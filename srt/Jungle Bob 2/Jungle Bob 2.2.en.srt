1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,435
The journey to find good flavors
that crosses over labor and gastronomy.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,460
The second season of JUNGLE BOB, PERU BOB!

3
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:06,314
(DinDin)

4
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:09,014
Last week was interesting.

5
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:10,247
But that was the appetizer.

6
00:00:10,247 --> 00:00:11,714
- That's right.
- We have to see the main dish.

7
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:12,614
- It was just the beginning.
- Yes.

8
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:15,327
What's for sure is
that we're just getting started.

9
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,848
- It's going to be so exciting.
- I can't wait to see it.

10
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:18,914
Things just keep coming up.

11
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,648
(PERU BOB, the second Tasty Mission card)

12
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,581
- Is money in that envelope?
- Maybe it's a secret mission?

13
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,814
Oh, it's a mission.

14
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:30,181
(This card contains a clue
to today's ingredient.)

15
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,948
"Bombonaje."

16
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,648
Longitude and latitude
are written on this.

17
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:37,114
What is that?

18
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,648
Are they the coordinates
of a bay or a port?

19
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,148
(PERU BOB, the second Tasty Mission card)

20
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:43,648
That's a fish.

21
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:45,014
Is it the Dimafro card again?

22
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:47,781
- "Bombonaje."
- "Bombonaje."

23
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,748
(A curious word...)

24
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,148
(and a card with coordinates)

25
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:54,048
The picture is scary in itself,

26
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:55,614
but these coordinates look brutal.

27
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,448
- I know.
- Where is this supposed to be?

28
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,981
This place doesn't have a name.

29
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:02,948
- It must be in the middle of nowhere.
- That's right.

30
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,863
I got its location.

31
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:06,963
(Where do the coordinates point to?)

32
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:07,829
Where is it?

33
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:09,496
It's in the middle of a river,

34
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:15,129
and it's in the Amazon.

35
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,096
It's the Amazon!

36
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,496
Or it could be this.

37
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:22,863
The man-eating fish.

38
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,263
- Piranha.
- Piranha?

39
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,096
Really?

40
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:27,529
- I guess it's piranha.
- Seriously?

41
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,096
My gosh!

42
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:31,896
(PERU BOB, the second Tasty Mission card)

43
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,463
(Piranha,)

44
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:37,129
(the man-eating fish)

45
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:39,729
Really. This isn't a joke.

46
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,196
(A carnivorous fish
that lives in the Amazon)

47
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,129
Oh my.

48
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,829
(Catch a piranha
at the location on the card.)

49
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,229
If you fall in, it could be fatal.

50
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:52,629
Is this supposed to be our last good meal?

51
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,296
That thought really crossed my mind.

52
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,929
That it could be our last meal.

53
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:58,763
(They will set off
to the Peruvian Amazon now.)

54
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:00,729
It's in the middle of a river,

55
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:01,863
and it's in the Amazon.

56
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:03,963
We're going to the Amazon.

57
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:07,296
(Lima, current location)

58
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,329
You can only get there by plane.
There are no roads leading there.

59
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,563
It's inaccessible by land.

60
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,296
- There are no roads.
- None.

61
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,529
We were in Lima,

62
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,163
and now, we're going to the jungle.

63
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:19,896
The card that we picked earlier...

64
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:23,696
What was it?

65
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:26,329
Bom... Bam...

66
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,796
Was it "Bambonanza?"

67
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:30,963
(It's "Bombonaje.")

68
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,363
"Bambonanza?"

69
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,763
You got it all wrong.

70
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:37,129
He tends to rearrange the letters
in a word.

71
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,496
I couldn't remember it.

72
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:39,796
You got the first part right.

73
00:02:39,796 --> 00:02:40,896
I didn't remember it.

74
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:44,996
We'll have to stay the night here
and leave tomorrow, right?

75
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:46,996
We'll have to get ready for the Amazon.

76
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,696
It's hot here.

77
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,129
Don't you feel really hot?

78
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,663
- It's really hot suddenly.
- It's so hot.

79
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,296
It feels like we've landed
in Southeast Asia.

80
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:57,196
The humidity is at 95 percent?

81
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:58,329
It's steaming hot.

82
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:01,163
It's so stuffy, even at night.

83
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:02,463
It's 32 degrees Celsius at night.

84
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,629
(Iquitos)

85
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,096
You have to pass through Iquitos
to reach the Amazon.

86
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,129
The Peruvian Amazon, that is.

87
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,529
Everyone who takes a trip
to the Amazon gathers here.

88
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,363
It's Iquitos.

89
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,896
(Iquitos, the Amazon city,
is located in the rainforest.)

90
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,029
Is that the only way to travel?

91
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,829
- The river is the route.
- Yes.

92
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,029
- Really?
- Really?

93
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,504
(The heart of the Peruvian Amazon...)

94
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:29,263
(embracing the Amazon)

95
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:31,263
(Among Peru's diverse culinary cultures,)

96
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,629
(this city highlights the allure
of the Amazon.)

97
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,496
- What's that?
- Hold on.

98
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:36,429
Wasn't that a piranha?

99
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,063
- Piranha, crocodiles, and snakes.
- Oh, my gosh. What?

100
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:41,496
Whatever it is, it's all dangerous.

101
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:46,196
(Iquitos is the final gate
that leads to the Amazon.)

102
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,196
We have to rest, eat,
and leave tomorrow, right?

103
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,663
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

104
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,696
(They decided to stay the night
in downtown Iquitos.)

105
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:53,896
Why do I feel hungry?

106
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,096
Am I the only one who's hungry?

107
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:56,196
I'm starving.

108
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,229
- In that case...
- Since we'll be going into the jungle,

109
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,863
we should have our last good meal.

110
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,029
Let's have these noodles.

111
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:06,029
(The Korean comfort food you miss
when you're away from home)

112
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:06,863
That's going to be delicious.

113
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,129
- I've never tried this before.
- Me neither.

114
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,163
How do you cook your ramyeon?

115
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:12,629
I'll show you my know-how.

116
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,163
I put the soup first.

117
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,163
It's liquefied.

118
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,796
The water must be boiling,

119
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,496
and I'll cook it like this.

120
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,496
That way,
the noodles will be firm and chewy.

121
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,096
That looks good.

122
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,329
He must make great ramen, being a chef.

123
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,696
- I know.
- Right?

124
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:31,363
It looks tasty.

125
00:04:31,363 --> 00:04:32,796
(Chef Choi's Amazon ramyeon)

126
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,229
(Happy)

127
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,563
(He starts devouring it.)

128
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:39,896
That looks tasty.

129
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,496
It looks delicious.
I wonder how it tastes.

130
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,396
(Having a bowl of ramyeon)

131
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:49,163
(It's spicy, satisfying,
and tastes like home.)

132
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,596
The soup is spicy and savory too.

133
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,029
The squid is really chewy.

134
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,429
I love it.

135
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,963
(Slurping)

136
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,829
Have you been starving for days?

137
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,529
It was the most delicious dish
out of everything in Peru.

138
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:04,329
Out of all the dishes.

139
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,129
You can't say that.

140
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,996
The chefs made so many dishes for you.

141
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:10,596
How can you say that
even after trying Chef Choi's dishes?

142
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,696
- He made sujebi and everything.
- But you know,

143
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,363
ramyeon was my favorite dish too.

144
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,463
You preferred the squid in that
to the giant squid in Peru?

145
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:20,996
(Processed food trumps ingredients
and chefs?)

146
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,196
(After their last good meal in Peru)

147
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,129
Let's go now.

148
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,063
- Let's go.
- Good luck today.

149
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:27,796
Let's get to the Amazon.

150
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,729
(They get on the tuk-tuk,
the local means of transportation.)

151
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,996
I haven't been on one of these in so long.

152
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:37,296
- Have you been on one before?
- Of course.

153
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,463
- It's tuk-tuk, right?
- It's my first time.

154
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:42,863
(It's his first time on a tuk-tuk.)

155
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:45,463
(Getting caught on the way)

156
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,129
It's too small for him.

157
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,596
(It's too small for someone
who's 190cm tall.)

158
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,063
It's not easy to get in.

159
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:52,229
(It looks cramped for the tall guys.)

160
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,529
Being 190cm tall can be inconvenient
at times.

161
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:59,763
Why are you so tall, though?
Why do you have to be so tall?

162
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,263
(Flustered)

163
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,296
I mean, couldn't you have stopped
at some point?

164
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,863
- At my own will?
- "Why do you have to be so tall?"

165
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:08,096
You could've decided to stop, you know?

166
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:10,629
- Did you stop at the point you chose?
- Of course.

167
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:13,496
- You must've stopped early.
- I slept less and went on a diet.

168
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:15,429
(It seems everyone grew
to their desired height.)

169
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,829
(The tall guys have
squeezed themselves in.)

170
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:21,296
(They set off, cutting through the wind.)

171
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,296
This is awesome.

172
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,263
(The morning in Iquitos,
where the Amazon trip will begin)

173
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,696
- We're off.
- Yes!

174
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,729
This is awesome.

175
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,329
(So excited)

176
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,029
- This is so exciting.
- It's amazing.

177
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:35,363
(Bumpy)

178
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,096
(Oh my)

179
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,296
This is scary.

180
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,763
- Daniel gets scared easily.
- Really?

181
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:42,229
I enjoy this kind of ride.

182
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,529
(On the other hand,
Ok Vin enjoys the thrill.)

183
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,829
It makes you feel like a local, you know?

184
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,296
(Along with the wind,)

185
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:55,563
(they can sense the presence
of the locals.)

186
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,396
Hello.

187
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:01,896
(The people of Iquitos
greet them cheerfully.)

188
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:04,529
The people are so cheerful there.

189
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:05,996
(We're so excited.)

190
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,529
(Here's another one who's stoked.)

191
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,529
I really like this energy
with the smell of gas.

192
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,163
(Nodding)

193
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:16,963
You're always full of energy.

194
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:17,863
This vibe.

195
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:20,596
You still got it.

196
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:26,796
Hyun Seok seems uncomfortable.

197
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:27,896
(Their energy level is at odds.)

198
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,529
His thumbs-up must mean, "That's enough."

199
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:31,663
- "That's enough."
- Oh, like, "Stop."

200
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:32,863
- Yes. "Stop now."
- "Stop."

201
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,796
(He doesn't seem to mind.)

202
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,896
(After running for a while
at a high energy level,)

203
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:40,796
We're here.

204
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,296
(the tuk-tuk stops somewhere.)

205
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,229
Okay, thank you.

206
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,196
Have they arrived?

207
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:46,363
(Have they arrived at the Amazon?)

208
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,429
This market is so cool.

209
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,463
We're at the market.

210
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,263
(Are they at a market, not in the jungle?)

211
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:57,729
You have to go through the market
to take the boat.

212
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,629
The Amazon is just beyond the market.

213
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:02,363
Is that it?

214
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:03,796
You can get there as soon as you cross.

215
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,063
(Belen Market)

216
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:10,763
(The market that has the Amazon in it)

217
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:14,329
(Full of raw ingredients...)

218
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,263
(that can only be seen here)

219
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:24,104
(A market tour
where you can't take your eyes off...)

220
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,763
(is coming soon.)

221
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:30,463
Tell me if you're hungry and want
to eat something. I'll buy it.

222
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,696
- Amazing.
- I will.

223
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:32,496
- On the way.
- Got it.

224
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,529
(I'll buy it for you.)

225
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,104
(There's a hustle and bustle
from the morning...)

226
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,063
The market here is really big.

227
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,529
(in this energetic place.)

228
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,796
This place is huge.

229
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:45,263
It's called the Venice of Peru.

230
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,796
(Located in the Belen District,
Belen Market is the biggest one here.)

231
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:50,263
We can't leave
without exploring this place.

232
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,896
Let's start buying from over there.

233
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:54,596
We can get some meat too.

234
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:57,396
Like the chef he is,
he's surveying all the ingredients.

235
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,729
Right. Hyun Seok had a hard time there,

236
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:03,363
but his eyes started sparkling
at the market.

237
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:05,129
It's alive. Look at it.

238
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,796
(The entrance is
full of surprising ingredients.)

239
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,029
He must love it here, being a chef.

240
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,884
Are those pork legs?

241
00:09:11,396 --> 00:09:12,429
- The legs.
- It's pork.

242
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,496
Or is that a goat?

243
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:14,963
(It's full of unidentified legs.)

244
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,296
This one looks like a goat.

245
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,396
Those are goat legs?

246
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,129
That's how they sell meat over there.

247
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,096
The whole leg?

248
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:24,155
It's not like they're going
to eat the whole thing, right?

249
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,863
- The fur is still on the feet too.
- We can buy...

250
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:32,696
different cuts of meat at the market
depending on what we want to cook.

251
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:36,163
But over there, they cut the whole thing
into big pieces...

252
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,596
and sell them like that.

253
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:38,696
(The Amazon is on another level.)

254
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:42,596
If there are no feet,
we can't tell what meat it is.

255
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:43,796
They could've left it for that reason.

256
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:45,485
I'm not sure what this one is.

257
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,563
(His eyes are gleaming.)

258
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:50,163
- Oh, my gosh.
- This must be for eating too.

259
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,063
Oh, gosh.

260
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,596
(What is the ultimate ingredient
that surprised even the cooking nut?)

261
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:55,496
What's that?

262
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:56,729
- What?
- What is that?

263
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,221
- There's crocodile meat.
- Is there?

264
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:00,422
- No!
- Crocodile?

265
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:03,125
(Crocodile meat?)

266
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,060
Alligator meat?

267
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:08,399
(Is this the crocodile
we're familiar with?)

268
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,397
Is that crocodile meat?

269
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,836
Oh, my gosh. They do eat crocodiles.

270
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:15,670
The crocodile's arms, head, and body.

271
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,074
(A whole crocodile)

272
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,142
That's unbelievable.

273
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,801
Do they eat crocodile feet
like we eat chicken feet?

274
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:34,743
(Looking intimidating)

275
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,878
They just sell it like that?

276
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,147
Yes. Crocodile meat is rare only to us.

277
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,984
- It's such a common ingredient there.
- Because there are so many.

278
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:46,020
Daniel, you're sociable,

279
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,154
so shake its hand.

280
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,458
Oh, my gosh! Nice to meet you.

281
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,564
(They touch the foot of a crocodile
for the first time.)

282
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,053
I've never seen a market
that sold crocodile meat before.

283
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,478
(Even a chef with 30 years of experience
is fascinated.)

284
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,495
- It even has claws.
- Yes.

285
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:07,775
- They do eat crocodiles.
- These are crocodile legs.

286
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,012
They also sell grilled legs.

287
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,481
- Crocodile...
- Do you want one?

288
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:14,715
How do I eat it? Is it edible?

289
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,783
I've never had it before.

290
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,752
Hello.

291
00:11:17,753 --> 00:11:19,053
(Picking the smallest leg)

292
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,187
We'll take the smallest one.

293
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:24,377
- They grilled it.
- I wonder what it tastes like.

294
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:25,702
(What does grilled crocodile smell like?)

295
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,743
- It smells like chicken.
- Does it smell like chicken?

296
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:28,745
It's like chicken.

297
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:32,282
- Just like we eat sundae and tteokbokki.
- Indeed.

298
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,384
They sell it
just like we sell chicken skewers.

299
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:35,752
Really?

300
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:39,556
It's the most accessible protein source
over there.

301
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,723
So, they simply eat it.

302
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,058
So, do the kids there say,

303
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,227
"Should we get crocodile meat
after school?"

304
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:47,464
(How about a crocodile skewer
after school?)

305
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,634
(What caught the cooking nut's attention?)

306
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:52,869
What's this? A turtle?

307
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,404
- Terrapins?
- Turtles?

308
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:56,406
Terrapins.

309
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,308
(They're Amazon River turtles.)

310
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,575
Oh, my gosh. What is this?

311
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,178
That's its face!

312
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,016
(We have fresh turtle meat from Amazon.)

313
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,452
Oh, my gosh.

314
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,222
It's moving.

315
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:14,357
It's moving!

316
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,626
- It's moving?
- You're lying.

317
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,562
- It's still alive.
- What?

318
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:22,398
- The nerves still work.
- It's the nerves.

319
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,203
Alive? Dead?

320
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,106
It's alive!

321
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,311
- Is that alive?
- That's a live turtle.

322
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,379
It's hiding its feet.

323
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,746
Oh, it's playing dead.

324
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,681
It's alive!

325
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,084
It moves!

326
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,986
(Ok Vin was startled.)

327
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:45,120
(Welcome to Amazon.)

328
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:46,055
Oh, my gosh.

329
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,257
That's incredible.

330
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,225
They sell turtles.

331
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:52,995
I guess they eat them.

332
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:53,996
It's really fresh.

333
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:55,131
What's this?

334
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,568
It's rolled up like a ball.

335
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,769
(Pausing)

336
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:03,039
(He spots something.)

337
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,574
- Look.
- What's that?

338
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,008
- Go over there, Ok Vin.
- Okay.

339
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,877
Oh, my gosh. What is that?

340
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,046
(Behind the turtle stall,)

341
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,615
(there's street food?)

342
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:13,817
Check this out.

343
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,884
What is it?

344
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:15,852
Look.

345
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,320
It's a turtle shell!

346
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:20,056
- Turtle stew?
- Made of turtles?

347
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,131
They use turtle shells...

348
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,898
- like a pot.
- They're eating it!

349
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,102
They were influenced
by the Chinese culture.

350
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,237
That must be why they eat turtles. Or not.

351
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,172
That may be true.

352
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,607
But they must have a lot of turtles here.

353
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,852
People tend to eat what's abundant.

354
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,443
It's not a domesticated animal.

355
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,979
They're eating it,
even though it's not common for us.

356
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,081
That means they must have
a lot of them here.

357
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,048
- It's one of their staple foods.
- Yes. It's readily available.

358
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,218
I can't believe they're eating it.

359
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:52,388
(The top item on the menu,
the turtle soup)

360
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:56,926
(Another delicacy at the Belen Market)

361
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,561
- Turtle eggs.
- Turtle eggs?

362
00:13:58,562 --> 00:13:59,562
- They're turtle eggs?
- No way.

363
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,130
(Boiled turtle eggs)

364
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,465
We are familiar
with Turtle Egg ice cream."

365
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,933
- Exactly.
- That looks a bit...

366
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,069
- But it smells...
- The ice cream?

367
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,837
incredibly wild.

368
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,475
It's an extremely condensed,
pungent smell.

369
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,643
(It's chewy and savory.)

370
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:17,112
The locals are familiar with such food.

371
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:18,781
I bet it's high in protein.

372
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:20,583
It's their daily food.

373
00:14:22,186 --> 00:14:26,156
(Amazonian street food)

374
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:29,425
They also have this. It's ornamental.

375
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,827
(Just browsing the market takes a while.)

376
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,827
They also sell slushies.

377
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,295
They have such an interesting market here.

378
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:35,298
I know, right?
The market itself is entertaining.

379
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,701
Check it out!

380
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:40,870
Look, guys.

381
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:42,171
(What caught her attention?)

382
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,072
Look.

383
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:44,941
Armadillos!

384
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,177
Armadillos?

385
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,679
- What are they?
- Armadillos.

386
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,447
- What is it?
- Armadillos.

387
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:53,349
- The reptile?
- What is that?

388
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:55,785
(Unfalimiar even to the cooking nut)

389
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:57,119
So, these are armadillos.

390
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,955
It rolls its body
into the shape of a ball...

391
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,423
when it's attacked.

392
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,192
- It must have a hard shell, then.
- Yes.

393
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:05,294
That's the one.

394
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:06,696
(Armadillos' strong shells can
deflect bullets.)

395
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,731
Its shell can even deflect bullets?

396
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:13,270
(It rolls its body to defend itself
when it's attacked.)

397
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:14,236
What?

398
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:16,973
That's so cute!

399
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,842
(Fascinating)

400
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:19,809
That's the real deal.

401
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,577
I think I've seen it in a cartoon.

402
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:22,511
So, they eat this too.

403
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:23,545
It's so hard.

404
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,782
Feel it. Nothing could penetrate it.

405
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,850
Over here.

406
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:29,685
Just trimming it would be a lot of work.

407
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,788
- It's got an armor.
- I'll have a breakdown trying to peel it.

408
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:34,457
Right. That's an armor
that you can't penetrate...

409
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,192
even with a knife.

410
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:38,961
(The cooking nut's eyes sparkle.)

411
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,896
Look. Is that deer meat?

412
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:42,932
It's rat meat!

413
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:45,168
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are these rats?

414
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:47,069
Rats?

415
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,137
Seriously?

416
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,338
- Mice?
- Mice?

417
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,142
That mouse could beat a cat.

418
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:53,142
Are you serious?

419
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:01,451
That's a mouse?

420
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,319
That's a mouse?

421
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,288
That has to be a piglet, at least.

422
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,423
- You have to be lying.
- That's not...

423
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,559
A cat would be obliterated.

424
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:13,262
Imagine seeing a mouse like that at home.

425
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:17,133
- I might have to move.
- You'll have to shoot it.

426
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,539
It must be...

427
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:26,109
around ten kilograms.

428
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,778
- Ten kilograms?
- Ten kilograms.

429
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,681
- How is a mouse so big?
- That can't be possible.

430
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:32,948
It's as big as a dog.

431
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,783
(Looking serious)

432
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,219
We might have to run
if we see a mouse in Amazon.

433
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,321
- I know, right?
- That's terrifying.

434
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:40,956
(Everything is bigger than expected
in Amazon.)

435
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,191
Okay. Thank you.

436
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,927
Thank you.

437
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:46,362
This place is incredible. It's so fun.

438
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:49,265
It's the most shocking market
I've ever been to.

439
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,566
- I bet.
- Yes.

440
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,702
They only have fish here.

441
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:57,006
(One type of fish draws
the cooking nut's attention.)

442
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,040
That looks unique.

443
00:16:58,709 --> 00:16:59,776
What is it?

444
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,378
- What's that?
- Is this a sturgeon?

445
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:02,478
- What is it?
- Hyun Seok!

446
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:03,980
Isn't this a sturgeon?

447
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,749
Isn't this a sturgeon?

448
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:09,351
It looks like a sturgeon?

449
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
- Isn't it a blacktip rockfish?
- Was it a catfish?

450
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,922
Isn't this a sturgeon? It's got roe.

451
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,090
It's not a sturgeon.

452
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:16,592
- It's not?
- No.

453
00:17:16,862 --> 00:17:18,761
- Carachama.
- Carachama?

454
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:19,729
Carachama?

455
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,064
It's alive.

456
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,732
That looks cool.

457
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,969
It's pitch black.

458
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,505
(This fish has superpowers?)

459
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:30,406
What would it be?

460
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,378
(It's as dry as a fossil
when it's out of the water.)

461
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,477
What's going on?

462
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:43,252
(It comes back alive
when it's fed with water?)

463
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,556
Oh, that's what it is!
It's a type of fish...

464
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:48,157
that revives with water
when it's dried out.

465
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:50,359
It's as dry as dried pollack,
but it comes back alive...

466
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,393
when you pour water.

467
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,361
It can last 30 hours?

468
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,831
So, that's what it is. I never realized.

469
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:56,065
It's called carachama.

470
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,366
(A cleaner fish
with strong suction power...)

471
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,834
(that attaches to other animals' backs,
eating dead skin cells and moss)

472
00:17:58,835 --> 00:17:59,935
That's amazing.

473
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,441
It's alive. Look!

474
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:07,310
That's amazing.

475
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:12,247
Even you've never cleaned
this kind of fish before, right?

476
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,418
This is my first time seeing it.

477
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:15,851
Is this your first time?

478
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:17,052
(Experienced chef of 31 years
has never seen it.)

479
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:19,488
- What's that? Roe?
- Innards.

480
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:21,057
- They look like roe.
- Roe.

481
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,257
- They're roe.
- They're roe.

482
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,194
Does carachama have tasty roe as well?

483
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:26,896
Of course!

484
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,099
(Give it a try.)

485
00:18:31,034 --> 00:18:32,268
(Carachama fresh out of the Amazon River)

486
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,569
- They look like salted pollack roe.
- Carachama.

487
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,737
Carachama.

488
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,939
It's my first time seeing anyone
eat nothing at a market.

489
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:39,442
It's not like we can go around
with crocodile legs in our mouths.

490
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,111
And it's my first time seeing
anyone buy nothing.

491
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:45,082
(They're extra cautious
about buying ingredients.)

492
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,749
This market has...

493
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,619
the liveliest vibe I've ever seen.

494
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,653
I'm fascinated,

495
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:51,364
but I wouldn't try anything
without caution.

496
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,657
(Chef Choi continues exploring...)

497
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,393
(with a keen eye.)

498
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,362
- I can't wait to see what he cooks.
- Exactly.

499
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,664
- It's pirarucu!
- No way!

500
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:03,799
(Chef Choi's eyes open widely.)

501
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,201
- What is it?
- They're huge!

502
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:07,169
- Pirarucu.
- What's a pirarucu?

503
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,203
Pirarucu?

504
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:11,107
(Here's a pirarucu.)

505
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,507
- What is that?
- It's finally here.

506
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,345
(It's hard to believe
that it's the size of a fish.)

507
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:17,613
Is this also a type of fish?

508
00:19:18,082 --> 00:19:20,751
Back in Korea,
we normally see that at aquariums.

509
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,184
But the locals here eat them.

510
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:24,153
The large ones are almost 2m long
and weigh 200kg.

511
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:26,222
(Even the seafood expert is seeing one
for the first time.)

512
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:31,127
(The living fossil of Amazon,
the pirarucu)

513
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,194
I know what that is!

514
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,066
- I've seen at aquariums.
- There are ones that are two meters...

515
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:37,033
- at aquariums.
- You're right!

516
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,167
(World's largest freshwater Amazon fish)

517
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:41,670
(It gobbles up everything it sees.
Even a whole chicken.)

518
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:42,604
That's right.

519
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,673
- What?
- It just gobbles it up.

520
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:45,708
- Like that?
- Yes.

521
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,545
(The maximum length is 5m,
and the maximum weight is 200kg.)

522
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:50,613
That's enormous.

523
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:54,952
That's huge.

524
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,839
(The vacuum cleaners of the Amazon,
the pirarucu)

525
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,565
That's unbelievable.

526
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:01,832
- What's that?
- That's huge!

527
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,201
- He's chopping it up.
- It's huge.

528
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:07,081
Many Japanese yakuza keep these
at their headquarters.

529
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,483
The ones in Japan are a different breed,

530
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:10,995
but the yakuza only keep one
in the tank...

531
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,287
and they won't leave the house on days
when the pirarucu is sick or dies.

532
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:16,193
- They're symbolic of the yakuza.
- They're symbolic.

533
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:19,260
I heard that yakuza or Chinese triads
use pirarucu for that purpose.

534
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,328
That's so cool.

535
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,275
(Chef Choi can't take his eyes
off of the real-life pirarucu.)

536
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:25,833
It's so fresh.

537
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,970
I've never seen anyone butcher
a pirarucu before.

538
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,119
(First time seeing pirarucu butchered.)

539
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,409
I'm so excited to watch someone butcher
a pirarucu in person.

540
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:38,096
(The fascial lining is as tough
as that of animal meat.)

541
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:41,048
I've only seen the fish at an aquarium.

542
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:43,814
Seeing it butchered for consumption
is so...

543
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,839
I can't believe this place.
This is so fascinating.

544
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,465
(Eyes glowing again at the amazing sight)

545
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:51,829
(Meanwhile, Chef Choi is deep in thought.)

546
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,227
His eyes were sparkling.

547
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,297
Let's buy it.

548
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,423
- Let's buy it.
- What?

549
00:20:57,855 --> 00:20:59,257
- Let's buy it.
- Yes, let's do that.

550
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:00,556
This is the first purchase!

551
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,561
(Why are they buying pirarucu
as their first purchase?)

552
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:07,258
(During the cooking nuts' meeting
before heading to Peru)

553
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,811
Apparently, they have giant pirarucu.

554
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:11,835
No way!

555
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,014
A piece of scale is this big.

556
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,050
(Chef Choi's Amazon bucket list item)

557
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,319
(Cooking with pirarucu)

558
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,487
Cooking with pirarucu sounds like fun.

559
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:21,214
Let's buy it.

560
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:22,723
How much do you want to buy?

561
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,981
(The fish that excited
the seafood master.)

562
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,095
Which part should we buy?
We should start from the belly, right?

563
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,130
Yes, but while the belly part...

564
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:32,633
has a good amount of fat,
cooking with it is...

565
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:34,768
It won't taste so savory, will it?

566
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,328
(Which part should we get,)

567
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,205
(and what should I cook with it?)

568
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,560
I can't wait for it.

569
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:41,984
- But we can get two parts.
- Right?

570
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,048
You know the remaining part of the head
after cutting the very front?

571
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,079
- About this much.
- Yes.

572
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,816
The belly is usually fatty and tender,

573
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:51,162
but if you want to taste
its unique flavor,

574
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,517
it's better to get the meat
just below the head.

575
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,022
It's better to get the meat
around the head, right?

576
00:21:55,126 --> 00:21:56,257
Yes, this part.

577
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,719
- That's so cool.
- This much?

578
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,569
- About this much?
- Yes.

579
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,154
Isn't that like a roofing tile?

580
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:05,666
Even when we ask for a small amount,
we get this much in Peru.

581
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:09,720
We can't ask for just a small amount
for soup here.

582
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,605
(Whatever you buy in Peru
can feed a whole village.)

583
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,932
It looks like it'll weigh
about two kilograms.

584
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,988
It's huge.

585
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,144
It'll be so tasty grilled whole.

586
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,258
How much is it?

587
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,347
(About two kilograms of fish is...)

588
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,273
It's about 25 dollars?

589
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,494
It's just over ten dollars per kilogram.

590
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,413
And pirarucu is pricier than other fishes.

591
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,773
I'll take that.

592
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:29,823
- I'll take it.
- We'll take it.

593
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:32,226
Pass it to me. You have too many bags.

594
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,831
- Over here.
- Are you sure?

595
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:35,062
Yes, I'm fine.

596
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,298
Now that we have the main ingredient...

597
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:39,843
(Getting a huge cooking inspiration)

598
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,635
He must be getting ideas for what to cook.

599
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,189
(He's off to look for something.)

600
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,669
They sell everything,
from the liver to the intestines!

601
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,379
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

602
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,740
(What's making
even the cooking nut shocked?)

603
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,010
What are those?

604
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:01,388
These chickens still have everything on.
That's so cool.

605
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,437
Oh, goodness!

606
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:04,592
That's wild.

607
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,323
The head!

608
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:07,895
That's insane.

609
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:11,685
It's unbelievable.
They're whole chickens.

610
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,335
They must slaughter them fresh here.

611
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,848
Yes, they're straight from the butcher.

612
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,939
(Straight from the butcher
with the guts in)

613
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,941
- They don't discard anything.
- They just don't have the feathers.

614
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:22,610
They eat everything, down to the guts.

615
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,216
It's amazing how they don't spoil...

616
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,381
when they're sold out in the open.

617
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,574
Shouldn't we get one?

618
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,386
We should get that.

619
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:34,574
- Let's buy some chicken feet.
- Let's do it now.

620
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,489
Really?

621
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:37,574
Okay.

622
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:42,340
(Just the chicken feet
and not the whole chicken?)

623
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:46,691
(Doing the completely unexpected...)

624
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,707
(and buying just chicken feet?)

625
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:53,304
(Chef Choi's choices are
the pirarucu and chicken feet.)

626
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,329
Let's have some really good food today.

627
00:23:55,354 --> 00:23:56,454
(Just trust me today.)

628
00:23:57,806 --> 00:24:00,247
Fine dining in the jungle!

629
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,149
(Amazonian fish and chicken feet
are working together...)

630
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,550
- That's amazing!
- That meal was incredible.

631
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:05,152
It was truly exceptional.

632
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,820
We're in the jungle,

633
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,501
but I feel
like I'm at a riverside restaurant.

634
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:11,539
How's that even possible?

635
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,040
That was absolutely incredible!

636
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:15,526
(Stay tuned for the fine dining dinner
in the Amazon.)

637
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,364
I'm starving.

638
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,143
Me too. We should eat something.

639
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,469
What could this be?

640
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:26,440
This must be what the locals eat.

641
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:27,608
- Really?
- What's this?

642
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:28,976
- No, what is it?
- What is this?

643
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,123
What is it?

644
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,225
(The so-called moving cafe
of Belen Market)

645
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,182
That's so cool.
It's coffee.

646
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:39,197
(Very popular among the locals)

647
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:40,721
- Why don't we try some?
- Should we try it?

648
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,635
(Too curious to walk away
and getting some immediately)

649
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:46,860
- Try it.
- I need to get some money out.

650
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:47,834
It's hot.

651
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,816
(Smelling it first)

652
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,501
- Daniel!
- Yes?

653
00:24:55,106 --> 00:24:58,085
(He can have the first taste
since it's a mystery drink.)

654
00:24:58,085 --> 00:24:59,673
It looks like a hot grain-powder drink.

655
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:01,113
Ok Vin, try some.

656
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,520
Try it first.
I have too many things to carry.

657
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,596
- Do I have to try it?
- Yes, my hands are full.

658
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:06,906
It smells like a grain powder drink.

659
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:11,435
(Ok Vin is trying some first.)

660
00:25:12,276 --> 00:25:14,625
(Taking a brave sip)

661
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,410
Is it delicious?

662
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:18,425
It's like Job's tears tea.

663
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:19,793
- Job's tears tea?
- Yes.

664
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:21,183
It's like Job's tears tea.

665
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,529
- Job's tears tea?
- Yes.

666
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,832
You took it smiling
as soon as she said that!

667
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,684
(Finally comfortable enough to take a sip)

668
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:27,559
- I'm sorry.
- It's Job's tears tea.

669
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:29,737
Right? It's sweet.

670
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,636
- I know!
- There are grain particles inside.

671
00:25:32,636 --> 00:25:33,564
Maybe some bean particles too.

672
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:35,853
- It could be a meal replacement.
- It's good.

673
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,742
It's really good.

674
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:38,679
I'm impressed.

675
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:41,207
She was like our guinea pig!

676
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:42,175
I'm sorry.

677
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,061
(Trust the guinea pig.)

678
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,230
- We only tried anything...
- I feel bad.

679
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,521
after Ok Vin gave her approval.

680
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,186
All three men made her try it first!

681
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,754
Ok Vin was the taste tester.

682
00:25:50,754 --> 00:25:52,226
- We all did that!
- I guess so.

683
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,128
- I feel bad.
- That's a bit embarrassing.

684
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,463
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

685
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,623
(We're sorry, Ok Vin.)

686
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:59,666
Those chili peppers are really spicy.

687
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,143
- Those?
- Yes.

688
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,569
I can handle spice really well.

689
00:26:02,713 --> 00:26:04,738
Why don't we get some for Ok Vin?

690
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,756
- They look like bell peppers.
- Those are spicy too.

691
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:09,299
Those look extremely spicy.
They're so tiny.

692
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,149
They're unbelievably spicy.

693
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:11,611
They're really spicy.
Do you want to try it?

694
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,529
Try it.

695
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,239
(Letting Ok Vin, the guinea pig,
try the spicy pepper first too)

696
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,252
Try it. Is it a chili pepper?

697
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,550
(Trying it without hesitation)

698
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:20,531
- Is it a chili pepper?
- Try it.

699
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,740
- It's hot.
- Very hot?

700
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,590
What?

701
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,895
(Is it that spicy?)

702
00:26:26,524 --> 00:26:27,828
It's super spicy.

703
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:30,197
It's really hot!

704
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:31,131
Is it that hot?

705
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:32,933
Is it that hot? It's that bad?

706
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,068
It's like tear gas!

707
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:36,020
Gosh, it's so hot.

708
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,568
I told you it was hot!

709
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:42,526
(Panting)

710
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:45,089
Dates!

711
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:46,590
(But even after that...)

712
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,716
- They're dates!
- No.

713
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:51,552
- They're so soft.
- She's fearless.

714
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:53,390
Ok Vin is really brave.

715
00:26:54,872 --> 00:26:57,675
(Trying it without hesitation)

716
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,445
That was incredibly sour.

717
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:03,219
It's so sour!

718
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:05,925
Are we buying something?

719
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,247
No.

720
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,634
(Nom)

721
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:12,773
(The guinea pig testing continues.)

722
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:13,623
Is this corn?

723
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:17,511
I ate everything! Did I eat that much?

724
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:19,447
(This is good!)

725
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:20,297
It tastes roasted.

726
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:21,982
(Feasting without worries,
thanks to Ok Vin)

727
00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,142
It's very savory.

728
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm the type to try anything new
on the menu...

729
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,055
whenever I'm at a restaurant.

730
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:30,416
- Even if it doesn't end up tasting good?
- Yes, even if I regret it later.

731
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:35,596
Ok Vin is proactive and down for anything
in all situations.

732
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,031
She always steps up,
whether it be chopping firewood,

733
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,366
catching insects,

734
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:41,034
or whatever she's told to do.

735
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,636
She steps up for everything.

736
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,865
(Here comes Ok Vin,)

737
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,103
(the woman of powerful charisma.)

738
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,842
(Even unfamiliar insects are...)

739
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:54,105
(just a good source of protein.)

740
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:56,747
(The Amazon River...)

741
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,062
(and the endless Pacific Ocean...)

742
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,559
(are nothing to fear for this heroine.)

743
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:03,189
(Wait for me, Amazon!)

744
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,851
(Here I come!)

745
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,601
(Meanwhile, he's the polar opposite.)

746
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,242
This must be the bread
that the locals eat.

747
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,490
- It looks like bread.
- Yes,

748
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,968
they seem to eat a lot of bread here.

749
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,171
- These are only available here.
- Yes.

750
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,107
There are so many kinds.

751
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,578
Why are they so colorful?

752
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:23,314
There are so many different types.

753
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,709
(Visually appealing to children's tastes)

754
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,146
These must be cookies.

755
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:29,283
Doesn't that look like corn? It's yellow.

756
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:30,689
(Buy these for me!)

757
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:31,924
How much is this?

758
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:34,705
(It's on the big brother.)

759
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:35,762
Thank you!

760
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:38,625
- We finally got some local bread.
- Local bread!

761
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,062
Hyun Seok, it's stuffed with something.

762
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,005
It looks like sugar.

763
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:45,565
It's local bread.
It looks like it's made from corn.

764
00:28:46,703 --> 00:28:48,201
That looks tasty!

765
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,900
(Another childlike palate is intrigued.)

766
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:50,971
They eat this here.

767
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,306
It's good.

768
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:57,177
I love bread like this.

769
00:28:57,294 --> 00:29:00,364
Why didn't you let Ok Vin have some first?

770
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,214
I gave her some!

771
00:29:01,425 --> 00:29:02,312
You were so excited!

772
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:04,715
- He eats it first when it looks edible.
- He was so excited!

773
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:10,857
This is 70 cents.

774
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,530
- What's that?
- A bug!

775
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,865
I'm terrified of bugs.

776
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,334
All right. This bun...

777
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,469
What was that?

778
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,905
Is that a bug? Please!

779
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:27,738
(What a child.)

780
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,888
He's very protective of his own body.

781
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:32,145
You'll keep seeing him like that.

782
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:34,815
He's scared of water, insects,
and everything.

783
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:38,352
- It's all good.
- It's gone.

784
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,569
- Is it?
- It's gone.

785
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:41,421
- You're lying!
- No, it's really gone.

786
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,005
You're sweating.

787
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:46,096
(Have some bread.)

788
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:48,405
(Scared but still taking a bite)

789
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:50,063
You're terrified
but still can't resist the bread?

790
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:51,601
(Not even a bug can stop
this childlike palate.)

791
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:55,175
- That was awful!
- Daniel is terrified of bugs.

792
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,328
Bugs are so scary!

793
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,666
(Daniel is such a big baby.)

794
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,869
He's not crying, is he?

795
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:07,032
(Once again, he makes his pace.)

796
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:12,666
Hyun Seok!
I can see the Amazon over there.

797
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:13,999
- Is that it?
- That's the Amazon?

798
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,152
I can see the Amazon.

799
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:17,105
It's on a high ground.

800
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:19,132
Is that where we're going?

801
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,557
Somewhere in there, yes.

802
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:23,026
I'm getting second thoughts about this.

803
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:26,999
- Let's go.
- They should hurry now.

804
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,131
They're really going.

805
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:30,499
We have to move, Daniel!

806
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:33,399
(Leaving the cradle of civilization
behind to the mysterious Amazon!)

807
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:39,832
(The cityscape becomes far more and more.)

808
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,832
These are the houses. They live here.

809
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:43,527
That's really a jungle.

810
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:45,649
The landscape is fantastic.

811
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:47,751
Come this way!

812
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,253
She leads the way.

813
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:53,732
- She takes the lead again.
- Yes, she's leading the way now.

814
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,466
We didn't know what was waiting for us,

815
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:58,432
so we told Ok Vin to go first.

816
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,866
- And we'd have her back.
- That's awesome, Daniel.

817
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:08,266
(As they go through the winding alley)

818
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,708
(At the end of their way,
the sight of the unknown Amazon unfolds.)

819
00:31:12,732 --> 00:31:13,732
My goodness.

820
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,232
Is that the actual point of departure?

821
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:22,153
That's it.

822
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,923
We finally reached the Amazon River.

823
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:29,166
- That's quite different.
- That's the dock?

824
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:29,999
Yes.

825
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:33,163
Let's go.

826
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:37,032
(Faltering)

827
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:41,132
(They get on the rocking boat one by one.)

828
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:44,541
Suddenly,

829
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,476
I feel so scared.

830
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,366
(Rattling)

831
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,332
Gosh, that felt like a bumper car.

832
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:54,266
(Tensed up)

833
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,686
This is the real Amazon.

834
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:00,924
I genuinely feel scared.

835
00:32:01,908 --> 00:32:03,727
I'm aqua-phobia, you know.

836
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,130
What if an anaconda pops up from here?

837
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,766
I don't think I could go there.

838
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,232
(With tensed hearts,)

839
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:20,299
(they sail out to the unknown Amazon.)

840
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,866
We're heading
where there are no cellphone signals.

841
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:25,015
- But I need to check my Instagram.
- No signals whatsoever.

842
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:27,951
I'm scared.

843
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,132
(To get to the mysterious coordinates,)

844
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:34,932
(the expedition resolutely
takes the journey.)

845
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:37,160
But this river is...

846
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:39,266
almost a sea.

847
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,866
- A sea?
- It's so broad.

848
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:42,466
Yes, it's pretty much a sea.

849
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:44,434
- It's too big for a river.
- Right.

850
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:47,466
(The streams of the Amazon are
as magnificent as the ocean.)

851
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,972
What in the world?

852
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,675
- That small thing is your boat?
- Yes.

853
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,711
- That's huge.
- It really is broad.

854
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,483
I thought that was a land.

855
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,232
But it looks like that's all muddy water.

856
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,487
The water has a different color.

857
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,599
(The color of the water is different?)

858
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,757
They didn't get mixed.

859
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:10,999
That's really fascinating.

860
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:11,962
What do you mean?

861
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:14,799
(The mysterious secret
of the Amazon River in Peru)

862
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,966
Look at that!

863
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,066
They didn't get mixed.

864
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,332
- How is that possible?
- What is that?

865
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,666
They never blend together.

866
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,666
Why?

867
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:22,630
See? Its color changes from here.

868
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,466
It changes beyond this line. Right?

869
00:33:27,866 --> 00:33:29,179
There's a road on the river.

870
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:31,255
It looks like this part of the water
flows this way,

871
00:33:31,255 --> 00:33:32,475
and the other part flows that way.

872
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:34,117
Look. It's completely different from here.

873
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,832
(An enormous borderline made by nature)

874
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:36,966
That place is incredible.

875
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,756
The temperature seems different too.

876
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:42,532
The scenery is just incredible.

877
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:43,666
(Overwhelming sight)

878
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,794
That's so interesting.

879
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,198
Don't pink dolphins live in this water?

880
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,532
Have you heard about pink dolphins?

881
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,936
There's a dolphin here?

882
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,232
I think I've heard pink dolphins live
where two waters of the Amazon meet.

883
00:33:56,232 --> 00:33:58,566
- Is that right?
- My wife wanted us to see it someday.

884
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:00,132
- Seriously?
- Are there dolphins?

885
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:01,166
Is it true?

886
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,746
Dolphins are here?

887
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,932
There it is!

888
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:06,366
- Where?
- Fooled you!

889
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,532
Geez.

890
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:10,466
He even got me.

891
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:13,999
Fooled you!

892
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,066
I can't believe you.

893
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:19,032
Look over there!

894
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:19,932
- For real?
- Really?

895
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,032
Something jumped back in the water.

896
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:22,299
- Let's go slower.
- Seriously?

897
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,232
Really?

898
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:25,101
If it is, that's some luck.

899
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,766
- Where?
- I can't see it.

900
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,766
There it is!

901
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:31,799
- There really is!
- Is it a dolphin?

902
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:35,566
(Did they spot a pink dolphin?)

903
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:36,466
A pink dolphin?

904
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:37,866
- Are you serious?
- That's can't be true.

905
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:39,194
Where?

906
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,166
(A pink dolphin actually appears.)

907
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,899
(Hi!)

908
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:48,466
Gosh, it's so cute.

909
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:51,666
I'd never thought they'd live there.

910
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:54,232
That's possible
because it's far from civilization.

911
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:55,498
It's adorable.

912
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:58,232
Oh, how cute.

913
00:34:58,232 --> 00:34:59,966
- That's so fascinating.
- It was a fascinating experience.

914
00:34:59,966 --> 00:35:01,432
- It was really pink.
- Tell me about it.

915
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,032
I've never seen one in my life.

916
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:04,266
- That's normal.
- Right.

917
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:06,409
- I can see them.
- They're so pretty.

918
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,468
- That's awesome.
- They're lovely.

919
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:13,777
There it is!

920
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:15,766
- There really is!
- Is it a dolphin?

921
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:18,032
- Ok Vin's shout is way more fascinating.
- This is unbelievable.

922
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,166
- I saw its head.
- She constantly shouts.

923
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,632
- Look over there.
- She does.

924
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,332
- Look at there. There are dolphins.
- They're swimming.

925
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,666
- Where?
- There's one here.

926
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,566
- Look over there.
- There are many over there.

927
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:28,732
- Man, the boat is...
- You can see them.

928
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:30,932
I don't know about dolphins,
but our boat is about to be flipped.

929
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:32,168
Let's see them later.

930
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,671
He's such a coward.

931
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,640
Oh, my world!

932
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:39,232
He wants to see them later.

933
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,266
(Daniel's imploring
puts him back to his seat.)

934
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:41,845
I don't need to see dolphins.

935
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,166
(Keeping the balance all by himself)

936
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,470
What did you go all the way there for?

937
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,099
We can always see them on TV.

938
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:53,332
- Oh, I see them over there!
- Gosh, this is amazing!

939
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:55,432
(She doesn't care. She's just thrilled.)

940
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:58,432
I go on a tour every year to see dolphins.

941
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,932
- Seriously?
- Yes.

942
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:02,126
Good for you. Take a good look at them.

943
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:03,499
(Ok Vin is just excited.)

944
00:36:03,499 --> 00:36:04,601
Dolphins are just dolphins.

945
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,366
(Hold on...)

946
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:12,275
Isn't there a movie director
called Hirokazu Koreeda?

947
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:16,066
- He's making me blush.
- His name sounds similar to a dolphin.

948
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,732
How can he associate him with dolphins?

949
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,291
I never expected his image
to appear on our show.

950
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:26,173
But he does exist, doesn't he?

951
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:29,876
- Yes, it's "Koreeda."
- Hirokazu Koreeda, right?

952
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:33,630
His name sounds like a delicious dish.

953
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:39,466
(Everything ends up with cooking
in Hyun Seok's mind.)

954
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:43,532
His name sounds like
a very good deep-fried dish.

955
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:46,132
- Because it's similar to "tonkatsu?"
- The Japanese dish?

956
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:47,345
He agrees with me.

957
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:50,246
I think we're almost there.

958
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,034
I see a village.

959
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,499
There's a village?

960
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:54,999
(Have they arrived at the destination
written on the card?)

961
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,953
- Did they arrive?
- This is no joke.

962
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:58,788
It's a literal jungle.

963
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:00,099
Yes, it is.

964
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,029
It's hard to believe...

965
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,712
- there's a village here.
- I know.

966
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,528
We're really in the jungle.

967
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:09,899
I assume the place is limited
by technology.

968
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:11,728
I'm getting a foreboding feeling.

969
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,599
It's my first time
visiting the legit jungle.

970
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,392
This is the real jungle of the Amazon.

971
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,768
What is it?

972
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:21,232
That boat ride was pretty long,
but there's still a village.

973
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:23,299
(An unrevealed village
deep in the Amazon River)

974
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,199
It's interesting.

975
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:28,599
What is this? Is it a house?

976
00:37:30,232 --> 00:37:33,699
(They just start walking.)

977
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:34,691
Oh, how cute!

978
00:37:35,432 --> 00:37:38,366
(Su Young discovered something?)

979
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,666
Is it an animal that they're holding?

980
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,999
- I think it's a sloth.
- What is that?

981
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:47,899
My goodness! Is it a sloth?

982
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:48,871
Really?

983
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:51,132
It is a sloth!

984
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:52,699
- Oh, my!
- It's a sloth?

985
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:54,365
- My gosh!
- It's so cute!

986
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,379
It's like their pet.

987
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,399
I've only seen them in "Zootopia."

988
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,866
That's right.

989
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:02,166
- It's so adorable!
- It is the one from "Zootopia."

990
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,199
- Yes, it is.
- A sloth.

991
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,632
I see they have
a different companion animal.

992
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,197
Right. It's different.

993
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:07,866
(The mascot of this village)

994
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:09,599
- It's so cute!
- That's their companion animal?

995
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,399
Yes.

996
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:12,166
Oh, my goodness.

997
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,499
It looks lovely.

998
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:15,799
It's a smiley face too.

999
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,275
(I'm Rosita, a sloth.)

1000
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,266
- It's so cute.
- It is really cute.

1001
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,603
It's just adorable.

1002
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,132
(They've never seen a sloth
as a companion animal.)

1003
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:25,499
Hi there.
(Holding her tightly)

1004
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,032
It really feels like a domestic pet.

1005
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,380
It's very gentle too.

1006
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:33,766
Oh, gosh. It's unbelievably lovely.

1007
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,599
It's so adorable. I can't...

1008
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,821
My gosh...

1009
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:41,499
- It's so lovable.
- Can I hold it?

1010
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,732
(May I hold it?)

1011
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:43,799
- Okay.
- You can hold it.

1012
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:45,666
It's crazy cute.

1013
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,099
This is my first time seeing one.

1014
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,499
Oh, my goodness!

1015
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,432
So cute!

1016
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:53,870
I can't! It's so cute.

1017
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,466
- My gosh.
- Look at it.

1018
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,199
- I envy her so much.
- You're so cute.

1019
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,532
(Feeling genuinely jealous)

1020
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:00,466
Oh, my.

1021
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,446
You'd want to take it home
after that moment.

1022
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,799
Its face is pure innocence.

1023
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:09,399
- I know.
- Its face tells it's so gentle.

1024
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,599
- It is so gentle.
- Gosh, it's adorable!

1025
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,966
- All its features are concentrated.
- How cute.

1026
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:16,132
- Oh, gosh...
- I love this.

1027
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,132
- Same.
- Look at its face.

1028
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,532
It's so cute and harmless.

1029
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,557
Yes, it's been a while
since I met such a harmless being.

1030
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:23,742
It's so innocent.

1031
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:25,499
I can't stop adoring it.

1032
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,966
- Rosita?
- My gosh...

1033
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,172
- "L'Occitane?"
- Rosita.

1034
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,632
- Rosita.
- It's not L'Occitane. It's Rosita.

1035
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:32,866
Look at him go again.

1036
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,766
Whatever the word he consumes,

1037
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,146
it comes out all mangled.

1038
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,199
So you're like a word blender.

1039
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,432
The words come out destroyed after you.

1040
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:44,799
It all comes out distorted.

1041
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,356
He should be called a wordbreaker.

1042
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:48,632
Come closer.

1043
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:50,466
- Can I hold it?
- Sure.

1044
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:51,299
- How?
- It's all right.

1045
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,966
- Won't it be scared of me?
- It won't.

1046
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,332
Can you please let go of my hair?

1047
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:55,398
It seems so soft and weak.

1048
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,566
It's just like a newborn baby.

1049
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:57,772
How cute.

1050
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,641
It's so gentle.

1051
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:01,643
- This is amazing.
- My goodness. It's so cute.

1052
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:03,044
Oh, no.

1053
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:06,182
- Oh, no.
- It just poked my nose.

1054
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:07,182
Be careful.

1055
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:09,618
- I think its claws are pretty sharp.
- He's a scaredy-cat.

1056
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:10,752
(He's scared for good.)

1057
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:13,955
Animals have a sense of who's good or bad.

1058
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,328
- How adorable.
- It's so cute. What should I do?

1059
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:21,982
- I need to go there to see it.
- It's truly worth going.

1060
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,851
I really love cute animals.

1061
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,218
I envy them so much.

1062
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:26,286
Let's get going.

1063
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:28,988
What is this place?

1064
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,223
Is it a school?

1065
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:32,158
Isn't this the village head's house
or something?

1066
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:33,726
I guess so.

1067
00:40:34,161 --> 00:40:37,063
(They decided to look around first.)

1068
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:38,965
This isn't the right town
we are going to stay.

1069
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:42,236
We need to take a boat to get there.

1070
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:43,404
Are you serious?

1071
00:40:43,404 --> 00:40:44,637
I see. We need to take a boat.

1072
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:46,172
(From here?)

1073
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:47,540
(We have to go even farther?)

1074
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,775
Do you need to go even further?

1075
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,300
We had to go much farther from there.

1076
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:53,680
(Iquitos, Current Location,
and Final Destination)

1077
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,216
(They've already traveled
a long time by boat,)

1078
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:57,651
- They still need to go even further?
- I think it took us an hour.

1079
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:58,551
Right.

1080
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:00,386
(but they need to go even deeper
into the Amazon.)

1081
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:02,221
We had to travel by boat
for a long time to get there.

1082
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:04,924
You traveled
for an awful long time to get there.

1083
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,663
(Now, they've arrived
at the dock to take a boat.)

1084
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:09,787
This is no joke.

1085
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,166
I wouldn't be surprised
if I saw a crocodile right now.

1086
00:41:15,102 --> 00:41:19,138
(What does the dock look like
that left them speechless?)

1087
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,743
- Even a small wave could flip it.
- What on earth is that?

1088
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:25,345
- We're doomed.
- Seriously?

1089
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:26,979
(No way.)

1090
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,015
- What?
- Is that small thing a boat?

1091
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,726
What if we drown out here?

1092
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:34,353
How long will it take
to get there by boat?

1093
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,924
- You take boats from there?
- Yes. There.

1094
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:38,891
Is this a common route people take?

1095
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:39,892
This is the only road leading us there.

1096
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:42,128
It is obvious there was no other way
to get there.

1097
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:43,463
(It's the only way
to get to their destination.)

1098
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:46,465
(Ok Vin gets on the boat first.)

1099
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:48,234
Be careful.

1100
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:50,603
(Cautious)

1101
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,939
- What happened?
- Watch out.

1102
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,906
Be careful.

1103
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:55,808
- Watch your step.
- What's that?

1104
00:41:58,545 --> 00:41:59,812
It's rocking left and right.

1105
00:42:00,181 --> 00:42:02,015
Ok Vin boarded first again.

1106
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,184
Usually, a gentleman gets on first
to offer a hand, right?

1107
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:07,453
In most cases, he does.

1108
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:08,721
I think Ok Vin will offer a hand now.

1109
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:10,022
(Meanwhile, the three scaredy-cats are...)

1110
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:11,590
Hyun Seok, I'll hold it so you can get on.

1111
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:14,427
- Hold on. Let me...
- Let me hold it for you.

1112
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:15,971
All right.

1113
00:42:15,996 --> 00:42:17,597
He's checking to see
if the boat has a hole or something.

1114
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:18,698
(He got on the boat
after thoroughly checking it.)

1115
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,033
Let Ok Vin board first.

1116
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,603
(When Daniel gets on the boat,)

1117
00:42:23,604 --> 00:42:25,638
(it starts rocking even harder.)

1118
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:28,074
Don't move, guys. I need to get on it too.

1119
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:29,776
- Hold on, Hyun Seok! Let me help you!
- No, you can just sit.

1120
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:31,344
- No, just stay seated.
- No! I should...

1121
00:42:31,345 --> 00:42:33,247
- No, just stay there.
- Come on! Let me go and help you.

1122
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:36,081
- No, you need to stay seated there.
- I'm coming, Hyun Seok! Hold on.

1123
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,450
He kept insisting
on that I didin't ask for.

1124
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:39,719
No, you should stay seated so that I...

1125
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:41,620
(Irritated)

1126
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:42,689
Just help me with these, then.

1127
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:45,191
Here.

1128
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:46,859
Just hold these for me.

1129
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:48,795
Just hold these for me.

1130
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:50,363
Hyun Seok!

1131
00:42:50,364 --> 00:42:52,232
- You'd better control your body first.
- Hyun Seok!

1132
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:53,499
- Here.
- Is this okay?

1133
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,600
- Yes. Okay. I'll handle it.
- Okay!

1134
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:56,135
- I can get on by myself.
- Hop on!

1135
00:42:56,413 --> 00:42:57,279
I'll hold it for you!

1136
00:42:57,304 --> 00:42:58,671
You need to stay out so I can get on.

1137
00:42:58,672 --> 00:42:59,606
All right.

1138
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:01,107
He can get on when you're not there.

1139
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:02,241
Stop getting in my way.

1140
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,242
Will this be okay, Hyun Seok?

1141
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:08,314
(He ends up getting scolded by Hyun Seok.)

1142
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:12,118
(The elementary school brothers
just can't help arguing.)

1143
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,119
All right.

1144
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,854
(Those guys are funny.)

1145
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:15,888
That's it.

1146
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,423
My goodness.

1147
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:18,281
(Everyone made it on board safely.)

1148
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:21,994
Geez. Daniel is high-maintenance.

1149
00:43:22,463 --> 00:43:24,297
It was really exhausting helping
Hyun Seok on board.

1150
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:27,333
(They might end up growing
fond of each other.)

1151
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:28,968
(Now the boat is ready to set off.)

1152
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:30,469
Here they go, finally.

1153
00:43:32,706 --> 00:43:34,473
(What does the other side
of this Amazon river look like?)

1154
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:35,475
This is crazy.

1155
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,277
This is insane.

1156
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:41,080
- This is the Amazon we know.
- Right.

1157
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,315
This is the image we have in our heads.

1158
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:44,717
It's the kind of place on "Indiana Jones."

1159
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,454
Gosh. This is immense.

1160
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:51,257
- It is immense, indeed.
- Right?

1161
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:54,927
Look at these trees up high.

1162
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:58,864
This is the legit Amazonian jungle.

1163
00:43:58,866 --> 00:44:00,333
We're in the middle of this jungle.

1164
00:44:01,602 --> 00:44:02,569
It's no joke.

1165
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,105
- This is so interesting.
- It's insane.

1166
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:08,107
(They sail deeper into the jungle,)

1167
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:11,711
- This is amazing.
- Bombonaje.

1168
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:13,081
(heading toward the unknown.)

1169
00:44:13,082 --> 00:44:15,448
The problem now is that if the boat flips,

1170
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:17,050
- there might be piranhas and crocodiles.
- Right.

1171
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:18,584
Even if you manage to save someone,
they could lose an arm or worse.

1172
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:19,485
Right.

1173
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:23,923
It seems like the perfect habitat
for crocodiles.

1174
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:25,658
Or anacondas.

1175
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:27,093
(Will there be crocodiles?)

1176
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:28,227
They must be really huge.

1177
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:30,329
Hola.

1178
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:35,067
Are there crocodiles in this river?

1179
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:36,635
Yes?

1180
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:38,538
Are there many of them?

1181
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:40,407
(Of course, there are.)

1182
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:42,842
The boat stopped every time
Su Young asked him a question.

1183
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:44,177
- Because of the noise.
- I see it now.

1184
00:44:44,177 --> 00:44:46,278
He turns off the motor to listen to him.

1185
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,581
(He turned the motor off
to answer his questions.)

1186
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:53,319
(He turns it on after answering him.)

1187
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,487
He said there were crocodiles.

1188
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:55,555
- Really?
- Yes.

1189
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,160
(His curiosity remains unsatisfied.)

1190
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:02,562
See? Here he goes again.

1191
00:45:02,563 --> 00:45:04,030
(The motor engine is off again.)

1192
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:05,332
Are those crocodiles big?

1193
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:06,966
Why do you keep asking him questions?

1194
00:45:08,202 --> 00:45:10,737
He slowed us down
about 15 minutes, didn't he?

1195
00:45:10,737 --> 00:45:12,104
- He did.
- Tell me about it.

1196
00:45:12,105 --> 00:45:13,672
He can't stop asking questions
when there's a long way to go.

1197
00:45:13,674 --> 00:45:15,275
That's why the boat couldn't move.

1198
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,878
Seriously? How much deeper
do we have to go? This is...

1199
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:22,448
This is the real Amazon.

1200
00:45:23,384 --> 00:45:24,717
The boat was way faster than we thought.

1201
00:45:24,818 --> 00:45:25,751
Really?

1202
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:28,688
(Eyes wide open)

1203
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:31,090
Why am I here? Oh, my gosh.

1204
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:34,727
(Where are they headed this deep...)

1205
00:45:34,728 --> 00:45:36,162
(inside the Amazon?)

1206
00:45:36,163 --> 00:45:38,464
We're really in the middle of a jungle.

1207
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:42,902
What's going on?

1208
00:45:43,571 --> 00:45:44,637
What happened?

1209
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:46,973
(The boat swerves suddenly.)

1210
00:45:49,443 --> 00:45:50,543
There is a village.

1211
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:55,013
What is that?

1212
00:45:55,015 --> 00:45:56,148
(There is a village?)

1213
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,183
How can a village exist over there?

1214
00:45:58,185 --> 00:45:59,218
Does someone live there?

1215
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,886
(In the Amazon jungle of Peru,)

1216
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:04,323
(there is a village.)

1217
00:46:05,158 --> 00:46:06,058
(Is there really a village in the Amazon?)

1218
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:07,299
For real?

1219
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,360
(Is there an Amazone village?)

1220
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:10,462
Does someone live there?

1221
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:13,766
I guess someone actually lives there.

1222
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,034
There are even kids.

1223
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:17,904
- A typical civilization ends there.
- Right.

1224
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:21,441
I think
some tribespeople will welcome them now.

1225
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:22,675
- You mean the natives?
- Yes.

1226
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:24,410
The native people who live there?

1227
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:27,980
(They are going to meet
the native Arizonians?)

1228
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:29,449
This is no joke.

1229
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:31,450
I don't think...

1230
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:34,354
this is going to be easy.

1231
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:36,622
What? There is someone coming out.

1232
00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:37,823
(Someone comes into view.)

1233
00:46:38,825 --> 00:46:40,693
(They finally land.)

1234
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:42,595
(The villagers start to move too.)

1235
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:43,963
What's going on?

1236
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:47,666
What?

1237
00:46:51,038 --> 00:46:53,706
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

1238
00:46:54,941 --> 00:46:57,042
(They're all dressed so nicely
to welcome them.)

1239
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:59,044
They're all dressed up impeccably.

1240
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:01,146
- I know.
- She's wearing a blazer.

1241
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:04,051
(She's all dolled up
in a flower-patterned skirt.)

1242
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,551
- Hello.
- Hi.

1243
00:47:05,552 --> 00:47:07,953
(He's happy to see them,
and he's dumbfounded.)

1244
00:47:07,954 --> 00:47:08,954
Hello.

1245
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:10,889
What's that dress about?

1246
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:12,358
(A girl is even wearing
a halterneck dress.)

1247
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,193
- Hello.
- Hi.

1248
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:15,161
Channel.

1249
00:47:15,162 --> 00:47:17,030
(Meet Amazonian Jennie.)

1250
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:18,231
Isn't it a limited edition?

1251
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:19,865
It must be an Amazon special edition.

1252
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:23,502
(Forget about old tribal fashion.)

1253
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:27,941
(This is the latest trend.)

1254
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:30,677
My name is Daniel.

1255
00:47:30,677 --> 00:47:32,011
Daniel.

1256
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:33,279
- What's your name?
- Adriel.

1257
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,180
Adriel!

1258
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:36,516
I'm Daniel.

1259
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,084
- They seem so happy to see them.
- I know.

1260
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:42,288
- Everyone is there, even the kids.
- Daniel.

1261
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,724
They must be there to greet them
in their finest clothes.

1262
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:47,360
They rarely have visitors,

1263
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:49,295
so they were really happy to see some.

1264
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,331
I'm Daniel.

1265
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:54,233
(Amazon Jennie is so cool.)

1266
00:47:54,234 --> 00:47:55,534
- Suddenly, she was there.
- Just like Jennie.

1267
00:47:57,104 --> 00:47:58,905
Hello.

1268
00:47:58,905 --> 00:48:00,038
- Hi.
- Hi.

1269
00:48:01,174 --> 00:48:03,642
- Bombonaje.
- Bombonaje.

1270
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,444
- Oh, is this the place?
- Oh, Bombonaje?

1271
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:07,046
Is this the one?

1272
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:09,449
Is the name of the village Bombonaje?

1273
00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:11,585
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, I see.

1274
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,652
It's the name of the village.

1275
00:48:14,354 --> 00:48:15,956
Bombonaje. It's here.

1276
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:17,857
We found it at last.

1277
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,127
- Finally.
- This is the place.

1278
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:24,097
They finally figured out
the second mission card.

1279
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:29,568
(In the Amazon rainforest of Peru,)

1280
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:30,937
(there is a small village.)

1281
00:48:30,938 --> 00:48:32,171
That is amazing.

1282
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:37,276
(Bombonaje)

1283
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,949
(The Amazon is...)

1284
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:46,151
(a playground for the village kids.)

1285
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:49,922
(It's where they fish and gather food...)

1286
00:48:49,923 --> 00:48:54,960
(and the only pathway
to the outside world.)

1287
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:56,829
It's so peaceful.

1288
00:48:57,531 --> 00:49:00,099
I realized I had a prejudice
against Amazon.

1289
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,200
- I know.
- Right.

1290
00:49:04,037 --> 00:49:04,970
An anteater!

1291
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:06,572
(It's a place
where they coexist with wildlife,)

1292
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:07,840
An anteater! That's insane.

1293
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:08,874
It's so interesting.

1294
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:12,044
How adorable! Geez.

1295
00:49:13,513 --> 00:49:19,785
(and also where we explore
traditional Amazonian food culture...)

1296
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,614
(using naturally sourced ingredients.)

1297
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:28,420
(What adventures await us in Bombonaje?)

1298
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:31,409
(Come on in.)

1299
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:33,073
- What is this place for?
- It's a house.

1300
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:34,113
A house!

1301
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:35,060
It is a house.

1302
00:49:36,737 --> 00:49:38,670
- The inside is cooler than I thought.
- It is.

1303
00:49:38,672 --> 00:49:39,839
We traveled a long time.

1304
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,374
Gosh. Get in.

1305
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:44,163
(He looks around the kitchen first.)

1306
00:49:44,211 --> 00:49:45,478
The kitchen is so nice!

1307
00:49:46,847 --> 00:49:48,616
- What? Do they have a gas stove?
- They have gas stoves!

1308
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:50,582
A gas stove? For real?

1309
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:52,385
(He checks the stove immediately.)

1310
00:49:52,552 --> 00:49:54,052
This gas stove's power isn't that bad.

1311
00:49:54,955 --> 00:49:56,757
Look at the fire pit. They have one.

1312
00:49:56,758 --> 00:49:58,080
Really?

1313
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:00,289
(An outdoor brazier
that every chef dreams of)

1314
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,008
- It's different.
- That's fascinating.

1315
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,795
(The indoor kitchen has
pretty much everything.)

1316
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,118
(Bathroom, bedroom, and dining zone)

1317
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,055
This is quite nice.

1318
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:12,426
- That looks like the bathroom.
- Check it out. It's interesting.

1319
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:15,229
- Let's check the bathroom out.
- What is it?

1320
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:16,963
(What's the bathroom like in the Amazon?)

1321
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:17,990
The bathroom? Oh, my.

1322
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,460
This is pretty decent.

1323
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:21,216
They actually have a toilet.

1324
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:23,374
(The toilet seat)

1325
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,540
It's clean too.

1326
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:27,260
The bathroom is quite fancy.

1327
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:30,163
The bedroom is neat too.

1328
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,369
- There it is.
- It's so nice.

1329
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:35,425
(Amazon's own princess bed)

1330
00:50:35,425 --> 00:50:37,303
I mean, they have everything.

1331
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:40,473
Things at the Amazon are...

1332
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,490
better than what I had in mind.

1333
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:43,309
- It's somewhat familiar.
- Right.

1334
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:44,661
I'm surprised at how familiar things are.

1335
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:47,113
They have a bathroom too.

1336
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:49,983
(Taking a quick break
while unpacking their things)

1337
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,651
Do you need tweezers?

1338
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,186
You can use it first,
and let me try it later.

1339
00:50:53,186 --> 00:50:54,170
- Why?
- I can use it later.

1340
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,523
- It's okay. You can use it.
- I mean it.

1341
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,458
- What's going on?
- What is it?

1342
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:00,994
Which tweezers do you need?

1343
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,573
(Chef Choi reveals his knife bag.)

1344
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:04,297
- My goodness.
- It has my name on it.

1345
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:06,032
I'm so curious about that knife.

1346
00:51:06,142 --> 00:51:07,500
You'll be surprised with this one.

1347
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:08,501
What is it for?

1348
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:10,570
This is called Asuka.

1349
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,202
- Asuka?
- It looks expensive.

1350
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,640
You'll be startled when you pull it out.

1351
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,441
- Can I try it?
- Hold this before you do it.

1352
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:19,619
It's made of Damascus steel.

1353
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,572
It's so light, isn't it?

1354
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:24,184
I want to hold it too.

1355
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:26,252
- Isn't it really light?
- Totally.

1356
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,993
When you slice an onion with it,
it doesn't make any sounds.

1357
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,524
You know how it makes these sounds?
You won't hear it.

1358
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,293
- These are...
- I think it'll cut through this.

1359
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:35,198
These are scissors for chefs.

1360
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:36,796
Goodness. It cuts through plastic
like it's nothing.

1361
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,465
- That's amazing.
- These are scissors for chefs.

1362
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,367
The cuts from plastic float in the air.

1363
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,822
Do you want precision cooking tweezers?

1364
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:45,238
Those look cool too.

1365
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,440
I like them.

1366
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:49,780
- If you cook with those...
- Like this.

1367
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,046
You can put it in there
since it won't get a dent.

1368
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:54,814
- I'll give it to you.
- Thank you, Hyun Seok.

1369
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:57,314
- Amazing.
- It's incredible.

1370
00:51:58,377 --> 00:52:00,653
I'll head out to look for ingredients
with Hyun Seok.

1371
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:02,088
- Bring us lots of good ingredients.
- Okay.

1372
00:52:02,139 --> 00:52:02,989
Then,

1373
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:05,225
let me choose the menu for today.

1374
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,394
- I'll help you with all the cooking.
- Okay.

1375
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:09,244
Let's go now.

1376
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:10,403
Let's go.

1377
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,699
Take a basket with you, Hyun Seok.

1378
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,834
Don't come back until the basket is full.

1379
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,859
You'll get the ingredients
from a field in the Amazon?

1380
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,594
Yes.
Off you go.

1381
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,441
We have an average height of 188cm.

1382
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,980
- I made it shorter.
- You cut it down a bit.

1383
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,830
I can see that.

1384
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:26,913
Let's go that way.

1385
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:28,047
Is it that way?

1386
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:31,147
(Why would he go under the eaves
when there's a road ahead?)

1387
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:36,039
(That guy's vibes are off for me too.)

1388
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,322
(Halting)

1389
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,172
What's this?

1390
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:41,988
What's this tree?

1391
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:43,690
It's a banana tree.

1392
00:52:43,715 --> 00:52:45,158
- It's a banana tree?
- Yes.

1393
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,303
Is it really? Or is that a lie?

1394
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:48,795
- It really is.
- It is?

1395
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,621
(You are such a suspicious person.)

1396
00:52:52,232 --> 00:52:53,082
Be careful of snakes...

1397
00:52:53,466 --> 00:52:54,467
and alligators too.

1398
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:57,160
It must be agonizing for him.

1399
00:52:59,262 --> 00:53:01,331
(They spot someone working hard.)

1400
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:05,468
(Hello,
we're the Tasty Mission expedition.)

1401
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:09,406
(This man came out from among the bushes.)

1402
00:53:09,406 --> 00:53:10,736
He looks a lot like In Pyo.

1403
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:12,371
(He looks a lot like In Pyo at a glance.)

1404
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:13,523
He looks rather like In Pyo.

1405
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:16,646
- He's really kind and took care of us.
- That's true.

1406
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:18,678
- He took care of everything for us.
- He did.

1407
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:22,071
(David is the go-to guy
at the Bombonaje Village.)

1408
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:23,458
He's handsome too.

1409
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:25,983
(He became a father to twins not long ago.
He's a father to five siblings.)

1410
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,854
The three babies are so cute.

1411
00:53:28,545 --> 00:53:31,001
(He agrees to join
the Tasty Mission expedition.)

1412
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:33,526
He was the kindest guy
and took good care of us.

1413
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,333
(They set off for a trip
to the Amazon's vegetable field.)

1414
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,131
So this is what happened
when we were not there.

1415
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,317
(In the vegetable field
at the Bombonaje Village,)

1416
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,637
(you can get almost everything.)

1417
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:46,439
(Tropical fruits, hunger crops,
spice, Sugar cane)

1418
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,758
You won't have trouble
getting ingredients now.

1419
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,293
It's full of them.

1420
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:51,832
(An area where they can find hidden items)

1421
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,796
There's a chili called Charapita
that we eat around here.

1422
00:53:55,796 --> 00:53:57,067
There's chili here?

1423
00:53:57,092 --> 00:54:00,100
(There's chili in the Amazon?)

1424
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,806
Oh, this one.

1425
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:04,591
- It must be that thing.
- It grows into that thing.

1426
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,376
- That yellow, little thing.
- Yes.

1427
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:09,777
(Aji Charapita)

1428
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:11,682
It's the most expensive chili
in the world.

1429
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,184
And you can see it anywhere there?

1430
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,654
South America is the birthplace of chili.
They have all kinds.

1431
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,256
Shall we slice it and try it?

1432
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:20,924
- The one who loses.
- We'll see how spicy it is.

1433
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,774
As a penalty?

1434
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:25,061
It will be spicy.

1435
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,396
He's like, "You'll regret it."

1436
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,495
Doesn't that word mean
that something is spicy?

1437
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:30,600
It's very spicy.

1438
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,003
You snooze, you lose.
Rock, paper, scissors.

1439
00:54:33,056 --> 00:54:34,257
Rock, paper, scissors.

1440
00:54:34,568 --> 00:54:36,884
(Daniel will get to try it.)

1441
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:39,286
Spicy.

1442
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:41,144
The one who suggests an idea
usually ends up getting chosen.

1443
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,830
Try the lower part only.

1444
00:54:43,964 --> 00:54:44,981
It's so small.

1445
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,760
(The chili is very small in size.)

1446
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,321
He seems really worried.

1447
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:55,174
(Frightening)

1448
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,559
Spit it out.

1449
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,514
(Is it that spicy?)

1450
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,564
Is he acting? Or is this for real?

1451
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:03,800
I'm serious.

1452
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:05,586
(Please trust me.)

1453
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:06,436
Hold on.

1454
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,323
(I told you it was spicy.)

1455
00:55:09,323 --> 00:55:10,340
This is no joke.

1456
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,895
Seriously. My lips are...

1457
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:14,945
I can't feel my lips. They're numb.

1458
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:16,497
(Feeling numb)

1459
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:17,491
I mean it.

1460
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:18,559
But you tried a tiny piece.

1461
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,217
- I'm serious.
- Is it really that spicy?

1462
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,596
I can't feel them. They went numb.

1463
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,723
- It's spicy.
- Is he drooling?

1464
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:29,163
I told you. I couldn't feel a thing.

1465
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:30,727
You must've given up on your image.

1466
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:33,096
This is no joke.

1467
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,510
(He's salivating
from the Charapita's lingering heat.)

1468
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:38,535
Do you have some water?

1469
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,221
(He requires a lot of care.)

1470
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,369
I have water, Hyun Seok.

1471
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:43,740
Rinse it out with water.

1472
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:46,393
(Taking an emergency measure
with bottled water)

1473
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,879
(He soothes the spiciness on his lips.)

1474
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:49,754
It's so strong.

1475
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,384
(What did I tell you?)

1476
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,760
(I told you it was spicy.)

1477
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,723
(It's spicy.)

1478
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:59,990
I thought I lost my tongue back there.

1479
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:02,443
(The Charapita is the spiciest pepper
in the world.)

1480
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:03,330
(Inhaling)
(Exhaling)

1481
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:05,262
You can start without me.

1482
00:56:06,006 --> 00:56:06,856
Please go ahead.

1483
00:56:08,742 --> 00:56:11,285
(Is he even declaring
that he's out of this season?)

1484
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,369
It's so strong.

1485
00:56:14,514 --> 00:56:16,849
(Left alone,
Choi is feeling more burdened.)

1486
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,700
What is this?

1487
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,643
Oh, it's a beehive.

1488
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,013
(Is that a beehive amid the bushes?)

1489
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:26,508
It's not a beehive,

1490
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:27,614
but a mousetrap.

1491
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,654
(A mousetrap?)

1492
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:31,606
Really?

1493
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:33,990
In that case, isn't something in there
since it's closed?

1494
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,127
- Yes, there's a rat in this.
- Yes, he caught something.

1495
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,411
Really?

1496
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,098
You won't make me try it
after I check it out, right?

1497
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:46,169
(He catches on to things so fast.)

1498
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:50,457
(I want Daniel to see this with me.)

1499
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:53,877
It's unbelievably spicy.

1500
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:55,095
(Daniel still feels numb.)

1501
00:56:56,009 --> 00:56:57,250
Why didn't Hyun Seok try it, though?

1502
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,949
I don't know. He's a thug.

1503
00:56:58,974 --> 00:57:01,888
I don't know. He's a thug.

1504
00:57:04,078 --> 00:57:06,289
You really don't watch your language.

1505
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:07,554
(I can't let my guard down.)

1506
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:10,931
(Rinsing it out)

1507
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:16,031
I wasn't sure if I could spit it out.
It was what he gave me, anyway.

1508
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,268
But I went crazy
to be holding it in my mouth.

1509
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,694
It was unbelievably spicy.

1510
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:22,802
Are you okay?

1511
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:24,341
Hyun Seok, this is killing me.

1512
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:25,942
- What? Do you have to rest?
- I'm serious.

1513
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,677
I'm not kidding.

1514
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:28,745
What do we do about it?

1515
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,614
I feel like my mouth is paralyzed.

1516
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,749
Your lips have become thicker.

1517
00:57:32,913 --> 00:57:33,763
They are swollen.

1518
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,851
Why didn't you have it?

1519
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:38,088
They're swollen
as if he got a filler injection.

1520
00:57:38,113 --> 00:57:39,339
His lips look more charming this way.

1521
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:41,191
- His lips are pretty.
- Right?

1522
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,057
(Stifling laughter)

1523
00:57:44,057 --> 00:57:46,296
- Are you happy to see me crying?
- No, I'm not.

1524
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,317
You know...

1525
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:50,070
It's spicy.

1526
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,119
(Are you still having a hard time?)

1527
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:54,037
It was very spicy.

1528
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:57,440
Is there a way to soothe it
that's a local remedy?

1529
00:57:58,151 --> 00:58:00,233
He'll feel better
if he has some sugar cane.

1530
00:58:00,233 --> 00:58:01,442
It's like we do a similiar thing
with Coolpis.

1531
00:58:01,466 --> 00:58:03,680
Is there a sugar cane tree nearby?

1532
00:58:03,705 --> 00:58:05,538
(Is there a sugar cane tree around here?)

1533
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:07,834
- Yes, it's over there.
- It's on that side.

1534
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,819
It gets better if you chew sugar cane.

1535
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:11,220
Ask him to find one for us.

1536
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,357
He takes them anywhere
as they tell him a thing.

1537
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:16,192
- It's amazing.
- The ingredients are everywhere.

1538
00:58:17,484 --> 00:58:18,725
Oh, it's a sugar cane.

1539
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:21,254
- Okay. What's this?
- Sugar cane.

1540
00:58:21,254 --> 00:58:22,765
- He needs to try a piece.
- Sugar cane.

1541
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,772
- I'll slice one for you to try.
- Okay.

1542
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,403
Okay.

1543
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:28,304
Just a tiny piece.

1544
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,041
It was my first time to see sugar cane.

1545
00:58:32,786 --> 00:58:34,287
(Moving his hands without hesitation)

1546
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,330
(Cutting it in one try)

1547
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:37,767
I can't eat all of it.

1548
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:41,250
Of course, you can't.
You're not Fu Bao, the panda.

1549
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,591
(I don't know about Fu Bao.)

1550
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:47,387
(Slicing)

1551
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:52,586
(They're immersed
by his flashy knife moves.)

1552
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:55,942
(He cuts it into a nice size.)

1553
00:58:57,077 --> 00:58:59,549
(He's done trimming it in no time.)

1554
00:59:00,594 --> 00:59:01,608
You should try one too.

1555
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:03,473
This is sugar water.

1556
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,527
(Surprised)

1557
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:09,078
It's my first time trying sugar cane.

1558
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:11,980
This is sugar water.

1559
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:14,751
(Crunchy)

1560
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:16,302
It's sweet.

1561
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,987
It's just sugar water.

1562
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,123
But if you turn this into sugar powder,

1563
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:21,724
(Sugar cane is rich
in vitamins and minerals.)

1564
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,859
it becomes a polysaccharide.

1565
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,965
This is better than sugar.

1566
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,261
(Chewing)

1567
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:30,767
If you boil its juice down,
it becomes sugar syrup.

1568
00:59:34,628 --> 00:59:35,872
(The natural sugar from the sugar cane
is mouthwatering.)

1569
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:36,803
It looks really good.

1570
00:59:36,803 --> 00:59:38,141
It must be delicious.

1571
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:41,144
I'm feeling okay now.

1572
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:43,103
(After recovering,
they go to find another ingredient.)

1573
00:59:44,313 --> 00:59:47,667
I thought this was a beehive,
but they caught something.

1574
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,018
It must be a rat.

1575
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:50,863
If you open it now, it'll come out.

1576
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:52,689
(Daniel recognizes a mousetrap
right away.)

1577
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,057
Can you eat it?

1578
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,008
Do you eat it?

1579
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:57,985
Maybe it's a rodent.

1580
00:59:57,985 --> 00:59:59,419
Ask him to show us
now that he's caught one.

1581
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:00,652
But it must be alive.

1582
01:00:01,252 --> 01:00:04,385
Wait. You made me look at it
so that you wouldn't have to eat it?

1583
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:06,252
- You didn't know that?
- I had no clue.

1584
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:09,152
(The childish duo leaves the good ones
for each other.)

1585
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,285
May I see it?

1586
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,619
(He wants to check it out first.)

1587
01:00:12,285 --> 01:00:15,719
(He stays silent
in case he'll have to eat it.)

1588
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:17,752
(Lifting)

1589
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:20,552
- Something is in it.
- Something is in it.

1590
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:24,219
(Their current average heart rate is
188 BPM.)

1591
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:26,319
(Glancing)

1592
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:29,619
What is it?

1593
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,819
- It's a mouse!
- It's a mouse!

1594
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,985
(It's an actual mouse!)

1595
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:37,152
- That's not food. That's a live mouse.
- It's a mouse.

1596
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:39,652
I knew it was a mouse.

1597
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:41,794
- A rodent.
- That's a live mouse.

1598
01:00:41,794 --> 01:00:44,294
It's a mouse. This is a mouse trap.

1599
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:46,094
It's obvious.

1600
01:00:46,094 --> 01:00:47,794
(It's a real mouse.)

1601
01:00:48,661 --> 01:00:51,261
(They're going to eat that?)

1602
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,260
But it's a mouse.

1603
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:55,526
We have to eat this?

1604
01:00:56,026 --> 01:00:57,126
It's the common mouse we see.

1605
01:00:58,026 --> 01:00:59,326
- Maybe...
- It's not like those large rats.

1606
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,693
Maybe he meant to say it was for dogs.

1607
01:01:01,693 --> 01:01:04,426
- This is a mouse.
- A mouse.

1608
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:06,526
- The larger ones are called rats.
- Rats. Right.

1609
01:01:06,526 --> 01:01:07,693
That's a mouse.

1610
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:10,960
Like Mickey Mouse.
Or Jerry from "Tom and Jerry."

1611
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,760
The tiny one. With black eyes.

1612
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,660
The cute-looking one.

1613
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,326
- And we're eating this?
- We had those back in the day.

1614
01:01:15,326 --> 01:01:16,360
Will you ask him how they eat it?

1615
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,693
There was a conspiracy
that they made mouse-meat burgers.

1616
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:22,326
They eat it however they want.
It's up to you.

1617
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,393
You can deep-fry it or grill it.

1618
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:26,584
(Actually, in Bombo Nahe Village...)

1619
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:34,093
(Sacha cui: Wild rats)

1620
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:37,060
Those wild rats damage their crops.

1621
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,560
So, they catch them and eat them.

1622
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,926
(It's the rat they saw
at Belen Market in the morning.)

1623
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,426
(At the time, they never imagined...)

1624
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:53,193
(they could see one so easily.)

1625
01:01:53,193 --> 01:01:56,360
So, that tiny mouse turns
into that huge rat?

1626
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,693
Oh, it's the same species?

1627
01:01:59,393 --> 01:02:00,460
They caught another one.

1628
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,160
Another one? The same one?

1629
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,353
We set up those traps
because the rats come for yucas.

1630
01:02:05,353 --> 01:02:07,220
They come for yucas.

1631
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,420
I guess rats like yucas.

1632
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,220
I guess so.

1633
01:02:11,986 --> 01:02:14,753
(There's a dense yuca field
ahead of them.)

1634
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:15,653
There it is.
Yuca?

1635
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:19,153
This is a yuca.

1636
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:21,620
I think yuca is their name for cassava.

1637
01:02:21,953 --> 01:02:23,786
Oh, it's cassava!

1638
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:25,220
That's tasty.

1639
01:02:26,753 --> 01:02:29,420
(Hold onto the stalk and pull it hard.)

1640
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,520
Oh, that's...

1641
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,820
That looks like a sweet potato.

1642
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,220
- Yuca.
- Yuca.

1643
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,153
This is...

1644
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,186
This is a yuca.

1645
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,653
It's a bit tougher than a sweet potato.

1646
01:02:42,653 --> 01:02:45,020
It's like a sweet potato with the texture
of a potato, but it's sweet.

1647
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,520
That's a common ingredient
in fine-dining restaurants.

1648
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,353
It is.

1649
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:48,598
(Chef Choi is familiar with it.)

1650
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:50,420
Oh, empanadas.

1651
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:52,520
(It's the main ingredient of empanadas,
which are Latin-American dumplings.)

1652
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,920
(Yucas are used
in various South American dishes.)

1653
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:58,220
Let's put them in the bag.

1654
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:02,220
(Cutting all the roots)

1655
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,753
Should we pack all the roots he gave us?

1656
01:03:03,753 --> 01:03:05,086
Yes. We can use these.

1657
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:09,053
Here. We can cut the stalks
when we go back.

1658
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:10,686
I just want to shake the dirt off.

1659
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:14,120
(They successfully find harvest
at the field in Bombo Nahe.)

1660
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1661
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,953
(Meanwhile, Su Young and Ok Vin are
in the natural pool by the village.)

1662
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,053
(Ok Vin is nervous about going
into the water for the first time.)

1663
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:25,686
Come on in!

1664
01:03:27,453 --> 01:03:28,786
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's warm over here.

1665
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:31,020
(Jumping in)

1666
01:03:31,586 --> 01:03:32,653
It's warm here.

1667
01:03:32,653 --> 01:03:35,653
(This feels so nice.)

1668
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,886
(Splashing water with full power
to the kids)

1669
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,020
(They embrace Amazonian Mother Nature
with their whole bodies.)

1670
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,853
(They wash away the fatigue and sweat
accumulated from the long journey.)

1671
01:03:47,853 --> 01:03:49,320
That was my favorite moment.

1672
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,653
(The mother brings something.)

1673
01:03:53,653 --> 01:03:54,886
What is she bringing?

1674
01:03:55,386 --> 01:03:57,186
(Wait. That's...)

1675
01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:59,420
Eat your snacks, kids.

1676
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,720
What's that?

1677
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,353
It's time for snacks!

1678
01:04:02,853 --> 01:04:04,420
You need snacks
after some time in the pool.

1679
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,253
That's true.

1680
01:04:06,086 --> 01:04:07,320
(Off they go to eat snacks.)

1681
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,953
(Swarming in)

1682
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:16,153
(What do Amazonian kids eat as snacks?)

1683
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:17,053
I wonder what they are.

1684
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,320
What are those?

1685
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,986
(Is that what I think it is?)

1686
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:28,286
It's been so long
since I last saw this thing.

1687
01:04:28,286 --> 01:04:29,220
It's a bit tiny.
What is it?

1688
01:04:30,553 --> 01:04:32,320
(What is it?)

1689
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,220
What is he eating?

1690
01:04:34,686 --> 01:04:36,120
The kids are giving it out.

1691
01:04:38,186 --> 01:04:39,353
- What is this?
- It's so tasty.

1692
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:42,386
- I can't eat this.
- It tastes like chicken.

1693
01:04:42,386 --> 01:04:44,620
- I can't eat this.
- Try it. I mean it.

1694
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,420
- But I can't eat this.
- It's delicious.

1695
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,320
What on earth is it?

1696
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,920
Oh, roasted worms!

1697
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,353
And the rat meat from earlier.

1698
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,486
But we normally eat cup noodles
after playing in the water.

1699
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:04,053
(They put
the well-trimmed rats and worms...)

1700
01:05:04,053 --> 01:05:08,620
(onto the skewers one by one.)

1701
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,520
(Roasting them to a golden brown)

1702
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,353
(Amazonian delicacies
grilled on charcoal fire)

1703
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:21,153
(It's full of protein
that helps with the children's growth.)

1704
01:05:22,553 --> 01:05:23,520
What is it?

1705
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,786
- It's tasty.
- Are you being serious?

1706
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:26,520
It's good. I'll give you a refund
if it tastes bad. Try it.

1707
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:29,286
Give it a taste.

1708
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:32,320
(Just try one.)

1709
01:05:34,286 --> 01:05:35,686
Come on. It's good.

1710
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:36,886
(Eat up. They'll be gone soon.)

1711
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:40,053
(Taking one cautious bite)

1712
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:45,886
(She precisely got the innards out.)

1713
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,753
- Why does it look like this?
- It's what it looks like.

1714
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:51,386
- Why does it look like this?
- Don't look inside.

1715
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:53,086
The innards don't look so appetizing.

1716
01:05:59,453 --> 01:06:00,286
It's good, right?
It's better than you think.

1717
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,029
You almost feel betrayed
because it's so good.

1718
01:06:03,053 --> 01:06:05,186
- But I don't think I should look at it.
- You shouldn't.

1719
01:06:05,486 --> 01:06:07,620
But we eat silkworm pupa in Korea.

1720
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:09,553
It's kind of like silkworm pupa soup.

1721
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:10,953
I couldn't eat its head either.

1722
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,186
You're so brave.

1723
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:14,220
- It was pretty good.
- It's like Korean silkworm pupae.

1724
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,553
- It's not so bad.
- It tastes like beef tripe.

1725
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:17,853
- Because it's grilled on fire.
- Beef tripe!

1726
01:06:17,853 --> 01:06:19,886
- It's got a lot of fat.
- Yes.

1727
01:06:19,886 --> 01:06:21,786
It's like a mixture
of beef tripe and large intestines.

1728
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,953
(The crispy peel holds
the creamy fat filling.)

1729
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:26,853
What am I to do with the rat meat?

1730
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,986
(Up next is the long-awaited food,
sacha cui.)

1731
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:37,586
How does it taste?

1732
01:06:37,586 --> 01:06:39,353
- It's like chicken meat.
- Chicken?

1733
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,086
- Like Gcova Chicken?
- Gcova.

1734
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:44,586
- More like Ratcova Chicken.
- Yes, Ratcova.

1735
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:45,486
Rat-ken.

1736
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:46,820
- "Rat-ken?"
- "Rat-ken."

1737
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,153
"Rat-ken?"

1738
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,820
(Will I be able to eat this?)

1739
01:06:52,286 --> 01:06:55,786
But the kids are enjoying it so much.

1740
01:06:56,820 --> 01:07:00,153
(She plucks up her courage
and takes a bite.)

1741
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:08,319
It tastes like roasted frogs
we used to have back in the day.

1742
01:07:10,353 --> 01:07:13,253
It's not like these rats live
in an underground sewer.

1743
01:07:13,253 --> 01:07:14,619
They run around in nature.

1744
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:18,353
So, they're edible.

1745
01:07:18,353 --> 01:07:22,719
(Although we're unfamiliar with it,
it's a common food in the Amazon.)

1746
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:26,986
In Korea, we see a lot of pigeons
under the pedestrian overpass,

1747
01:07:26,986 --> 01:07:28,819
and we think
that they carry all kinds of germs.

1748
01:07:28,819 --> 01:07:30,819
But pigeon dishes are famous in France.

1749
01:07:30,819 --> 01:07:32,119
- And it's a fine dish.
- Yes.

1750
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:35,153
This is a floating brunch.

1751
01:07:35,586 --> 01:07:38,486
You know the floating breakfast
they bring out at hotels?

1752
01:07:38,486 --> 01:07:40,186
We're having a floating brunch.
This is incredible.

1753
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:41,486
The dishes are amazing.

1754
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:42,419
Worms and...

1755
01:07:43,153 --> 01:07:44,086
- Rats.
- Yes.

1756
01:07:48,082 --> 01:07:49,716
The menu is just a bit wild,

1757
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:52,252
but this is a floating breakfast.

1758
01:07:52,553 --> 01:07:55,321
But the roasted rat was...

1759
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,123
- It was quite good.
- Yes, it was.

1760
01:07:57,124 --> 01:07:59,192
(This is only the start
of the Amazon adventure!)

1761
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,061
We don't have...

1762
01:08:01,462 --> 01:08:03,096
enough protein to cook with.

1763
01:08:03,097 --> 01:08:05,098
Right. We don't have
any protein-containing ingredients.

1764
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:08,768
(All they have are vegetables
they harvested from the field.)

1765
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:12,305
We only have the pirarucu.

1766
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:14,140
But I hear that piranhas are common here,

1767
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,109
so I'll go and catch some.

1768
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:19,412
(Piranhas?)

1769
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:20,913
(You mean the flesh-eating fish?)

1770
01:08:21,949 --> 01:08:24,383
(You can find piranhas...)

1771
01:08:24,385 --> 01:08:27,187
(in the Bombo Nahe Village.)

1772
01:08:28,255 --> 01:08:31,124
(The Bombo Nahe specialty on the card)

1773
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:35,328
(The predators that want to eat
anything that bleeds)

1774
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,801
(The fisherman of 41 years is back.)

1775
01:08:41,168 --> 01:08:43,037
(Will they eat the fish...)

1776
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:45,138
(or be eaten by the fish?)

1777
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,876
(The final match against the real Amazon)

1778
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:52,579
(Korea's best chef,)

1779
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,515
(Choi Hyun Seok)

1780
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:56,750
Gosh!

1781
01:08:57,618 --> 01:08:58,918
My hands hurt.

1782
01:08:59,155 --> 01:09:01,988
(The biggest challenge to his chef career
in the Amazon?)

1783
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:03,456
It'll be a disaster if this tips over.

1784
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:05,759
(The kitchen is
in straight-up wilderness.)

1785
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,560
(Bugs everywhere)

1786
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:09,195
(Help this poor chef of 31 years!)

1787
01:09:10,097 --> 01:09:11,931
(Chef Choi is in a true life crisis.)

1788
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:13,432
(Ok Vin, the food taster is the judge.)

1789
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:15,068
(Secretly getting hopeful)

1790
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:17,704
(Crushing his hope)

1791
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:19,405
(In the Amazon,
where the chef of 31 years...)

1792
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:20,840
(is getting his pride trampled on,)

1793
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,208
(there's an experienced jungle cook.)

1794
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:23,543
(Crazy eyes)

1795
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:25,144
(Feeling at home)

1796
01:09:25,146 --> 01:09:27,047
(Completely adjusted to the jungle life)

1797
01:09:27,348 --> 01:09:28,849
(Even the ingredients from the jungle...)

1798
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:30,616
(can turn into cozy home-style food.)

1799
01:09:31,385 --> 01:09:33,920
(The BOB friends are already in love.)

1800
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:36,289
(The next step is serving
the Amazon guests!)

1801
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,890
(Wary)

1802
01:09:38,559 --> 01:09:39,259
(Om nom)

1803
01:09:39,994 --> 01:09:40,627
(Nom)

1804
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:43,379
I've never had such good food before.

1805
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,830
(So proud)

1806
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:46,766
(Please give me more.)

1807
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:48,968
(He's even giving up
on his head chef title?)

1808
01:09:48,969 --> 01:09:51,471
If anyone is free, can you help me here?

1809
01:09:51,706 --> 01:09:53,139
Yes.

1810
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:55,375
(The hierarchy has been turned around.
What will happen to the cooking masters?)

1811
01:09:55,376 --> 01:09:56,927
(JUNGLE BOB 2, PERU BOB)
