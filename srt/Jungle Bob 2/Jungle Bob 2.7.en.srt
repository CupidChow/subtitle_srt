1
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:10,236
Why am I going through all this trouble?

2
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,836
(A man travels all around the world...)

3
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:18,103
I need to find something new.

4
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:19,303
(in search of a new flavor.)

5
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,311
You can find new ingredients
in a new place.

6
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:23,503
(JUNGLE BOB, a journey of 53,730km)

12

(He went around the world,)

13
00:00:42,303 --> 00:00:44,503
(but his search for the taste didn't end.)

14
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,356
You can...

15
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,803
only meet new things far from home.

16
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,803
(the Caribbean Sea)

17
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:01,074
(The most beautiful sea on Earth)

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,242
I'm so excited.

where a man can see")

20
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,674
(Christopher Colombus said it
after arriving in the Caribbean Sea.)

21
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:14,607
(It's always passionate
above the Caribbean Sea.)

22
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,941
(It's blessed with great weather
and abundant ingredients.)

23
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,507

24
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:25,374
(Barbacoa)

25
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,974
(Since Columbus' discovery in 1492,)

26
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:29,441
(it's where diverse food cultures
converged.)

27
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:34,374

28
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:38,107

32
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,574

35

(Tasty Mission in the Caribbean Sea
begins.)

36
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,782
If we get to the end of the rainbow,

37
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,629
there'd be a pot of gold.

38
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:05,850
(We're here for a pot of flavors.)

39
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:07,074

(General Ok's amazing moments...)

44
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:24,207
(as she gets in her element)

45
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,674
(The Caribbean Sea is a stage for me.)

46
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:30,107
(Leave the undersea ingredients to me.)

47
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:33,807
(From General Ok of Peru
to a warrior of the Caribbean Sea)

48
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:37,874

(A cooking boy next to the captain)

51
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,419
I'm glad I've been cooking...

52
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:52,750
- for a long time.
- Why?

53
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:54,911
Because you're next to me cooking.

54
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:58,407
(They're both fascinated by each other.)

55
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,074
(A shy guy with a buzz cut)

56
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,141
(Let us tell you about this guy.)

57
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,807
(The moment he appeared,)

58
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:07,974
(he captured Choi Hyun Seok's eyes.)

59
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:12,141

(A rising star chef
in the global spotlight)

66
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,974
(However, instead of delicacies,)

67
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:42,707
(he's practically living on junk food?)

68
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,541
You're quite something.

69
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,407
Why?

70
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,974
You ate three cup noodles
early in the morning.

71
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,304
- I had two. Not three.
- I thought it was three.

72
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,874
(Palm oil needs to be recharged
as much as he works.)

73
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:55,807
(He eats hard...)

74
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:57,907
(and works hard.)

75
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,274
(This man, right beside the chef
of "Culinary Class Wars")

76
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,541

(Lee Joon, Passionate Maniac)

78

(He's hyped energy comes out any time.)

80
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:15,607
(As his instinct leads him...)

81
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:18,674
(and as his body leads him)

82
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:21,874
(Somewhere between passion and madness)

83
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:26,341
(This madman with bright eyes...)

84
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:30,874
(has taken over the Caribbean Sea.)

85
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:36,874
(Embracing both day and night
of the Caribbean Sea,)

00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,674
(an epic journey
of Caribbean food unfolds.)

87
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,534
The second journey, CARIB BOB, begins!

88
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,692
Yes!

89
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,841
(Among familiar faces)

90
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,141
Things change completely.

91
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:55,507
- It's totally different.
- It'll be a whole other vibe.

92
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,341
- Hello?
- Who are you?

93
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,274
I'm a new member.

94
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,707
- You are?
- Yes, I'm new.

95
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,107
Please introduce yourself.

96
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:04,241
Hello, I'm the new member
of CARIB BOB, Lee Joon.

97
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:08,217
Hello, I'm the kitchen guy
of CARIB BOB, Yun Nam No.

98
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,707
- "The kitchen guy?"
- Yes.

99
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:11,107
What about Cooking Maniac?

100
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,707
That sounds too provocative.

101
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,441
I can't wait to find out
the dishes you'll make.

102
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,441
We have high expectations.

103
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:19,407
I'm sure it'll satisfy your expectations.

104
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:20,848
- Really?
- I'm confident.

105
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,774
- My mouth is already watering.
- I'm excited...

106
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,474
because Chef Choi also
did an excellent job...

107
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:27,274
- in PERU BOB.
- Right.

108
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:28,407
He was exceptional.

109
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:31,483
And the Caribbean Sea has
an abundance of ingredients.

110
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:32,978
Just look at Nam No's build.

111
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,084
He makes generous servings for every dish.

112
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,441
- I love that.
- It's hearty.

113
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:40,441
I can't stand tiny portions,
even if I have to leave food.

114
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,274
You're not talking
about Hyun Seok, are you?

115
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,973
- Are you referring to him?
- Be careful with your words.

116
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,053
We just pursue different paths in cooking.

117
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:53,713
Joon had a shoot with me
right after he came back.

118
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,367
I asked him how the trip was,

119
00:05:56,841 --> 00:06:01,074
and he said he was the life of the party.

120
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,774
- Meaning he took over the shoot?
- He said he did everything,

121
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,674
- and he was literally the main host.
- Hold on.

122
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:07,807
- He was the main host?
- I'm so excited to find out.

123
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:09,274
(That's new to hear.)

124
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,641
I mean, that happens...

125
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,474
when you try to be funny.

126
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,641
- Anyway, we'll see.
- I'll look forward to it.

127
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,848
- The main host, Lee Joon.
- He's the protagonist.

128
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,974
(What's the truth behind this rumor?)

129
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:25,307
(The Caribbean Sea)

130
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:26,574
(Beside the Caribbean Sea)

131
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:27,632
Dominican Republic.

132
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:30,735
It's located on the island of Hispaniola,

133
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,741
which Columbus discovered.

134
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,741
I see.

135
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:38,074
(They arrived at the Caribbean Sea
at 19:05.)

136
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:42,541
(Bayahibe, Dominican Republic)

137
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:44,807
- Hey.
- Hello.

138
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,007
Nice to meet you.

139
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:47,941
Hello, everyone.

140
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,374
- That was such a long trip.
- We've come a long way.

141
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,941
I'm happy to meet you all.

142
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:52,824
It's already so peaceful
from the beginning.

143
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,674
It feels like "Culinary Class Wars"
all over.

144
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,241
They're the tertiary judges.

145
00:06:58,241 --> 00:06:59,207
It tastes really...

146
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,941
(Having a small talk
with someone particular in mind)

147
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,155
profound.

148
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:03,774
Who's older?

149
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,774
- I was born in 1990, and he's...
- I was born in 1988.

150
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,507
- So, you're the youngest.
- That's right.

151
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:08,907
- And you were born in 1988.
- Right.

152
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:10,541
- I was born in 1987.
- It's 1987, yes.

153
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,241
- I guess it's all set, then.
- Yes.

154
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,307
The first, second, third, and fourth.

155
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:16,841
- That's why I'm pouring the beer.
- The youngest.

156
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,407
I like how they have bright faces.

157
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,587
I feel so great right now.

158
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:25,546
- They're younger than me.
- You've got younger members.

159
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:27,707
- In Peru...
- Right.

160
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,576
- I was the young member.
- Hyun Seok was older than you.

161
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,774
Your face is glowing. It's so obvious.

162
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:36,874
- Look at that big smile.
- Since they're younger than me,

163
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,474
it's easier for me to ask them
to do things.

164
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:39,707
Did you forget about the Choi duo?

165
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:41,606
- I already forgot about them.
- That's right.

166
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:45,607
I can just tell she's completely
moved on from them.

167
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,974
(She can't stop laughing.)

168
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,771
It's nice to have younger members.

169
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:52,350
What do you need me to do?

170
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,507
There's nothing to do now. Relax.

171
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,954
- Thank you.
- You're going to be busy...

172
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,589
starting tomorrow.

173
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:01,807
You need to be careful
what you wish for here.

174
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:05,507
Or else you'll have to work your butt off
for the ingredient.

175
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:07,374
I should choose my words carefully.

176
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:11,107
Let's say you craved lobster.

177
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,611
Then, you have to get it yourself
in the water.

178
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:15,696
In fact...

179
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:19,744
I mean, I'm always ready to dive in.

180
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:22,407
We've got you a map.

181
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:25,717
This is just like "Jumanji."

182
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:28,541
- The map is awesome.
- But it's usually bad luck.

183
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,407
What is that?

184
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,241
- It's like a treasure hunt.
- I know.

185
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:34,341
Is this an actual map?

186
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,360
So what is it?

187
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:36,628
What kind of map is that?

188
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:39,841
(The map for Tasty Mission
in the Caribbean)

189
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:41,607
I see Mano Juan,

190
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,941
Santo Domingo,

191
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,341
Baní,

192
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,774
and San Rafael.

193
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,893
- I see a treasure chest.
- Yes, Eldorado.

194
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,041
- There are pictures of the ingredients.
- But...

195
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,207
- Crayfish and other things.
- There's even a blue marlin.

196
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:55,874
So, they are the ingredients
of each place.

197
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,404
I guess we're going all
across the southern Caribbean.

198
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,844
- Yes, in order.
- Right.

199
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,122
Goodness.

200
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,241
Look at that.

201
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,374
A feast is about to happen.

202
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,452
We're here right now,

203
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,218
so I guess we're going
to this island tomorrow.

204
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:13,374
Probably.

205
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:15,691
There's something I want to try here.

206
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,602
Do you know Sanji from "One Piece?"

207
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,009
He runs a restaurant on the sea.

208
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,374
- I'd like to achieve that dream.
- That's interesting.

209
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:24,307
(The cooking boy dreams
of comic-book fantasy.)

210
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:27,231
We'll be cooking a lot of seafood dishes.

211
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:31,472
I genuinely want my fantasy
from "One Piece" to come true.

212
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,707
- Cooking with Kraken, and...
- Kraken dish?

213
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,141
And huge sea creatures.

214
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,241
- How do you read this?
- Mano Juan.

215
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,407
- Yes, Mano Juan.
- We're here right now.

216
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,906
It's Mano Juan tomorrow.

217
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:43,274
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

218
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:44,974
Just look at the color of the ocean.

219
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:46,407
(To where the unknown ingredient lies)

220
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,532
I'm so excited.

221
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:53,241
- Look at the water.
- It's so clear.

222
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,741
I can see everything underwater.

223
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:57,666
It surely has the Caribbean vibe!

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,668
It's like "Pirates of the Caribbean!"

225
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,647
It's a real Caribbean bay,
not the water park!

226
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:02,771
You're right.

227
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,173
(Crossing the vast Caribbean)

228
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,141
- Let's go!
- Oh, my!

229
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:07,909
Awesome!

230
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:10,510
This is so much fun!

231
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:11,680
This is crazy.

232
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:14,917
(The BOB friends are taking
the first steps of their journey.)

233
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,286
This boat is so fast!

234
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:18,618
It's unbelievably fast.

235
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,457
I feel so refreshed!

236
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:23,091
(The best feeling ever)

237
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,026
This is...

238
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,596
Can you believe
the color of the water here?

239
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,207
It's unbelievable.

240
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:30,899
It's exquisitely beautiful.

241
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:33,002
It's so clear that you can see everything.

242
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,237
- Unbelievable.
- It's beautiful!

243
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,805
It doesn't feel...

244
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,774
like I'm on Earth.

245
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:43,111
It feels like I'm getting drawn
into a mystical world.

246
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:44,713
He sounds like he's had too much beer.

247
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:45,882
It feels surreal.

248
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,549
No, I was completely sober.

249
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,217
(Surprisingly sober)

250
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:52,821
Look, a rainbow!

251
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,122
- What?
- Really?

252
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,891
- What?
- That's incredible!

253
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:00,929
(A rainbow in the Caribbean?)

254
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,796
It's a rainbow!

255
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,800
- It's a real rainbow!
- A rainbow!

256
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,502
Look at that rainbow!

257
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,736
I can't believe it!

258
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:11,474
(A perfect rainbow has bloomed
in the sky.)

259
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,142
- How can that be?
- It's a rainbow!

260
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,610
- What?
- No way!

261
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,778
- Really?
- It's a rainbow!

262
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,352
(Everyone is excited here too.)

263
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:21,859
It looks like CGI!

264
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,816
- It doesn't look real!
- How can that be?

265
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,255
The rainbow is connected!

266
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:27,823
The rainbow!

267
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:29,288
I've never seen a full rainbow!

268
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,358
You're right.

269
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:34,062
This is the biggest rainbow I've seen.

270
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,464
It's a double rainbow!

271
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:36,365
Double rainbow!

272
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,902
- That has to be fake!
- It looks fake, right?

273
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:40,702
- How is that real?
- They were so clear.

274
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,771
They're the exact rainbows we imagine.

275
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:46,641
They're so vibrant!
I've never seen such vibrant rainbows.

276
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,145
How is that real?

277
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,680
- I've never seen anything like that.
- I've never seen such a perfect rainbow.

278
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:54,349
- Me neither.
- It's perfect.

279
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,552
- It's beautiful.
- I'm in awe.

280
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:58,887
(A vibrant seven-colored rainbow)

281
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,055
It's incredible.

282
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:05,193
(Even the Caribbean native is in awe.)

283
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,596
Captain!

284
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:12,667
She has a driving license.

285
00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:14,937
- Really?
- Really?

286
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:18,640
I get a dopamine rush in the ocean.

287
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,376
You know?

288
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:24,613
I live for the joy I get in the water.

289
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,583
I adore the ocean.

290
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:29,751
(Aqua Ok Vin loves water.)

291
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:32,554
I have driving licenses
for yachts and boats.

292
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:34,489
- You can drive a boat?
- That's so cool!

293
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:36,491
I'm also a certified safety guard
for water sports.

294
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:37,892
(Water sport safety guard course)

295
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,504
I have a permit for shellfish harvesting.

296
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,160
For bare-hand shellfish harvesting?

297
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:43,832
(She also has a free diving permit.)

298
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,800
That's incredible.

299
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:48,437
(The aqua woman has
all sorts of licenses.)

300
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:50,104
Come on!

301
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:51,807
- Okay.
- Me?

302
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:53,976
- You want me to drive?
- Yes.

303
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:55,010
- Come on!
- Really?

304
00:12:55,178 --> 00:12:59,281
(Here comes Ok Sparrow.)

305
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,551
Let's go, Captain Ok Vin!

306
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:05,987
How can I drive it?

307
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,256
Okay.

308
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:09,124
(Ok Sparrow is taking the wheel...)

309
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,627
(without prior training.)

310
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:16,397
(Speeding up)

311
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,167
Let's go!

312
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,869
(You're the best!)

313
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,003
That's so cool.

314
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,706
Hold on!

315
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,708
- Let's go!
- Right on!

316
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,779
(Warrior Ok is taking over the Caribbean
with her wild driving.)

317
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:34,013
Your energy is different.

318
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:36,518
Even I can tell that.

319
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,886
You're like a different person.

320
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,186
I didn't know she was this kind of person!

321
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:41,990
And I've been watching her for six weeks!

322
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:44,826
(First time seeing her true self
in six weeks)

323
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,494
You're so cool!

324
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:49,664
You're incredibly cool!

325
00:13:49,665 --> 00:13:51,332
(A thumbs-up from the captain)

326
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,234
This feels awesome!

327
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:56,972
(The refreshing sail
for the heart and the mind is...)

328
00:13:57,983 --> 00:13:59,050
(making them feel the happiest.)

329
00:13:59,075 --> 00:13:59,975
Right on!

330
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:03,679
Off to the ocean we go

331
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,246
You can tell he's genuinely excited.

332
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,683
- Definitely!
- It's so clear.

333
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:08,648
It takes a lot to sing that song.

334
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,490
(The former K-pop singer
with a booming voice is joining.)

335
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:19,995
You look like an old man!

336
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,797
Seriously!

337
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,233
(He can't hide his 70s and 80s vibe.)

338
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,534
Did you see that heart?

339
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,103
- Yes, the beer-induced heart!
- He's like a middle-aged manager.

340
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,205
He's an excited middle-aged manager.

341
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:31,704
The middle-aged manager is here.

342
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,278
(In the zone)

343
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,581
(The newbie is dazzled
by the middle-aged manager.)

344
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,051
(After a long sail full of laughter)

345
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,850
I see a village! Look at that.

346
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,656
- Finally!
- A village, at last!

347
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,626
Is that Mano Juan?

348
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:52,895
Yes, it is.

349
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,370
This is Mano Juan!

350
00:14:54,764 --> 00:14:56,231
- We've arrived.
- Finally.

351
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,733
(Dominican Republic)

352
00:14:57,734 --> 00:14:58,998
It's a village.

353
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,369
Finally!

354
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,104
(The first destination)

355
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:04,407
(Mano Juan)

356
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,338
I can't believe it!

357
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:09,244
(A paradise of nature)

358
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:10,178
It's dazzling.

359
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,746
It takes one hour by boat.

360
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,512
It's truly a hidden paradise.

361
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:18,886
I can't believe how beautiful it is.

362
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,655
(A tiny island village known
as the hidden gem)

363
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,957
Not many tourists come here.

364
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,092
I bet.

365
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,561
(The traditional fishing culture
has been preserved,)

366
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,364
(so the locals live in harmony
with the Caribbean.)

367
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,431
Unbelievable.

368
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:34,402
It's absolutely beautiful!

369
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:37,605
(A place to enjoy nature
in its natural habitat)

370
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,745
(The first journey starts in Mano Juan.)

371
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:43,511
Let's go!

372
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,014
(Getting off the boat after one hour)

373
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,716
It took an hour to get there.

374
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,773
(Everyone is getting off.)

375
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:50,674
It's so nice!

376
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,818
(Watch out, Ok Vin!)

377
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:01,785
Are you okay?

378
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:03,153
(The ocean almost swallowed Aqua Ok Vin.)

379
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:04,922
Watch out!

380
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,056
Oh, gosh!

381
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:08,091
There's a dip here.

382
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,392
Nice, Joon!

383
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,228
There was a cliff under our feet.

384
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:13,797
There's a big dip here!

385
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:14,898
- Is there?
- Yes.

386
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,667
- The water suddenly came up to my waist.
- You scared me!

387
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,135
I almost got sucked into the water!

388
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:22,239
No, Ok Vin!

389
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,773
I got her!

390
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,776
(A rough welcome, only for Ok Vin)

391
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:27,920
She still looks so happy.

392
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,443
Happier than she was in Peru!

393
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:32,015
You'll need to control yourself there.

394
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,483
(Embarrassed)

395
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,918
What a rough place.

396
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,053
I'm all torn apart!

397
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,932
Slapstick comedy is for Daniel, not me!

398
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:44,361
We've made it here!

399
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:47,030
(Entering Mano Juan)

400
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,241
Look at the clouds!

401
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,233
- I'm starving.
- Let's go there.

402
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:51,101
Wait.

403
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,003
First, we must find our house.

404
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,606
We need to find our house
to cook something.

405
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:56,973
- We hadn't eaten anything.
- We had to find our house first.

406
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,143
We hadn't eaten anything until then.

407
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,312
- It's the fourth house in Mano Juan.
- The fourth house.

408
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,448
- The fourth house in Mano Juan.
- Yes, the fourth house.

409
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,950
Why don't we look for a house
with number four on it?

410
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:07,717
Right.

411
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:11,122
Look for house number four in Mano Juan.

412
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,589
- Number four?
- Number four?

413
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:16,059
Does that mean...

414
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,261
every house in Mano Juan is numbered?

415
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,362
I guess so.

416
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,307
- I'm so hungry.
- House number four.

417
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,099
- Number four.
- The fourth house.

418
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,944
But these houses aren't numbered.

419
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:26,536
- Number four?
- How can we find it?

420
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,505
That was the start of our mental meltdown.

421
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:31,875
The palm trees are so short and cute.

422
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,344
Yes, they look so cool.

423
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,544
- It's not scary.
- No.

424
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:35,879
I feel so happy to be so far away.

425
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:38,899
Number 14!

426
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,034
- Number 14!
- Number 14!

427
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:40,935
The houses are numbered!

428
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,795
(Have they found the numbers
on the houses?)

429
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,763
There's a number on it.

430
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,040
Really?

431
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,943
(The numbers are written on the posts!)

432
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,611
- If that's 14...
- We can find it in no time!

433
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,913
That's so easy!

434
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,914
That's the whole village.

435
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:57,151
- If we go straight...
- I'm sure we'll find it soon.

436
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,953
(The houses and stores are marked
with numbers.)

437
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,287
Number 13.

438
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,389
Numbers 17, 14, and 13.

439
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,027
The farther we go this way,

440
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,029
the shabbier the buildings get.

441
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,764
It feels like we're getting farther away
from civilization.

442
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,235
The houses are getting smaller!

443
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:15,369
Whatever.

444
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,738
- There's number six.
- Six.

445
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:20,741
(Getting closer to number four)

446
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,110
- We're almost there.
- Please be a good house!

447
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:24,378
Please!

448
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,446
- Five!
- Please!

449
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,615
Please!

450
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,350
That must be the fourth house, then.

451
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,387
Isn't this house number four?

452
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:33,821
- The next one...
- This one!

453
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,089
This is house number four?

454
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,491
- I knew it! It's number four!
- Is this the fourth house?

455
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,959
Come on!

456
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,628
I'll be really mad
if that's house number four!

457
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,066
There's no house.

458
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,934
- Are we camping?
- I got hopeful!

459
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,938
If this is house number four,
I'll be furious!

460
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,640
- It looks like a heritage site.
- Seriously!

461
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,243
No way. But that's house number five.

462
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:56,410
- Then, this is...
- Number four.

463
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:58,278
- This should be number four, then.
- Yes.

464
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,281
This can't be true.

465
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:02,617
- That's an abandoned building.
- It looks haunted.

466
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,052
- I can't believe it.
- This is going too far!

467
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,587
- It looks like a haunted house.
- It does!

468
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,589
Please!

469
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,391
- Could it be that one?
- Please!

470
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,759
(There has to be a different house!)

471
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,494
Could it be that one?

472
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,730
(Please!)

473
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,000
Four? Four!

474
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,307
(They've found house number four
with a solid red roof.)

475
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:26,573
- Right on!
- Perfect!

476
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,175
- I'm so glad!
- This is perfect!

477
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:30,310
- It looks so clean!
- Perfect!

478
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,012
- I love it.
- Come this way.

479
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,214
Amazing.

480
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,048
(Happily entering the house)

481
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,984
What a perfect home!

482
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,886
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

483
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,623
- There's a kitchen!
- Perfect!

484
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:44,191
It's wonderful.

485
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,193
It's great!

486
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,228
(A clean kitchen and living room
in wood tones)

487
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:49,763
I love it here!

488
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,332
It's perfect.

489
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:55,203
- We even have fans.
- It's amazing.

490
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:57,203
There's an oven!

491
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:58,850
Nam No, we have an oven!

492
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,973
- We have a nice kitchen.
- Oh, my goodness.

493
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,086
Seriously?

494
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:03,821
What a nice place to stay.

495
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:07,292
- They need to get some proper rest.
- They really do.

496
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,760
- They worked so hard.
- The lodging is so nice.

497
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:11,065
What a beautiful place to stay.

498
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,888
(House Four with a red roof,
right on the Caribbean beach)

499
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,932
This place is even better than I expected.

500
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:18,436
- It's so nice. The inside...
- The kitchen is perfect for cooking.

501
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:21,470
(With the Caribbean Sea
in the background,)

502
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:29,137
(a new world of flavors begins.)

503
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:38,190
(A new symphony of Caribbean taste
starts soon.)

504
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:41,396
I learned something about Nam No
on this trip. When he's cooking,

505
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,571
- his eyes change.
- He becomes a different person.

506
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,829
He becomes a totally different person.

507
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:48,957
(They found the house.)

508
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,280
(But it's already lunchtime.)

509
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,370
They need to eat now.

510
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:54,739
I'm really hungry.

511
00:20:56,707 --> 00:20:59,043
I think I've been really hungry
since I woke up at seven.

512
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,373
(Is there anything in the fridge?)

513
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,182
As expected, the fridge is empty.

514
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,651
(Nothing at all?)

515
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:07,852
I'm dying.

516
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:09,103
What should we do?

517
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:11,889
Joon really can't stay hungry.

518
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,618
The biggest problem with Joon is...

519
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,195
that he can't function without carbs.

520
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:18,996
- He completely shuts down.
- And he gets super sensitive?

521
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:20,631
He'd eat anything, even plain sugar.

522
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:21,539
- Really?
- I noticed...

523
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,334
that he couldn't stand up straight
when he was too hungry.

524
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,335
I'm serious.

525
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:25,970
- That's true.
- Really?

526
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,840
I was worried
when I heard he was going there.

527
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,976
I thought, "He can't survive
even a moment of hunger."

528
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,675
(Save Joon from hunger!)

529
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,546
I'm starving.

530
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,132
(They head out to find food.)

531
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,584
(His face looks awful from hunger.)

532
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,123
I don't mind losing sleep.
I'm fine with that.

533
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:47,257
But food?

534
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:49,994
When I'm hungry, I can't even talk.

535
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:51,320
- I have no energy.
- You're right.

536
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,866
I can't go anywhere
or do anything like this.

537
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,185
I think even his lips are turning blue.

538
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,822
(Please let there be a store nearby.)

539
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,672
How much farther...

540
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,208
Wait. Isn't that a store?

541
00:22:04,552 --> 00:22:07,078
- Isn't this a place?
- Is it?

542
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,040
I think it is.

543
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,148
(They finally found a restaurant.)

544
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,490
- They sell food like that too.
- What's this?

545
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,093
It's street food.

546
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:18,956
What is this?

547
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,472
- Oh, it's an empanada.
- I see. Banana!

548
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:23,861
I think that's not it.

549
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:25,301
It's some sort of...

550
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:27,565
- It's Spanish...
- Did he mistake empanada for banana?

551
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:30,501
It's kind of like a fried dumpling.

552
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,467
It looks so good.

553
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,070
(After wrapping up various fillings...)

554
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,741
- It's similar to a dumpling.
- Right.

555
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:42,437
You can find empanadas easily
at Spanish restaurants in Seoul too.

556
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:43,287
It's really good.
Two of them?

557
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,158
(Smelling)

558
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:48,119
This is crazy!

559
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,487
He's losing it.

560
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,222
What is that smell? How is it this good?

561
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,089
(He's about to pass out.)

562
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,694
What's this?

563
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:58,362
What's this? I think it's pasta.

564
00:22:58,362 --> 00:23:00,731
(It's the spaghetti we all know.)

565
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:01,606
I need it.

566
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,035
Gosh. The smell is amazing.

567
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,093
(Has he been starving for days?)

568
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:07,205
How can you look so miserable?

569
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,374
I'm desperate.

570
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:14,129
(Let me bag it for you.)

571
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,960
(They bought empanadas
and some spaghetti without hesitation.)

572
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:20,542
Oh, boy.

573
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,287
The pasta looks like
it's been sitting out for a while.

574
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:28,764
(They rushed back to the lodging.)

575
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,761
- Ok Vin?
- Please come out.

576
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:32,785
Great. Let's eat.

577
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,665
Come on and eat some.

578
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:38,236
Look at the food here. It looks rough.

579
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,638
Look at his face!

580
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:42,901
He's almost...

581
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,344
Ok Vin, it's banana.

582
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:47,860
I mean...

583
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,581
(It's an empanada, not a banana.)

584
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:51,946
I see.

585
00:23:53,813 --> 00:23:55,853
- Thanks for the food. Is it good?
- Geez!

586
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,390
- I'm hungry.
- This is crazy good!

587
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,094
It's the best pasta I've ever had
in my life!

588
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:04,929
Is it that good?

589
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,565
I think hunger messed with his brain.

590
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:08,432
But it's so good!

591
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,903
It's insanely delicious!

592
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:16,071
(He keeps eating...)

593
00:24:16,096 --> 00:24:18,015
(and eating.)

594
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:21,402
Honestly, that's better food
than what he usually gets at home.

595
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:22,780
- That's true.
- Right?

596
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,715
- What does he eat at home?
- Mostly just...

597
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:27,351
instant rice with some kimchi and laver.

598
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:28,286
That's it.

599
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:31,303
Do you know how harsh he is to me?

600
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,362
A few days ago,

601
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,259
he sent me a prison meal plan.

602
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:38,077
- A prison meal plan?
- He said inmates eat better than I do!

603
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,565
- I mean, their meals...
- Why would I eat like that?

604
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,795
But looking at it, I thought,

605
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,668
"It does look better than mine."

606
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:48,209
How good was the pasta, Nam No?

607
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:49,656
I just ate it because I was starving.

608
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,942
What did it taste like?

609
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:53,544
It was a basic tomato sauce one.
Edible, but...

610
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:56,314
I was honestly confused
seeing him praise it so much.

611
00:24:56,647 --> 00:24:58,416
I wouldn't say I was inspired.

612
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:02,183
"How should I cook for someone
with that kind of palate?"

613
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:05,299
If he reacts the same way
to your cooking...

614
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:07,524
That means your dish is
as good as that pasta.

615
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,960
You can't really tell, right?

616
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,028
- It might actually hurt your feelings.
- Of course, it would.

617
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,966
I've made up my mind.

618
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:17,900
I'm going to move Joon with my cooking!

619
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,511
Now I'm really confident
after seeing how much he loved it.

620
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,774
I'm serious. This is the best so far.

621
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:25,189
For real.

622
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:29,531
(He's scraping up every last bit.)

623
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:31,556
He's so easy to impress.

624
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,652
Now that we're done,

625
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,922
we need to decide who's going fishing...

626
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,377
and who's getting other ingredients.

627
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:42,093
They're heading out right away.

628
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,404
- I'll go get some ingredients.
- Right.

629
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,463
- I'll check out what's in the water.
- In the water.

630
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:47,865
- Can you dive with her?
- Of course!

631
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,032
You can trust me.

632
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:50,992
I'll get everything!

633
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,502
(Team Divers: Ok Vin and Joon)

634
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:56,674
Nam No, you should ask around
if there's a grocery store nearby.

635
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:58,155
(Team Grocery: Nam No)

636
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,277
They have a small grocery store.

637
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:04,806
And I heard that they have
something special around here.

638
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,550
- What is it?
- Blue marlins.

639
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,552
- Blue marlins?
- Yes. Blue marlins.

640
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:12,104
Isn't that way too hard to catch?

641
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,557
He's going to catch one?

642
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:16,210
The big ones can weigh
anywhere from 450 to 900kg!

643
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:21,269
(Team Blue Marlins: Mr. Eo Nam Seon)

644
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:24,035
And you're planning to catch that
by yourself?

645
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:25,903
I think I can. Let me give it a shot.

646
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:27,748
- Let's get moving, shall we?
- Good.

647
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:30,111
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

648
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:31,112
I've got a good feeling about this!

649
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,810
- I got excited!
- Me too!

650
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,660
Great.

651
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:35,546
- It's all about the spirit.
- It is.

652
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:40,755
(While Ok Vin gets changed in her room...)

653
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:43,320
What's that?

654
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,424
- What?
- Why is he coming out half-naked?

655
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:48,069
(He's putting on a changing show
on the street.)

656
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:50,995
Look at Joon's back! It looks so cool.

657
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,530
Geez. Look at those muscles.

658
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,867
What?

659
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:58,169
Is this for real?

660
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:01,372
As you can see,
he's got a lot of muscle mass.

661
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,473
Right.

662
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:04,959
(Envious looks)

663
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:06,656
But they're just beach muscles.

664
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:07,624
Right.

665
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:11,716
- He's not that strong.
- It's just between you and me!

666
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:12,805
- That's a secret!
- For photo shoots.

667
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:14,049
Why did you have to spill it?

668
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:16,620
- You're not that strong?
- Honestly, I'm not.

669
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:24,562
I look like a good diver,

670
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,331
but that's only in my head.

671
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:28,576
(In reality, he's just a newbie diver.)

672
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,482
(The newbie proudly shows off
his beach muscles.)

673
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,074
It looks like a commercial.

674
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:41,039
(I'm muscular but not strong.)

675
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,348
(But...)

676
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:45,449
How should I put this?

677
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:48,185
I've shown my upper body on TV a lot.

678
00:27:48,819 --> 00:27:50,636
But this feels like
I'm revealing my lower body!

679
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:53,067
It feels really weird.

680
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:56,861
- Is it ripped here?
- It is.

681
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,964
It feels like I'm not wearing
anything down below.

682
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:01,914
Are you a flasher or something?

683
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:05,736
- Why does he keep showing...
- He needs medical help.

684
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,281
You look like a ballerino.

685
00:28:10,345 --> 00:28:12,042
Let's strike a pose together.
I know.

686
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:14,745
Is this right?

687
00:28:18,286 --> 00:28:20,284
I'm wearing a top, not a bottom.

688
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,754
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

689
00:28:26,257 --> 00:28:28,042
Ok Vin really looks like a pro.

690
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,004
She's got professional gear
and everything.

691
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,128
She's an amazing diver.

692
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,697
Be careful, okay?

693
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:34,999
- Watch out for the coral.
- All right.

694
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,368
I'll go first and board the fishing ship.

695
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:38,469
- Be safe.
- You got this.

696
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,971
Watch out
for the blue marlin's pointy nose.

697
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:44,493
- I'll break it and bring it back!
- That's it!

698
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,976
I'll grab it by the nose!

699
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:47,568
- See you.
- Let's go!

700
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:48,612
- Let's go!
- You got this.

701
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,681
- Let's go too.
- Let's go!

702
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:51,592
- Let's go!
- Go!

703
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:53,517
- You got this, Nam No.
- See you soon.

704
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,696
- Be safe.
- I'll get us about 20 fish.

705
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:56,821
- Twenty?
- Yes.

706
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,490
Don't worry. It's all about the spirit.

707
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:01,292
(Hunting is all about the spirit.)

708
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:03,794
You've spent a lot of time
underwater, right?

709
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,240
Yes, I have.

710
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:08,232
I love scuba diving,
so I've done it a lot.

711
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:11,402
Then you must not be scared at all.

712
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,938
But the ocean is the scariest place.

713
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:15,069
Because it's unpredictable?

714
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:17,208
It's unpredictable
and full of creatures below.

715
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,909
It's really scary.

716
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:22,768
Look at that!

717
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:24,401
That's incredible.

718
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:28,709
(Beneath the deep blue void,)

719
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:31,815
That's crazy!

720
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:34,707
Look at its eyes!

721
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:36,938
It's terrifying!

722
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:38,495
It's intimidating.

723
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,165
- How can they catch any of them?
- Are you serious?

724
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:43,604
(nature hides a treasure trove of food.)

725
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,213
(Mano Juan)

726
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:48,589
(To find the gem-like ingredients
hidden underwater,)

727
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,077
(they've arrived at El Dorado.)

728
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:52,643
The name is literally El Dorado.

729
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:56,579
(To the heart of El Dorado)

730
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:59,579
We need to be aggressive and catch a lot.

731
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:00,865
Sure.

732
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,365
- We only had pasta today.
- Yes.

733
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:07,131
So let's catch a lot for Nam No,
who can cook for us.

734
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,431
If I can't catch some here,

735
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,031
there's no reason for me to be here.

736
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:12,765
I'm not really good at anything
other than this.

737
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:15,065
If I had to dive there,

738
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,331
I could do it as long as I have equipment.

739
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:20,465
You might have to go a little deep.

740
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:23,098
About 25m.

741
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:24,665
- It's 25m?
- It's 25m.

742
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,865
- I can do free diving for that.
- That's really deep.

743
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:28,098
Ok Vin.

744
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:31,665
If it's 25m,
it's like going 7 to 8 stories down.

745
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,565
It can burst your eardrum.

746
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,665
She's a pro diver.

747
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:38,098
(Here comes Ok Vin, the ace diver.)

748
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,698
I'm happy to do anything to help...

749
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,865
since I'm a new member here.

750
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,531
Joon even got a certificate for this.

751
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:48,765
- He practiced a lot.
- Free diving?

752
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,365
- Yes.
- Yes, that's the one.

753
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:52,865
He's full of enthusiasm.

754
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:54,631
(Joon, the passionate diver,
is full of enthusiasm.)

755
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:59,831
(After a 50-minute sail, they've arrived
at El Dorado's treasure trove.)

756
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:04,298
(Getting ready to go with an odd tension)

757
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,698
(I must catch it.)

758
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:09,931
That's so cool.

759
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:17,722
(Ok Vin and Joon will dive
into the Caribbean.)

760
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:19,965
Off you go.

761
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,198
(Joon, the passionate diver,
will dive first.)

762
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,331
Let's do this!

763
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,098
(Here I go.)

764
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:29,031
Let's do this!

765
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:33,065
(Diving in high spirits
without hesitation)

766
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:37,698
(Checking the depth of water
while steadying his breath)

767
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,465
(Ok Vin, the veteran diver,
gets ready to go too.)

768
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:44,431
I'm going in.

769
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:45,565
(Swish)

770
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:47,831
I'm going in.

771
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:51,131
(Diving backward relaxedly)

772
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:55,531
(Where is Joon?)

773
00:31:56,631 --> 00:31:59,465
(After checking where the other one is,)

774
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:04,298
(they move slowly
while getting warmed up.)

775
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:10,098
That's incredible.

776
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:12,731
(Starting their first Tasty Mission
in the Caribbean's golden spot)

777
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,265
(Shall I get started?)

778
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:20,865
(A swift dolphin kick)

779
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,098
- All the way down at once.
- She's holding her breath.

780
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:31,798
(Ok Vin, the ace diver,
has already reached the bottom.)

781
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:39,065
(feeling cozy)

782
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:42,898
Her movements are so light.

783
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:45,798
- She looks comfortable underwater.
- Right. She seems so relaxed.

784
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,098
(Ok Vin is gently flapping underwater.)

785
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,231
It doesn't feel
like she's holding her breath.

786
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:55,298
(Getting her breath back
while looking at the sea leisurely)

787
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:01,531
(But her eyes keep exploring
without a rest.)

788
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:06,431
(Let me look thoroughly this time.)

789
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:10,198
(Charging forward)

790
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,098
She's determined to do it.

791
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:15,265
(Swimming with ease...)

792
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:18,065
(and reaching the surface
of the water again)

793
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:21,731
(Searching through the gaps
between the rocks)

794
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:29,698
(As expected, the space between the rocks
is full of sea creatures.)

795
00:33:33,065 --> 00:33:35,898
(Ok Vin is looking in the gaps.)

796
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,465
(Startled)

797
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:41,098
- It was just there.
- I ran into it on the way.

798
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:42,031
They can bite you.

799
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:43,231
(Something came out from the crack.)

800
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:44,798
I was so frightened.

801
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,765
(Startled, she heads out
of the water quickly.)

802
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:52,531
There's something in there.

803
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:54,765
What is it?

804
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,831
There's something,

805
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,698
but I'm scared because it's so big.

806
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:01,698
It's huge.

807
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:02,865
Of course, she'd be scared.

808
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:05,398
- I've never caught it before.
- Of course.

809
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:10,898
This is crazy.

810
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,565
(Suppressing her fear
and reentering cautiously)

811
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:17,565
(What was that?)

812
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:22,231
(Ok Vin's camera)

813
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:23,965
(This creature that is on full alert...)

814
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:25,398
Gosh. Look at that.

815
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,098
It's not easy to catch.

816
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,165
They must be delicious.

817
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:30,465
They're really good.

818
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,365
- The tail is filled with flesh.
- I know.

819
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:33,731
- It comes from the water.
- In the tail?

820
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:34,731
It's full of it.

821
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:38,631
(You can find this everywhere
in the Caribbean.)

822
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,298
- Look at how big it is.
- They're so fast.

823
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:44,365
How can you catch that?

824
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:47,265
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

825
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,965
(Failing in her first attempt)

826
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,431
Look how fast it is.

827
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:58,098
They're faster than you think.

828
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,465
It's ready for an attack.

829
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,198
My gosh. Look. It's on alert.

830
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:07,065
(Furtively approaching from the back)

831
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:09,365
She's so brave.

832
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:10,465
It's trying to fight her.

833
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:11,865
(Screeching)

834
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:14,565
My goodness. She caught it.

835
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:15,798
Is it trying to escape from you?

836
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,998
- It's really strong.
- She's amazing.

837
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,365
(She captured the crayfish successfully.)

838
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:29,965
It's so scary.

839
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:33,998
She caught it.

840
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,698
She's like a female diver in Jeju.

841
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,031
Wasn't it scary?

842
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:39,198
It really was.

843
00:35:39,198 --> 00:35:42,331
I've never seen this creature in my life,
but I had to grab it.

844
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:47,665
(It's the first one she caught
despite her fears.)

845
00:35:49,498 --> 00:35:52,298
(XXXL size)

846
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:53,198
It's so big.

847
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,731
- Where do I put it?
- Over here.

848
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:00,765
I caught it!

849
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,298
(They acquired crayfish,
the second Tasty Mission ingredient.)

850
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:11,931
She had a really good start.

851
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,498
It's on the map too.

852
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,131
It's already amazing
from their first catch in the Caribbean.

853
00:36:16,731 --> 00:36:21,165
(The first catch she bravely hunted)

854
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:22,398
I can't believe I caught it.

855
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:24,531
Nam No.

856
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:26,131
Su Young.

857
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:27,431
Wait for me.

858
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,698
I'll go and catch another one.

859
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,431
I'll get as many as I can.

860
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:35,265
She's amazing.

861
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,116
(Keeping up the momentum)

862
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:44,038
She seems to be more confident
after catching one.

863
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,331
(Be on your toes, crayfish.)

864
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:48,831
(Going round and round)

865
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:55,765
(Searching for food with a hawk eye)

866
00:36:57,231 --> 00:37:00,698
(Check the location, then dive forward)

867
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:14,265
The gap between the rocks is
a treasure trove.

868
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,231
I can see that.

869
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:17,931
(Hide well, or I might spot your antenna.)

870
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:26,398
(They're hiding awfully well.)

871
00:37:35,265 --> 00:37:38,698
(Stop hiding, guys...)

872
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:41,631
(because I'm coming to get you.)

873
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:50,998
(Between the rocks right next to her,)

874
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:52,331
(here's even bigger one.)

875
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,165
- What?
- What?

876
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:54,331
- Oh, my.
- It's insanely big.

877
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:59,765
(Slowly)

878
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:04,198
(Grabbing its antennae)

879
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,498
- She grabbed it by the antennae.
- So that's how you do it.

880
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,798
(No matter how hard she pulls,)

881
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:14,265
(it's crouching and won't let go.)

882
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,365
You can hold your breath for so long,
by the way.

883
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:18,598
(The standoff is continuing.)

884
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:22,731
(Screeching)

885
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,265
Look at it.

886
00:38:26,298 --> 00:38:27,665
It sounds like an alien or something.

887
00:38:28,798 --> 00:38:29,831
(Holding it down by the nape)

888
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:31,465
That's unbelievable.

889
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,198
Gosh. It's so strong.

890
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,165
It's very strong.

891
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:35,731
(Trying to hang on
and trying to get it out)

892
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,531
It's powerful.

893
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,365
She's like the natural enemy of crayfish.

894
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:48,865
(Getting crayfish twice in a row)

895
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:50,831
It's even bigger.

896
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:55,998
(Returning proudly)

897
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:02,198
(Here comes another one.)

898
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:07,498
(Big one after another big one)

899
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:09,331
What do I do?

900
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:10,765
This spot really is...

901
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:13,065
a treasure trove.

902
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:14,898
That must be why they put...

903
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,231
a treasure box on our map.

904
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:19,831
Seriously.

905
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:22,431
- You can't see it well from above.
- Why not?

906
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:25,631
You'll just see an antenna sticking out...

907
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:26,998
from between the rocks.

908
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,598
Did you catch all the crayfish
that day, Ok Vin?

909
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:34,098
(Remaining silent)

910
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,998
Where are you right now, Joon?

911
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,098
I must've been feeling anxious.

912
00:39:38,098 --> 00:39:41,398
You're getting less air time than Daniel.
Come on.

913
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:44,265
- Seriously. I can't see you.
- What happened to "being the main host?"

914
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,198
How come I can't see you?
Where is the main host?

915
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:47,498
Why are they not showing me?

916
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:50,598
(Meanwhile, in the sea)

917
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:52,031
- Isn't that me?
- No.

918
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:54,298
- Do you wear a women's swimsuit?
- Of course not. It's not me.

919
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,029
(Ok Vin has gotten the hang of it,)

920
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,665
(and she dives back in.)

921
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,267
(Ok Vin's camera)

922
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:11,973
(She thoroughly combs through the rocks.)

923
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:18,981
(Under the rock right below her,)

924
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,050
(she found it.)

925
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,217
This is incredible.

926
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:27,323
(She lowers herself
so that it's easier to catch it...)

927
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,123
(and grabs it by the head.)

928
00:40:29,124 --> 00:40:30,992
She's like one of those female divers
in Jeju.

929
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:32,862
Oh, like that?

930
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,701
She grabbed its head and pulled it.

931
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,671
(Now, she feels relaxed enough
to enjoy the process.)

932
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,509
(She elegantly swims back up
like a mermaid.)

933
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:50,679
(Screaming)

934
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:52,848
I caught it!

935
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,019
(She caught three crayfish in a row.)

936
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:58,754
We now have one crayfish...

937
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,121
per person!

938
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,023
"One crayfish per person."

939
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:04,626
If they're showing us this first,

940
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:07,696
it means the rest of them are
a complete mess.

941
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:09,965
- The rest of them...
- That's not true.

942
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:12,434
- They'll go, "On the other hand..."
- A total mess or completely edited out.

943
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,639
We don't even have footage of Joon
reacting?

944
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,006
(Were there any cameras filming him?)

945
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:21,543
I was doing my part somewhere.

946
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:24,746
- There he is.
- There he is.

947
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:25,780
There are waves,

948
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:28,550
so I can barely inhale before going in.

949
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:33,555
I can't even breathe from the start.

950
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:34,856
(The Caribbean current is
rougher than it seems.)

951
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:39,161
(The spirit wasn't good enough
to go right into the field.)

952
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:42,097
(I want to catch one, though.)

953
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:44,233
(Joon's camera)

954
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,735
(But I've come all this far.)

955
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,271
(He takes a breath...)

956
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:53,208
(and plucks up his courage
before he goes.)

957
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:57,646
(Flailing)

958
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:58,914
His leg movement already looks...

959
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,582
a bit clumsy.

960
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:02,317
He's such a rookie.

961
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:06,588
(He flounders like a rookie...)

962
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,757
(and takes his first dive.)

963
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,458
Look! Watch how cool he is.

964
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,894
- Okay.
- He'll be so cool now.

965
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:13,762
(Let's try catching anything.)

966
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,197
(Joon's camera)

967
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:23,205
(He looks around as he's floundering.)

968
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,075
What's that?

969
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,244
(He spots something.)

970
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:34,016
He's swimming down with some guts.

971
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:35,951
He is. That was pure strength.

972
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:38,253
(He gets as close to it as possible.)

973
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:46,328
(It's pointed, and it looks like a conch.)

974
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,033
He grabbed it!

975
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,902
- Oh, he dropped it.
- Did he drop it?

976
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,671
(He definitely grabbed it.)

977
00:42:58,841 --> 00:42:59,874
Oh, no.

978
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,410
(It slips and goes back down.)

979
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:06,247
He can't go back now.

980
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:07,382
(But he's already out of breath.)

981
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:10,552
(Hurriedly swimming back up)

982
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:15,857
(Don't leave me here.)

983
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:20,963
(He tries to stay calm
and returns to the boat.)

984
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:23,399
I dropped it.

985
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,836
I'm going to go back for it.

986
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:30,272
I'll go back once I catch my breath.

987
00:43:30,606 --> 00:43:32,607
Why is his face so pale?

988
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:40,015
(Meanwhile, Ok Vin stopped
where Joon was.)

989
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,918
(Looking around)

990
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,489
(It must be here somewhere.)

991
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:54,329
She's going in.

992
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:56,531
She's a total diver.

993
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:00,903
- Oh, it's the one he dropped.
- The one he dropped.

994
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,070
(The one that Joon dropped)

995
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,141
It was a gigantic conch.

996
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:08,343
- That would be enough for four people.
- Yes, it was huge.

997
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:10,145
It's as big as her face.

998
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:12,080
She's so relaxed,
even though she's holding her breath.

999
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,181
How does one do that?

1000
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:15,517
- You look like an actual mermaid.
- She's so good.

1001
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:18,286
You see people like her only in aquariums.

1002
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:19,487
(She easily picks it up and swims up.)

1003
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:24,626
That's the one!

1004
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:25,861
- Wait.
- What?

1005
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:27,329
That's the one!

1006
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,463
She got it.

1007
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,765
That's the one!

1008
00:44:29,765 --> 00:44:31,332
(Teary)

1009
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:36,838
Yes, it was this guy.

1010
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:39,174
Look.

1011
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:42,277
(Fortunately,
Ok Vin retrieved his lost conch.)

1012
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:46,615
It's the one
that Joon was trying to catch.

1013
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:50,785
I still remember its taste.
It was so delicious.

1014
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:51,686
- Was it?
- It was tasty.

1015
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,254
- It was seriously good.
- It really was.

1016
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:54,723
It has a fantastic texture.

1017
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:57,993
(They acquired a lambi,
the second Tasty Mission ingredient.)

1018
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,438
- It was upside down, right?
- Yes!

1019
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,101
Just the way you dropped it.

1020
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:07,669
(A near miss)

1021
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,838
- This is good, though.
- Nice.

1022
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,139
- Great job.
- Nice.

1023
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,674
(We finally got the hang of it.)

1024
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:14,643
We're going back in!

1025
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:17,146
(Ok Vin and Joon set out to conquer
the treasure box of ingredients.)

1026
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:18,513
Let's find the treasure.

1027
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,419
(She slowly guides him
as he's new to this.)

1028
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:27,923
- There's one.
- What?

1029
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:30,825
There. Do you see it?

1030
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:33,528
- Do you think you can dive in?
- Yes.

1031
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:37,799
- There we go.
- Okay.

1032
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,967
- Please catch one.
- He did really well.

1033
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:40,869
(He snatches it faster than light...)

1034
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:42,904
He's tired.

1035
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:44,906
(and swims up.)

1036
00:45:47,944 --> 00:45:51,046
(He's become a skilled lambi hunter now.)

1037
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,050
(Even when it's ten meters deep,
he dives in for lambis.)

1038
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:57,286
He catches it right away and brings it up.

1039
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,154
- He knows how to use his body.
- Exactly.

1040
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:04,126
(Confident as ever)

1041
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,931
(Everything he catches is...)

1042
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:11,333
(extra large.)

1043
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:12,200
Oh, I'm out of breath.

1044
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:13,602
I almost missed it.

1045
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:19,407
(In the meantime,
General Ok Vin is looking for crayfish.)

1046
00:46:22,211 --> 00:46:25,680
(One more, and she'll be able
to have one crayfish each.)

1047
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:31,519
(But they're no longer to be seen.)

1048
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,425
(She keeps searching.)

1049
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,128
Word got out between the crayfish.

1050
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:43,099
- They ran away?
- Yes, they're talking about you.

1051
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:44,032
Like, "Watch out for that woman."

1052
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:45,567
- Yes. "That woman..."
- "That woman?"

1053
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:46,968
- "That woman..."
- "Watch out for her."

1054
00:46:47,136 --> 00:46:48,369
"She's hunting us, so watch out."

1055
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:50,272
They're going, "She grabs you
by the head and pulls you out."

1056
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:52,574
"She pulls your head out."

1057
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:54,309
"She grabs you by the head
and pulls you out?"

1058
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,644
(It's Crayfish and Ok Vin's
underwater battle.)

1059
00:46:56,512 --> 00:47:00,114
(Her search for crayfish gets longer.)

1060
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:06,788
(She's starting to get exhausted
due to the long search.)

1061
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:11,393
(She can't even go forward now.)

1062
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:14,796
(For her,)

1063
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:16,698
(Joon goes instead.)

1064
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:17,799
I'm going!

1065
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:19,367
- Look!
- Joon is going.

1066
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:24,172
(He combs through the rocks...)

1067
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:29,110
(to find the hidden crayfish.)

1068
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,512
(He spots a long antenna under a rock.)

1069
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:32,482
Could it be?

1070
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:37,485
(He almost swam past it
without noticing it,)

1071
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:43,158
(but he luckily found the crayfish.)

1072
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:47,162
There you go.

1073
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,530
(Snatching it from behind)

1074
00:47:49,865 --> 00:47:51,566
(Come here.)

1075
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:58,506
(Joon caught the final crayfish...)

1076
00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:01,175
(to make it one crayfish per person.)

1077
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:04,879
(We're proud of you, Joon.)

1078
00:48:06,048 --> 00:48:07,048
- He's done it.
- Well done.

1079
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:08,116
(Covering his mouth
as he's still impressed)

1080
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:11,086
Great job!

1081
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:13,121
You did it!

1082
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:14,789
(Panting)

1083
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:16,457
It's like a movie scene.

1084
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:19,361
(Although he's completely out of breath,)

1085
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,930
(he can't let go of the one thing
that everyone wants.)

1086
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:26,768
Joon made it!

1087
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:28,737
(The passionate man has made it possible
for everyone to have one crayfish.)

1088
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,940
- It's huge.
- It is big.

1089
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,009
(The fourth crayfish)

1090
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:37,813
(Joon's final effort made it possible...)

1091
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:39,147
(for everyone
to have 1 crayfish and 1 lambi.)

1092
00:48:39,815 --> 00:48:42,316
- That's a lot.
- We have so much food.

1093
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,319
I can't believe we caught all these.

1094
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:46,821
(They're excited about today's harvest.)

1095
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:49,158
- How did we catch so many?
- We have so many!

1096
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,191
How come we have so many?

1097
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:51,627
When I'm in the ocean,

1098
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,862
I worry about what I should do
if I come across a great white shark.

1099
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:56,598
But sharks don't attack you first.

1100
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:59,401
But what if they do?

1101
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:01,136
Then, you can shove its nose.

1102
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:02,603
- Its nose?
- Yes.

1103
00:49:02,905 --> 00:49:05,740
(Then, you can shove the shark's nose.)

1104
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:07,342
When you run into a shark,
shove its nose, and...

1105
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:08,978
Are they usually that good-tempered?

1106
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,513
- Because they have...
- Shove its nose, and you lose an arm.

1107
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:14,516
(Shove its nose, and you lose an arm.)

1108
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:16,918
After you push its nose...

1109
00:49:17,853 --> 00:49:19,420
After you push its nose,

1110
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:20,955
- you're like this.
- "Where has it gone?"

1111
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:21,923
Try to push it with the other arm, and...

1112
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,927
- Do you think you can do it?
- They say that you should...

1113
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:27,796
play dead when you run into a bear.

1114
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:30,298
Apparently, you'll find yourself
in the sky when you open your eyes.

1115
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,434
- As soon as it comes...
- Isn't that the same thing?

1116
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:33,668
We'll keep that in mind.

1117
00:49:33,669 --> 00:49:35,148
You should, just in case you.

1118
00:49:35,149 --> 00:49:37,706
(We await anyone who can tell us a story
of surviving after shoving its nose.)

1119
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:41,610
(Meanwhile, Nam No,
who was waiting on the island...)

1120
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,844
Do they have a grocery store here?

1121
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,013
There's a grocery store?

1122
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:46,114
(He's looking everywhere
for a grocery store.)

1123
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,386
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

1124
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,421
Where did that chicken crow?

1125
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,421
Is that my game today?

1126
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:58,475
He's like that jobless guy next door.

1127
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,246
I miss my members. Where are they?

1128
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:05,548
(Trudging)

1129
00:50:05,548 --> 00:50:06,649
When will they be back?

1130
00:50:08,386 --> 00:50:10,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

1131
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,155
- What is that? Coconut?
- It is.

1132
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:15,692
(Coconut is one of the top three crops.)

1133
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:17,193
Coconut water.

1134
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,521
(Do you want to see the inside?)

1135
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:24,691
(His eyes are shining.)

1136
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:25,735
So amazing.

1137
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,505
Keep going.

1138
00:50:29,036 --> 00:50:31,007
He says to keep going.

1139
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:33,176
I didn't know it was done by hand.

1140
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:35,730
(He makes a hole and offers him a sip.)

1141
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:36,742
He lets him try it.

1142
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,189
- Can I try?
- It's coconut water.

1143
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,184
What is it? Is it coconut water?

1144
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:42,285
It's water.

1145
00:50:42,781 --> 00:50:45,238
(He didn't understand,
but he drank it anyway.)

1146
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:49,143
It's amazing.

1147
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,393
That was so good.

1148
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:53,002
It's my first time seeing coconut.
It's so fascinating.

1149
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,765
(The real coconut water amazed him.)

1150
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,300
Gosh, it's delicious.

1151
00:50:57,884 --> 00:50:59,280
- I never tried it like this.
- What's so different?

1152
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:00,590
Well...

1153
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:04,069
It wasn't actually cold,
but it was so refreshing.

1154
00:51:04,093 --> 00:51:05,853
- Usually, it tastes pretty heavy.
- It was good.

1155
00:51:05,878 --> 00:51:07,410
People either love it or hate it.

1156
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,791
My friend, where is a mart?

1157
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:13,983
- A mart?
- That way.

1158
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,410
- "Alli?"
- Yes, that way.

1159
00:51:16,512 --> 00:51:18,421
Do I turn right?

1160
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:19,931
(It seems like there's a mart somewhere.)

1161
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:21,424
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

1162
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:24,093
(He goes toward the direction
he was told to.)

1163
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:25,495
Do they have a mart here?

1164
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:30,953
Hello.

1165
00:51:30,978 --> 00:51:32,269
(He's quite friendly.)

1166
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:34,337
Nam No is pretty sociable.

1167
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:36,906
Doesn't he look like a kid
running his mom's errands?

1168
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:39,899
- That's a great way to put it.
- He's just saying hello.

1169
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:43,406
- I'm on my way to get tofu.
- And it's his first time on that street.

1170
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:45,181
Is there really a mart?

1171
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:47,083
He's so cute.

1172
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:48,818
Nam No is really cute.

1173
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:51,588
- He looks like a cartoon character.
- His face is like an emoji all along.

1174
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,591
It's somewhat lonely.

1175
00:51:54,816 --> 00:51:57,530
(I feel lonely.)

1176
00:51:58,271 --> 00:52:00,563
It looks like he's a resident there.

1177
00:52:00,588 --> 00:52:02,031
He's just adorable.

1178
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:05,201
Can someone make a meme with that?

1179
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:07,737
- He's like a cartoon character.
- Someone, please make emojis with that.

1180
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:09,883
I can use that on a lot of occasions.

1181
00:52:09,883 --> 00:52:11,074
- It's perfect for an emoji.
- It should be called Caribbean Maniac.

1182
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:12,642
"Caribbean Maniac?"

1183
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:13,643
So cute.

1184
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:17,514
(He goes as he's told for now.)

1185
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:20,263
(What?)

1186
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:24,788
(He manages to find a mart.)

1187
00:52:24,788 --> 00:52:25,638
Hello.

1188
00:52:25,663 --> 00:52:27,323
It's a local supermarket.

1189
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:29,325
- Right.
- It's called "colmado."

1190
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:30,823
That looks nice.

1191
00:52:30,823 --> 00:52:33,363
- It's really a small grocery store.
- Yes, it's small.

1192
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,335
(Supplies are brought in
from the mainland twice a week.)

1193
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:36,601
They source goods from the mainland.

1194
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:40,203
Since it's an island,
most of them are canned food.

1195
00:52:40,228 --> 00:52:41,237
That looks good.

1196
00:52:41,377 --> 00:52:42,702
Things that don't rot.

1197
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:44,605
- Because it's hard to store them.
- Right.

1198
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:47,629
- Hello.
- Hello.

1199
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:54,951
(Looking around)

1200
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:57,654
His radar is on.

1201
00:52:57,987 --> 00:53:00,092
"What did Mommy tell me to get?"

1202
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,058
(A giant baby is pondering.)

1203
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:03,518
We need subtitles for that.

1204
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,729
(If they come back with fish...)

1205
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:08,610
I'll make broth first...

1206
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:11,614
and put seafood in...

1207
00:53:12,835 --> 00:53:14,381
to cook spicy fish stew.

1208
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:18,578
(Scanning ingredients for spicy fish stew)

1209
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,382
He needs vegetables. There were none.

1210
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:25,047
There were no onions, no garlic.

1211
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:27,850
Onion and garlic.

1212
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,490
(His eyes change.)

1213
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:31,104
He instantly knows what he needs.

1214
00:53:31,104 --> 00:53:34,724
Yes, he has the whole recipe ready
in his brain.

1215
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:36,159
(Onion and garlic)

1216
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,494
What is this?

1217
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:41,250
- It's pepper.
- Pepper?

1218
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:42,999
(He gets a pepper and a paprika.)

1219
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:44,200
That pepper is huge.

1220
00:53:45,614 --> 00:53:47,059
I need an eggplant.

1221
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:50,050
(Carefully selecting the ingredients)

1222
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:53,176
- I got everything.
- That's a lot.

1223
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,450
I know.

1224
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:56,563
What was this called?

1225
00:53:57,637 --> 00:53:58,487
Mama.

1226
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:00,229
What is this?

1227
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,920
In the Dominican Republic,
we call it "dallota."

1228
00:54:03,945 --> 00:54:05,385
"Dallota."

1229
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,091
(It sounds like she's speaking Korean.)

1230
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,622
It's sour?

1231
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,081
(How is she speaking Korean?)

1232
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:12,245
Do you speak Korean?

1233
00:54:13,473 --> 00:54:15,498
- How does she know Korean?
- She knows Korean?

1234
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:17,631
(She was saying it was food,
but it made sense anyway.)

1235
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:18,634
So...

1236
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,871
I'll make fresh kimchi with that.

1237
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,376
But if we don't get any seafood,

1238
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:28,415
that's just a bunch of veggies.

1239
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,060
(He scans for the ingredients
for when they failed fishing.)

1240
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,684
This one... Hey, it's rice.

1241
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:37,268
(He found rice.)

1242
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:38,143
We need rice.

1243
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:40,690
They only have this kind.

1244
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:43,036
(He gets rice in case there's no seafood.)

1245
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:44,026
Joon...

1246
00:54:44,422 --> 00:54:46,696
I think we need all of it to feed Joon.

1247
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,196
(He even gets noodles.)

1248
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:51,222
These noodles...

1249
00:54:51,477 --> 00:54:52,594
They have instant noodles?

1250
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,005
Oh, I don't know. This should be good.

1251
00:54:56,902 --> 00:55:00,143
If they fail to catch anything at all,

1252
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,577
it'll be a temple meal.

1253
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:02,975
(Preparing temple food)

1254
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,740
Thank you.

1255
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:07,049
Nam No has a heart of a mother.

1256
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,410
He wanted to feed us anyhow.

1257
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:12,259
(Nam No returned from grocery shopping.)

1258
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:18,004
I keep forgetting its name.
What was it called?

1259
00:55:18,004 --> 00:55:19,962
- I wonder how they taste.
- Me too.

1260
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,330
A pepper should be really hot.

1261
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,642
That pepper wasn't as hot as I thought.

1262
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:23,696
Is that right?

1263
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:27,455
(Heading out to the kitchen outside)

1264
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,056
(Happy)

1265
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,881
Shall we set the table?

1266
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:35,922
Nam No, are you back from the market?

1267
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,246
They're back.

1268
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:39,325
(The diving team returns.)

1269
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,294
She looks like a mom who's a fisherman.

1270
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:44,287
"Hey, did you get anything?"

1271
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:47,423
I see you have not much.

1272
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:50,330
(Their hands seem pretty light.)

1273
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,294
What is it?

1274
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:54,388
What's this?
Is this like a local specialty?

1275
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:55,665
I caught it.

1276
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,813
I was too scared to go into the water.

1277
00:55:58,151 --> 00:55:59,969
He couldn't even get into the water.

1278
00:55:59,969 --> 00:56:01,147
Really? Why?

1279
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:03,005
This really stresses me out.

1280
00:56:03,837 --> 00:56:04,687
What happened?

1281
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:08,010
Should we pretend like
we didn't get anything?

1282
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:10,489
- That's brilliant.
- You should...

1283
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,177
(They suddenly plotted a prank.)

1284
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,051
They were acting.

1285
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,676
Let's improvise it as we go.

1286
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,554
(These two actors have great teamwork.)

1287
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,715
Su Young catches on fast,
so he would know,

1288
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:23,059
- but Nam No would be fooled.
- You think so?

1289
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:25,020
- I think he'll fall for it.
- Okay.

1290
00:56:25,225 --> 00:56:26,383
- Let's hide these.
- I can see him.

1291
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:28,411
Put it away somewhere,
and don't look at him.

1292
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:31,891
(The candid camera for Nam No is on.)

1293
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:36,322
(They're acting with all their might.)

1294
00:56:36,322 --> 00:56:37,811
The current was too fast.

1295
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:41,087
The boat just kept on rocking up and down.

1296
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:43,322
- Really?
- When we got there,

1297
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:45,351
we also were swayed along with it.

1298
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:47,817
What should we do?
This is all we get for today.

1299
00:56:47,817 --> 00:56:50,006
I bought some vegetables...

1300
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,455
so I could cook something up.

1301
00:56:52,933 --> 00:56:54,056
It's so frustrating.

1302
00:56:54,654 --> 00:56:55,892
- Seriously.
- Don't worry.

1303
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:58,027
We can rely on Su Young, then.

1304
00:56:58,418 --> 00:56:59,595
He might catch something.

1305
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,843
(The youngest is completely fooled.)

1306
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,465
- He even stammers.
- He's so kind.

1307
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:03,589
- That good boy.
- Right.

1308
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:06,430
- He didn't want to hurt their feelings.
- He was trying so hard.

1309
00:57:06,736 --> 00:57:07,863
He's so kind.

1310
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:10,528
- I couldn't even touch the water.
- Is that so?

1311
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,812
Since I didn't witness it,
it sounds pretty scary.

1312
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:14,801
Why would you do that?

1313
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:18,047
He's really set out to tease him.

1314
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:20,550
- I think I'm no good for this show.
- Oh, come on.

1315
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,414
We need you to enjoy my food later on.

1316
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,686
- He's so nice.
- You got something here.

1317
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,460
- He's such an angel.
- What happened?

1318
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,543
What even am I on this show?

1319
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,059
No.

1320
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,194
I can pull this off.

1321
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:34,260
He's so cool.

1322
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,521
- The equipment?
- Yes, we'll go get it.

1323
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:36,632
I'll be here.

1324
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:38,551
- We'll be back with equipment.
- Okay.

1325
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:44,674
When you walked away,
I'm sure you thought, "We're screwed."

1326
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:46,627
- I did.
- Did you?

1327
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:48,010
I see.

1328
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,035
- That was his first time cooking,
- I get him.

1329
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:52,591
so of course, he'd feel so lost...

1330
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:55,284
when they couldn't get anything
to cook with.

1331
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:57,987
I wasn't mad at them or anything,
but I was annoyed in general.

1332
00:57:58,012 --> 00:57:59,555
- Oh, I get it.
- I had nothing to work with.

1333
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:02,119
- He was annoyed by you guys.
- I wasn't annoyed at them.

1334
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,493
No, I just said I wasn't.

1335
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:06,886
I was upset that we had nothing to cook!

1336
00:58:06,886 --> 00:58:08,998
It'll be edited like you were mad at them.

1337
00:58:08,998 --> 00:58:12,201
I was mad because I couldn't feed them.
You can't set me up like that.

1338
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,003
We just met, but you're pretty rude.

1339
00:58:17,523 --> 00:58:19,286
Being rude is what we do for a living.

1340
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,947
- Please understand that.
- All right.

1341
00:58:20,972 --> 00:58:23,887
- This is how we get paid.
- It's our job.

1342
00:58:24,547 --> 00:58:25,681
Or else they won't pay us.

1343
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:29,937
We can't do anything about it. I'm sorry.

1344
00:58:29,961 --> 00:58:31,020
What is wrong with him?

1345
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:32,686
What is the matter with him?

1346
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:35,254
- Joon.
- What are you doing?

1347
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:36,492
His shoe even came off.

1348
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,151
(It's also their job
to throw physical gags.)

1349
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:39,562
That was hilarious.

1350
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:42,330
- "Being rude was our job" was so funny.
- Gosh, it was so funny.

1351
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:45,067
- They get paid when they are rude.
- It's their job.

1352
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,671
We don't get paid if we're polite.

1353
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,268
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

1354
00:58:49,268 --> 00:58:51,057
- Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1355
00:58:52,186 --> 00:58:53,753
(Nam No, here come our ingredients.)

1356
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:54,922
That's awesome.

1357
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:57,613
- That should make a feast.
- Nam No is approaching.

1358
00:58:57,613 --> 00:58:59,192
- He missed us.
- He's going around the back.

1359
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:00,983
- Should we hide?
- Don't let him see us.

1360
00:59:00,983 --> 00:59:03,136
(This poor thing doesn't know a thing.)

1361
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:04,587
Nam No!

1362
00:59:06,192 --> 00:59:07,243
Nam No!

1363
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:10,412
(Genuine shock)

1364
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:12,739
That's a genuine reaction.

1365
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:14,497
We caught something.

1366
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:15,603
We got all of these.

1367
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:17,933
That's really me. I had no idea.

1368
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:20,086
(A feast of ingredients
that seems too good to be true)

1369
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:22,238
How much would that cost in Korea?

1370
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:23,337
- The crayfish?
- Yes.

1371
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:26,801
A crayfish that big would cost
about 900 dollars.

1372
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:27,947
About 900 dollars?

1373
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:30,480
You were being so nice earlier.

1374
00:59:31,013 --> 00:59:32,748
- I knew he was disappointed.
- But he didn't show.

1375
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:34,819
- He tried so hard.
- Yes.

1376
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:37,523
Well, I had to feed you anyhow.

1377
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:39,606
Do you like it?

1378
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,624
- Isn't this amazing?
- It's big.

1379
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:43,225
- Each of us...
- Look at that conch.

1380
00:59:43,225 --> 00:59:44,958
can have a crayfish for ourselves.

1381
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:47,129
- I think it's still alive.
- This is crazy.

1382
00:59:47,602 --> 00:59:49,682
- That's huge.
- Gosh, look at that size.

1383
00:59:49,707 --> 00:59:51,289
It's so big.

1384
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:54,444
I can't believe you fooled me.

1385
00:59:54,638 --> 00:59:56,526
- Ok Vin caught this one.
- It's huge.

1386
00:59:56,549 --> 00:59:58,316
- He looks so happy.
- Careful.

1387
00:59:58,316 --> 00:59:59,949
It's gigantic.

1388
01:00:00,882 --> 01:00:01,916
It's so big.

1389
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:04,149
It's as big as a person's torso.

1390
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,049
Why does its head...

1391
01:00:07,049 --> 01:00:07,882
Is this...

1392
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:10,449
- Are more recipes coming to your mind?
- It's not that.

1393
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:11,549
It's gotten more complicated.

1394
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,182
I can't afford to cook poorly
now that you brought crayfish.

1395
01:00:14,182 --> 01:00:16,616
- Don't worry!
- No pressure. Do what you want.

1396
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:18,816
- Do whatever you want.
- There's no pressure at all.

1397
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:21,216
I think I should go
back to the grocery store.

1398
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:22,782
Then...

1399
01:00:22,782 --> 01:00:25,216
- No, I'm sure we can enjoy anything.
- No. I've got this.

1400
01:00:25,216 --> 01:00:26,882
- We caught so much.
- I know.

1401
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:29,249
They were talking about spicy fish stew
with lots of vegetables in it earlier.

1402
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:31,649
- No wonder he's flustered...
- Exactly.

1403
01:00:31,649 --> 01:00:32,863
- to see crayfish.
- It changes the whole thing.

1404
01:00:34,249 --> 01:00:35,349
(In the open Caribbean sea at that moment)

1405
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:36,316
Where's Su Young?

1406
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:38,449
I can't wait to watch this.
I'm so curious.

1407
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:41,316
My name is Eo Nam Seon.

1408
01:00:41,316 --> 01:00:42,882
(One man goes into a monologue.)

1409
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:44,474
The Chinese character for "Eo" means fish.

1410
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,249
(Watching the deep-blue Caribbean sea,)

1411
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:52,516
(he brings up the mood.)

1412
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:54,616
(Aquaman in the ocean)

1413
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:57,249
("Eo" for fish, "Nam" for south,
and "Seon" for kind)

1414
01:00:57,249 --> 01:00:58,355
That's a cool name.

1415
01:00:59,316 --> 01:01:00,549
What's Eo Nam Seon, though?

1416
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:03,116
- That's his name.
- My real name is Eo Nam Seon.

1417
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:05,662
- You don't even know his name?
- You didn't know that?

1418
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,749
- What?
- It's his real name.

1419
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:08,416
- It's my real name.
- His name is Eo Nam Seon.

1420
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:10,382
- I guess he didn't know.
- People call him Mr. Eo Nam Seon.

1421
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,782
I thought that meant
"Last mister standing" in Korean.

1422
01:01:13,049 --> 01:01:15,649
- What are you talking about?
- What nonsense is that?

1423
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,116
- His real name is Eo Nam Seon.
- That was new.

1424
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:18,216
He's ridiculous.

1425
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,149
- Su Young is his stage name.
- "Last mister standing?"

1426
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:21,478
That's so funny.

1427
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:23,349
Stop lying.

1428
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,016
But I didn't know his real name either.

1429
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:26,183
It's Eo Nam Seon.

1430
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,649
I thought that was the name of that boat.

1431
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:30,549
- What are you talking about?
- What?

1432
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:31,482
- I'm serious.
- This is wild.

1433
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:33,782
Why would they name a boat
Eo Nam Seon in the Caribbean?

1434
01:01:35,216 --> 01:01:37,682
- Do you think this is the East Sea?
- Exactly.

1435
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:39,963
- He actually didn't know.
- It was true!

1436
01:01:40,716 --> 01:01:42,882
- What are you doing?
- Show me.

1437
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:44,182
- It's Eo Nam Seon!
- After all this time...

1438
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:45,082
Let me see it.

1439
01:01:45,082 --> 01:01:46,416
- It was true!
- After all this time?

1440
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:47,749
- His last name is Eo!
- No way!

1441
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,082
And the Chinese character
for "Eo" means fish.

1442
01:01:49,082 --> 01:01:50,816
- So, what I thought was wrong!
- It's "Eo" for fish.

1443
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:52,416
- Of course.
- Seriously?

1444
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,116
- Good luck, Nam Seon.
- Thank you.

1445
01:01:54,116 --> 01:01:55,649
(Take Two)

1446
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:58,882
(Anyway, this ocean
that Nam Seon is in...)

1447
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:03,016
- "Hemingway?"
- "The Old Man and the Sea."

1448
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:04,716
(This is the backdrop
of "The Old Man and the Sea"...)

1449
01:02:04,716 --> 01:02:09,349
(by the great writer Ernest Hemingway.)

1450
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:12,916
Swordfish?

1451
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:15,816
That's every angler's dream catch.

1452
01:02:17,116 --> 01:02:18,549
- It shoots up like that.
- It springs up.

1453
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,516
- It catches its prey by spearing it.
- Yes.

1454
01:02:21,516 --> 01:02:24,049
(It's got a bill that's like a sharp spear
and brutal aggression.)

1455
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:26,516
- It can swim 80km per hour.
- Right.

1456
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:27,616
- Underwater?
- Underwater.

1457
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:28,816
It can spear through anything.

1458
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:31,516
(This toughest fish to catch
weighs 0.5t when fully grown.)

1459
01:02:31,516 --> 01:02:32,882
When we talk about the Caribbean,

1460
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,082
we always mention Hemingway.

1461
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:36,516
"The Old Man and the Sea."

1462
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:40,549
The lonesome struggle
in "The Old Man and the Sea."

1463
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,049
Are we actually going fishing?

1464
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,461
As a man, I have such a dream.

1465
01:02:44,485 --> 01:02:45,829
(This man has dreamed of this moment.)

1466
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:49,749
(And his fishing guide in the Caribbean)

1467
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:52,182
(Pedro with 25 years
of fishing experience)

1468
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:52,982
Pedro?

1469
01:02:52,982 --> 01:02:54,982
He must be a veteran.

1470
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:58,816
That's right. He's been fishing
for decades in that ocean.

1471
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,716
That's reassuring.

1472
01:03:01,016 --> 01:03:03,549
- Is this bait?
- This is the bait.

1473
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:05,449
(Even the bait is large.)

1474
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,349
- What's the name of this?
- Even the bait is large.

1475
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:09,049
This is Baho-ulo.

1476
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:10,582
- Baho-ulo?
- Baho-ulo?

1477
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,482
- It's a fillet of Baho-ulo.
- A fillet of Baho-ulo.

1478
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:16,749
(They use raw bait to catch swordfish.)

1479
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:18,816
I think it's the belly
of the fish called Baho-ulo.

1480
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:22,249
He sewed the belly...

1481
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:23,749
to make this bait.

1482
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:26,149
That bait itself is a big fish.

1483
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:31,182
(You use big fish to catch bigger fish.)

1484
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,949
I'm going to catch a swordfish,
using Baho-ulo.

1485
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:38,316
Okay. Let's get it started.

1486
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,316
Let's go!

1487
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:42,585
He's faking excitement again.

1488
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:43,982
I need to catch one.

1489
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:46,982
(Getting their fishing rods ready)

1490
01:03:48,016 --> 01:03:49,516
- That's...
- It needs to be strong.

1491
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:51,482
Yes, they weigh 450kg.

1492
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:55,582
- Look at the fishing line.
- That's so thick.

1493
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:58,716
Bait thrown by Mr. Eo Nam Seon.

1494
01:03:58,716 --> 01:03:59,849
(Time to cast bait!)

1495
01:04:00,616 --> 01:04:03,749
Mr. Eo Nam Seon is throwing bait,

1496
01:04:04,149 --> 01:04:07,516
so help him catch a fish,

1497
01:04:07,882 --> 01:04:08,749
Kraken in the Caribbean.

1498
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:10,814
- You shouldn't throw it so slowly.
- Slowly?

1499
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,249
They're fed up with him already.

1500
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,349
The Captain told him to throw it
because he kept talking.

1501
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:17,782
In 1, 2, 3.

1502
01:04:17,782 --> 01:04:19,716
(Casting bait, expecting a big fish)

1503
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:22,316
There's a huge rock attached to it.

1504
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:23,816
It helps the bait go deeper.

1505
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:31,849
(Loud noises come from the fishing rod.)

1506
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:33,416
(Creaking)

1507
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:37,149
- Listen to that noise!
- It must live really deep.

1508
01:04:37,149 --> 01:04:39,316
It's going all the way to the bottom.

1509
01:04:40,282 --> 01:04:41,516
(You can tell how deep it has gone...)

1510
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:46,882
(from the color of the line.)

1511
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:49,182
How deep is this sea?

1512
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:51,749
It's 554m deep.

1513
01:04:52,982 --> 01:04:55,749
(The depth is
almost the height of Lotte World Tower.)

1514
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,816
It's that deep?

1515
01:04:58,749 --> 01:05:00,782
They have to reel in the line
the height of Lotte World Tower?

1516
01:05:02,182 --> 01:05:03,082
With the fishing rod?

1517
01:05:03,549 --> 01:05:06,382
When the rock hits the bottom,
there's our bait.

1518
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,116
So, we'll reel the bait in to lure it.

1519
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:10,349
Then, I'm going to catch it!

1520
01:05:11,216 --> 01:05:12,049
Hit!

1521
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:17,449
- No, I think he's actually excited.
- He's genuinely excited.

1522
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:20,116
- I can tell that he's excited.
- He believes that he'll catch one.

1523
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,149
Okay. I'll do that.

1524
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:25,249
(He takes over the fishing rod.)

1525
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:30,316
(He reels it in with full power
as he's desperate.)

1526
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:33,749
(Working hard from the start
for the fish to bite)

1527
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,382
(Su Young stops all of a sudden?)

1528
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:44,349
It's too tight.

1529
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:45,582
Hold on. It's too tight.

1530
01:05:45,982 --> 01:05:47,149
- It's too tight.
- Wait.

1531
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:48,616
(Something big bit it!)

1532
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:49,679
- Have we caught something?
- Already?

1533
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:52,982
I got it!

1534
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,116
(The first bite gives him
a dopamine rush.)

1535
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,149
Let's go!

1536
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,216
I got it!

1537
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:02,282
(Blessing of fish
comes to those who are diligent.)

1538
01:06:02,282 --> 01:06:03,749
Look at his arms.

1539
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:06,016
It's so pumped up.

1540
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:07,149
It's here!

1541
01:06:07,149 --> 01:06:09,199
I didn't know fishing could look so cool.

1542
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:11,449
- It's so manly.
- It is.

1543
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:13,016
(The fierce battle between man and ocean)

1544
01:06:14,316 --> 01:06:16,382
(Something answers from under the sea?)

1545
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:17,249
What is that?

1546
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,608
Come on!

1547
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,042
(With all his might)

1548
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:24,375
I had been reeling it in nonstop.

1549
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:26,075
I never stopped.

1550
01:06:26,075 --> 01:06:27,408
(The tension continues.)

1551
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:30,208
(The relentless power struggle goes on
without either side backing down.)

1552
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:35,008
(He let go of the rod for a second.)

1553
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,783
(Stop.)

1554
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:38,708
He told him to stop.

1555
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:43,708
(Pedro checks the bait.)

1556
01:06:44,975 --> 01:06:45,875
What?

1557
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,142
(He easily pulls up the line?)

1558
01:06:50,242 --> 01:06:52,208
(The tension is gone already.)

1559
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,508
- It just came up.
- Is it gone?

1560
01:06:56,175 --> 01:06:57,180
I think so.

1561
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:00,015
- It ran away with the bait, didn't it?
- It did.

1562
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,181
- Many of them do.
- That looks too way too exhausting.

1563
01:07:03,648 --> 01:07:05,481
Now, we know that there's fish down there.

1564
01:07:05,881 --> 01:07:07,048
Yes. Right.

1565
01:07:07,248 --> 01:07:08,215
That was so hard.

1566
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:11,248
(He lost the fish and his energy.)

1567
01:07:12,981 --> 01:07:15,448
(On top of that, the sun is sizzling.)

1568
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:18,181
Did you feel how strong it was?
It was very tight.

1569
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:20,348
Yes. I felt that moment.

1570
01:07:22,381 --> 01:07:23,781
- Do you want to try again?
- Yes.

1571
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:26,781
- He's become eager again.
- Right.

1572
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,915
I got motivated
when he told me there was fish.

1573
01:07:28,915 --> 01:07:30,748
(He casts the bait again and waits.)

1574
01:07:30,748 --> 01:07:32,448
I almost caught one.

1575
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:38,815
(He's lost in thought without words
as he's tired.)

1576
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:42,048
(The blue Caribbean reminds him
of one person.)

1577
01:07:42,048 --> 01:07:43,881
That's so picturesque! Look at the sky.

1578
01:07:47,015 --> 01:07:51,648
(What did Hemingway think about
in this ocean 70 years ago?)

1579
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:53,181
He said, "The sea is..."

1580
01:07:55,381 --> 01:07:56,348
"the world,"

1581
01:07:57,548 --> 01:08:00,148
"and the fish is my desire."

1582
01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:06,581
Hemingway had caught
almost 1,000 tuna and swordfish.

1583
01:08:07,948 --> 01:08:12,748
(Is he emptying the desire inside him?)

1584
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:17,148
(Things got busy on the boat
all of a sudden.)

1585
01:08:17,148 --> 01:08:17,981
What's going on?

1586
01:08:19,315 --> 01:08:20,215
What is it?

1587
01:08:20,215 --> 01:08:22,548
(Something bit the bait!)

1588
01:08:22,548 --> 01:08:23,381
It bit.

1589
01:08:25,915 --> 01:08:27,415
Look at how the fishing rod is bending.

1590
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:28,371
It bends that much?

1591
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,281
It's tighter than before.

1592
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:33,543
It took the bait.

1593
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,115
You can tell once it bites the bait.

1594
01:08:36,115 --> 01:08:37,315
You don't even need a bell.

1595
01:08:37,315 --> 01:08:38,948
You can tell easily.

1596
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,248
(He reels it in more carefully
as he's lost one before.)

1597
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:45,148
(It's incredibly tighter than before.)

1598
01:08:47,215 --> 01:08:49,015
(Bringing all his excitement)

1599
01:08:49,015 --> 01:08:50,715
Come on!

1600
01:08:50,715 --> 01:08:52,715
Come on up, swordfish!

1601
01:08:54,835 --> 01:08:56,699
- It's like watching an Olympic Games.
- I know.

1602
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:00,306
- Okay.
- Okay?

1603
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:02,074
He's going to put something on you.

1604
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:03,242
Okay.

1605
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:04,950
(He makes Su Young put something on.)

1606
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,441
- What is he putting on?
- Sit down.

1607
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,511
- What is that? A life vest?
- Out of the way.

1608
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,214
What for? To go in and catch it?

1609
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:12,514
Okay!

1610
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,116
(The chair
that Su Young is sitting on is...)

1611
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,552
(a symbol of big fish hunters,)

1612
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:19,388
(the fighting chair!)

1613
01:09:19,512 --> 01:09:21,467
(An angler sits on it
for a long battle with a big fish)

1614
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,193
It's to actually fight the fish.

1615
01:09:24,194 --> 01:09:25,661
- It's a fighting chair.
- To fight it.

1616
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,229
- Do you have to fight?
- You have to.

1617
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,264
If you just keep reeling it in,
the line will snap.

1618
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:30,599
Even though it's very thick.

1619
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,103
You have to reel it in
while controlling your power.

1620
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:37,940
(Sitting on a fighting chair means
he'll have a 1-on-1 fight with a fish.)

1621
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:38,941
Out of the way.

1622
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,143
Move over, guys.

1623
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,213
(They rush to give Su Young the rod too.)

1624
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:46,282
All right!

1625
01:09:47,117 --> 01:09:49,985
- It's literally a 1-on-1 fight.
- Yes.

1626
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,386
It's a 1-on-1 fight with the fish.

1627
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,089
Yes, I can feel the fish.

1628
01:09:54,092 --> 01:09:55,424
It's so heavy.

1629
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,225
I can't reel it in.

1630
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,396
He doesn't keep reeling it in.

1631
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:01,630
If I do that, the line will snap.

1632
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,099
(It's vital to go back and forth,
winding and unwinding the line.)

1633
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,570
(But Su Young can't even do it properly.)

1634
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,570
Look how tight it is.

1635
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,706
(It is rather pulling Su Young in.)

1636
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,244
(He even put his sunglasses down.)

1637
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:19,982
(But we still can't see it underwater.)

1638
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:24,553
(He tries his utmost,
all the way down to his toes.)

1639
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,488
It's hard just watching it.

1640
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,126
(He's already in a groggy state.)

1641
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,795
(Has he already reached his limit?)

1642
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:36,265
(At that moment)

1643
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:40,335
Nam Seon!

1644
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,404
Yes! Let's go, Nam Seon!

1645
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:45,107
- You can do it, Nam Seon!
- Nam Seon! Yes!

1646
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:46,908
Let's go!

1647
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,544
- Let's go!
- You got this!

1648
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:50,880
(It turns out Pedro was
good at putting on enthusiasm.)

1649
01:10:50,881 --> 01:10:52,014
You can do it, man!

1650
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:55,484
I'm sure it's there.

1651
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:56,920
- A swordfish.
- A big swordfish.

1652
01:10:56,921 --> 01:10:57,753
Really?

1653
01:10:58,955 --> 01:10:59,988
It's amazing.

1654
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,923
I could only do it
because he cheered for me.

1655
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,592
He came to cheer for me
whenever I was struggling.

1656
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,093
You would've given up otherwise.

1657
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,196
(The original Mr. Fake Reaction
hangs in there, thanks to him.)

1658
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:10,599
(But the effects of the cheering
didn't last long.)

1659
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,633
It must be so tiring.

1660
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,369
It really was.

1661
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,402
(Getting his energy back up)

1662
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,304
They poured water on me too.

1663
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:17,573
(A cold shower just when you're tired)

1664
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,075
- Don't stop, strongman.
- All right!

1665
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:20,977
They're cheering him from the sides
like a coach.

1666
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:22,912
- I know. Like a coach.
- Yes, they're encouraging him.

1667
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:24,169
I got energized after a sip.

1668
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:25,614
(He takes a sip of beer too.)

1669
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,284
Come on. Don't give up.

1670
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,719
(More fake enthusiasm by the Dominican)

1671
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,791
(30 minutes into the confrontation)

1672
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,827
(Under the hot Caribbean sun,)

1673
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:42,664
(the big fish fighter is growing weary.)

1674
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,067
(At that moment)

1675
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:46,468
The line changed its color.

1676
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,105
(The line turned black,
which means the fish is near.)

1677
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,975
How much longer do I pull?

1678
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,744
- We're 30m from there.
- It's 30m.

1679
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,582
If the line changes in color,
it means you're almost there.

1680
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,550
(There's only 30m left
until the fish comes up.)

1681
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:02,651
I'm almost there.

1682
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,023
(Loading up on energy again)

1683
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,025
I'm almost there.

1684
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,561
- He's almost there.
- I can feel it.

1685
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:13,929
(He's about to conquer the swordfish.)

1686
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:16,164
It feels different. It's so close.

1687
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:19,335
(The black line is getting reeled in
more and more.)

1688
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,371
(Is it coming into the frame now?)

1689
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,306
- It looks like a shark to me.
- A shark?

1690
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:25,174
Don't you think so?

1691
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,541
You're almost there.

1692
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:28,611
(He reels in the line
by straining all the muscles in his body.)

1693
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:30,312
Come on.

1694
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,648
(He only has a little more to go.)

1695
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:34,750
- You've got this!
- Keep it up!

1696
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:40,055
(He needs to go all out
for his last battle.)

1697
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:46,995
(I will fight to the bitter end
with my name on the line.)

1698
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:48,631
- It's coming up.
- Here I go.

1699
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:59,575
(His hands get busy.)

1700
01:13:03,013 --> 01:13:04,146
- It's coming up.
- Here I go.

1701
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:06,450
(Will Su Young make his dream
of a big catch come true?)

1702
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,350
- Did he really catch it?
- For real?

1703
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,518
It's out.

1704
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:10,619
It's out of the water.

1705
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:11,987
It's there.

1706
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:17,493
(The ingredient expedition gets started.)

1707
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:21,731
(The real hunting begins now.)

1708
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:25,634
(We're going to get it, no matter what.)

1709
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,469
(However,)

1710
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:31,540
(they keep missing their ingredients.)

1711
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,878
(Even the air container runs out of air.)

1712
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:39,482
(What will be the fate
of Ok Vin and Joon?)

1713
01:13:39,507 --> 01:13:42,242
(We still have a trump card up our sleeve,
which is Nam No.)

1714
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:46,222
(Even with super-sized ingredients
that he sees for the first time)

1715
01:13:46,957 --> 01:13:49,959
(Separating it at once)

1716
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:57,333
(Will this be a legendary dish
by Nam No with the Midas touch?)

1717
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,935
(And...)

1718
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:00,135
My gosh. What is that?

1719
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,038
(In the middle of the Caribbean,)

1720
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,640
(they have
a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.)

1721
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,309
This is unbelievable!

1722
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,343
(They meet the legend of the Caribbean...)

1723
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:12,581
(that could only be seen here.)

1724
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:16,284
(What kind of magical things...)

1725
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,419
(await the CARIB BOB expedition?)

1726
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,622
(JUNGLE BOB 2, Caribbean BOB)
