1
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:05,500
(The bright sun of the Caribbean rises
once again.)

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:12,200
(Santo Domingo,
the capital of the Dominican Republic)

3
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:21,166
(Day 3 of the road trip
in the Dominican Republic)

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,900
(Santo Domingo)

5
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:24,966
The weather's nice.

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,966
- It's so sunny.
- This is amazing.

7
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,366
It is.

8
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,100
Perfect weather for a drive.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,966
I'm in my best condition right now.

10
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,066
"Perfect weather for a drive."

11
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,366
(Let's drive by ourselves today,
shall we?)

12
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,600
Wait. Is that our car?

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,566
Look. That looks nice.

14
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,909
- This is it?
- That's pretty good.

15
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,000
- I like it.
- It's nice.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,866
- This is great.
- It's not bad.

17
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,213
Are you sitting in the back?

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,848
Let's hit the road.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,433
- This is great.
- It's a nice truck.

20
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,933
Let's get going.

21
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:53,966
Do you want to sit in the front?

22
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,333
- The road is...
- Sure.

23
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,433
I'll tell him where to go.

24
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,800
(Su Young volunteers to be a human GPS.)

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Wait, the seat's too far back.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,700
- Is it too far?
- I don't know how to adjust it.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,366
- To the front.
- Here it is.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,600
- There we go.
- He's nervous.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,759
Can I trust you?

30
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,700
You bet. Driving is my specialty.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,773
- Is that right?
- Yes.

32
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:18,133
I can leave the bags and take another car.

33
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,533
No, I'm serious.

34
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,848
Just drive for 5 meters.

35
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,800
We'll see how you drive.

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,733
Drive smoothly.

37
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,633
Feel free to take a nap.

38
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,475
(Checking the rearview and side mirrors)

39
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,600
Let's go.

40
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:38,800
You didn't release the parking brake.

41
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,366
You're supposed to release
the parking brake!

42
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,833
- Are you sure we can trust you?
- You're making me worried.

43
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,733
- Gosh.
- It's different in a truck.

44
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:46,666
The parking brake is always here.

45
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,833
He almost broke the car.

46
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,400
Usually, the parking brake
releases automatically.

47
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,966
It's been so long to...

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Joon drives a nice car, so...

49
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,713
- It must be automatic.
- How did you figure that out?

50
00:01:59,738 --> 00:02:00,966
A supercar doesn't need a parking brake?

51
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,833
In a supercar, you start the car,
put it in drive,

52
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,733
- and the parking brake releases.
- I see.

53
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,300
(He's suddenly a supercar owner.)

54
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
When I saw people on TV driving
without releasing the parking brake,

55
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,566
- I used to say, "They're insane!"
- Right.

56
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,834
I was the insane one.

57
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,233
- Let's hit the road!
- That made no sense.

58
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,800
(Will they safely reach
their destination?)

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,866
Wait.

60
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,266
- You need to turn on the GPS.
- You're right.

61
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,500
- We just follow our guts.
- Do we?

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Earth is round, anyway.

63
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,400
That's a huge car.

64
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,400
- That's...
- It is huge.

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,633
It's pretty cool to load up the truck
with all your equipment.

66
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,466
Right.

67
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,933
(He looks up the destination, concerned.)

68
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,241
How many hours does it take?

69
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,766
We'll probably have to drive
for 3 to 4 hours.

70
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:42,066
Really?

71
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,530
We're traversing the country.

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,666
From Mano Juan, which is on the far right
of the Dominican Republic,

73
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,266
to the center, where the capital is,

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,766
and to the west side.

75
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:56,500
So, we're visiting
the entire Dominican Republic.

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,533
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

77
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,680
I wonder what we'll find there.

78
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:01,900
It must feel nice to drive there.

79
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,800
- Yes, the view was awesome.
- Yes.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,100
That's stunning.

81
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,533
(Traversing the Dominican Republic
while enjoying the refreshing view)

82
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,333
That looks like a painting.

83
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,333
I'm hungry.

84
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,900
Do you want some eggs?

85
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,100
Yes, I'm hungry.

86
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,400
I boiled them for about 7 to 8 minutes.

87
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,066
Seven to eight minutes? That was detailed.

88
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,966
You can expect them to be soft-boiled.

89
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,733
- Not fully cooked inside, right?
- No.

90
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,700
- Yes, those soft-boiled eggs.
- It's perfect.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
I succeeded.

92
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,715
- That looks delicious.
- It's soft-boiled.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,766
(Boiled eggs are the best snacks
on a road trip.)

94
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:40,266
- This is incredibly soft.
- Isn't it?

95
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,800
The egg yolk is perfect.

96
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,700
How did he manage to boil those
in the morning?

97
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,266
- He's so considerate.
- He's like a mom.

98
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,166
How long will it take?

99
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,300
We have two and a half hours left.

100
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
- Still a long way to go.
- Two and a half hours.

101
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,733
I have an entertaining Balance Game
for you.

102
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:57,633
What is it?

103
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,566
I'm curious.

104
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,133
You did try.

105
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,533
- I can tell that he's trying.
- He even studied.

106
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,366
- I had to do something.
- Will we watch it again?

107
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,400
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

108
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,784
If you could only eat one food
for the rest of your life,

109
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,019
would you eat kimchi stew
or doenjang stew?

110
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,866
You can never eat the other one
until the day you die.

111
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,558
- You can only pick one.
- I...

112
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,400
- I'm Team Kimchi Stew.
- So am I.

113
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,233
You want that spicy soup.

114
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,466
Really? I'd go with doenjang stew.

115
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,900
Doesn't doenjang stew go well
with grilled meat?

116
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,933
(Or will it be savory doenjang stew
with zucchini and tofu?)

117
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,566
(The toughest dilemma ever)

118
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,677
I love them both.

119
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,433
- But you can only pick one.
- I'm choosing kimchi stew.

120
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:41,548
I'll also pick kimchi stew.

121
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,833
- Nam No?
- I'd go with kimchi stew.

122
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,033
- That's my pick too.
- Yes.

123
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,800
Koreans can't live without kimchi.

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,933
It's the perfect food.

125
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,857
Pork versus beef.

126
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,800
- That has to be pork.
- Pork for me.

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,266
You only need to eat beef once in a while.

128
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,320
Yes, from time to time.

129
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,433
- Pork, since it's for my entire life.
- Pork for me.

130
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,466
- Pork.
- Pork.

131
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,333
We're all the same.

132
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,633
He's not so good at making Balance Games.

133
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,066
All the answers are easy.

134
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,600
I bet you asked them this,
"Acting or cooking?"

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
- Exactly.
- They probably edited it out.

136
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,966
- How did you know?
- He did ask that.

137
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,266
- That was my question.
- He asked Su Young.

138
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,266
Joon asked Su Young.

139
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:21,166
Number 1, acting. Number 2, cooking.

140
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,556
(The questions were too obvious.)

141
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,624
- For the rest of your life.
- That's a tough one.

142
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,866
- It's tough, isn't it?
- I need some time.

143
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,500
Is two hours enough?

144
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,500
What do you think?

145
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,965
(Even the main host was getting bored.)

146
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
- Nam No,
- Yes.

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,033
- if you could only eat...
- Yes.

148
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,500
flour-based foods
for the rest of your life...

149
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,533
or rice-based foods
for the rest of your life,

150
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,366
Flour-based foods. It's a no-brainer.

151
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,766
- Absolutely flour?
- Yes.

152
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:52,033
- Because of ramyeon.
- Ramyeon?

153
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,533
- All I need is ramyeon.
- Really?

154
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:59,200
The happiness that comes from ramyeon
can't be compared to anything else.

155
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,333
Really? That's your absolute favorite?

156
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,366
Ramyeon? Yes.

157
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,666
It's the best food
when you're finishing a meal,

158
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,967
and it can be the meal itself.

159
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,366
Or it can be a snack.

160
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,533
- So, ramyeon is your comfort food.
- Yes.

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,366
I see something down the road.

162
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,847
- I see the ocean!
- Ocean.

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,300
- The color is incredible.
- Look at that color.

164
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,166
It's gorgeous.

165
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,000
(The fantastic horizon unfolds
before their eyes.)

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,100
- That's the sea?
- It's definitely worth the drive.

167
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,900
Their sea has a different color
than what we're used to.

168
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,566
- It's emerald.
- It's precisely emerald.

169
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,494
There are so many marine plants...

170
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,433
as the waves are gentle.

171
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,866
(A mix of beautiful blue hues)

172
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,700
That means there are lots of ingredients.

173
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,466
Ingredients?

174
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,341
I can't believe I'm salivating
looking at the ocean.

175
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,000
- Are you drooling?
- I wonder what tasty treats are there.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,666
(I can't wait to dive in.)

177
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,943
Seriously.

178
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,133
That's beautiful.

179
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,008
(The western Caribbean Sea feels
cozier than the east.)

180
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,018
When would you ever see
the Caribbean in your life?

181
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,133
You must visit the Caribbean
before you die.

182
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,800
Hold on.

183
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,666
- What's wrong?
- Where are we?

184
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,566
- I think we're lost.
- What is this?

185
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,633
It's not the destination on the GPS.

186
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:13,300
- His eyes look tired and hollow.
- His eyes have sunk in.

187
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,033
Are they selling things?

188
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,033
Hello.

189
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,100
(Has he spotted a person?)

190
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,700
Should we get out?

191
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,566
What is this place?

192
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,266
Let's check it out.

193
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,533
They got lost, and...

194
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,766
(Lost after a three-hour drive)

195
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,533
What is this place?

196
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,200
(Su Young sees little stalls.)

197
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,333
What's that?

198
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,433
Is it by the beach?

199
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,833
(The vast, blue Caribbean
stretches out before them.)

200
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,800
What is that?

201
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,466
It's a small town,
so there aren't any large markets.

202
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,100
They sell what they catch.

203
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,066
Right at the beach.

204
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:51,733
Right over there?

205
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,733
- They sell it as soon as they catch it?
- Yes, they do.

206
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,887
- They just carry it like that?
- And people come to buy them.

207
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:58,966
Really?

208
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:01,300
I thought they'd sell
coconut juice and stuff.

209
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,666
- Like tiki bars on the beach.
- Right.

210
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,051
But it's not a tourist area.

211
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,933
It's too small to call it a marketplace.

212
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,333
That looks like a crab.

213
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:12,966
- It's crab.
- What is that?

214
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:13,933
- It's huge.
- That's it.

215
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,800
Are they selling what they catch?

216
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,700
That's so big.

217
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:21,133
(Getting lost was a blessing in disguise.)

218
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:22,933
What is this?

219
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,000
(Drawn to the shiny seafood)

220
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:27,366
They're crayfish and king crab.

221
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,566
I've never seen anything like it.

222
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,200
How come the knuckles are so big?

223
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,933
- I know, right?
- The legs are so thick.

224
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,133
- It must be so plump.
- And there are so many of them.

225
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,733
Where did they catch it?

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,985
In the sea right out front.

227
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,833
Right here?

228
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,300
(Yes, here.)

229
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,066
They caught them right here.

230
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,733
- Seriously?
- Yes.

231
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,133
That's gigantic.

232
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:49,933
Look at that.

233
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,900
It's scary!

234
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,366
That's an alien.

235
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,467
That's impressive.

236
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:56,833
It's literally king crab.

237
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,066
(The most delicious ingredient
in this area)

238
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:00,066
(The Caribbean king crab inhabits
depths of up to 200m.)

239
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,700
The Caribbean king crab?

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,612
They inhabit depths of 200m?

241
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,900
That's so big.

242
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,166
That's amazing.

243
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:18,433
(They've come
to the best place for king crab.)

244
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,833
That's also...

245
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,833
That scares me.

246
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,463
- Is it alive?
- This one looks nice.

247
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,700
This is huge.

248
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,566
- It's the biggest one.
- I'm so...

249
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:29,869
This is as big as my head.

250
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:31,900
It's so large.

251
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,533
No!

252
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,033
Hey, now.

253
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,400
- How did they catch it?
- Calm down.

254
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,500
Lift it.

255
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,100
How on earth did they catch that?

256
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,966
It's so strong.

257
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,166
- Is it?
- Yes.

258
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,033
(Just its body is as large
as Nam No's belly.)

259
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,333
That's so big!

260
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,000
Look at those claws.

261
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,033
Even a claw will be enough
to make you full.

262
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,566
Their claws are as big as human hands.

263
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:52,625
- They are.
- I know, right?

264
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,195
You'll be surprised. It's so strong.

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,166
It's strong. Be careful.

266
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,731
- Oh, I can lift it like this?
- Look at you.

267
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,910
- It's so scary!
- It's foaming at the mouth.

268
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,569
It's blowing froth.

269
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,638
- Should we buy some?
- Should we?

270
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,974
- How much do we need?
- Choose the big ones.

271
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,243
- One crab per person.
- The big ones.

272
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,511
- That's amazing.
- Do you think you can prep it, though?

273
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,445
- This?
- Yes.

274
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,580
This is easier than crayfish.

275
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,515
Really?

276
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,984
- There are eggs under it.
- It's filled with eggs.

277
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,687
- It's eggs.
- It must be delicious.

278
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,656
- They're my favorite, actually.
- Really?

279
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,290
You can grill it or steam it.

280
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,658
It's my comfort food.

281
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,759
- Crab eggs?
- Yes.

282
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,295
I love crabs.

283
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,230
Five kilos? Let's measure it.

284
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:36,268
(Let me weigh it before we buy it.)

285
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,970
Crabs taste better when they're bigger.

286
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,405
The bigger ones are tastier?

287
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,508
- That must be really expensive.
- I know, right?

288
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,078
- It's 5.5 kilos.
- That's heavy.

289
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,148
It's 20 dollars. No, 25 dollars.

290
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:51,684
- That's 25 dollars?
- Yes.

291
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,185
Let's weigh each one.

292
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,053
No way.

293
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,688
(The big crab costs only 25 dollars!)

294
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,256
It costs about 5 to 6 dollars per kilo.

295
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,626
- For one kilo.
- How much would that cost in Korea?

296
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:05,597
When prices are really high,
it can be as high as 150 dollars per kilo.

297
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,365
If you had 2 kilos, it'd be 300 dollars.

298
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,434
Over 300 dollars.

299
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,635
- But how much is it for a kilo there?
- It weighed five kilos.

300
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,471
It's about 5 to 6 dollars per kilo.

301
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,906
That's the price of crab sticks.

302
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,674
- You're right.
- You know?

303
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,876
That's awesome.

304
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,479
It costs as much as artificial crab meat.

305
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:20,913
As much as artificial crab meat.

306
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,081
- Crab sticks.
- No way.

307
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,882
You can get it
for the price of crab sticks.

308
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,319
You can buy a king crab
for the price of a crab stick.

309
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,488
That's so cheap.
How can that be for 20 dollars?

310
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,923
It's so cheap. It won't cost much,
even with all these crabs.

311
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,459
Bring some more crabs.

312
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,261
We bought so much. We got a bunch of them.

313
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,629
- Of course, you should.
- It's huge.

314
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,165
Aren't you excited to think
that we'll be eating this?

315
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,434
I'm really looking forward to it.

316
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:43,735
Amazing.

317
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,203
- That's such a low price.
- I'm excited.

318
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,774
- I know.
- Why is it so cheap?

319
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,041
I guess they're common here.

320
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,743
(Please enjoy.)

321
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,446
They're getting off work.
He seems light-hearted.

322
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,781
- He's closed for the day.
- Yes.

323
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,252
Oh, my. Look over here.

324
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,255
(The Caribbean looks dazzling
next to the fish market.)

325
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,657
It's stunning.

326
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:06,925
It's marvelous.

327
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,862
It's cool to see the white foam
washing up on shore.

328
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,399
I haven't seen foam break on the shore
like that in a long time.

329
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,236
- Look at the color.
- This is unbelievable.

330
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,637
It's like a painting.

331
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,538
I loved it.

332
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,141
It's like the wallpaper on your PC.

333
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,777
We can get a good view from here.

334
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,779
The ocean looks amazing.

335
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,114
(They walk to a scenic spot
while looking around.)

336
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,984
- It's gorgeous.
- So amazing.

337
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:37,623
(How can it be so mesmerizing?)

338
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,858
It looks amazing from here.

339
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,993
- It's unbelievable.
- It's crazy.

340
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,662
- We loved it there, didn't we?
- Yes.

341
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,765
- It was great.
- It looks like paradise.

342
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,935
(San Rafael)

343
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,070
Look at the color of the water.

344
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,807
The waves drive you crazy.

345
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,676
(The wildness of the real Caribbean)

346
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,913
Are they going fishing on that boat?

347
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,883
Did their ship get wrecked?

348
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,584
They're amazing.

349
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,953
That's wild!

350
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,024
Are they going to say, "Help me?"

351
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,902
It's like they're out there
risking their lives.

352
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,561
The waves are so strong.

353
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,494
Seriously.

354
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,798
(A huge pantry on the ocean floor,
full of valuable ingredients)

355
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,565
Is that a shark?

356
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,167
- Yes.
- Really?

357
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,769
They're hiding in there.

358
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,372
It's a paradise of ingredients.

359
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,773
(It's abundant
not just under the water...)

360
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,210
That's why they say
this is where the real Caribbean is.

361
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,278
- Right. That's the real deal.
- The real Caribbean.

362
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,850
(but full of tropical fruits
and Caribbean vegetables too.)

363
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,717
Cacao.

364
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,357
I loved everything there,
but it was especially unforgettable.

365
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,894
(Welcome to San Rafael.)

366
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,362
The ocean looks stunning.

367
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,930
It's unbelievable.

368
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,136
(And a must-visit place
for those who come to San Rafael Beach)

369
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,238
- There's so much here.
- That's a lot of ingredients.

370
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,672
San Rafael.

371
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:01,974
It's a blue house.

372
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,308
(A blue house on San Rafael Beach)

373
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,243
Okay.

374
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,579
This is San Rafael Beach?

375
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,746
This is...

376
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,750
(They've arrived on San Rafael Beach,
in search of a blue house.)

377
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,885
- San Rafael Beach.
- San Rafael.

378
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,389
This place is like paradise.

379
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,991
It's like paradise.

380
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,130
(Here we are, at last.)

381
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,799
It's so refreshing.

382
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,269
(The wild Caribbean,
where they will stay for two days)

383
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,140
The ocean looks gorgeous.

384
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,942
- Tell me about it.
- It's stunning.

385
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,244
It's...

386
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,347
- milky white and emerald.
- I love it.

387
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,582
A deep blue.

388
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,083
I love it here.

389
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,921
(Rough waves...)

390
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,891
- The ocean has layers.
- It's mysterious. It does.

391
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,025
It's so dreamy.

392
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,161
The colors are definitely beautiful.

393
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,466
(He's stoked.)

394
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,201
(I can't resist this beautiful color.)

395
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,569
My goodness.

396
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,707
(Abruptly making a U-turn)

397
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,242
(Running away
without even dipping his toes)

398
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,778
- The waves are rough.
- I can't go in there.

399
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,982
I've just realized
that the waves are so high.

400
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,517
(The waves are as big as houses!)

401
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,818
(Even the locals run away.)

402
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,154
Why are the waves so big?

403
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,789
- No.
- No way.

404
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,224
There's no way I'm going in there.

405
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,328
(Just then, a man walks
toward the rough waves.)

406
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,196
I can't do it.

407
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:33,642
(Taking off the shoes?)

408
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,367
Su Young is taking his shoes off.

409
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,637
Are you really going in?

410
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,072
I'm going to soak my feet.

411
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,874
- You are?
- Of course.

412
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,742
The ocean looks too pretty to pass up.

413
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,444
But I'm so scared.

414
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,816
(We should get a taste of the ocean
since we're here.)

415
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,017
It's so cool.

416
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,953
The water isn't too cold.

417
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,523
(Entering reluctantly)

418
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,690
It's so nice here.

419
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,291
I love it.

420
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:00,414
(Scared)

421
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,930
(Here comes a big one.)

422
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,137
(Getting drenched in the ocean
in an instant)

423
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,805
My underwear got soaked. What do I do?

424
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,407
(Here comes another one.)

425
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,977
(Taking a lesson from the rough sea)

426
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,845
This isn't right.

427
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,179
I must be dreaming.

428
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,115
My underwear got soaked.

429
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,189
(Despite the problem with his underwear,)

430
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,194
(the BOB friends are feeling
like children again.)

431
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,229
I'm all wet.

432
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,802
- Seriously.
- What's that?

433
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,371
Who are they?

434
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,742
(Behind the BOB friends,
who are having a blast)

435
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,348
That seems to be the blue house
that was on the map.

436
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,282
Right.

437
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:03,922
(A man is watching the BOB friends.)

438
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,594
I can see some people over there.

439
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,862
There are some people over there.

440
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,798
Who could it be?

441
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,532
(They head for the blue house
in front of them.)

442
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,869
(Is this the place?)

443
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,537
- Hello.
- Hello.

444
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

445
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,742
- Hello.
- Hello.

446
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,111
- Hello.
- Hello.

447
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,715
Are you the owner of this blue house?

448
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,050
(You've come to the right place.)

449
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:32,951
- Is this it?
- Yes.

450
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,923
(Located on the shores
of the San Rafael Beach...)

451
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,890
A blue house.

452
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,091
(is a blue house.)

453
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,662
(The destination on the map)

454
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,897
This must be it.

455
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,333
(Successfully finding the blue house)

456
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,170
You must be Reiling.

457
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,642
(You're in the right place.)

458
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,713
How was your trip here?

459
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,148
It was great.

460
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,317
How do you like the beach?

461
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,619
- It's great.
- Okay.

462
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,257
(I'm glad to hear that.)

463
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:16,194
This is our first time in San Rafael.

464
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,198
We don't have a house or a kitchen,

465
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:24,436
so we need a kitchen and a place to sleep.

466
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,004
(Gesturing they need a kitchen
and a place to sleep)

467
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,741
I can help you with everything.

468
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,812
Can we stay at your house?

469
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,647
(How could he say yes so willingly?)

470
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,750
He's the guy who knows everything
about the area.

471
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,853
He's like the handyman of this village.

472
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,055
- That's why.
- Yes.

473
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,458
Reiling.

474
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,360
(Reiling,
the youth president of San Rafael)

475
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:53,498
(Every ingredient we find...)

476
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,670
(comes through Reiling,
the youth president.)

477
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,939
He's the go-to guy in this area.

478
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,877
(Where Reiling takes them...)

479
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,050
(there are always ingredients,
even though it's challenging.)

480
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,985
- What?
- What's that?

481
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,454
(Take this!)

482
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,791
(Sometimes, they get playful together.)

483
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,927
(He'll show them the real Caribbean
as the locals know it.)

484
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,562
(An expert guide,)

485
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,832
(the Reiling family)

486
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,836
Welcome to San Rafael.

487
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,505
He has the looks of a youth president.

488
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,043
- A people person.
- The type who can mingle with anyone.

489
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,387
He looks young but seems reliable,
like an older brother.

490
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,146
- He looks reliable.
- Yes.

491
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,282
(Looking reliable)

492
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,484
You're very friendly.

493
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,520
(Thank you)

494
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:49,955
Joon is hungry.

495
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,258
He's hungry and low on sugar.

496
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,227
- Are you hungry? Okay.
- We're ravenous.

497
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,530
(I'm hungry.)

498
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,196
Let's head to the kitchen first.

499
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:02,478
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

500
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,303
Okay!

501
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,354
Let's go.

502
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:07,973
- He's so nice.
- Yes.

503
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:09,875
- He's very kind.
- Okay!

504
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,714
(Reiling's mom)

505
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:13,696
Say hello, Mom!

506
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,031
Okay!

507
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,582
Hello, Reiling's mom!

508
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,818
(Excuse us, ma'am.)

509
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,522
- She's Elisa.
- Your mom!

510
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,757
Nice to meet you!

511
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,826
She was so kind too.

512
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:31,064
She'll help you cook today.

513
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,499
There's the fire.

514
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,801
What's that?

515
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,536
(A fire pit in the kitchen)

516
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,404
A fire pit!

517
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,374
There's no gas. They use wood.

518
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,944
That's the real deal.

519
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,346
No way!

520
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,616
I love the vibe.

521
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,886
I've never seen a better kitchen.

522
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,087
It's incredible!

523
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,491
- My gosh.
- Imagine turning back while cooking.

524
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,630
(When you turn around
while cooking by the real fire)

525
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,832
The ocean view is unbelievable.

526
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,201
(The kitchen has a dreamy ocean view.)

527
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,570
That's unbelievable! How is it real?

528
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,674
It's so romantic.

529
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,875
- For sure!
- As romantic as it gets.

530
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,077
- I'm in awe.
- I can't believe it.

531
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,845
That's incredible!

532
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,864
- It was incredibly romantic.
- That's insane!

533
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:28,388
We want to cook here.

534
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,293
I'll cook some delicious Dominican food
for you guys.

535
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,495
(She wants to cook for us?)

536
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,366
We'd like to help you cook, then.

537
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,336
You can't be the chef
when the food is for you.

538
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,304
(Can we do anything to help you?)

539
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,906
No, it's really okay.

540
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,809
- Even when we offer help...
- She wants us to rest, right?

541
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:50,843
Yes, she does.

542
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:55,748
Enjoy your time and the beach.

543
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,252
(But it'll be a lot to cook alone.)

544
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,656
How can we tell them
we'd like to make dinner for them?

545
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,960
We will prepare dinner for you guys.

546
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,328
- Okay.
- Okay?

547
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,663
- Okay!
- Okay.

548
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:11,746
Thank you.

549
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,799
Lunch and dinner.

550
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,835
- Dinner, okay?
- Yes.

551
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,770
(Making a deal with the mom)

552
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:20,239
(They must be tired from the long trip.)

553
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:22,518
- I wonder what she'll serve you.
- Same.

554
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,134
(Mom's Dominican home food)

555
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,797
I've never seen
what Dominicans eat at home.

556
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:28,881
- Never.
- For sure.

557
00:22:30,534 --> 00:22:32,721
- What's that?
- What is that?

558
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,321
- What?
- What are those?

559
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,889
- She's deep-frying something.
- You all know it.

560
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:37,823
- Bananas?
- Bananas?

561
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,155
No, not bananas.

562
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,393
- What are they?
- Plantains.

563
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,896
They're different from bananas.
They're longer and green.

564
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:50,596
(They look like bananas
but are less sweet and more starchy.)

565
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,506
- I thought they were just unripe.
- Me too.

566
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,775
- Unripe...
- I thought they were unripe bananas.

567
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:59,378
Koreans only eat one type of banana.

568
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,155
- Yes.
- But there are so many other kinds.

569
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,281
- Really?
- Yes.

570
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:07,492
(The first homemade dish)

571
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:08,367
Tostones!

572
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:09,996
(Tostones)

573
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,090
(Plantains are roughly chopped...)

574
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:16,385
(and fried once.)

575
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,131
(Then, they're flattened...)

576
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:26,209
(to be fried again.)

577
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:28,064
(That gives you tostones...)

578
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:30,733
(that are crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.)

579
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:33,145
Don't they taste like banana chips, then?

580
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,110
- I know!
- Banana chips.

581
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,447
They look like they would,

582
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,049
- but they're not sweet.
- They're not sweet.

583
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,521
Are they not sweet?

584
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:40,286
They're like unsweetened bananas.

585
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,756
You can keep eating them, like rice,
as the flavors are subtle.

586
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,175
(The first homemade dish is ready.)

587
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,184
(It's time for the main!)

588
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,963
- What is it?
- What is it?

589
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,718
(What's the main dish
for the Dominican homemade meal?)

590
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:54,152
What is it?

591
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,761
(Locrio de jaiba)

592
00:23:58,761 --> 00:23:59,638
Look at that!

593
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,342
(The main ingredient is
Caribbean king crab.)

594
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,192
That's unbelievable.

595
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:10,413
(Adding heaps
of colorful Caribbean vegetables)

596
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,615
(Tomato, potato, carrot, and celery)

597
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,612
(Adding the king crab broth)

598
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:18,407
(Some curry)

599
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:19,725
That's curry!

600
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:22,905
(Adding heaps of rice)

601
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:27,089
(And tons of king crabs!)

602
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,535
(Boil it over fire.)

603
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,470
It's like Korean pot rice.

604
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,638
- Yes.
- They're similar.

605
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,739
It's like pot rice.

606
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,718
(Full of crab flavors)

607
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,509
- You can taste the crab.
- That looks so good!

608
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:40,409
(The Caribbean-style king crab pot rice
is ready.)

609
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,915
- That looks scrumptious!
- It looks so good! I'm so intrigued!

610
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:45,515
(Topping it off
with extra-large crab shells)

611
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:47,186
- Crab pot rice.
- Crab pot rice.

612
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:49,555
You can't get that anywhere,
not even with loads of money.

613
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,857
That looks so good!

614
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,829
(Meanwhile, the guys are relaxing
by the beach.)

615
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,530
Anything would taste good with this view.

616
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:01,767
- It's already delicious.
- That's true.

617
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,969
I'm... Wait! It's coming!

618
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:06,872
- Is she already done?
- Is the food already ready?

619
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,008
Thank you!

620
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,780
(No way!)

621
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,630
What?

622
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,317
(A Dominican traditional dish)

623
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,281
That's amazing!

624
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:20,119
This looks scrumptious.

625
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,977
The claws!

626
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,500
- They're huge!
- They're terrifying.

627
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:30,529
We spent the whole trip
cooking for ourselves,

628
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,564
so this feels like a treat.

629
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,390
- Isn't it our first time?
- I think so!

630
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,402
It feels odd.

631
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,407
(Enjoy your food!)

632
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,739
How should we eat this?
How do we break the shells?

633
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,084
(How will Reiling's mom's
king crabs taste?)

634
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:45,895
(King crabs taste better...)

635
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:48,097
(when you smash the shells.)

636
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:50,582
Like that?

637
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,752
(Under the smashed shells)

638
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:57,082
- No way!
- That's crazy!

639
00:25:58,414 --> 00:25:59,792
Dig in to get the meat.

640
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:02,027
- Thank you so much!
- So sweet.

641
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:04,229
- Very sweet.
- Look at the claw.

642
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,494
(Taking a big bite)

643
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:10,002
It's so good! I can't believe it!

644
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,923
(Getting a big chunk of meat)

645
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,774
He's taking care of everyone.

646
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:18,848
(It melts in my mouth!)

647
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:20,179
- It's so good!
- Isn't it?

648
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,147
It's unbelievably good.

649
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,317
- It's crab stick.
- Crab stick!

650
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,019
- The real deal.
- You're right!

651
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:28,887
The meat!

652
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:30,292
(Tasting a mouthful of crab meat)

653
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:32,792
How is it?

654
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,605
(It's so good that I might cry.)

655
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:37,641
Look at that face!

656
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:40,049
How do you make such a face?

657
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,971
Is it that different
from the king crabs we eat?

658
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:43,235
How should I put it?

659
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,837
It's sweeter...

660
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,573
and slightly saltier.

661
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,009
- It's salty and super flavorful.
- Right?

662
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:53,979
(Sweet and salty crab meat
packed with flavors)

663
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:57,316
It'd be perfect in a stew
for its savory flavor.

664
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,251
You wouldn't need any other seasonings.

665
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:02,287
You don't even need to season it.

666
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,019
I want to know how that tastes.

667
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:06,492
It didn't taste seasoned.
The flavors were subtle.

668
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,862
What's this?

669
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,212
What?

670
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:15,701
- Is it a crab shell stuffed with rice?
- It has rice in it!

671
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,803
- The shell is filled with rice! Look!
- What?

672
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,539
- That's the best!
- Every country loves...

673
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,941
- rice in crab shells.
- Rice in crab shells.

674
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:27,443
(Such a salivating view)

675
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:29,448
I want to devour that!

676
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:34,210
(Making funny sounds)

677
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,221
He was starving.

678
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,724
(Groaning)

679
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,592
- It's so good!
- He groans when he's hungry.

680
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,627
I know!

681
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,416
It's incredible.

682
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,831
It's so good.

683
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:47,466
(Groaning)

684
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,391
He refused chocolate in the car...

685
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,236
- and waited for better food here.
- I get that.

686
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,609
He could've enjoyed both.

687
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,232
(What a genius.)

688
00:27:56,232 --> 00:27:57,643
This is king crab.

689
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:58,968
(Groaning)

690
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,512
The flavors are packed.

691
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:01,933
It's incredible.

692
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,703
(Getting every grain of rice on the shell)

693
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,909
(Collecting every last grain)

694
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:13,309
(Cleaning the plate)

695
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:16,726
(He's definitely enjoying the food.)

696
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,466
(Eating)

697
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,334
(Eating more)

698
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,184
It's perfect.

699
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,905
(Getting a refill)

700
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,040
I can't stop myself!

701
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,111
He's getting away
from the handsome man character.

702
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,551
(No longer hungry after the crab rice)

703
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,183
He looks so much more alive now!
That's so cool.

704
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,915
(Fascinated)

705
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,223
They seem to eat this often.
It tastes uncooked, right?

706
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:46,959
- It's better when cooked more.
- What is it?

707
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:49,361
They make pancakes...

708
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:54,132
with bananas,
like we do with potatoes and eggplants.

709
00:28:54,503 --> 00:28:56,965
- These are like pancakes to them.
- Are they?

710
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,303
They've been deep-fried.

711
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,207
They make pancakes out of bananas.

712
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:04,843
They're deep-fried
but are basically pancakes.

713
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,412
(Tostones, a homemade dish
with subtle savory flavors)

714
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:08,973
I really wonder what that tastes like.

715
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:12,101
That reminds me
of sugar-coated sweet potatoes.

716
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:13,368
- Same!
- Are they different?

717
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,703
- Completely.
- They're not sweet at all.

718
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:15,988
They're not like bananas.

719
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,978
They're crispy on the outside
as they're deep-fried,

720
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:21,650
but the texture inside is
like that of a potato.

721
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:23,895
They're like potatoes to Koreans.

722
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,297
They're fluffy.

723
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,959
We love the food! It's delicious!

724
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,971
- Thank you! Really good!
- Really good!

725
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,172
Delicious!

726
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:38,427
(Thank you for enjoying it.)

727
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,246
- I'm stuffed now.
- Same here.

728
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:42,808
(After the meal cooked with love)

729
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,716
- Nam No!
- Yes!

730
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,419
We must create some recipes
using what we have now.

731
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,454
What should we make?

732
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:50,889
We need to get the ingredients.

733
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:52,991
You have to prepare the dinner
right after lunch.

734
00:29:53,562 --> 00:29:55,744
(What should we cook for dinner?)

735
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,782
(All we have are crabs.)

736
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,233
Some fruits grow in the garden
on the mountain.

737
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,933
Mountain?

738
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,100
We've got coffee
and fruits that grow in our gardens.

739
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,500
- They're very delicious. Tropical fruits.
- Tropical?

740
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,133
They have tropical fruits
on the mountain behind us,

741
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:15,633
and there are also regular fruits.

742
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:16,500
On the mountain.

743
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,633
Banana plants, avocado plants...

744
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,366
You can taste all the fruits we have.

745
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,833
- Really?
- Can we...

746
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,700
- pick them too?
- Do we get to pick them?

747
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,500
- Is that allowed?
- Can we pick them too?

748
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,466
Of course.

749
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:32,500
Really?

750
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,233
Why don't we go
and get some ingredients for ourselves?

751
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,566
- Yes, he says there are lots of fruits.
- Some fruits.

752
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:38,966
Nam No, come with me.

753
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,100
- Yes, we can go.
- The two of us will go.

754
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,133
I'm not doing it in the water,

755
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,233
so I feel like I can collect a lot.

756
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,600
- Good luck.
- I bet I can handle this.

757
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,733
- You've got this.
- Good luck.

758
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,766
- I can't go in the water.
- Let's go!

759
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,266
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

760
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,866
(What types of tastes await them
in the farms of San Rafael?)

761
00:30:56,266 --> 00:31:00,000
(The workers climb uphill to pick fruits.)

762
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,566
Where is your farm?

763
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,966
You are on the farm now.

764
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,333
- All of this?
- Yes.

765
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,200
(All this is your farm?)

766
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,633
(The entire hill?)

767
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:13,533
What?

768
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,900
(Facing the clear Caribbean Sea...)

769
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:20,700
(is a giant mountain of fruit trees.)

770
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,266
The whole mountain is...

771
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,666
That's all his farm?

772
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,300
He's the rich guy in this town.

773
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,633
He's an impressive man.

774
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,733
That's his mountain?

775
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,333
No wonder he's always smiling.

776
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,766
(Smiling brightly)

777
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:36,800
- And his posture.
- Yes.

778
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,500
He doesn't look happy
because he lives there.

779
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,466
He couldn't be anything but happy.

780
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm sure not everyone who lives there is
as happy as he is.

781
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,033
(Jealous)

782
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,866
(It's sunny every day here.)

783
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,266
(The Caribbean is
a paradise of tropical fruits.)

784
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,633
They had such good fruit in that country.

785
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,266
(What treasures will they find
on the farm?)

786
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,533
- Ready?
- Yes.

787
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:05,900
It's huge.

788
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,800
(Move, workers. We've got a lot to do.)

789
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:12,800
All right. Let's pick the fruits
that we can actually use.

790
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,100
You know, the ones we can efficiently use.

791
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,300
- Careful.
- Okay.

792
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,900
I'll climb the tree,

793
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,533
so you can catch the oranges.

794
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,400
- Oranges?
- You can climb that?

795
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,266
- He'll get hurt.
- Okay.

796
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
I climb the tree,
and you catch the orange.

797
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,533
Show me.

798
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,433
Show me.

799
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,633
(He climbs it with his bare hands.)

800
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,666
- But he's too chubby to move that well.
- I know.

801
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,900
He seemed pretty heavy.

802
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
- He climbed so high up.
- He's good, though.

803
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
He's so good.

804
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
(Is he from "I Am a Person of Nature?")

805
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,166
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

806
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,300
What is that? Is that an apple?

807
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,500
- An orange.
- An orange?

808
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,533
They have oranges?

809
00:32:58,366 --> 00:32:59,600
That looks delicious.

810
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,300
(It's a naranja
that's similar to an orange.)

811
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:03,066
Can you pick five oranges?

812
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,966
(Picking them without hesitation)

813
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,500
I think Su Young said he wanted oranges.

814
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,200
This is pretty nice.

815
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,300
- I love oranges.
- One more. Let's go.

816
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,500
(The basket is full of naranjas.)

817
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,033
(Light)

818
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,066
It looks pretty easy, to be honest.

819
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,733
Will you show us?

820
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:23,600
Of course.

821
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:24,766
How did he do it?

822
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:25,966
He stepped on this first, right?

823
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,933
(His gym-going personality can't wait
to come out.)

824
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,866
I'm a proud man, you know.

825
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:32,300
I do a lot of pull-ups.

826
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,466
- Pull-ups.
- Just in case...

827
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:35,066
No.

828
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,633
(Don't you worry.)

829
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:40,633
Just sit and watch.

830
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,166
- Okay.
- Yes.

831
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,900
(If you say so.)

832
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:46,466
This is a piece of cake.

833
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,166
This is too easy.

834
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,000
Be careful.

835
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,500
It's fine. I could climb
without stepping on this.

836
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:53,333
(Jumping)

837
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,600
Your body is so light!

838
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,666
(Even this young man is surprised.)

839
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,300
He's a Korean monkey.

840
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,833
Yes, he's like a monkey.

841
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm just sitting and resting here.

842
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:12,800
(He turns into Tarzan.)

843
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:15,900
Now, I see that you can find
a lot of them here.

844
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,633
- Nam No.
- Yes.

845
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:22,466
You're good.

846
00:34:23,766 --> 00:34:26,133
(Picking them one at a time)

847
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,366
- It must be so heavy.
- What?

848
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:31,700
Here.

849
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,100
You're doing great!

850
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,133
I know!

851
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,100
Pick some more!

852
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:39,733
Okay.

853
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:42,933
All his muscles weren't just for show.

854
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,100
Of course not.

855
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,633
I could climb without using my feet.

856
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:49,433
(His muscles came in handy today.)

857
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:53,500
Really?

858
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,466
Right.

859
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,533
You have to taste the ones you picked.

860
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:58,800
We get to eat one right away?

861
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:00,800
I bet it's sweet.

862
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,700
(Tasting a naranja on the spot)

863
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
He peels it better than my mom.

864
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
He is good.

865
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,066
That's so cool.

866
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:12,666
It looks so neat.

867
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,900
(How does a handpicked naranja taste?)

868
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,766
I bet it tastes good.

869
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,833
That looks so delicious.

870
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,766
You need to eat this in one bite.

871
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,400
(Yuck)

872
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,166
(Laughing)
What's wrong? Is it bad?

873
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,400
Why is it so bitter?

874
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,033
It is?

875
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,666
(Frowning)

876
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,066
It's not tasty.

877
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
Why don't you try one?

878
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,233
It's not ripe yet.

879
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,400
- What?
- Oh, it's not ripe yet.

880
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,266
(I knew something was wrong.)

881
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,666
He tricked us.

882
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,333
- Really?
- I see.

883
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:01,966
He's playful like Shin-chan.

884
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,600
Bye-bye.

885
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,766
He makes me angry.

886
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,500
He's so weird.

887
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,466
I should show him my temper.

888
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,400
How old are you?

889
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,333
- Thirty.
- Thirty?

890
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,400
(Reiling Shin-chan, born in 1994)

891
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,133
We're the same age. He's a friend.

892
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,533
- He's the same age as you?
- Yes.

893
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:19,966
(Both born in 1994)

894
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,433
We have something called
the age culture in Korea.

895
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,833
- You're mischievous.
- Okay.

896
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,266
- Let's go.
- You tricked us.

897
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,733
That's so sour and bitter.

898
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,666
- I want to try the sweetest fruit now.
- Okay.

899
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,633
- The sweetest one. Please.
- Okay.

900
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,466
Here. Mangoes.

901
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,566
Mangoes!

902
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:45,266
- I love mangoes.
- Mangoes!

903
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:46,533
- It's not...
- They have mangoes.

904
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:48,066
They're not ripe yet.

905
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,633
"They're not ripe yet."

906
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,700
What's wrong with him?

907
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,966
- He's so playful.
- Indeed.

908
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:57,366
He knows how to make a TV show funny.

909
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,433
He's funny.

910
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:01,533
That's not it.
He's just good at teasing people.

911
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,600
You're good,

912
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,433
bro.

913
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,500
He grows on you, doesn't he?

914
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,566
He does.

915
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:11,200
You're good.

916
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,933
Those born in 1994 tend to be playful.

917
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,500
You're good, bro.

918
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,466
Some-bro.

919
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:17,566
"Some-bro?"

920
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,066
You're my Some-bro now.

921
00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:20,533
Okay.

922
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,933
- He said, "Okay," in Korean.
- "Okay?"

923
00:37:21,933 --> 00:37:23,033
(They're sworn brothers now.)

924
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,233
(The ex-bro's farm stretches so far.)

925
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,333
- Where is it?
- I'm out of breath.

926
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,900
(Find sweet fruits
in this jungle of fruit trees.)

927
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Wait. That's...

928
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,566
(They spot something.)

929
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,466
What is that?

930
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,900
What's that?

931
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,133
(Small, yellow fruits on a tree)

932
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,966
Is that chili?

933
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,366
It looks like one.

934
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:52,000
What's the name of this one?

935
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,800
Starfruit.

936
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,133
- This is a starfruit?
- Yes.

937
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:55,700
Carambola.

938
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,400
Oh, that's a starfruit?

939
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,433
"Carambola?"

940
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,433
It's shaped like a star.

941
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:01,766
This is my first time seeing one.

942
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,600
Can you give me a starfruit?

943
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,766
(The tiny, precious fruits are hanging
on the tree.)

944
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:08,933
- It looks fascinating.
- It's shaped like a star.

945
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:10,166
It looks so interesting.

946
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,200
It smells like a passion fruit.

947
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,300
Let me smell it.

948
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,566
- It smells so refreshing.
- It does!

949
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,200
That's pretty nice.

950
00:38:17,566 --> 00:38:19,700
I've never seen starfruits before.

951
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,966
- Same here.
- It's fascinating.

952
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,200
It's shaped like a star
as soon as you cut it.

953
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,833
It's nice and sour, and it tastes so good.

954
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,633
That does look good.

955
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,633
That tastes so good.

956
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,733
It tasted so good.

957
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,800
(He obtained ripe starfruits.)

958
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,233
(What's their next task?)

959
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:43,366
These are bananas from our village.

960
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,400
Platano.

961
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,133
Isn't that the one we fried earlier?

962
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:52,233
(They're platanos,
which are green bananas.)

963
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,633
Cut where the fruits are,

964
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,166
and cut the stalks.

965
00:38:58,866 --> 00:38:59,833
What? Why?

966
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:01,300
It's so intriguing, right?

967
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,533
Why would you cut the tree too?

968
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:06,566
(Once a stalk produces a fruit,
it no longer produces any.)

969
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:07,466
That's so intriguing, isn't it?

970
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,633
Really?

971
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:11,833
(You must cut the stalk after harvesting.)

972
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,333
It only has one seed,

973
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,200
so it grows only if you cut it.

974
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,100
Really?

975
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
(He tries cutting the fruit first.)

976
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,233
- It's so heavy!
- It looks heavy.

977
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,633
(You can instantly tell how heavy it is.)

978
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,566
They're so heavy.

979
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,133
(He cuts the stalk for the next produce.)

980
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:35,766
It looks like...

981
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,766
(He slices it with a sharp knife.)

982
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,733
I've got this.

983
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,133
(He successfully chopped off the stalk.)

984
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:46,766
(Looking like a swordman)

985
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,433
I thought I was watching "Ninja Assassin."

986
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:50,000
Ninja!

987
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:51,966
- Yes.
- How did you know?

988
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:52,866
How did you know that?

989
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:56,666
I used to be a ninja.

990
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,800
About 16 years ago.

991
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,866
I'm serious.

992
00:40:01,638 --> 00:40:03,681
- Good. Okay.
- "I used to be a ninja 16 years ago."

993
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,700
(Don't mess with me.
I used to be a ninja.)

994
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:10,377
Gosh. It's too heavy!

995
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:11,712
(Thanks to the ninja,
they got plenty of food from the field.)

996
00:40:11,986 --> 00:40:13,494
You don't need to pay for groceries there.

997
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:14,914
Okay.

998
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,783
Would you like a coffee?

999
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,517
Yes.

1000
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:19,419
He's so nice.

1001
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:20,720
You're so kind.

1002
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,556
What is it?

1003
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,425
What's this?

1004
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:27,294
It's coffee.

1005
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:28,895
Coffee?

1006
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:31,331
- I'm great at making coffee!
- Let's go.

1007
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:34,768
- I've been craving it!
- It looks so good!

1008
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,970
I love this smell!

1009
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:38,905
It's Catimor,

1010
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,673
coffee beans with a balanced flavor.

1011
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,543
South America is famous for coffee beans.

1012
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,278
- It's so popular.
- Costa Rica too.

1013
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,382
I'd love a cup.

1014
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:48,603
(Catimor is well-balanced coffee bean.)

1015
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,616
Coffee?

1016
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,151
Gosh. That aroma!

1017
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:54,054
(The deep fragrance
already lifts their spirits.)

1018
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,657
Do you want to try making coffee?

1019
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:01,661
- Yes.
- Okay.

1020
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:02,795
- Coffee making?
- I'm a pro.

1021
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:04,364
Let's go.

1022
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,733
Hey, I'm serious.
I used to work at a café.

1023
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:07,701
Okay.

1024
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:09,803
I'm thrilled. I love the smell of coffee.

1025
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:11,638
What?

1026
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:16,943
- That's incredible.
- That aroma is strong.

1027
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,480
So he's roasting them in a pan.

1028
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,649
I've never seen this method before.

1029
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,384
(Roasting)

1030
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:25,352
It's a first!

1031
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,288
He actually is roasting the beans.

1032
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:31,291
He's roasting the beans he harvested.

1033
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,228
The smell is insane.

1034
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:36,796
I bet the flavor will be next-level.

1035
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,834
(Let me see.)

1036
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:42,869
That's it.

1037
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,671
(Let me show you my pro skills.)

1038
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:45,572
Hey!

1039
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:48,741
(Thanks to his wok skills,)

1040
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:50,911
(the beans roast evenly.)

1041
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,479
(Interesting)

1042
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:56,649
(Reiling can't take his eyes off the pan.)

1043
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,618
He's really into it.

1044
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,583
You look like a chef.

1045
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:04,550
I am a chef.

1046
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:08,162
Clearly, he hasn't seen
"Culinary Class Wars."

1047
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:12,565
(Let's make coffee now.)

1048
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,320
I love old-school stuff like this.

1049
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,864
Is this the one? With this?

1050
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,731
Seriously?

1051
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,971
(Mysterious mortar and pestle)

1052
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:21,904
What now?

1053
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,074
Are you sure we're using this?

1054
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,944
Time to grind!

1055
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,112
They're really doing this?

1056
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,047
For real?

1057
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,918
This is totally my thing. So traditional.

1058
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,911
(Stamping down)

1059
00:42:36,912 --> 00:42:37,926
(No stamping down)

1060
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:38,855
You need to pound it.

1061
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:40,849
Like this.

1062
00:42:42,197 --> 00:42:43,297
How long does this take?

1063
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:45,599
I bet it'll take a long time.

1064
00:42:47,068 --> 00:42:49,603
(He starts pounding.)

1065
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:50,904
Okay.

1066
00:42:51,306 --> 00:42:54,108
(It's hard to earn a cup of coffee.)

1067
00:42:56,478 --> 00:42:59,213
Stronger!

1068
00:42:59,214 --> 00:43:00,188
What?

1069
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,348
Hold on! What did you just say?

1070
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:02,575
Can he speak Korean?

1071
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:03,984
Stronger!

1072
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,087
(Out of nowhere, a Korean phrase?)

1073
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:08,923
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

1074
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:10,924
- Sigue.
- Stronger?

1075
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,126
Isn't he a Korean?

1076
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:15,362
One more time.

1077
00:43:15,363 --> 00:43:16,396
Sigue.

1078
00:43:16,865 --> 00:43:18,099
I think he knows Korean.

1079
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,833
It means "keep going" in Spanish.

1080
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:21,868
Really? It means "keep going?"

1081
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,537
I got the wrong idea!

1082
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:25,105
Keep going!

1083
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:27,341
Sigue means "keep going?"

1084
00:43:27,342 --> 00:43:28,943
- I learned a new phrase.
- He surprised me.

1085
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:32,179
Sigue!

1086
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,080
Keep going!

1087
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:36,216
(He's doing great.)

1088
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,853
(Now it's Nam No's turn.)

1089
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,690
(The beans start to peel.)

1090
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,259
(Harder!)

1091
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:52,599
(They're all in a trance of "sigue" now.)

1092
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,670
That chanting helps them keep going
cheerfully.

1093
00:43:57,872 --> 00:43:58,805
It's hilarious.

1094
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:00,841
How long do we keep going?

1095
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:04,745
- Más duro.
- Más duro?

1096
00:44:04,746 --> 00:44:07,514
- It means much harder.
- Much harder!

1097
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:11,285
- Harder!
- Harder!

1098
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,855
(Laughing)

1099
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,178
(He goes full maniac.)

1100
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,125
It's the maniac we know.

1101
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,927
(Screaming)

1102
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:26,366
Continue.

1103
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:27,968
Do we really need this coffee?

1104
00:44:28,503 --> 00:44:30,504
- This is brutal.
- I give up. I'll buy one at a café.

1105
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,706
It's too much!

1106
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,008
I'm exhausted.

1107
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:35,876
Let me see.

1108
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:40,180
(Checking the grind)

1109
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:41,447
Not yet.

1110
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,016
Why?

1111
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:45,919
- Do we have to go more?
- Harder!

1112
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,288
- More?
- Let's go!

1113
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,624
Let's go! We got this.

1114
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:53,994
- Keep going!
- Keep going!

1115
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:57,431
(With intense pounding,)

1116
00:44:57,432 --> 00:45:00,134
(the coffee of trance is born.)

1117
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:04,304
(The mortar and pestle party rages on.)

1118
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:06,706
(No breaks)

1119
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:10,878
(The coffee train goes wild
with broken brake.)

1120
00:45:11,065 --> 00:45:12,098
It's hilarious.

1121
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,814
(A coffee workout that builds muscle)

1122
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:14,748
Look at Nam No behind.

1123
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,517
(Coffee extracting exercise)

1124
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,051
What's up with this music?

1125
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:19,352
- It's hilarious.
- It's hysterical.

1126
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:21,922
Here comes the maniac.

1127
00:45:21,923 --> 00:45:23,824
(They're not exorcising.)

1128
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:27,895
What is this?

1129
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:29,362
Is this a concert?

1130
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:31,498
(The madness for a single cup of coffee)

1131
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,300
Okay.

1132
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:34,802
Hold on.

1133
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,103
(I can't take it anymore.)

1134
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,171
You should do it now. You're the youngest.

1135
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:41,942
I give up. No more.

1136
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:43,611
It's too much.

1137
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,045
It's exhausting.

1138
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,849
(Fidgeting)

1139
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:49,717
What is it?

1140
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:52,352
(Hold up, guys.)

1141
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:53,453
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

1142
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:55,589
I found pre-ground beans.

1143
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:57,558
Seriously? What the...

1144
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:59,259
- You had it all along?
- Yes.

1145
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:00,861
Seriously? What the...

1146
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:02,929
- You had it all along?
- Yes.

1147
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:05,232
(He got you again.)

1148
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:06,934
He's so annoying.

1149
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:09,770
(He had perfectly ground coffee
the whole time.)

1150
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:12,038
What were we doing then?

1151
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,474
It's almost ready.

1152
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:15,608
But wait. The smell is divine.

1153
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:16,910
Hold on. I can't...

1154
00:46:17,312 --> 00:46:20,214
What were we doing all along?

1155
00:46:20,648 --> 00:46:23,016
- He's a prankster.
- He really is.

1156
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:23,950
He's mischievous.

1157
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:28,088
(I'll make a good coffee instead.)

1158
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:30,991
Are you ready for help? Hold it.

1159
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,893
- Yes.
- Be careful.

1160
00:46:32,894 --> 00:46:34,361
(It'll be almost done after filtering.)

1161
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:35,729
- Okay.
- Be careful.

1162
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:41,701
This is the traditional way
of how coffee used to be brewed.

1163
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,872
- Okay.
- Oh, hold on.

1164
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:46,773
(Dripping)

1165
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:48,508
It looks like making herbal medicine.

1166
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,378
What'll it taste like? So curious.

1167
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:57,851
(What is this amazing aroma?)

1168
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,221
(Fabulous!)

1169
00:47:01,323 --> 00:47:03,623
- See? So easy to exploit them.
- They're like "Dumb and Dumber."

1170
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:05,358
Look! They forgot everything already!

1171
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:07,961
- They remember nothing.
- I have a short memory.

1172
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:10,864
I forgot the struggle.
I just loved the smell.

1173
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,800
(This coffee erases all suffering.)

1174
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,902
- That looks incredible.
- It's true Americano.

1175
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:18,574
(Americano in San Rafael)

1176
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:19,706
It's amazing, brother.

1177
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:25,412
Smell it.

1178
00:47:27,782 --> 00:47:29,916
This would be amazing with some cookies...

1179
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,685
or dark chocolate.

1180
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,120
This is amazing.

1181
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,157
Cheers.

1182
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:38,492
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1183
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:44,464
It's delicious.

1184
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:48,034
It was amazing. The smell was awesome.

1185
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:51,305
That aroma...

1186
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:54,508
It's so delicate and rich.

1187
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:55,442
- Deep and luxurious.
- It really is.

1188
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:57,877
It's amazing.

1189
00:47:58,113 --> 00:47:59,279
It was delicious.

1190
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,982
Some beans are very sour.

1191
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:05,519
Some are nutty and some are sour.

1192
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:08,590
This one has the best of both.

1193
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,857
It's sour yet nutty.

1194
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:13,794
- That looks insanely good.
- That'd be really great.

1195
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:16,163
I wanted to take a coffee break
with some cookies.

1196
00:48:16,264 --> 00:48:17,831
Or something like macarons.

1197
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:19,666
Didn't you just want macarons?

1198
00:48:24,572 --> 00:48:27,040
(Did you like it, brothers?)

1199
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:27,841
Okay.

1200
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:29,843
(They enjoyed their little break
over coffee.)

1201
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:32,646
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1202
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:35,549
(Meanwhile, in the beach kitchen...)

1203
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,716
It still looks amazing, even after sunset.

1204
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:38,552
- It looks surreal.
- It looks like a CGI.

1205
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,653
Isn't that a green screen?

1206
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:44,057
(He starts prepping for dinner, humming.)

1207
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:46,126
(Su Young appears with a cooler in hand.)

1208
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:46,960
What is it?

1209
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:49,429
Good. Let's get to work.

1210
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:55,102
I've never seen one this big.

1211
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:57,170
These are the ones we bought this morning.

1212
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,139
Gosh. They're massive.

1213
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,841
We need to take photos of these.

1214
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:03,944
The crabs are huge.
It's bigger than I remembered.

1215
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:06,046
(The size is overwhelming.)

1216
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:07,548
That's insane.

1217
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:09,983
- You're all going to be stuffed.
- It actually happened.

1218
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:11,852
- We got full just eating crab.
- We're having a crab party.

1219
00:49:11,853 --> 00:49:13,053
It's crab madness.

1220
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:15,355
A full-on crab party.

1221
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:16,690
(At lunch, they received...)

1222
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:20,527
(A special homemade Dominican meal
by Reiling's mom)

1223
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,565
(Reiling's family introduced them
to Dominican crab.)

1224
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:26,065
It must've been amazing.

1225
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,333
Now it's our turn.

1226
00:49:27,335 --> 00:49:30,604
(Time for us to cook for Reiling's family)

1227
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:31,405
What will they make?

1228
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:34,641
(What will Mr. Eo Nam Seon whip up
with king crabs?)

1229
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:35,642
What's he cooking?

1230
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:40,356
(A Boiling Crab-style dish where crabs
and other shellfish are tossed...)

1231
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:42,649
(in a rich, spicy sauce,
which is popular in the Southern U.S.)

1232
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,550
It's Boiling Crab-style.

1233
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:46,453
(Crab served straight on the table,
no plate necessary)

1234
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:48,121
Oh, really?

1235
00:49:49,157 --> 00:49:53,560
(But with a Korean twist,
thanks to Mr. Eo Nam Seon.)

1236
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,928
That'll be delicious!

1237
00:49:55,863 --> 00:49:57,263
(The king crabs are reborn
in spicy Korean sauce.)

1238
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:59,397
- I can't wait to see the sauce.
- The sauce?

1239
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:01,201
It's boiling king crab.

1240
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:03,631
You can just bite the meat right off.

1241
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:07,269
It's a rare chance to cook
with king crab this expensive.

1242
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:10,038
I'm so excited.

1243
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:15,401
(He sets the washed crabs aside.)

1244
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:16,778
All right. Let's do it.

1245
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:20,118
(He starts prepping something else?)

1246
00:50:20,152 --> 00:50:21,002
What is he doing?

1247
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,151
Add some ginger.

1248
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:24,819
- Ginger?
- It boosts the flavor.

1249
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:28,456
Never forget ginger when boiling crab.

1250
00:50:28,481 --> 00:50:29,824
It really enhances the flavor?

1251
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:31,826
- It gets rid of the fishy smell.
- I see.

1252
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:33,269
It's to remove the fishy smell.

1253
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:36,148
You can eliminate the fishy taste
of blue crabs with ginger.

1254
00:50:36,148 --> 00:50:37,165
With ginger.

1255
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,701
Ginger improves your cooking.

1256
00:50:39,808 --> 00:50:42,548
It applies to most of the dishes
with crustaceans.

1257
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:43,398
Oh, really?

1258
00:50:44,036 --> 00:50:46,572
(Meanwhile,
Ok Vin is quietly prepping something.)

1259
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:49,177
What's she up to?

1260
00:50:49,915 --> 00:50:51,680
- The skin's too tough...
- Even cucumbers are huge here.

1261
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,515
- We should peel them.
- The cucumber is huge.

1262
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:57,622
(She opens a plastic bag.)

1263
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:58,472
What is she making?

1264
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:01,756
I'm making a side dish.

1265
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:03,808
What is it?

1266
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:07,270
- It's a go-to dish at my place.
- It's smashed cucumber salad.

1267
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:09,264
- It's good.
- It's so good.

1268
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,431
She's so good!

1269
00:51:13,959 --> 00:51:15,570
Ok Vin is such a good cook.

1270
00:51:15,954 --> 00:51:18,173
- I'm not.
- She's really good.

1271
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,809
I'll just add vinegar and sugar.

1272
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:23,044
Simple is best.

1273
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,939
(She shakes the bag.)

1274
00:51:28,483 --> 00:51:30,827
- It's a popular camping dish.
- Right.

1275
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:32,988
It's easy to make and refreshing.

1276
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:36,615
(This simple side dish will be ready
after resting in the fridge for a bit.)

1277
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,698
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

1278
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:40,548
We're back.

1279
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:44,199
You got that many?

1280
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:45,734
Are they all avocados?

1281
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:48,136
- Yes. Avocados and some papayas too.
- My gosh.

1282
00:51:48,622 --> 00:51:49,472
One.

1283
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,273
We need to show them off.

1284
00:51:52,424 --> 00:51:53,708
Let's stack them back here.

1285
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:55,777
You picked a ton.

1286
00:51:56,437 --> 00:51:57,545
What did you get?

1287
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,007
(Thanks to them,
they're swimming in produce.)

1288
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:01,282
- These oranges look delicious too!
- And some yucca too!

1289
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:02,157
Yucca!

1290
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:04,819
Avocados, oranges, starfruit,

1291
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,341
and papayas.

1292
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,289
They just picked these from the forest?

1293
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:11,026
- Just like we harvest lettuce at home.
- I know.

1294
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:12,838
Avocados.

1295
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,596
I've never seen avocados this big before.

1296
00:52:15,196 --> 00:52:17,098
Well done, guys.

1297
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:20,707
This is coffee brewed the old-school way.

1298
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:22,267
- Can I try it?
- Yes, please.

1299
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,206
We brewed it like brewing herbal medicine.

1300
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,709
It smells amazing!

1301
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:29,894
So this is Dominican coffee?

1302
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:31,246
It's a 100 percent legit.

1303
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,015
It's really strong.

1304
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:37,352
How is it? Do you like it?

1305
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,888
- It's so good!
- How is it?

1306
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,023
It's strong but delicious.

1307
00:52:42,524 --> 00:52:43,479
I want some too.

1308
00:52:43,503 --> 00:52:44,559
Try it.

1309
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:46,525
(Su Young grabs a taste,
desperate for caffeine.)

1310
00:52:49,715 --> 00:52:50,756
(He hasn't had a hit like this in ages.)

1311
00:52:50,756 --> 00:52:51,606
He needed it badly.

1312
00:52:51,606 --> 00:52:54,169
That cup made me happy.

1313
00:52:54,569 --> 00:52:55,970
Maybe because it's been so long.

1314
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,807
I was so happy to finally have coffee
after such a long time.

1315
00:52:58,832 --> 00:52:59,731
I know.

1316
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:02,343
- Are you boiling this now?
- Yes, I'm making...

1317
00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:03,890
boiling crab.

1318
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,982
It's been boiling for over 20 minutes,
so it should be done.

1319
00:53:08,383 --> 00:53:09,233
Amazing.

1320
00:53:09,258 --> 00:53:10,856
(Grand opening)

1321
00:53:12,139 --> 00:53:13,697
- My gosh!
- Darn it.

1322
00:53:13,722 --> 00:53:14,656
Incredible.

1323
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:16,257
All set.

1324
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:18,193
The potatoes were so good,
I threw them in too.

1325
00:53:18,193 --> 00:53:19,561
You just boiled everything in water?

1326
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:21,463
With some ginger, yes.

1327
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:22,797
- You just boiled it?
- Yes.

1328
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,667
Gosh. It's so heavy.

1329
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:27,212
(Nam No is here
to get some crabs to cook.)

1330
00:53:27,362 --> 00:53:29,804
They're too big for tongs!

1331
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:31,873
- He needs his hands!
- I know.

1332
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,694
Take this one.

1333
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,331
- This is the biggest.
- It's huge!

1334
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:36,344
- Unbelievable.
- So big.

1335
00:53:36,662 --> 00:53:37,512
I'll give it to you now.

1336
00:53:39,034 --> 00:53:40,849
This is the best and the biggest one.

1337
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,152
- Okay.
- Can I grab one more?

1338
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:46,554
- One more?
- Goodness. How can it be that big?

1339
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,822
It's humongous.

1340
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,557
That's so unreal.

1341
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:50,825
It's even bigger.

1342
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,529
(Nam No enters the kitchen.)

1343
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:56,731
- I wonder what he'll make this time.
- I know, right?

1344
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:03,908
(Shelling begins.)

1345
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:07,909
I was really happy while shelling.

1346
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:11,229
Even though it's a hassle, I was happy,
thinking about cooking for everyone.

1347
00:54:12,644 --> 00:54:14,326
(The meat comes out...)

1348
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:17,919
(neat and clean.)

1349
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:24,859
What a waste!

1350
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:26,861
I can't waste a thing.

1351
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:29,164
He totally did that on purpose.

1352
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:32,573
Do you need some help?

1353
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,173
(Joon naturally joins.)

1354
00:54:34,198 --> 00:54:35,875
Joon. Here.

1355
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,830
When I crack it...

1356
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,777
When I crack it, you fork out the meat.

1357
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:44,379
Okay.

1358
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:47,432
(Joon is now the designated meat-forker.)

1359
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,151
- No shells allowed.
- Got it.

1360
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:55,223
That's shell.

1361
00:54:56,624 --> 00:54:58,216
You'll feel it.

1362
00:54:58,216 --> 00:54:59,818
(The chef can spot a shell like a hawk.)

1363
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:02,497
You were right. It's a delicate job.

1364
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:04,709
Of course, it is.

1365
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,105
What is he talking about?

1366
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:09,137
You don't want Reiling's mom
to crack a tooth.

1367
00:55:11,464 --> 00:55:12,314
(Screaming)

1368
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:16,817
- If you miss one, you're doomed!
- You shouldn't!

1369
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:18,913
- That'd be a trip to the dentist.
- You'd better not miss it.

1370
00:55:18,913 --> 00:55:21,382
She'd keep doing this.

1371
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:24,819
Be careful.

1372
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:27,873
(He gets back to work
after pulling himself together.)

1373
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:33,151
(Hand-shelling every piece)

1374
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,998
He did it all with his own hands.

1375
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:38,900
(He's fully committed
to shelling every last crab.)

1376
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,528
(Then he stuffs the meat back
into the crab shell.)

1377
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:46,145
That looks incredible. So much meat.

1378
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,309
It's like a mountain of rice.

1379
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:51,112
- No, it's a mountain of crab meat.
- That's it.

1380
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:56,755
(I'll take the scraps.)

1381
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:58,623
(After shelling)

1382
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,021
Can I get a bell pepper?

1383
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:01,322
What is he making now?

1384
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:04,389
(He puts it right on the stove?)

1385
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:06,137
- What's that?
- Why?

1386
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:07,896
Guess what I'm making.

1387
00:56:08,329 --> 00:56:10,465
It's a bell pepper.
Are you making grilled bell peppers?

1388
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:11,715
It's grilled, yes.

1389
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:13,341
Well...

1390
00:56:14,106 --> 00:56:16,070
Now, I'll concasse it.

1391
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,006
It means to remove the skin.

1392
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,842
Grilling blackens it so we can peel it.

1393
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:22,810
I've never seen anything like that.

1394
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:25,780
We don't need the burnt skin,

1395
00:56:26,087 --> 00:56:27,255
but we want the smoky flavor.

1396
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:33,331
(Only the sweet, juicy inside remains.)

1397
00:56:33,415 --> 00:56:35,782
I grill green onions like this
when camping.

1398
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:37,592
- It's amazingly good. Only the inside.
- It's the best.

1399
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:41,523
(He slices the grilled pepper delicately.)

1400
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:44,038
I'm really curious.

1401
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:46,501
It looks like salmon.

1402
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,419
It also feels similar to salmon.

1403
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:50,002
- That looks so luxurious.
- It looks like sashimi.

1404
00:56:50,026 --> 00:56:51,773
The taste was similar to meat.

1405
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:53,333
Let me help you.

1406
00:56:54,008 --> 00:56:54,953
It'd be so good.

1407
00:56:57,683 --> 00:56:58,977
It tastes so expensive!

1408
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,216
It's a luxury cuisine!

1409
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:04,385
You say that whenever there's olive oil!

1410
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:07,974
Because you always cook with regular oil.

1411
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:10,482
Seriously.

1412
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:11,926
Still, it was really good.

1413
00:57:12,283 --> 00:57:14,529
Roasting brings out the sweetness
and adds smoke.

1414
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:15,451
Yes, right.

1415
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:18,232
It enhances the sweetness
and adds a smoky kick.

1416
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:20,238
That was such an awesome experience.

1417
00:57:21,656 --> 00:57:24,238
- I'm curious.
- I'm dying to try it.

1418
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,985
(Su Young starts on the boiling crab.)

1419
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,543
Okay. Let's cook.

1420
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,340
(He preps the crabs first.)

1421
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,683
Look at those huge claws!

1422
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,749
(He finally got the big claw off
after a lot of effort.)

1423
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:39,269
Do you want to try?

1424
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:43,758
Just a bite to test it.

1425
00:57:43,758 --> 00:57:44,930
(He offers a piece to Ok Vin.)

1426
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:47,996
(Trying it immediately)

1427
00:57:49,472 --> 00:57:50,431
Is it good?

1428
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:51,953
(Wide-eyed)

1429
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,199
- Of course, it's good. It's a crab.
- It's perfectly seasoned.

1430
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:55,336
- Is it?
- Yes.

1431
00:57:55,336 --> 00:57:59,574
It's salty already, so I just removed
the fishy smell with ginger.

1432
00:58:00,174 --> 00:58:02,043
I'd fly there just to eat this.

1433
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,188
Now, this part...

1434
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,483
- It's not breaking.
- It isn't.

1435
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,182
You don't need to break it fully.

1436
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:13,521
Just crack it so the sauce soaks in.

1437
00:58:14,094 --> 00:58:17,035
(He hits it with the knife spine.)

1438
00:58:17,188 --> 00:58:18,826
The shell is hard...

1439
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:20,897
but cracks with a few light hits.

1440
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,398
I'm getting better at breaking shells!

1441
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:26,097
(Excited)

1442
00:58:26,097 --> 00:58:28,333
(Fast forward!)

1443
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,738
We've got so many legs!

1444
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:31,906
All done.

1445
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:33,674
Nice.

1446
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:36,277
Now, I'm going to make the sauce.

1447
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:37,775
What is he using?

1448
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:40,787
(The first ingredient is...)

1449
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:42,025
There you go.

1450
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,132
(margarine.)

1451
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:48,022
It's too bad we don't have butter,
but I'm glad we have margarine.

1452
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,391
We bought margarine
because there was no butter.

1453
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:51,823
(He uses margarine instead of butter.)

1454
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:55,513
(He adds garlic.)

1455
00:58:55,513 --> 00:58:57,165
- That must be good.
- That's good already.

1456
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,793
I boiled garlic in margarine
until it turned into a paste.

1457
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:03,171
The garlic was minced so finely.

1458
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:06,307
Garlic and margarine are...

1459
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:07,491
always a win.

1460
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:09,210
Gosh. It looks so delicious.

1461
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:14,332
(He sets aside the garlic.)

1462
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:19,364
(It's time to make the sauce
with pepper, garlic, and onion.)

1463
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,724
(Soy sauce goes in.)

1464
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:26,347
Nice!

1465
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:27,679
(Fire show time!)

1466
00:59:27,906 --> 00:59:29,097
So cool.

1467
00:59:29,574 --> 00:59:31,029
(To the sautéed onions, ketchup is added.)

1468
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:33,201
- That's wild.
- It already smells amazing.

1469
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:37,159
Ketchup gives it that familiar kick.

1470
00:59:37,183 --> 00:59:38,606
Everyone can enjoy it.

1471
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,575
(Next ingredient...)

1472
00:59:40,575 --> 00:59:41,843
- Is it gochujang?
- Yes, gochujang.

1473
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:43,611
- It's gochujang.
- It's a must.

1474
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,614
(Gochujang adds spicy depth.)

1475
00:59:46,614 --> 00:59:49,383
- But can they handle spicy food?
- Tell me about it.

1476
00:59:49,584 --> 00:59:52,820
They handled it better than I expected,
but I didn't make it too spicy.

1477
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,356
(He adds the garlic margarine back in.)

1478
00:59:55,356 --> 00:59:56,624
East meets West.

1479
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:57,980
It's got kick.

1480
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:01,665
Butter and gochujang is
the flavor combo we all know.

1481
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:04,000
Westerners genuinely enjoy that flavor.

1482
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,433
It is somewhat spicy but still quite mild.

1483
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:07,700
- It is not overpowering.
- Exactly.

1484
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,666
It has a milder taste.

1485
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:10,166
That's interesting.

1486
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:15,100
This tastes so good.

1487
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,000
I'm so curious about it.

1488
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:19,700
Do you want to taste it?

1489
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:21,518
That looks so good.

1490
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,233
I made it with gochujang.

1491
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:24,666
(Main taster, Nam No, steps in.)

1492
01:00:27,066 --> 01:00:29,000
(The taste makes him smile right away.)

1493
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,133
If you don't like this flavor,

1494
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,000
you've got a broken tongue!

1495
01:00:34,366 --> 01:00:36,366
- Like, you don't even have a tongue.
- For real.

1496
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,633
(Feeling proud)

1497
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:38,933
It's seriously delicious.

1498
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:42,100
(Su Young's sauce has everyone fired up.)

1499
01:00:42,566 --> 01:00:46,000
(The crab meat
and bell peppers are ready.)

1500
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:51,566
(What's the new ingredient? Avocado?)

1501
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,600
That's huge.

1502
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,366
Is that really an avocado?
It looks like a pumpkin.

1503
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:57,566
(Slicing the pumpkin-sized avocado.)

1504
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:00,566
Oh, my!

1505
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:01,833
The seed is that big?

1506
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,966
- It's a seed?
- It's the size of a baseball.

1507
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:05,300
Seriously, that avocado...

1508
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,066
You could
actually play baseball with that.

1509
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,233
It's so big.

1510
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:10,500
That surprised me.

1511
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,100
(Bringing out a perfectly ripe avocado)

1512
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,200
It's so perfectly ripe
that you can eat it right away.

1513
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,766
What's that?

1514
01:01:16,766 --> 01:01:18,066
(Nam No's mysterious dish is...)

1515
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:20,466
(Mapo avocado crab)

1516
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,333
Mapo avocado crab?

1517
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,633
I'm curious about that one.

1518
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,400
When you grill an avocado,

1519
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,100
it gives off a buttery aroma.

1520
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,066
That grilled avocado tastes worlds apart.

1521
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:36,766
- It's nutty like butter.
- Really?

1522
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:39,333
That looks amazing.

1523
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:43,233
(Grilling the avocado
to creamy perfection)

1524
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,600
(Time for the final touch
for mapo avocado crab)

1525
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,466
(He is ripping something off.)

1526
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:53,733
This is Sichuan Mapo sauce.

1527
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:55,700
It's one of my all-time favorites.

1528
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,533
But they haven't tried mapo taste before.

1529
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,118
- I wonder if they'll like it.
- Me too.

1530
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:06,233
(Heat the sauce briefly,
and pour it on the plate.)

1531
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,400
(Then place the grilled avocado
on the sauce.)

1532
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,500
How did you come up
with the avocado and mapo combination?

1533
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,433
- Beats me.
- Right?

1534
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:17,533
I felt like this sauce
would go perfectly with tofu.

1535
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,600
- But this country doesn't have tofu.
- Yes, there's no tofu.

1536
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,566
Honestly, the moment I tasted the avocado,

1537
01:02:23,566 --> 01:02:27,366
I thought I should replace
the tofu's texture with avocado.

1538
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:30,633
- Because avocado is similar to tofu?
- Exactly.

1539
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,933
Since tofu wasn't available,

1540
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:35,000
I decided to use avocado instead.

1541
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,233
(Top it with bell peppers.)

1542
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,900
It's incredibly refined.

1543
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,500
- Right?
- It's luxurious.

1544
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:45,500
If you scoop up the avocado
with the sauce beneath...

1545
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,733
- It looks tasty.
- It is a real treat!

1546
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,900
Here we go.

1547
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,800
(Su Young's boiling crab is
also being finished off with the sauce.)

1548
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:57,000
The presentation is insane.

1549
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,033
It's an art form.

1550
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:01,200
I can't wait to taste that.

1551
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:02,466
It looks incredible.

1552
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,400
Here we go!

1553
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,566
(He lifts and shakes
a 10kg cast iron pot!)

1554
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,333
(Mixing endlessly
so the sauce coats the crab)

1555
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,200
It looks delicious.

1556
01:03:20,366 --> 01:03:23,866
(The finished boiling crab is...)

1557
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:27,033
(poured directly onto the table!)

1558
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:28,800
- This is crazy.
- It's totally my style.

1559
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,600
- It's exactly my vibe.
- It's insane.

1560
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,833
For real.

1561
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,000
So this is how it's done.

1562
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,100
The visuals are mind-blowing.

1563
01:03:36,766 --> 01:03:38,200
It's a masterpiece.

1564
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,400
- So, that's the vibe.
- It's art.

1565
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,266
I can't wait to dig in.

1566
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,233
Seriously.

1567
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:46,800
I've never seen anything like this.

1568
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,600
(A hearty king crab meal)

1569
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,500
It's amazing.

1570
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,500
It looks delicious.

1571
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,100
It's incredible.

1572
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,666
Even the pickles are absolutely perfect.

1573
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,401
It looks delicious.

1574
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
- Hold on.
- This is insane.

1575
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:04,100
Isn't this a full-on feast?

1576
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,033
I want to eat right away.

1577
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:07,300
Should we bring Reiling's family here?

1578
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,133
They treated us to lunch, after all.

1579
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:11,266
- I'll go get them.
- All right.

1580
01:04:11,966 --> 01:04:13,333
It feels a bit empty with just this.

1581
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:16,033
But with this and that, it feels complete.

1582
01:04:16,033 --> 01:04:18,833
- Will it suit their taste?
- That's what I'm curious about.

1583
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:20,200
Come on.

1584
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,966
Reiling!

1585
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:23,000
My little brother!

1586
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,466
- Sorry for the long wait.
- My little brother!

1587
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:27,600
(They reunited with Reiling...)

1588
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,700
(and even Elisa,
who treated them to lunch.)

1589
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,666
She should try it.

1590
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,600
(Welcome.)

1591
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,600
We enjoyed lunch so much...

1592
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,576
that we got together to prepare this meal.

1593
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,600
Thank you.

1594
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:42,933
Thank you.

1595
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:46,383
Chef, could you please explain the dish?

1596
01:04:47,366 --> 01:04:49,733
We added Sichuan mapo sauce.

1597
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:51,133
There's no tofu in the Dominican Republic.

1598
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:54,100
Avocado is really buttery,

1599
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,700
so it's great as a substitute for rice.

1600
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,600
I want to scoop up the avocado and eat it.

1601
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,233
And what do you think this is?

1602
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:01,866
We added a bit of bell pepper.

1603
01:05:01,866 --> 01:05:04,333
We charred the skin
to give it a smoky flavor.

1604
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,033
(The bell peppers are topped
with savory crab meat.)

1605
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,700
- Please enjoy.
- Enjoy.

1606
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,106
Enjoy the meal!

1607
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,266
- A lot of care went into this.
- Thank you.

1608
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:14,444
Thank you.

1609
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,900
- But why am I nervous right now?
- I know.

1610
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,133
It's not like I even did all the cooking.

1611
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,333
Nam No must be feeling nervous.

1612
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:22,933
Right now,
it's like "Culinary Class Wars."

1613
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,966
(The judges have probably tasted
every kind of crab dish out there.)

1614
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,525
The one on the right is
Anh Sung Jae, right?

1615
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:33,333
(They scoop the crab meat
into the mapo sauce.)

1616
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:36,066
But this must be their first time
tasting mapo sauce.

1617
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,168
I wonder if they'll like it.

1618
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,600
(Nodding)

1619
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:49,300
Is it spicy?

1620
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,647
(How is it?)

1621
01:05:51,066 --> 01:05:54,300
It's sweet and slightly spicy.
It's delicious.

1622
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:55,733
(Just as I thought!)

1623
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:57,400
This dish is impressive.

1624
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,933
It's a new kind of spicy for me.

1625
01:05:58,933 --> 01:06:00,700
(It passed Reilling's taste test.)

1626
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,900
(But Elisa's judgment is still pending.)

1627
01:06:04,433 --> 01:06:07,666
It's so soft when you eat it
with the avocado.

1628
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,000
I've never had this texture before.

1629
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
It's really good!

1630
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,966
(I can't believe crab and avocado
go this smoothly together.)

1631
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:15,933
She says it's soft.

1632
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:21,966
(He goes in for another bite right away.)

1633
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,750
The spicy mapo sauce
and avocado go really well together.

1634
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:29,919
You have to share the recipe
before you go.

1635
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:32,766
(See?)

1636
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,400
Hey, brother!

1637
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,666
(He is indeed a Cooking Maniac.)

1638
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,266
He wants your recipe!

1639
01:06:37,266 --> 01:06:38,100
No!

1640
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:41,033
(He just felt like being a little cheeky.)

1641
01:06:41,033 --> 01:06:42,165
You startled me!

1642
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:44,700
- Is it a secret recipe or something?
- I guess so.

1643
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,073
This is what makes cooking worth it.

1644
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,233
How did you even make something
like this by the sea?

1645
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,633
(Su Young also takes a bite
of the avocado and crab.)

1646
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:00,833
Does it taste like tofu?

1647
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:01,718
(No need for words.)

1648
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:04,133
The avocado is...

1649
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,833
- so creamy!
- Oh, it's creamy?

1650
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:09,033
The avocado turns
into a sauce in your mouth.

1651
01:07:09,033 --> 01:07:10,933
- Exactly.
- It's spot on.

1652
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:13,466
It's like a rose sauce.

1653
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:14,666
It wraps around your mouth.

1654
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:17,166
I really want to try that avocado.

1655
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,066
That seriously looks so good.

1656
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:20,000
Madam.

1657
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:22,833
(Try mine too.)

1658
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,966
(What could this be?)

1659
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:30,333
This is called boiling crab.

1660
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:35,066
I made it Korean-style with gochujang
and a bit of mapo sauce.

1661
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:36,766
I tried to make it Korean-style.

1662
01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:38,600
That seriously looks good.

1663
01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:47,100
The meat is packed
and just melts in your mouth.

1664
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:51,433
It was honestly delicious. For real.

1665
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:55,838
(The meat slid right out.)

1666
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,866
Reiling really likes it.

1667
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,733
Isn't it spicy?

1668
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,566
It's a bit spicy, but really good!

1669
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:05,400
I actually like spicy food.

1670
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,366
When you suck on it,
the sauce bursts in your mouth,

1671
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:11,966
and that's the best part.

1672
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,666
(Ok Vin goes for the claw meat.)

1673
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,500
(It's so good that I can't help but hum.)

1674
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:29,933
This one costs 20 dollars?

1675
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,379
He is digging in since it's pricey!

1676
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,748
"You said, 20 dollars?"

1677
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:43,433
This is seriously good.

1678
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,866
(He can really eat.)

1679
01:08:45,866 --> 01:08:48,066
(King crab is conquered in seconds.)

1680
01:08:48,066 --> 01:08:49,966
He is really enjoying that.

1681
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:52,066
Seriously, he eats so well.

1682
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,133
He makes it look so tasty,

1683
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:55,966
making you want to eat too.

1684
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:56,800
He eats so well.

1685
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,666
Nam No not only cooks well
but also eats well.

1686
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:00,600
- Right.
- Exactly.

1687
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,305
He makes it look really appetizing.

1688
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:04,233
(He even eats the legs thoroughly.)

1689
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:06,400
Do you know that saying?

1690
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,833
"If a chef looks scrawny,
his food probably isn't good."

1691
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:12,866
Skinny chefs just don't inspire trust.

1692
01:09:12,866 --> 01:09:14,800
- That's true.
- Facts.

1693
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,866
Are you dissing all the skinny chefs?

1694
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:19,133
(Fully trustworthy)

1695
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,133
(Pure happiness)

1696
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,866
The seasoning goes perfectly with it.

1697
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:30,333
Seriously, the sauce is amazing!

1698
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,934
That's the power of gochujang.

1699
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:35,300
Even with gochujang,
it's not muddy at all.

1700
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,700
Not at all!

1701
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,300
- Sometimes, gochujang can be too much.
- Exactly.

1702
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,777
This is seriously good.

1703
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,445
(Gochujang enhanced
the taste of the crab.)

1704
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,066
Reiling is totally hooked.

1705
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:51,933
- But doesn't his eating look classy?
- Right?

1706
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:53,000
He's so elegant when he eats.

1707
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,633
You know his wealth.

1708
01:09:54,633 --> 01:09:55,933
So graceful.

1709
01:09:55,933 --> 01:09:58,266
Compared to the chef,
he eats way more elegantly.

1710
01:09:58,266 --> 01:10:00,333
- The contrast is real!
- Right.

1711
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,033
He's eating like a beggar.

1712
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,902
(The beggar feels awkward.)

1713
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,739
He's trying everything
he can get his hands on.

1714
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,409
(The food that captured the taste
of the chef...)

1715
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,244
(who is gulping down the food)

1716
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,912
The cucumbers are really good.

1717
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,714
Cucumber salad.

1718
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,350
- Cucumber salad.
- The smashed cucumber salad!

1719
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,251
We ate all of it. It was all gone.

1720
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,887
The cucumber plays the role of kimchi.

1721
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:26,855
- Right.
- In this meal?
Yes.

1722
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,424
That's a relief. I was aiming for that.

1723
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,726
Its cool taste balances out the flavors.

1724
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,230
- I ate most of the cucumber.
- It was all gone.

1725
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:40,336
It's cool and very delicious.

1726
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,970
- She really likes it.
- I'm relieved.

1727
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,939
I was so nervous.

1728
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,509
Thank you.

1729
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,212
(I love it.)

1730
01:10:49,213 --> 01:10:50,279
What a relief.

1731
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,448
We should visit Korea sometime.

1732
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,884
- You should come.
- Welcome.

1733
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:57,987
He's definitely going to like Korea.

1734
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:01,557
(The first night in San Rafael
with a delightful crab party is waning.)
