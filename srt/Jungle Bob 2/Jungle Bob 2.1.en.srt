1
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:05,372
This is unbelievable!

2
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:09,643
How far are we going? This is so...

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,658
We're going really deep
into the darn true Amazon jungle.

4
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:18,413
Right into the heart of the jungle.

5
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:21,979
- We're in the jungle!
- We've never been to a real jungle.

6
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:23,946
I've only seen this in movies.

7
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:24,879
- Is that an alligator?
- It is!
It's a real alligator!

8
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,746
- There's something!
- There is!

9
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:32,400
(The Pacific Ocean)

10
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,234
It's huge!

11
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,785
It's out!

12
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:41,279
(The Andes Mountains)

13
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,379
We're up 3,720m above sea level!

14
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,879
It's crazy to see it up so close.

15
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,279
I can't believe it.

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,079
(The paradise of ingredients...)

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,613
(with those from the jungle,
the ocean, and the mountains)

18
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,779
(We're off to Peru,
the best foodie spot in South America.)

19
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:02,721
(Panting)

20
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:03,713
My goodness!

21
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:05,305
Oh, gosh!

22
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:07,679
Goodness!

23
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,713
We asked for potatoes
and were led to a potato farm.

24
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:12,913
We asked for some salt,
and now, we're at a salt farm!

25
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,492
We have to watch what we say.

26
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,779
- Stop asking for ingredients.
- Please stop.

27
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,479
- Let's just get to work.
- Right to work?

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,146
(They need to get...)

29
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:25,113
(every ingredient needed on their own.)

30
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,379
This is too tiring.

31
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,646
(They're harvesting,)

32
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:32,013
(catching,)

33
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:34,213
(and cooking everything on their own.)

34
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:36,279
We have to plant them all here?

their own ingredients)

on JUNGLE BOB 2.)

to getting the ingredients.)

before words)

47
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,679

(Clucking)

49
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:21,646
Egg.

50
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:22,946
(We'd like some eggs, please.)

51
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,079
(Wherever he is,)

52
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,613

59
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,479
- I'm getting emotional.
- Really?

60
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,779
Yes, I'm tearing up.

61
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,379
- You're quite emotional.
- Yes.

62
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,713
- Keep smacking the plates!
- Yes, Chef.

PERU BOB has begun!

65
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,479
Welcome!

66
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,946
I didn't expect to hear a fine-dining chef
call it "the darn true jungle."

67
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,779
He really called it
"the darn true jungle."

68
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:10,479
(The chef's one-liner on PERU BOB:
"The darn true jungle")

69
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,679
You're all a bit tanned.

70
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:15,813
Didn't you already shed a layer of skin?

71
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:17,179
Your arms are yellow!

72
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,579
How could you say that to a lady?

73
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,813
- "Yellow?"
- Come on!

74
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:23,070
(Friendly banter from the start.)

75
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:26,546
He doesn't look like a fine-dining chef.

76
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,313
Why is he tearing up?

77
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,679
Why are you tearing up as you speak?

78
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,113
Was it that difficult there?

79
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:35,479
When I was getting invited to the show,

80
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,479
the production crew called it
"a gourmet trip."

81
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,913
And they said that they were
equipped with everything...

82
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:42,079
so I could cook to my heart's content.

83
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,788
You had the show sound
like "Culinary Class Wars!"

84
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:46,047
They didn't say anything...

85
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,246
about having to get
the ingredients ourselves.

86
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:49,379
Seriously.

87
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,579
You were scammed for the job, then.

88
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,046
- He was scammed.
- It was "Extreme Job in Peru."

89
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:56,179
"Extreme Job in Peru!"

90
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,513
It's like he's just here to whine today.

getting scammed for the job?)

92

(13 hours and 40 minutes of flight)

94

- No.

(Atlanta)
(Another 6 hour and 40 minute flight)

97
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,946
Peru is really far.

98
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:18,746
It's a huge decision to go there.

99
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,146
It's not easy to get there.

100
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:21,813

Peru has jungles, mountains,
and the ocean.

107
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,013
It has everything.

108
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,446
That's why it's the land of gourmet food.

109
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:48,146
They have all sorts of ingredients.

What?

115
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:07,213
(It's called the furnace of flavors.)

116
00:05:07,213 --> 00:05:08,079
That's crazy.

117
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,879

Doesn't it feel
like we're getting kidnapped?

120
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,713
Isn't that a fisherman's boat?

121
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,979

122
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,679
- I feel like I'm going to throw up!
- Wait!

123
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:32,879
What?

124
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,879
We can't go on like this.

125

126
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:44,579
Oh, no!

127
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,046
(What happened to them?)

128
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,718
It's suddenly become
a mystery documentary!

129

(Is it a different genre now?)

130
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,846
This is the prelude to the job scam.

131
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,979
The prelude to the job scam.

132
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:00,913
- Hello.
- Hello.

133
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,646
Nice to meet you.

134
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:03,913
I know I'm a celebrity myself,

135
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:07,279

when they see one.

(The Peru cooking nuts' first time meet)

137

You two met up first.

138
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,079
You're so handsome.

139
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:17,246
You're also very well-known
for being a good cook.

140
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:20,913
Your chopping skills are
as proper as those of a chef.

141
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,146
Thank you.

142
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,013
And you're the legend of La Cucina.

143
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:26,346
I wouldn't call myself a legend.

144
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,746
I was...

145
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:30,179
just a top ace chef.

146
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:33,813
You're not such a humble guy type.

(The hottest men of the culinary industry
have finally met.)

148
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,179
As you know, it's a gourmet trip.

149
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:42,213
Is there an ingredient from Peru
that you really want to try cooking with?

150
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,079
Peru is really forward...

151
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,146
in its culinary culture.

152
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,979
People just think
of the tall mountains there,

153
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,779
so they assume
Peruvian food is all vegetables.

154
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,646
But I also want to explore
the ingredients from the ocean there.

155
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:57,513
Cooking with seafood is my strength.

156
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:02,013
I love getting inspired
and making my interpretations.

157
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:03,147
You were so excited for Peru.

158
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,213
I'm intrigued.

159
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:05,613
What I enjoyed most was...

160
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:10,913
learning the local ways of cooking
from the local village ladies.

161
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:11,847
That was the best part for me.

162
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:15,247
You can find so many inspirations
through that.

163
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:19,713
Sometimes, I'll show you
what a chef can do.

164
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,447
I'll cook you something...

165
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:23,577
- really good.
- Something gourmet.

166
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,080
Let's go...

167
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,047
and enjoy lots of good food.

168
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,847
I'd love that. Let's go!

169
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,580
- They were all smiley back then.
- Yes, they were...

170
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,280
(A month later in Lima, Peru)

171
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,847
(Hyun Seok has arrived in Lima
at 11:30 p.m.)

172
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:41,847
This was the longest flight of my life.

173
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:45,113
(Exhausted from the long flights)

174
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:50,880
Wait!

175
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,447

178
00:07:56,947 --> 00:08:00,147
Welcome to South America.

179
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,480
(The Chef Brothers have assembled.)

180
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:07,513
What an experience I'm getting,
thanks to me being your friend.

181
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:08,380
No.

182
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,413
- We're here because you're here.
- My gosh!

183
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,913
Things looked great until then.

184
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:14,947
You were both so happy.

185
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,513
They can't stop laughing.

186
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:18,880
(Without any idea of what's coming,
the Chef Brothers take a tour.)

187
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
There's even a kitchen.

188
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:22,680
Of course!

189
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,713
(Impressed)

190
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,480
- The counter is quite tall.
- Yes, it is.

191
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,513
And it's a gas stove.

192
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,213
The fire is quite strong too.

193
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,847
I can't wait. Your eyes are sparkling!

194
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,347
I thought that it'd be like this
the whole time.

195
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,247
Like a restaurant.

196
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,380
So, first...

197
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,280
What's that?

198
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:42,647
What is it?

199
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,280
This wasn't here earlier.

200
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,747
What's in here?

201
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:46,547
What's that?

202
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,247
Is it from the production crew or what?

203
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,447
It seems like it.

204
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:52,447
What is it?
What's that?

205
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:57,613
(Opening the envelope first)

206
00:08:58,347 --> 00:08:59,247
What is it?

207
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,680
"Dimafro."

208
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,980
- What is that?
- What is this?

209
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:07,813
(The first Tasty Mission card of PERU BOB)

210
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:17,047
(The card contains a clue
to today's ingredient.)

211
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:17,947
"Dimafro?"

212
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,713
What is this?

213
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:21,213
(A mysterious word and time)

214
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,980
(What's this?)

215
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:26,080
"Dimafro?"

216
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:28,480
He seems genuinely confused and startled.

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,780
(Actually confused)

218
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,080
- This...
- What's this?

219
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,113
It's that drawing.

220
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,480
The octopus monster
that destroys our planet.

221
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,847
What?

222
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,013
It has a name.

223
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,480
(The drawing on the card)

224
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,247
- The Kraken!
- Yes, the Kraken!

225
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,313
It's the Kraken!

226
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,180
- What?
- What is that?

227
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,213
(The ship-wrecking monster?)

228
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,747
- The Kraken?
- Yes, the Kraken.

229
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,780
(The Kraken, you say?)

230
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,113
(That's what we're cooking with?)

231
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,938
(Kraken? We'll be cooking with Kraken?)

232
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,274
- As far as I know.
- What's Dimafro, then?

233
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,743
Dimafro? Let me look it up.

234
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:03,812
(He starts looking up the word
that he sees first.)

235
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,847
What is Dimafro?

236
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,617
- I got a search result.
- You did?

237
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,355
- What is it?
- Here's what it says.

238
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,123
- Dimafro?
- Dimafro?

239
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:16,691
"Dimafro is the name
of a Peruvian fishing boat."

240
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:20,061
(It's the name
of a Peruvian fishing boat!)

241
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:22,163
(A fishing boat?)

242
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,265
It's a fishing boat.

243
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,534
It's the name of a boat.

244
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:27,435
Oh, it's the name of a boat.

245
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:32,874
(If Dimafro is the name of a boat...)

246
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,544
Is this a squid, then?

247
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,547
It looks like it.
I don't think it's an octopus.

248
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:42,617
- It's a boat for catching squids?
- That could be it.

249
00:10:42,618 --> 00:10:44,586
They must be going to catch squids.

250
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:46,387
I mean...

251
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,990
Seriously?

252
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:52,360
This is like asking us to go
to Sokcho in Korea...

253
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,263
and look for a boat called
"Hope Number Two."

254
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:56,565
Are they serious?

255
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,299
This is the name of a fishing boat.

256
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,334
That's when you started pouting.

257
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:03,338
- Oh, right.
- That's when it started.

258
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,406
That's when you stopped
exchanging compliments, right?

259
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,578
I think they want us
to get on a boat like that.

260
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:11,579
- Like a motorboat. Yes.
- On a boat for catching squids?

261
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:13,447
Seriously?

262
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:15,883
(The first ingredient
for the Tasty Mission in Peru)

263
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,885
(Giant squid)

264
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,687
- Why is it so big?
- What is this?

265
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,590
(It has a maximum length of 2m
and can weigh up to 60kg.)

266
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,595
(This squid is taller than a human.)

267
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,221
It can be bigger than a person.

268
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,223
(A typical ingredient of Peru.
It's called the Humboldt squid...)

269
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,525
- It's enormous.
- It's known to fight whales too.

270
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,394
(as it is distributed
along the Humboldt Current.)

271
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,464
We made it. Great job!

272
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,201
(Giant squid)

273
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,003
It's so big.

274
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,438
I mean, it's huge.

275
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,473
- It's like a monster squid. Really?
- Some are bigger than that.

276
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,509
If it's 60kg, it's as heavy as an adult.

277
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,311
Right. I weigh around 59kg.

278
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,346
- It would be as heavy as DinDin.
- Right.

279
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:59,318
(Today's goal)

280
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,454
(Board the Dimafro
and catch a giant squid.)

281
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,390
- I'm not going on it.
- He's already refusing to go.

282
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,125
He's making a face.

283
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,361
- I get seasick. Badly.
- You do?

284
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,295
I'm not kidding.

285
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,830
(His eyes are darting.)

286
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,999
- Should I go by myself, then?
- I'll stick to cooking.

287
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,435
That's the deal.

288
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,202
I know it makes me sound shrewd,

289
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,704
but I came here to cook.

290
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,472
I heard it was a culinary trip.

291
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,083
(This is a job scam.
They said it was a culinary trip.)

292
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,745
But shouldn't you see the ingredients
for yourself?

293
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,513
- I should.
- You have to see it for yourself.

294
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,382
- I have to see it,
- When it's still alive.

295
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,417
but I don't necessarily have to catch it.

296
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,187
But you have to catch it first to see it.

297
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,822
We came all the way to Peru.

298
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,725
Shouldn't we check out
what we'll be catching?

299
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,459
(This younger guy seems quite optimistic.)

300
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,462
If you pout a little more,
your lips will be longer than your nose.

301
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,765
They're almost the same length now.

302
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,034
(It looks like he really doesn't
want to go.)

303
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,502
Are we really getting on a boat?

304
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,404
I get seasick.

305
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,972
(At 1 a.m., they set off for the port.)

306
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,307
But he's just got there!

307
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,875
Let's go.

308
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,567
(Without having had a wink of sleep,)

309
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:02,794
(they get on a mysterious van.)

310
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,755
Where could we be going?

311
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,460
We're really boarding a boat, right?

312
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,878
- A boat to catch squids?
- For squids?

313
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,664
There was definitely Kraken on it.

314
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,733
(They're being taken to an unknown place.)

315
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,702
(This is familiar.)

316
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,003
(Giant Squid Game)

317
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,406
- "Giant Squid Game."
- Giant squid.

318
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,873
Sir.

319
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,376
Where are we going now?

320
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,481
I asked him where we were going,
but he didn't answer me.

321
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,982
Shall we check the map?

322
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,519
This really feels like "Squid Game."

323
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,421
The van is similar too.

324
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,457
(They're going
through the pitch-black darkness.)

325
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,726
- It's so late at night.
- He's taking an odd route.

326
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:49,660
It's late, but shouldn't there be...

327
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,330
at least a couple of houses
where the lights are on?

328
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:54,619
This is...

329
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,405
like the kind of place
where they smuggle things.

330
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:02,175
It's deserted.

331
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,912
They must've torn down
some buildings around here.

332
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,114
Some of the houses have holes in them.

333
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,849
(The van runs for a while...)

334
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,318
(and stops slowly.)

335
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,219
Where are we?

336
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,255
It looks like the dock.

337
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,125
(They've arrived at the dock.)

338
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,259
Here we are.

339
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,360
The dock.

340
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,099
Oh, what a fishy smell.
The smell of a real port!

341
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,369
The water is clear here.

342
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,272
Something's floating on it.
We've come to the right place.

343
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,673
(They arrived at the port at 2 a.m.)

344
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,943
- It's so beautiful.
- It's gorgeous.

345
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,878
- It's like a golden city.
- It looks so cool.

346
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,312
That's weird.

347
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,515
It didn't look like that when I saw it.

348
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,786
(Their priority is to find Dimafro.)

349
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:48,787
I mean,

350
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,256
they brought us here to cook.

351
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,593
There are no boats with lights on.

352
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,797
I guess we should keep walking.

353
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,035
(There's not a boat
with lights on in sight.)

354
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,403
(Why are they here at this hour
to catch squids?)

355
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,370
What is it?

356
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:09,941
(Giant squids can only be caught
between dusk and dawn.)

357
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,443
It has to be between dusk and dawn.

358
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,012
- We have to catch it before dawn.
- Oh, right.

359
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,515
It's not easy to catch squids.

360
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,617
(They must catch it before sunrise.)

361
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,451
(This is why they had to come here
without getting any sleep.)

362
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,887
It's so dark now.

363
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,522
(But they can't see the boat.)

364
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,490
I don't see the boat.

365
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,126
The weather is warm today.

366
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,329
Where is the boat supposed to be?

367
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,364
Where is it supposed to be?

368
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,170
(They go straight along the port.)

369
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,183
(Suddenly, they hear a motor running.)

370
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,242
There's a boat with the motor on.

371
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,012
Could that be it? Really?

372
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:48,014
Is this the boat?

373
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,527
I don't think so.

374
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:52,706
Seriously?

375
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:54,743
Did you really take that boat?

376
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,178
- Was that it?
- They asked us to get on it.

377
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,012
- Are you serious?
- No way.

378
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:01,081
(He's flustered.)

379
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:03,317
Is this the fishing boat?

380
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:04,485
Tell me about it.

381
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,820
(Is this the fishing boat
for the Pacific Ocean?)

382
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,522
Do you catch giant squids?

383
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,491
(Nodding)

384
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,060
(You catch them?)

385
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,095
Is this Dimafro?

386
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,563
Is this Dimafro?

387
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,398
- Dimafro?
- Dimafro.

388
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,166
(Yes, Dimafro.)

389
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:20,968
- What? No way.
- That can't be it.

390
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:22,369
- They can't go on that.
- This is Dimafro?

391
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,139
Is this really Dimafro?

392
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,907
(Will they catch giant squids
on this boat?)

393
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:28,442
Is it seriously this small?

394
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,444
If you just put two giant squids on it,

395
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,012
it'll sink.

396
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,515
This is...

397
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:37,585
This is Dimafro?

398
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,520
You can seriously look this up?

399
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:40,955
(Can you really find
this boat's name online?)

400
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:41,789
Okay.

401
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,457
(Too tired to argue, he boards the boat.)

402
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,594
Will they be able
to catch giant squids in it?

403
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:46,927
Is that even possible?

404
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:54,240
This is a fishing boat?

405
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,672
- This is Dimafro?
- It seems like it.

406
00:16:57,672 --> 00:16:59,306
(The giant squid
might be bigger than this boat.)

407
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:02,042
I think it will tip over
while catching it.

408
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,377
Sir.

409
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,379
Dimafro?

410
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,214
(Nodding)

411
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,315
I don't think this is it.

412
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,117
This can't be Dimafro.

413
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,386
Oh, hey.

414
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:14,121
We are going out to the sea.

415
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,757
What can we even catch in this?

416
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,427
Dimafro? This is...

417
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,965
(Only the seagull squawks in the silence.)

418
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,735
Are there really giant squids?

419
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:29,071
(Yes, there are.)

420
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,437
- What?
- Is he saying this is it?

421
00:17:31,273 --> 00:17:33,574
He says that there are giant squids here.

422
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:35,937
Giant squids...

423
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,347
Shouldn't we catch them in the deep sea?

424
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,347
I know, right?

425
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:41,782
We have to go further out,
but there are some over there.

426
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:44,818
- But on this boat?
- I don't think this is big enough.

427
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,721
If there are some waves,
it will easily tip over.

428
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:50,090
I get seasick too.

429
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,124
(The boat's size is nonsense.)

430
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:53,894
There's no way this is Dimafro.

431
00:17:54,562 --> 00:17:56,763
- How many times are you saying that?
- His eyes are...

432
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,966
He cried back then too.

433
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,833
His eyes are wet.

434
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,336
He can't believe
that any of this is happening.

435
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:04,571
He's on a culinary trip, after all.

436
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,641
(But the boat is...)

437
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,210
(heading towards the Pacific Ocean.)

438
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,177
What's going on?

439
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,084
There's a boat with the lights on
over there.

440
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,252
Isn't that Dimafro?

441
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,821
That must be a boat for catching squids.

442
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:21,855
(They spot a big boat with lights on.)

443
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:25,725
I see someone in there.

444
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,429
Can you cast a light on the boat?
I can't see it.

445
00:18:30,598 --> 00:18:32,132
Dimafro?

446
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,036
Dimafro?

447
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:39,373
(They found the real Dimafro.)

448
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:40,574
That's the real Dimafro.

449
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:42,810
- It looks pretty cool.
- Yes.

450
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,879
Is this really the boat?

451
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:48,348
Hello.

452
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:52,753
(They transfer from the boat
to Dimafro quickly.)

453
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:55,122
- They're changing boats.
- They're getting on it.

454
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,657
Hello.

455
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,896
(Smiling in relief)

456
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,935
(Thank you for being Dimafro.)

457
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,206
(They're finally aboard the Dimafro.)

458
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,475
- Is this Dimafro?
- Dimafro.

459
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,510
How many times is he asking?

460
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:17,978
(This is Dimafro.)

461
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:21,048
This is exactly the same size...

462
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:24,184
where I got seasick the most.

463
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:28,322
(They're aboard the real Dimafro
at 2:25 a.m.)

464
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:30,157
What do you feel about choosing "Dimafro"
as your English name?

465
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,125
I know.

466
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:33,393
- It could be Dimafro Choi.
- Hyun Seok.

467
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,161
- You know what you should do?
- Dimafro Choi.

468
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:37,297
- You can make a dish called Dimafro.
- Exactly.

469
00:19:40,902 --> 00:19:42,703
Put this on.

470
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,548
(He receives a fishing outfit.)

471
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:47,053
Why are we putting this on, though?

472
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,723
"Why are we putting this on, though?"

473
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:53,013
I shouldn't have trusted these TV people.

474
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:54,848
(This is far from a classy culinary trip.)

475
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,666
(They change into the outfit
for the Giant Squid Game.)

476
00:19:58,802 --> 00:19:59,652
This clothing...

477
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:02,616
(Participant One starts to enjoy it.)

478
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:07,210
Do you really think
this will inspire us to cook?

479
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,766
I'd feel fooled too if I was told
it's going to be a food tour.

480
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,550
It was supposed to be a food tour.
How is this one?

481
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,481
It's scarier than the real "Squid Game."

482
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:18,605
We're all set.

483
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:20,174
- Are you?
- Yes. Let's go.

484
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,636
(Is he the captain?)

485
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,073
- Captain, it's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

486
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:26,513
How can I say hello in Spanish?
Is it "Hola?"

487
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:27,522
Hola.

488
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,730
(Captain, please be nice to us.)

489
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,139
(Welcome aboard.)

490
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,015
We're cooks.

491
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,585
I'm a cook and also an actor.

492
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,015
A cook.

493
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,045
Sorry?

494
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,912
I'm a cook too.

495
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:46,894
- You're a cook?
- Cook?

496
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:49,506
(It's nice to meet you.)

497
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:53,841
(It just so happens
that there are three cooks on one boat.)

498
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:58,836
(Giant Squid Game departs at 2:40 a.m.)

499
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:02,416
(Four hours before sunrise,
two men sail in the pitch-black.)

500
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,867
It's so dark.

501
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,105
Welcome everyone to the Giant Squid Game.

502
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:12,126
Hey, friend.

503
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:13,977
He's telling us to do something.

504
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:18,345
This was supposed to be a food tour.
Why do I need to learn how to fish?

505
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,574
(Once you're on board, you're a sailor.)

506
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:27,841
(That means you'll have to work
as part of the team until morning.)

507
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:29,593
(I'm watching you, Koreans.)

508
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,995
He's like Lee Byung Hun in Squid Game.

509
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,097
(A mission for the interns)

510
00:21:34,097 --> 00:21:35,499
(Attach the giant bait to the hook.)

511
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:36,970
- He's telling us to do this, right?
- Yes.

512
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:41,338
That was the biggest lure I've ever seen.
It was huge!

513
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:42,252
How scary.

514
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:48,295
(Participant One is picking up
the game really fast.)

515
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:52,586
(I see he's a quick learner.)

516
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,263
(But what's wrong with that tall guy?)

517
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:58,285
(Awkward)

518
00:21:58,285 --> 00:21:59,856
I think he's stuck on the floor.

519
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:03,516
(Standing tall and rigid)

520
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:06,702
We should keep working.

521
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:12,159
(Participant Two is in danger
of being eliminated?)

522
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:17,007
I was told to be on a food tour.

523
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:19,309
A food tour...

524
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,135
(I thought
it was going to be a food tour.)

525
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,641
(But he's on a boat, struggling
with seasickness.)

526
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,119
It's more like a fool's tour to me.

527
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,920
He's feeling seasick in a fool's tour.

528
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:32,272
- So, is that why?
- A fool's tour.

529
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,758
That's more like it.

530
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:39,663
(By the way,
what's he working so hard for?)

531
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,200
(He's so skilled with the giant bait,
even though he's never seen it before.)

532
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,368
- Is it your first time fishing squid?
- It is.

533
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:46,470
How can you be so good, then?

534
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,898
He was a good teacher, telling me to wrap
the line around the rod four times.

535
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:54,478
(He's the perfect intern,
good at everything.)

536
00:22:54,578 --> 00:22:56,947
Thank you.

537
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:58,682
He said I was a quick learner.

538
00:22:58,915 --> 00:22:59,983
You're a bit of a braggart.

539
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,520
(Good for you.)

540
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,023
(A man standing tall like a lighthouse)

541
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:09,793
(Why is he here on a squid boat?)

542
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,294
(The first meeting was 45 days ago.)

543
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:17,197
I want to create something
no one can even imagine.

544
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:18,398
That'd be great.

545
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,003
- That's perfect.
- I want to do that.

546
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,805
You know I tend to do weird things.

547
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:23,690
You always try interesting things.

548
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,842
I like taking on new challenges.

549
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,578
I need to do something
that no one else would do.

550
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,514
I'm good at working with seafood.

551
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:37,724
(So what I want to do is...)

552
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:40,457
The giant squid...

553
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,643
(He's the one who suggested
the giant squid.)

554
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:43,493
Was it you?

555
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:45,365
What? Hold on!

556
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,181
(No way.)

557
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:51,358
- Blame your own words.
- Did I bring it up?

558
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:52,969
You said it yourself.

559
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,043
He can't believe what he said himself.

560
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,241
- He said it himself.
- Did I?

561
00:23:58,439 --> 00:24:00,009
Do I have amnesia?

562
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,022
You need to slice it thinly,

563
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:07,784
as the giant squid's meat tends
to be tough.

564
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,050
It's a bit tough.

565
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:11,855
It's indeed huge. It weighs about 60kg.

566
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,423
I think there are bigger ones.

567
00:24:13,423 --> 00:24:14,688
Only chefs can handle it.

568
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,493
You shouldn't just fry it.

569
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:18,182
You need to separate its legs first...

570
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,766
(His eyes looked like a 15-year-old boy's
when he talked about the giant squid.)

571
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:25,338
Once I get inspired,

572
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:28,815
the ideas just keep flowing.

573
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:31,532
(Should I not have said that?)

574
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,710
He said all these things himself.

575
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:41,888
(I told them to get squid,
and they got me a boat to catch them.)

576
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,243
(Did he pull himself together?)

577
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:46,118
- Dimafro.
- Dimafro.

578
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,619
Dimafro chef.

579
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,258
(Mumbling)

580
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:54,982
(Are you okay?)

581
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,734
- He's lost his mind.
- He needs some help.

582
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,403
(All of a sudden, he acts
like a patient from "The Trauma Code.")

583
00:25:00,704 --> 00:25:02,772
(Is that tall guy okay?)

584
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,808
(Maybe we should have checked him
before hiring.)

585
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,544
Dimafro, Dimafro!

586
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:09,413
- He's crazy.
- Crazy?

587
00:25:09,513 --> 00:25:11,214
(Got it.)

588
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:12,978
Dimafro?

589
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,973
(Let me handle it.)

590
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,805
He keeps mumbling the word "Dimafro cook."

591
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:20,180
He's talking randomly.

592
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,925
He's going insane.

593
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,459
When I find a word I like,

594
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:25,592
I just stick with it.

595
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:29,596
They said I could just eat and cook.

596
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,000
They promised me inspiration.

597
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:32,926
I don't think this will inspire me.

598
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:35,939
He's the biggest complainer I've ever met.

599
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,368
He can't stop complaining, can he?

600
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:40,376
- Tell me about it.
- My stomach hurts.

601
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,411
(Hyun Seok faces reality at 3:25 a.m.)

602
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:46,049
(About 20 minutes later,
in the South Pacific Ocean)

603
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:47,780
(Gagging)

604
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,386
(The boat is rocking harder at night.)

605
00:25:50,386 --> 00:25:51,417
Is someone seasick?

606
00:25:53,256 --> 00:25:54,106
Are you okay?

607
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:56,396
(Hyun Seok looks exhausted
from seasickness.)

608
00:25:56,496 --> 00:26:00,296
(He's fighting seasickness on his own.)

609
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:03,533
(Someone is chatting loudly in Spanish.)

610
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,436
(No matter how hard he tries to escape,)

611
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:09,139
(Su Young's voice follows him everywhere.)

612
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:13,020
(He's suffering from both seasickness
and the noise.)

613
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:15,612
(Is he done chatting now?)

614
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:17,447
Don't you smell a dog?

615
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,247
- Is there a dog on a boat?
- A dog?

616
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,384
Don't you smell a dog?

617
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,412
Why would he smell dogs?

618
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:24,858
(Why would you smell a dog
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?)

619
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:26,015
Su Young.

620
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:28,574
I'm sorry.

621
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,961
- I don't think I'll be able...
- Yes?

622
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:35,198
to answer your questions for a few hours.

623
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,100
He might puke while trying to answer.

624
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,119
(Please don't ask me.)

625
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:41,655
(Poor him.)

626
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:44,123
(He immediately starts talking
to someone else.)

627
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:46,132
He doesn't hesitate to switch
to someone else.

628
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,968
Will there be a lot of squid
at the spot we're heading to?

629
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:52,379
I'm not sure. They must be under the sea.

630
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:56,850
It's very cold in Korea in January.

631
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,521
I think he needs to take a break too.

632
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,435
(Getting tired)

633
00:27:02,535 --> 00:27:03,630
(But he never gives up on talking.)

634
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,461
Why do you keep talking to him?

635
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:07,434
You're making everyone sick.

636
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,468
(This chatterbox kept talking
about various topics.)

637
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,339
Gosh. I think I understand
how Hyun Seok feels.

638
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:19,641
(We're definitely not compatible.)

639
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,511
- His ears are bleeding.
- Why does the CGI look so real?

640
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,536
Maybe it wasn't CGI.

641
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:26,346
Can ceviche be made with giant squid?

642
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:27,474
Yes.

643
00:27:27,574 --> 00:27:29,950
(Ceviche?)

644
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,857
We make ceviche with squid and fish.

645
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:36,927
(Are you talking about ceviche?)

646
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:38,896
(It's Peruvian soul food.)

647
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:42,165
Ceviche is a traditional Peruvian dish...

648
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:45,468
that dates back over 2,000 years.

649
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:49,572
(It's a nutritious food
for Peruvian fishermen.)

650
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,235
(Its sourness helps soothe seasickness.)

651
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,909
It works for sea sickness too?

652
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:58,365
We have some ingredients for ceviche.

653
00:27:58,365 --> 00:27:59,215
Let's go.

654
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:05,035
(It's 4:10 a.m., time to make ceviche
to help relieve seasickness.)

655
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:09,236
(He shows up
holding something in his hands.)

656
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:12,399
It's fish for ceviche.

657
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,363
It's bonito.

658
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,864
(In Peru, they enjoy it grilled and raw.)

659
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:15,714
It's bonito.

660
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:20,213
You're going to eat
that freshly caught fish on the boat?

661
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:21,063
Yes.

662
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,244
The local chef is going to cook it
for them.

663
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,913
He's the cook of this ship.

664
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:31,124
- I'll fillet it first.
- I see.

665
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,183
The knife is very sharp.

666
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:36,352
He's very skilled.

667
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,834
(Bonito ceviche:
1. Fillet the bonito along the grain.)

668
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,825
- Its meat must be very soft.
- It must be.

669
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,592
I've caught bonito before,
and its meat is very soft.

670
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,162
If the knife isn't sharp enough,
the meat will get all mushy.

671
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,098
That's amazing.

672
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,859
Now I'll peel.

673
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,170
I'll fillet it.

674
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:57,198
- He wants to try it?
- I was surprised that he volunteered...

675
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:59,105
while suffering from seasickness.

676
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:01,712
(First, he strikes a pretty pose.)

677
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,379
Why is he sitting like a mermaid?

678
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:06,482
You need to do
a five-piece filleting for this.

679
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:08,268
(His legendary knife skills begin.)

680
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:08,996
(Five-piece filleting)

681
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,404
(Make an initial cut along the backbone,
then separate the four fillets.)

682
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:11,254
I feel dizzy.

683
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:13,523
If you're feeling dizzy,
be careful with the knife.

684
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:14,878
(Despite the seasickness,)

685
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,317
(his knife skills are precise.)

686
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:18,461
How cool.

687
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:20,655
(Even when the boat is rocking...)

688
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:22,098
The boat is rocking so hard.

689
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:26,353
(I'll do it my way.)

690
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:30,584
(Is he done already?)

691
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:33,643
That's perfect.

692
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:36,145
That's a perfect cut.

693
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:37,377
It's perfect!

694
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,881
That's awesome.

695
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,568
You filleted it perfectly.

696
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:41,443
He's a pro.

697
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:43,670
You're so good.

698
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,125
He said he was so good.

699
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:47,180
- He acknowledged him.
- He complimented him.

700
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,498
Gosh. I'm getting sick.

701
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:50,760
It feels like we're cooking in a car.

702
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:52,172
Thank you.

703
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,730
He looks like he's about to vomit.

704
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,755
(I've used up all my energy.)

705
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,314
(See how I finish it, Korean.)

706
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:03,663
(With a knife
that the chef's pride indwells)

707
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:04,688
(Chopping)

708
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:07,199
That must be delicious.

709
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:08,674
He dices it.

710
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:12,488
(2. Dice the bonito into bite sizes.)

711
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,307
Su Young is absorbing that technique.

712
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,288
How is he standing like that?

713
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:17,388
(The core strength
that doesn't waver on board)

714
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:19,689
I said that because the boat
was rocking this hard.

715
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:21,121
His core strength is on another level.

716
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:22,588
Yes, that's his core strength.

717
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,655
(Acrobatic performance brings him back.)

718
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:26,755
- That's crazy.
- It's rocking a lot.

719
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:27,955
(The ceviche show is performed
only on the heaving South Seas.)

720
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:31,555
(Super-thinly sliced red onion)

721
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,246
(Lemon drop pepper)

722
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:37,788
(On top of sliced raw fish,)

723
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:40,788
(he simply just sprinkles salt.)

724
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:41,867
Onions.

725
00:30:42,021 --> 00:30:45,021
(Covering them with a pile of red onions)

726
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:48,440
That's the lime.

727
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:51,471
He used about eight limes.

728
00:30:52,388 --> 00:30:53,921
That's a lot of limes.

729
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,588
(Primary shaking
with plenty of lime juice)

730
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,648
I see.

731
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:01,587
The lime juice cooked the fish a bit.

732
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,522
I see the milky-white juice coming out.

733
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,355
That should be salty and tangy.

734
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:08,088
That must taste so fresh.

735
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:09,188
(The second shake is
more skilled and evenly done.)

736
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:16,155
(Amidst everyone watching it
with breathless interest)

737
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:19,955
Cilantro.

738
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:22,355
(Pumping up the flavor
with cilantro and pepper)

739
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,688
(Bonito of South Seas
and the fisherman's skills)

740
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,255
(Does that complete
the original ceviche of Peru?)

741
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:28,021
That has to be good.

742
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,755
About a half of the fish is cooked.

743
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,355
(And the last kick is added.)

744
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:36,814
(Toasted corn)

745
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,097
(Cancha is an Inca corn that can add
sweet flavor and nutrition to ceviche.)

746
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:42,588
It's a corn,
but a kernel of it is as big as a thumb.

747
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:44,188
- Seriously?
- It's huge.

748
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:45,288
(Peruvian's hearty meal)

749
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:46,521
That looks scrumptious.

750
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:47,488
Ceviche.

751
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:49,630
Thank you so much.

752
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,788
(Peruvian DNA, how does ceviche taste?)

753
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,928
(Chef Choi chooses to have corn first.)

754
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:02,080
(Crunchy)

755
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,216
Gosh.

756
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:06,318
How can it be so good?

757
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:12,555
The texture of corn is like
that of starchy potatoes.

758
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,555
I agree.

759
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:14,621
(Starchy potatoes are used
in stew or curry.)

760
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:16,079
It is pretty similar to starchy potatoes.

761
00:32:18,321 --> 00:32:21,885
It may look like a corn,
but it's not actually.

762
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,721
They go so well.

763
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:24,988
(It has a fluffy texture
and it's filling.)

764
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,206
I almost thought I just ate French fries.

765
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:28,955
It's so crunchy!

766
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,666
Something just spreads out in your mouth,
just like when potato starch does.

767
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:38,021
(Shall we taste ceviche now?)

768
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:46,555
(This reaction from him
is quite familiar.)

769
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,619
Seriously... Goodness...

770
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:49,721
It's good.

771
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,322
It's tasty.

772
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:53,432
It's really good.

773
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,435
Delicious!

774
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:02,665
It's savory and so fresh.

775
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:05,821
The flavor of bonito just explodes
in my mouth.

776
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:07,255
And as soon as pepper kicks in,

777
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,150
onions bring them all together in one.

778
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,622
The cilantro doesn't stick out
too much either.

779
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:17,823
You can taste that ceviche only there.

780
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:19,521
It's super good.

781
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:21,521
(Beside Su Young,
who is constantly admiring the food,)

782
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,821
(a guy is tasting it with all his might.)

783
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:28,221
(Just like Beethoven
right before his last concert)

784
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,161
A gourmet trip
that turns your stomach inside out!

785
00:33:31,864 --> 00:33:33,572
Is he enjoying it,
or is he just feeling ill?

786
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:38,388
Is it good?

787
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:40,355
Very good.

788
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:43,788
(You must really like it.)

789
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,921
(Well, he sure knows about food.)

790
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:51,089
Compared to the ceviche I ate in Korea,

791
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:54,578
it's more flavored and salty.

792
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,265
What's special about it is...

793
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:01,744
that they put toasted corn,
which keeps the overall taste balanced.

794
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,132
Very good.

795
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:05,999
(That tall guy knows
how to enjoy good food.)

796
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:09,507
(Only available in Peru)

797
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:13,099
(Only available at this place)

798
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,632
(The South Seas ceviche
can only be tasted on board.)

799
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:21,914
(Anyway, besides tasting ceviche...)

800
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:25,001
When do we catch squid?

801
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,399
- Squid?
- Yes.

802
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,503
I mean...

803
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,205
How far are you guying going?

804
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,132
- Just to catch squid...
- They sailed to the other country.

805
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:32,332
- They just keep going.
- To the country beside.

806
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:33,799
- All they did was just eat.
- It took about an hour.

807
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,299
How far are you guys going?

808
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,846
Maybe they're heading to Chile.

809
00:34:37,532 --> 00:34:42,199
(At that moment, the boat paused.)

810
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,199
(Looking around)

811
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:49,665
(Suddenly, a bird flies over their heads.)

812
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,132
- Oh, my!
- What is going on?

813
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,965
(And dozens of birds follow along.)

814
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:56,165
What's happening?

815
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:58,465
(The sailors become busy all of a sudden.)

816
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,063
(The mood in the air seems serious.)

817
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,932
(The old saying about fishing)

818
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:06,732
(Where the bird flies low, fish exists.)

819
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,232
So where the birds are, there are fish?

820
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,246
Birds come to hunt.

821
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:18,465
(They finally run into them
after sailing a long time in dawn.)

822
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,124
(A swarm of giant squids)

823
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:27,999
(The golden time to fish giant squid
is from twilight to dawn.)

824
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,566
You went pretty far out.

825
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:35,899
(And this is the last chance.)

826
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:41,165
(Deep down the sea below where they stand)

827
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,532
(The first ingredient in Peru)

828
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:47,565
(Giant squid inhabits.)

829
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,674
(Aim for the time...)

830
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,432
(when they swim toward the surface...)

831
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:55,632
(to forage for food.)

832
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:57,165
- Did you see the birds just now?
- Yes.

833
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,065
What do you think there is
under those birds?

834
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,796
- Fish.
- Squids are there.

835
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,632
His energetic and vigorous voice tone...

836
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:08,360
amplified the fatigue.

837
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,640
Right.

838
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:13,965
(Fishing giant squids begins.)

839
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:17,732
(It's somewhat tensed up on the deck.)

840
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:19,265
(Hastily giving out hand signals)

841
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:20,383
What is he saying?

842
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:22,588
Drop the rope up to 15 meters.

843
00:36:22,815 --> 00:36:23,803
Goodness.

844
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:25,988
About 15 to 20 meters?

845
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,399
(Roger that.)

846
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,632
(A man of 41 years of experience
gets himself together.)

847
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:31,627
Cast it far?

848
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,165
(Here we go.)

849
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:38,999
(It's important to toss the bait
far from the boat.)

850
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,682
Now, pull up the rope until it gets tight.

851
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,099
(Casting)

852
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,165
(Su Young also tosses the bait
pretty nicely.)

853
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:51,432
What do I do? Do I just hold it up?

854
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:52,782
Or do I make a motion?

855
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:55,465
(What do you mean?
Don't you know how to play hard to get?)

856
00:36:56,165 --> 00:36:59,632
(The reason they play games
with giant squids)

857
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,732
(It's because giant squids
can be caught...)

858
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:05,699
(only by line fishing.)

859
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,732
(Lures need to be moved
to lure the squid.)

860
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:10,432
- Wait, is he pulling up with bare hands?
- That's right.

861
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:12,965
- Why? How?
- But that weighs about 60kg,

862
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:14,365
and all they use is
that single fishing line?

863
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,364
When you fish without the rod,

864
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:19,365
it feels like you're hit by a car
the moment something is caught.

865
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,965
You feel it immediately.

866
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:22,632
After you pull it out with all your might,

867
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:25,499
what you get is a squid about this size.

868
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:28,199
- Even the small ones are that strong.
- Yes, their strength is something.

869
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,985
So, I can't even imagine
how strong the giant squid is.

870
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,922
We should be catching them
since the sun is coming up.

871
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,658
This is the time.

872
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:37,665
I need to move it up and down.

873
00:37:37,665 --> 00:37:39,999
(They swiftly switched
into a fishing mode.)

874
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:45,232
(Their pride as anglers is at stake!)

875
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,899
(Today's Eo Nam Seon represents
fish, south, and kindness.)

876
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:52,297
(Getting the spirit the name gives him)

877
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,807
(It's time to wait
for the giant squid to answer.)

878
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:55,866
They feed themselves at a particular time.

879
00:37:57,624 --> 00:38:01,291
(Everyone waits in silence.)

880
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,432
(Among them, Choi seems the most haggard.)

881
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:07,189
It looks like he's going to throw up.

882
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,425
When I was
on "The Fisherman and the City,"

883
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:12,132
I threw up numerous times,

884
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,587
but I still caught the huge one.

885
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:17,155
Once he feels its bite, it'll all go away.

886
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:22,307
(Fellow chef approaches Choi,
who's struggling.)

887
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:23,265
What did he say?

888
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:29,416
(He talks to him in Spanish.)

889
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,285
From 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock every morning,

890
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:39,974
we've caught a good number of squids
at this sea.

891
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:41,565
He's telling him not to give up.

892
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:43,699
He doesn't understand Spanish,
but he keeps talking anyway.

893
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:44,693
I know.

894
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:47,065
He knows he wouldn't understand,
but still...

895
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,265
(He leaves after cheering him up.)

896
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:50,965
(However, that didn't last long.)

897
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,707
Good riddance...

898
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,665
- He's not so young for that.
- Oh, gosh.

899
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,899
I know how hard the seasickness is.

900
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:01,332
- It's not about your age.
- That's true.

901
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,832
(He didn't expect this gourmet trip
would give him such a hard time.)

902
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,465
(Meanwhile, the chatterbox of the Pacific
is quiet, unlike usual.)

903
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,220
I'm terribly sleepy. What should I do?

904
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,674
You get struck by drowsiness...

905
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,765
(On the deck. Join us...)

906
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:18,207
Now that we've seen this,

907
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:20,399
don't you think it's so lucky
that we got there late?

908
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,465
I know.

909
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:24,365
- We got there at the perfect time.
- I'm so glad...

910
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:26,235
we didn't have to get on that boat.

911
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,299
(There's been nothing for an hour.)

912
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:32,291
- No bites for an hour? Not even once?
- No, not once.

913
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,532
(They keep trying to lure the squid.)

914
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,299
(Choi has almost reached his limit.)

915
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,932
But is that...

916
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:41,143
Oh, I feel so bad.

917
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:45,165
(He's holding out as much as he can.)

918
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,365
I feel so bad for him.

919
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,424
Oh, no...

920
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:49,832
Are you okay?

921
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:51,365
(But his seasickness worsens.)

922
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:55,865
(Is it reasonable to continue?)

923
00:39:55,865 --> 00:39:57,632
I need to catch one.

924
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:00,768
(Su Young's bait is gone.)

925
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:06,331
(The sailor's bait...)

926
00:40:06,332 --> 00:40:08,500
(is gone.)

927
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:11,903
(There's an air of failure on deck.)

928
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:12,837
Hang on.

929
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:17,843
(But at that moment,)

930
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:21,447
(Choi got something.)

931
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:23,081
- Choi!
- Hyun Seok.

932
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:25,050
- Please.
- Choi's got something.

933
00:40:25,051 --> 00:40:26,385
I bet he caught one.

934
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:30,989
(They move busily on the deck
all of a sudden.)

935
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,657
The boat is rocking so hard.

936
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,963
(The fishing line feels heavy?)

937
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:44,837
I'm adjusting the strength
because it's still not sure about coming.

938
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,939
- Let's go!
- Did he get anything?

939
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:52,911
(Hyun Seok versus giant squid)

940
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:54,012
But...

941
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,513
- What?
- Is it moving on to next week?

942
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:56,915
Is it over?

943
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,351
- He caught it.
- Wait.

944
00:40:59,352 --> 00:41:00,519
What?

945
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,587
Did he catch it or not?

946
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:02,787
- Didn't he?
- Why are you skipping the process?

947
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:05,090
Didn't he catch it? He already trimmed it.

948
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:06,124
Just like that?

949
00:41:06,226 --> 00:41:07,193
- It's too sudden.
- Yes!

950
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:10,362
(And the two chefs stand in front of it.)

951
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:15,300
(What happened?)

952
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,403
- It's gigantic.
- It's huge.

953
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:19,904
What's the length?

954
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,441
Including the legs,
it should be about 180cm.

955
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:23,809
(It's 180cm long.)

956
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,012
The big suckers are as big as human ears.

957
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:28,514
Just one?

958
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,248
(Their long-awaited first ingredient
in Peru)

959
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:32,183
I'd be scared to see it in person.

960
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:33,419
- I know, right?
- Right.

961
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,153
It'd be terrifying to see it in the ocean.

962
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,489
(It's got enormous suckers,)

963
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,491
(a body as thick as a cotton comforter,)

964
00:41:39,492 --> 00:41:41,827
(and a head that fills the whole table.)

965
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:43,228
It should be almost 180cm.

966
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:46,632
- It's like Daniel is lying there.
- It's as tall as I am.

967
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:47,465
Indeed.

968
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:49,491
How would you catch that
just with your hands?

969
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:50,502
It must be so strong.

970
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:52,137
You seemed way too exhausted...

971
00:41:52,138 --> 00:41:53,405
- to even lift it.
- Right.

972
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:55,207
Did they rescue you
after you fell into the ocean?

973
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,341
It's impossible to pull it.

974
00:41:56,342 --> 00:41:58,109
I'm sorry, but did you just return
from Peru yesterday?

975
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,645
Why are you so tired?

976
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:00,744
He looks haggard.

977
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,748
That's the face he made
when he was on the boat.

978
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:04,016
It's like they returned yesterday.

979
00:42:04,016 --> 00:42:05,316
Why do I feel so sad?

980
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:08,587
(What on earth happened?)

981
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,991
(A giant squid bit his bait?)

982
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,727
(Choi has the first bite of the day.)

983
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:18,330
- We got it!
- Here it comes.

984
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,866
- It's coming.
- We got one.

985
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:24,369
(Only if I catch this creature,
we can eat.)

986
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:26,205
- Here it comes.
- We're done for the day.

987
00:42:28,174 --> 00:42:29,074
Did he get it?

988
00:42:29,642 --> 00:42:30,610
(Nothing)

989
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,943
- What?
- What?

990
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:33,778
What is that?

991
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,613
Did you not catch it?

992
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:37,916
- You failed to catch it?
- You should at least catch a yellowtail.

993
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,921
(Dispirited)

994
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,858
(Even talkative Su Young is quiet)

995
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:49,928
It's heartbreaking to watch.

996
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,430
It's so heartbreaking.

997
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,300
Let's go back!

998
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:58,870
It means it's time to wrap it up
if you still haven't caught one.

999
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:07,045
Let's get out of here.

1000
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,246
What's wrong?

1001
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:09,647
What are they saying?

1002
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:11,316
Are we going back?

1003
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,091
We need to go back.
You can't catch anything due to the sun.

1004
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:25,130
(They decided to sail back at 6:15 a.m.)

1005
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,365
Are you serious?

1006
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,933
- You're lying!
- We were on the boat for four hours.

1007
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,034
You just left?

1008
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:31,703
- There was no choice. The sun was up.
- Seriously?

1009
00:43:32,405 --> 00:43:33,939
We should catch one, though.

1010
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,240
You just went back?

1011
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,441
You didn't catch anything?

1012
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:37,742
(Dispirited)

1013
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,377
I feel so bad for them.

1014
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,114
(Don't be too sad, friends.)

1015
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:50,989
(You can get giant squid at the market.)

1016
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,858
(The market?)

1017
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:55,460
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

1018
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:58,062
They bought it at the market!

1019
00:43:58,164 --> 00:43:59,931
Why did you even get on the boat?

1020
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:02,132
Is this for real?

1021
00:44:02,133 --> 00:44:03,340
- Oh, no.
- Seriously?

1022
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,140
I'm so grateful for the experience.

1023
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,005
(Clenching his teeth)

1024
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:08,206
Why did you go in the first place?

1025
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:12,777
(On their way to the market at 9:10 a.m.
after staying up all night on the boat.)

1026
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,480
I stayed up one night,
and it affected me so hard.

1027
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:16,511
I can't believe how severe it is.

1028
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,623
We should get some sleep on our way there.

1029
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:22,192
(Yawning)

1030
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,859
(25 hours on the plane,
2 hours at the hotel,)

1031
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,997
(and 6 hours on the squid-fishing boat.)

1032
00:44:26,021 --> 00:44:28,021
(They've been awake for 33 hours.)

1033
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,434
(Rustling)

1034
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,204
(Crumbling)

1035
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,641
(Curling up)

1036
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:39,276
(We pity these 2 guys
with an average age of 48.5.)

1037
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,811
I feel so bad for them!

1038
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:43,814
(Snoring)

1039
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,153
They've turned into squid.

1040
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:52,490
That's hilarious.

1041
00:44:52,491 --> 00:44:55,726
You should have gone to the market
after getting a deep sleep.

1042
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,862
- I know. It would have been easier.
- We had no idea.

1043
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:59,430
Why did you go through all that?

1044
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,131
They could have gotten one
in great condition.

1045
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,132
(We thought we could catch one.)

1046
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,968
(They drove an hour from the port
and arrived at the fish market.)

1047
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:05,869
Let's go.

1048
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,272
- Was it "pota?"
- "Pota."

1049
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,910
(Pesquero Fish Market)

1050
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,280
It's one of the largest fish markets
in Lima.

1051
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,582
(One of the largest fish markets in Lima)

1052
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:21,986
They look fresh!

1053
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:23,754
They were right there.

1054
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:26,056
- And they were freshly caught.
- Yes.

1055
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,358
They had just caught them.

1056
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:30,761
You could have gone there
after a sound sleep.

1057
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,864
- They have seaweed.
- Let me see.

1058
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,132
They're seaweed.

1059
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,967
(There are various shellfish and seaweed
at the entrance of the market.)

1060
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,504
They have so many types
that we normally don't eat.

1061
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,809
(His inspiration is coming back.)

1062
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:47,644
There are various kinds.

1063
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,380
What are these?

1064
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,281
(The seafoods look familiar yet new.)

1065
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,016
Oh, it's a sea urchin!

1066
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:54,217
Sea urchin roe?

1067
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,885
That's huge.

1068
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:57,888
How come it's so big?

1069
00:45:58,857 --> 00:45:59,757
They have rockfish.

1070
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:01,826
- Rockfish.
- Fat greenling.

1071
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,320
- Fat greenling?
- It's a fat greenling.

1072
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:05,148
- Fat greenling? Not a rockfish?
- Fat greenling.

1073
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:06,062
It's a fat greenling.

1074
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:09,967
It's got the texture of a monkfish,
but it's softer.

1075
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,768
Oh, I see.

1076
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,769
And it tastes...

1077
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,472
a little bland, so you usually dry it.

1078
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:16,807
But fat greenling roe is...

1079
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:20,744
very round, so they crackle in your mouth
when you roast them.

1080
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:23,180
He looks a lot better than before.

1081
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,150
My initial purpose was to be inspired.

1082
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,719
I think you'll be salty
until the end of this show.

1083
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:34,758
(Come on, my inspirations.)

1084
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,093
What are these?

1085
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,563
- What is that?
- What's that?

1086
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:40,998
They look like sharks.

1087
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,402
(Sharks are pretty common
in Peruvian fish markets.)

1088
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,137
- Sharks?
- Oh, my.

1089
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,272
What's this?

1090
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:50,941
(What is it?)

1091
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,211
That's a sea bream.

1092
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:59,350
(Peruvian sea breams are
exceptionally large.)

1093
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:02,652
(They stop at every stand to look around.)

1094
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,221
I think it's a blood clam.

1095
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,550
Those mussels look good.

1096
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:08,926
(It's the best shopping mall
in Peru for them.)

1097
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,261
That's paradise.

1098
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,834
- We need to buy our ingredients.
- Giant squid.

1099
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,936
(They forgot about giant squid
while browsing.)

1100
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,870
(They snap out of it
and look for giant squid.)

1101
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:22,940
They only sell scallops here.

1102
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,742
This way.

1103
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,278
What if they have
so many giant squids there?

1104
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:30,781
- "Pota?"
- "Pota."

1105
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,717
They have small squid too.

1106
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,552
Those are squid?

1107
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,853
That's still big.

1108
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:39,656
No.

1109
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:40,791
A big one.

1110
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,128
- "Pota?"
- "Pota?"

1111
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:45,159
Giant squid.

1112
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,365
(Rushed)

1113
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,234
Over here.

1114
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:53,804
They have giant squid.

1115
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,907
It's enormous!

1116
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,943
(Did they finally find it?)

1117
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:00,244
This is unbelievable.

1118
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,151
(This is a giant squid.)

1119
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:07,083
That's wild.

1120
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,154
(They've roamed around
on airplanes and boats.)

1121
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,757
- They're gigantic.
- They're huge.

1122
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:17,660
(Giant squid)

1123
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:20,463
Young Ji could wear one.

1124
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:21,699
You could cut it up and wear it...

1125
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,099
- when you feel cold.
- Hey.

1126
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,101
It's like a sleeping bag.

1127
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:27,771
(Grabbing it)

1128
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:28,872
It's really heavy.

1129
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,907
(Long)

1130
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,810
How much does it weigh?

1131
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:38,748
That's huge.

1132
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,186
(How much does one giant squid weigh?)

1133
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:43,086
How heavy is it?

1134
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:47,658
It's 11kg.

1135
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,126
Without the innards?

1136
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:50,127
That's incredible.

1137
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,197
(I finally got you.)

1138
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:54,898
That's the brightest we've seen him,
isn't it?

1139
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:56,633
That was his first laugh, right?

1140
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:59,302
- It was.
- That was his first laugh.

1141
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,503
That was his first laugh.

1142
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,805
I forgot what he looked like
when he smiled.

1143
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,874
(He lets his guard down
before the inspirational giant squid.)

1144
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,010
Giant squid or Peruvian squid...

1145
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,814
- may sound unfamiliar,
- Yes.

1146
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:11,682
but they're closely related to our lives.

1147
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,882
Really?

1148
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,386
- Take a look.
- These are...

1149
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:17,889
made of Peruvian squids.

1150
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,390
We've already been eating them.

1151
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:21,392
It says, "Peru."

1152
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:23,660
- Yes.
- "Dried shredded squid from Peru."

1153
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,028
It says, "From Peru."

1154
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,198
- Is this also from Peru?
- This is also from Peru.

1155
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,399
- Even the snacks are from Peru?
- Even the chips?

1156
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,468
That's interesting. I had no idea.

1157
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,335
None of us knew.

1158
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,204
So, we've all eaten giant squid...

1159
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,707
- Yes, we've been eating them.
- in our daily lives.

1160
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,773
- Yes.
- You're right.

1161
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,476
Excuse me.

1162
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,511
(Gobbling up dried shredded squid)

1163
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,380
- It's too good, though.
- You're not here to eat.

1164
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,582
- Hold on.
- Just feel the texture.

1165
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,450
- It's good. Right?
- I...

1166
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,452
You're like the guy eating
a long-legged octopus in "Oldboy."

1167
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,788
I've never seen anyone eat
dried shredded squid like that.

1168
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:52,222
- They looked like noodles.
- I mean,

1169
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,357
- have you starved for days?
- That's so funny.

1170
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,458
But it's so good.

1171
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,437
(Sweet and spicy dried squid is a must!)

1172
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:00,297
We really got it!

1173
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,563
It's crazy. It weighs ten kilograms!

1174
00:50:03,928 --> 00:50:05,867
What are you cooking with it? Calamari?

1175
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:08,227
(Thinking about cooking right away)

1176
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:10,004
Only if we could get some ocean quahogs.

1177
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:12,470
(Thinking with every brain cell)

1178
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,320
Okay!

1179
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,042
Let's keep it simple.

1180
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:17,722
(Seven days before leaving for Peru)

1181
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,372
(He's busy on an ingredient search...)

1182
00:50:20,758 --> 00:50:22,583
Let's see what I can cook in Peru.

1183
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,953
There's no way I can memorize this.

1184
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,226
Write up a recipe in Notes
of the video playing now.

1185
00:50:34,486 --> 00:50:37,798
Chef Choi came so prepared!

1186
00:50:38,263 --> 00:50:41,102
Here's a recipe called
"How to Cook with a Squid."

1187
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:42,163
(Using technology to write a recipe)

1188
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:45,072
There's something more respected
in a kitchen than a chef.

1189
00:50:45,072 --> 00:50:45,922
That's the ingredients.

1190
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,060
(A chef who always researches
and experiments)

1191
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,921
I coated the steak in doenjang.

1192
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:52,550
(A cooking scientist and a vongole master)

1193
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:54,452
(Choi Hyun Seok)

1194
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,520
(A man who can cook a cozy meal,
even in the jungle)

1195
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:01,756
(The K-homemade food master
and the cooking nut)

1196
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:04,302
(Ryu Su Young)

1197
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:07,659
(Ryu Su Young and Choi Hyun Seok
with the giant squid)

1198
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,299
(What will the two men
with different cooking expertise...)

1199
00:51:11,299 --> 00:51:13,968
(make with the giant squid?)

1200
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,258
I can't wait.

1201
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,972
Me too! I can't wait to see it.

1202
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:20,007
I can't believe
that we're cooking with a giant squid!

1203
00:51:20,408 --> 00:51:21,509
I'm going to make it taste delicious.

1204
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:26,915
(So determined)

1205
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,087
(The first Tasty Mission ingredient:
a giant squid)

1206
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:36,891
You could make two trucks
of Peanut Balls with that!

1207
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:39,461
I know!

1208
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:41,262
What parts are you going to use?

1209
00:51:41,596 --> 00:51:42,663
What do you want to use?

1210
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,680
The body.

1211
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:45,566
- The body?
- Yes.

1212
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,150
I just need...

1213
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:48,869
this much of the body.

1214
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:50,338
I'll use the legs, then.

1215
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:54,692
(You take the body,
and I'll take the legs.)

1216
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,809
(Getting right to operating on the squid)

1217
00:51:57,809 --> 00:51:59,380
What are you guys cooking?

1218
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,382
See how deep the knife goes in!

1219
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,702
Seriously!

1220
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:06,654
That's so thick!

1221
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,223
Look at how thick it is! That's insane.

1222
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:11,803
(So thick)

1223
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:12,853
Su Young!

1224
00:52:13,394 --> 00:52:15,296
How long are you going to take?

1225
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:17,962
- About 40 minutes.
- About 40 minutes?

1226
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:19,533
I'll try to finish cooking in 45 minutes.

1227
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:20,951
What time is it right now?

1228
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:23,638
It's 10:56 a.m.

1229
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,733
Our customers better come soon.

1230
00:52:27,675 --> 00:52:30,111
Su Young, please finish cooking
by 11:30 a.m.!

1231
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:31,716
Okay!

1232
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:32,647
This is exciting!

1233
00:52:33,638 --> 00:52:36,227
(Singing)

1234
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,252
- What was wrong with me?
- The forced excitement!

1235
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:40,054
He's forcing himself to sound excited.

1236
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,252
"This is exciting!"

1237
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:45,670
Anyone can tell that he's faking it.

1238
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,062
He hasn't slept all night! That's why.

1239
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:51,709
I remember the squid being really tasty.

1240
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,244
Of course, you had
a good night's sleep before that.

1241
00:52:54,065 --> 00:52:56,561
(He got the point.)

1242
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:59,610
(The kitchen: The fine dining zone)

1243
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,634
(The rooftop: The street food zone)

1244
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,594
The two guys have
completely different cooking styles.

1245
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:04,912
- Right.
- I bet.

1246
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,950
(Getting right down...)

1247
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:12,487
(to cooking)

1248
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:17,192
(Leaving the squid legs aside)

1249
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,163
(And adding the clams to the pot first)

1250
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:24,658
I'm making vongole.

1251
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:27,034
But it'll be different.

1252
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:28,169
Vongole?

1253
00:53:30,304 --> 00:53:34,088
(He's been experimenting with vongole
for 31 years.)

1254
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,643
(Starting with his first signature vongole
in 1995,)

1255
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:40,581
(from different flavors...)

1256
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,317
(to shapes...)

1257
00:53:42,417 --> 00:53:44,585
(and pasta types,
he's developed nine vongole dishes.)

1258
00:53:45,419 --> 00:53:47,055
(Chef Choi Hyun Seok's career history...)

1259
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:49,824
(shows the history of vongole.)

1260
00:53:50,725 --> 00:53:52,827
(The top vongole chef's special vongole,)

1261
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:55,497
(Sujebi vongole with giant squid)

1262
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:56,664
Sujebi?

1263
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:59,867
Of all the things
that you could've cooked,

1264
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:01,669
why did you choose sujebi?

1265
00:54:01,669 --> 00:54:04,071
It is because I can cook it very quickly.

1266
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:07,575
The sujebi dough has a nice texture,

1267
00:54:07,575 --> 00:54:09,844
- and you can eat it so easily.
- That's true.

1268
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:11,279
(It has a nice texture
and a familiar taste.)

1269
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:15,506
(Chef Choi's easy homemade sticky sujebi)

1270
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:19,053
(Ready to be hand-kneaded)

1271
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:21,689
(And adding some parsley...)

1272
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:22,733
(into the dough)

1273
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:25,426
I usually add the parsley later,
but by adding it now,

1274
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,551
I'm making the dough green.

1275
00:54:28,052 --> 00:54:30,087
No wonder it was green!

1276
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:32,567
(And then,)

1277
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:35,236
(it's time to knead the dough.)

1278
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:38,740
(Kneading away)

1279
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,220
Keeping the dough so dry made it so chewy!

1280
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,595
(Use all of your forearm muscles
to knead it.)

1281
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:47,448
It's hard to knead it when it's so dry.

1282
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:50,701
But that was what made it so chewy.

1283
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:56,628
(What's the next step?)

1284
00:54:57,492 --> 00:55:01,025
(Clanking noises)

1285
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:08,813
(What's this sound?)

1286
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:12,197
(Mincing away)

1287
00:55:14,932 --> 00:55:16,043
The noise from your neighbor!

1288
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:19,770
- It was intense.
- His neighbor!

1289
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,319
You're making him struggle
in so many ways!

1290
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,286
I know!

1291
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,275
How creative of you!

1292
00:55:26,004 --> 00:55:28,019
(The upper-floor neighbor is...)

1293
00:55:28,044 --> 00:55:30,995
(causing a huge ruckus
with his knife dance.)

1294
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,512
(He's mincing away
at a mystery ingredient.)

1295
00:55:34,537 --> 00:55:36,096
Are you mincing the squid?

1296
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:40,201
- Is that Su Young cooking?
- Yes.

1297
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:42,570
Why is he so loud?

1298
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,439
(Getting back in the zone,
ignoring that noise)

1299
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:51,055
(Quietly mincing the garlic cloves)

1300
00:55:51,896 --> 00:55:55,553
(Chop chop)

1301
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,198
It was so good
that we were cooking on different floors.

1302
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:01,286
(Quietly cutting the squid)

1303
00:56:02,189 --> 00:56:04,969
(Totally in the zone)

1304
00:56:05,997 --> 00:56:08,733
(The chef in the street food zone
is mincing away...)

1305
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:12,236
(at the squid's body,
Peruvian fish, and leek.)

1306
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:16,874
(Drumming away until his arms fall off)

1307
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:21,485
Done!

1308
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:23,257
That's forced too.

1309
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,278
(Another faking excitement moment)

1310
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:28,816
I'm familiar with that.

1311
00:56:29,538 --> 00:56:31,254
I look so fake doing that.

1312
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:34,205
Drumming is so hard.

1313
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,390
Let's see it!

1314
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,259
It looks like fish cake.

1315
00:56:39,921 --> 00:56:40,939
(Giant squid fish cake)

1316
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:41,814
You caught on so quickly.

1317
00:56:42,493 --> 00:56:43,901
I've never seen a fish cake made of squid.

1318
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:44,868
Me either.

1319
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,178
(Giant squid fish cake)

1320
00:56:47,178 --> 00:56:48,269
It's half plain and half spicy.

1321
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:51,319
(Giant squid fish cake,
half plain and half spicy)

1322
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:55,579
Koreans love half of everything.

1323
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,744
We have half of everything.

1324
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:58,946
Gochujang fish cake.

1325
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:01,088
Challenge accepted!

1326
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:03,050
- Gochujang fish cake.
- Gochujang fish cake?

1327
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:05,561
(Adding a spoonful of gochujang)

1328
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:08,188
- I don't think that I've ever seen that.
- Me neither.

1329
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:12,870
(Stir the mix with the knife...)

1330
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,071
(to blend it into the batter.)

1331
00:57:14,071 --> 00:57:15,696
He's a genius!

1332
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,399
How did he even come up with that idea?

1333
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:19,566
He made it so easily too.

1334
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,072
(The gochujang fish cake batter is ready.)

1335
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:27,858
(Half gochujang-flavored)

1336
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:28,876
It's time to fry it.

1337
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:31,308
The fish cake will taste really good.

1338
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:32,662
I can feel it already.

1339
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,355
(Nonchalantly dropping the batter
with the knife)

1340
00:57:39,353 --> 00:57:41,789
It's like watching a fish cake seller
make fish cakes.

1341
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:42,639
I know!

1342
00:57:46,237 --> 00:57:47,291
(Looking like the owner
of a fish cake shop)

1343
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:50,267
You don't need to coat it
in anything first?

1344
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,089
Yes, I already added some starch
into the mix...

1345
00:57:52,466 --> 00:57:54,291
- with some leek.
- You just need to deep-fry it?

1346
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:56,293
Yes, it's almost entirely seafood.

1347
00:57:56,293 --> 00:57:58,472
- It's almost all seafood.
- Yes, entirely seafood.

1348
00:57:59,537 --> 00:58:02,159
And it tastes so much better
if you add some sugar.

1349
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:03,009
Sugar!

1350
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:05,135
I can't wait for the gochujang fish cake.

1351
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,918
If it tastes good,
I'll make it at home too.

1352
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:17,658
Don't stick together, guys.
It's not time yet.

1353
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:19,460
Yes. Stay away from each other.

1354
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:22,763
Just stay in there for five minutes, okay?

1355
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:26,133
Don't stick together. Yes, good boys.

1356
00:58:26,773 --> 00:58:28,602
Good job on not sticking together.

1357
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:30,955
(Taking care of each piece
with compliments)

1358
00:58:30,955 --> 00:58:32,639
It smells wonderful!

1359
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:35,809
There's no way that this will taste bad.

1360
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,578
You're not Mr. Eo Nam Seon for nothing.

1361
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:42,883
It looks beautiful, right?

1362
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:44,718
Oh, my gosh!

1363
00:58:46,384 --> 00:58:50,801
(The bright red fish cakes are
making all of us drool.)

1364
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:55,126
(And some plain fish cakes
that we'll never get sick of)

1365
00:58:56,472 --> 00:58:58,432
- That looks so good!
- It looks incredible!

1366
00:58:58,457 --> 00:58:59,666
- It's all fish.
- That looks amazing.

1367
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,301
- I want to try it.
- Kids would love it.

1368
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:04,872
(Meanwhile, at the fine dining zone
on the first floor)

1369
00:59:05,072 --> 00:59:08,309
(It's time to make the sauce,
the highlight of vongole.)

1370
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:12,914
(Making some garlic oil)

1371
00:59:13,847 --> 00:59:15,816
I took one leg of the giant squid.

1372
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,203
The longest one.

1373
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:20,120
I figured that I could cut round slices.

1374
00:59:21,332 --> 00:59:24,181
(Adding the giant squid)

1375
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:32,957
(Extraordinary moving
of the executive chef of 31 years)

1376
00:59:32,957 --> 00:59:34,391
He looks so cool.

1377
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:41,859
(The squid slices are dancing
at his quick wrist snapping.)

1378
00:59:43,027 --> 00:59:45,323
(He took the unfamiliar ingredient,)

1379
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:47,852
(a giant squid, from Peru...)

1380
00:59:48,906 --> 00:59:52,623
(and made his own interpretation of it.)

1381
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,775
(Adding the flavor-packed clam broth)

1382
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,726
(Enhancing the flavor with butter)

1383
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:02,096
(Special vongole sauce...)

1384
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:05,496
(loaded with giant squid)

1385
01:00:06,563 --> 01:00:08,030
(When the sujebi batter is cooked,)

1386
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:12,330
(add it to the sauce.)

1387
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,963
(Giant squid vongole meets...)

1388
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:17,830
That's crazy.

1389
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:23,996
(chewy sujebi.)

1390
01:00:24,796 --> 01:00:26,596
You went there
expecting to do that, right?

1391
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:28,830
(Prick)

1392
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,996
(He showed off his professional skills.)

1393
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:33,796
That was heavenly.

1394
01:00:35,863 --> 01:00:40,596
(Now, cooking is almost done.)

1395
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,596
(Maybe not.
Is he still cutting the squid?)

1396
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,996
(Is he making another dish?)

1397
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,130
Once I minced it, I realized its meat
was softer than I thought,

1398
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,563
so I decided to deep-fry some too.

1399
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:49,430
That'll be delicious.

1400
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,996
(Deep-fried giant squid will be made...)

1401
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,196
(with thickly sliced body parts.)

1402
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,530
It looks like acorn jelly.

1403
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:02,463
(Its gelatinous texture is
on another level.)

1404
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:04,905
(Adding potato starch...)

1405
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,830
(and flour)

1406
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,863
(He puts the sliced squid meat in.)

1407
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,096
(After coating it evenly with the powder,)

1408
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:16,696
(he puts it into the boiling oil.)

1409
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,196
It's a Peruvian way.

1410
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,530
Do they fry it like that in Peru?

1411
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,130
In Peru, they coat it in powder,

1412
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:23,463
unlike how we use a wet batter.

1413
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:24,696
So, I used the Peruvian way.

1414
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,196
It was delicious.

1415
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:30,096
- You only coat them with powder?
- Only with powder.

1416
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,663
It's both the Mediterranean
and the South American way.

1417
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:33,830
It's also a good way to enjoy it.

1418
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,730
In that way, the meat won't come out.

1419
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:37,830
- No.
- Usually, it does.

1420
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,996
- Right.
- It's as crunchy as chips.

1421
01:01:42,463 --> 01:01:44,430
(Peruvian deep-fried giant squid)

1422
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,563
That was also good.

1423
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:51,563
(Crispy coat and tender squid meat
in one bite)

1424
01:01:51,563 --> 01:01:53,563
(If you're having fried squid,
you need some tteokbokki to go with it.)

1425
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:55,563
- What is that?
- We didn't have rice cake there.

1426
01:01:55,563 --> 01:01:57,830
So Hyun Seok made some from scratch.

1427
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:58,863
(Rice cake made by Hyun Seok)

1428
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:01,563
(Fresh giant squid)

1429
01:02:03,396 --> 01:02:04,930
(Adductor muscles and scallops)

1430
01:02:05,963 --> 01:02:09,196
(Various fresh seafood from the ocean
come together in one dish.)

1431
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:11,830
That looks insanely good.

1432
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,530
(Spicy, yet rich in flavor,
seafood tteokbokki)

1433
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:17,163
(Meanwhile, Hyun Seok is experimenting
with a new ingredient.)

1434
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:18,030
What is he doing?

1435
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:23,263
(What is this fish he just grabbed
from the market?)

1436
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:24,696
What fish is it?

1437
01:02:27,696 --> 01:02:30,947
The meat is incredibly soft and moist,

1438
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,763
not dry at all.

1439
01:02:33,896 --> 01:02:36,096
(He enjoys testing new ingredients.)

1440
01:02:36,096 --> 01:02:37,696
That's very interesting.

1441
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:43,896
(It will be transformed
by the hands of a food scientist.)

1442
01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:49,096
(He handles it delicately
to ensure both sides are cooked evenly.)

1443
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:50,063
That looks so delicious.

1444
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,296
(Then, he adds a strange liquid to it?)

1445
01:02:54,296 --> 01:02:56,296
What's that? What is he adding?

1446
01:02:56,663 --> 01:02:57,496
What's that?

1447
01:02:57,496 --> 01:03:00,730
(What's this mysterious water?)

1448
01:03:02,096 --> 01:03:03,313
(It's chicha de jora,)

1449
01:03:03,337 --> 01:03:04,972
(corn-fermented liquor
from the local market.)

1450
01:03:04,996 --> 01:03:06,263
I think they mixed it with water.

1451
01:03:06,263 --> 01:03:07,696
It smells like plum tea with water.

1452
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,296
- Is it like makgeolli?
- I think it's fermented.

1453
01:03:09,296 --> 01:03:10,163
So it's liquor.

1454
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:13,796
Chicha is good.

1455
01:03:13,796 --> 01:03:15,030
(He even gets...)

1456
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:19,730
(inspiration from a strange drink.)

1457
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:23,296
He's pouring corn makgeolli on the fish?

1458
01:03:23,763 --> 01:03:25,863
In Italian cooking,

1459
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:29,930
it's common to add wine or liquor
and boil it down.

1460
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,030
This way, you can make a sauce
using the broth.

1461
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,063
(Boiling the liquor helps
remove bad odors.)

1462
01:03:35,263 --> 01:03:36,696
Did you improvise it?

1463
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:37,696
Yes.

1464
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,796
I think Hyun Seok looks
even cooler in PERU BOB...

1465
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,763
- than in "Culinary Class Wars."
- Tell me about it.

1466
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:42,819
He whips up things...

1467
01:03:42,843 --> 01:03:45,206
- without any given clues.
- He looks cooler in this kitchen.

1468
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,830
He's much cooler.

1469
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:51,230
That's the cool Hyun Seok I know.

1470
01:03:51,963 --> 01:03:54,730
But today, I've only seen
a strange side of him.

1471
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,532
(Gagging)

1472
01:03:57,896 --> 01:04:00,130
(He's charming,
with so many unexpected sides to him.)

1473
01:04:00,596 --> 01:04:03,030
(He effortlessly squeezes
the lime juice out.)

1474
01:04:03,963 --> 01:04:07,696
(Now, the fish will be simmered
in the corn liquor and lime juice.)

1475
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,330
(Peruvian braised liza)

1476
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,363
- I can't take my eyes off.
- That must be good.

1477
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,196
(Meanwhile)

1478
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,663
(In front of their lodging)

1479
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:19,830
Here they come.

1480
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:23,496
(Reliable assistants,)

1481
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:28,163
(Ok Vin and Daniel, arrived in Peru.)

1482
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,296
(Hurrying to the door
in the middle of cooking)

1483
01:04:37,296 --> 01:04:38,130
Is this the place?

1484
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,796
- Hello.
- Hi.

1485
01:04:40,796 --> 01:04:42,996
I'm cooking right now.

1486
01:04:42,996 --> 01:04:44,096
- Okay.
- Come on in.

1487
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:46,363
- Hello.
- Sorry that I can't greet you for long.

1488
01:04:46,363 --> 01:04:48,030
- I have dishes to finish.
- It's all right.

1489
01:04:48,296 --> 01:04:52,030
That's very gentle of him to welcome them,
considering his character.

1490
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,296
You're lucky
that he opened the door for you.

1491
01:04:54,396 --> 01:04:56,096
We didn't know just until now.

1492
01:04:56,096 --> 01:04:57,163
Right.

1493
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:58,363
We didn't know back then.

1494
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,230
Watch out for the stairs.

1495
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,930
- All right. Hello.
- Okay.

1496
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,330
You're way too handsome.

1497
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,430
We look really awkward.

1498
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,130
He keeps complimenting you for no reason.

1499
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:08,396
(Hurrying back to the kitchen)

1500
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,896
(He's busy finishing up the plating.)

1501
01:05:12,763 --> 01:05:13,963
Hello.

1502
01:05:13,963 --> 01:05:15,596
- Hello!
- Nice to meet you.

1503
01:05:16,396 --> 01:05:19,063
(We're here, Su Young.)

1504
01:05:19,063 --> 01:05:20,196
Welcome.

1505
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:22,196
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

1506
01:05:22,196 --> 01:05:23,453
You must be tired
after traveling all the way.

1507
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:25,096
- Hey!
- How are you?

1508
01:05:25,096 --> 01:05:26,763
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1509
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:28,930
- Did you stretch your legs?
- Yes. We took a break.

1510
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,963
I'm glad you did.

1511
01:05:29,963 --> 01:05:30,996
I heard you arrived this morning.

1512
01:05:30,996 --> 01:05:31,896
- Right.
- Are you feeling okay?

1513
01:05:31,896 --> 01:05:33,663
- I'm feeling great.
- You must be tired.

1514
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:37,096
Chef Choi and I are cooking
with some ingredients from the market.

1515
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:38,963
- So please take a seat and wait.
- Thanks.

1516
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:40,963
Did you cook all these yourself?

1517
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:44,296
I minced the ingredients
to make fish cakes.

1518
01:05:44,296 --> 01:05:46,330
- Gosh.
- I deep-fried squid as well.

1519
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,563
Geez.

1520
01:05:49,263 --> 01:05:50,414
What's all that?

1521
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:52,963
(Jaw-dropping)

1522
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:54,930
Take a seat.

1523
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,196
Geez. Look at this!

1524
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:59,363
How did you prepare the pasta
and all these so quickly?

1525
01:06:00,263 --> 01:06:01,730
I need to take photos of it.

1526
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,696
Awesome. I love it.

1527
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:06,130
(The first feast
featuring local ingredients)

1528
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,463
They had such a feast
as soon as they arrived.

1529
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:12,230
They must've thought
they could feast on food there.

1530
01:06:14,563 --> 01:06:16,596
- Thanks for the food.
- Thank you.

1531
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:18,863
Thank you for coming.

1532
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:19,863
Let me help you with that.

1533
01:06:21,163 --> 01:06:22,963
Did you really make all these?

1534
01:06:22,963 --> 01:06:24,430
Please help yourself.

1535
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,730
It's sujebi vongole
made with clams from the local market.

1536
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,152
(The first dish, sujebi vongole)

1537
01:06:29,363 --> 01:06:31,296
The hand-pulled dough was made
with minimal water,

1538
01:06:31,296 --> 01:06:32,796
making it extra chewy.

1539
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:36,263
The sujebi vongole was really good.

1540
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,519
(Sujebi with fresh giant squid)

1541
01:06:38,196 --> 01:06:40,963
I didn't forget to put garlic this time
this time.

1542
01:06:42,296 --> 01:06:44,701
- You didn't forget it this time.
- You didn't forget it.

1543
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:48,196
Is there a chef crazy enough
to forget garlic?

1544
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:51,584
I forgot to add garlic.

1545
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:54,196
(That's me.)

1546
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,187
I must've been crazy.

1547
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,963
(Please don't repeat the painful mistake.)

1548
01:06:57,963 --> 01:06:59,763
(This time, he put extra garlic.)

1549
01:06:59,763 --> 01:07:02,563
- Here.
- Thank you.

1550
01:07:02,563 --> 01:07:03,530
- Let me do it.
- Thanks.
- It's okay.
- Come on.

1551
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:06,863
It's more delicious when others serve you.

1552
01:07:06,863 --> 01:07:09,063
- But the plate is dirty.
- It's all right.

1553
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:15,330
You and I are the same kind,

1554
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,363
but we're not compatible.

1555
01:07:16,363 --> 01:07:17,263
We're not?

1556
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:19,730
Have some more garlic.

1557
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,130
(I still like you.)

1558
01:07:21,563 --> 01:07:24,063
Look at that beautiful color.

1559
01:07:24,063 --> 01:07:25,563
(Topping giant squid on sujebi)

1560
01:07:28,296 --> 01:07:30,363
(Looking at his face)

1561
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:34,646
It's so good.

1562
01:07:36,813 --> 01:07:37,679
It's so good.

1563
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,513
(Feeling proud)

1564
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:42,846
(Ok Vin also takes a big bite.)

1565
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:47,313
(Happy)

1566
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,446
Gosh. It looks so delicious.

1567
01:07:48,446 --> 01:07:49,579
(Is it that good?)

1568
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:50,713
He put in extra garlic.

1569
01:07:51,913 --> 01:07:54,479
(Humming)

1570
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:56,205
(What's this?)

1571
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:59,179
This is so delicious.

1572
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:00,343
(The rich flavor of the clams fills
the mouth.)

1573
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:02,278
This is awkward.

1574
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:03,513
Gosh. It's so embarrassing.

1575
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,579
The texture of the giant squid is
really good.

1576
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:09,754
It was really soft.

1577
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:11,519
It was like scallops.

1578
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:12,886
It looks similar to scallops too.

1579
01:08:12,886 --> 01:08:15,019
The texture was similar
to that of scallops.

1580
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:16,528
(Fresh seafood)

1581
01:08:16,553 --> 01:08:18,686
This is more delicious than anything else.

1582
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:20,086
Is it sujebi pasta?

1583
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:21,253
- The sujebi is so good.
- It's sujebi vongole.

1584
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:22,786
- It's insanely good.
- It's delicious.

1585
01:08:22,786 --> 01:08:24,386
(They indulge in fine dining in Peru.)

1586
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:26,819
By the way, it's so nice to meet you.

1587
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:31,119
(He greets them after eating.)

1588
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,053
I'm Ryu Su Young.

1589
01:08:32,053 --> 01:08:34,453
Now that he's stuffed,
he can see people clearly.

1590
01:08:34,453 --> 01:08:35,553
I'm Kim Ok Vin.

1591
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:37,186
- I'm Choi Daniel.
- Daniel.

1592
01:08:37,186 --> 01:08:39,119
- It's so nice to meet you all.
- You too.

1593
01:08:40,186 --> 01:08:43,253
Have you known each other before this?

1594
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,186
- No.
- No. We've just met.

1595
01:08:45,211 --> 01:08:46,044
You've just met?

1596
01:08:47,065 --> 01:08:48,725
You two seem very close, though.

1597
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,227
Well, we do seem very close,

1598
01:08:52,227 --> 01:08:53,961
but when we are together,

1599
01:08:53,962 --> 01:08:55,763
we don't click that well.

1600
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,433
(We seem close, yet not close enough.)

1601
01:08:59,434 --> 01:09:00,902
We, indeed, are different.

1602
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,069
Like how?

1603
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,474
I've never seen anyone
more talkative than me.

1604
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,376
He really loves talking.

1605
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,611
- Really?
- Yes.

1606
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,178
(Giving a look)

1607
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,016
(Even when everyone is feeling tired,)

1608
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:19,488
(the chatterbox won't stop.)

1609
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,356
It's my first time seeing Hyun Seok...

1610
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,224
- so quiet.
- Same.

1611
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,092
He has a social battery
that lasts three times longer than me.

1612
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,562
(Such an endurable passion battery)

1613
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:29,706
Let's try this fish cake
we fried this morning.

1614
01:09:29,731 --> 01:09:31,999
(The passionate cook's special dish)

1615
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:34,659
(The giant squid fish cake)

1616
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,806
(Mince the giant squid and fish together.)

1617
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:40,575
(A variety of fish cakes
are crispy fried.)

1618
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:42,209
I want to have a bite.

1619
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,012
I wonder what that gochujang one
would taste like.

1620
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,680
- Is it spicy?
- It should be okay.

1621
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,416
(He tries gochujang fish cake first!)

1622
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,716
Man!

1623
01:09:50,163 --> 01:09:51,531
Try the white one.

1624
01:09:52,215 --> 01:09:53,287
That one isn't spicy.

1625
01:09:53,827 --> 01:09:55,223
I'm good with spicy food.

1626
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,458
(How will the original fish cake taste?)

1627
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:58,593
Won't he try this one?

1628
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:02,395
Dip it in that one. It's not spicy.

1629
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:06,834
(Eyes wide open)

1630
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,436
The spicy one is pretty good.

1631
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,105
- Right?
- I like it too.

1632
01:10:10,772 --> 01:10:13,172
At first, it's very soft, like a sponge,

1633
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:16,020
but it finishes up with a springy texture.

1634
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,879
This is well-cooked.

1635
01:10:17,904 --> 01:10:19,171
(Adding spiciness
by dipping it in tteokbokki)

1636
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:20,514
It's good.

1637
01:10:20,515 --> 01:10:22,116
He made these rice cakes.

1638
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,517
(Spicy seafood tteokbokki)

1639
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,155
There are many interesting ingredients
in this.

1640
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:28,822
That looks amazing.

1641
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,193
(How is seafood tteokbokki
with the squid fish cake?)

1642
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,532
That's really spicy.

1643
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:43,438
The chili powder we got was really hot.
It's making me dizzy too.

1644
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:46,974
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1645
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:48,711
(The spiciness makes them keep eating it.)

1646
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:51,011
It's sweet and nice. But it's a bit spicy.

1647
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:52,112
I'm not good with spicy food.

1648
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,982
Actually, it's just right for me, though.

1649
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:55,617
- Does it suit your palate?
- It's perfect for me.

1650
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:58,385
(I see you know how to enjoy food.)

1651
01:10:58,386 --> 01:10:59,720
- I'm glad.
- That's great.

1652
01:11:00,188 --> 01:11:04,225
(Sweating hot taste suits her palate.)

1653
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,194
Try deep-fried giant squid.

1654
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:07,929
Squirt the lemon on top of it.

1655
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:09,864
(Deep-fried giant squid)

1656
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,431
That should be good.

1657
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,500
It's full of squid meat.

1658
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,936
It's really meaty,
unlike the ones from Korea.

1659
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,037
Yes.

1660
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,874
That sauce was so good.

1661
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:21,475
What did you make that with?

1662
01:11:21,476 --> 01:11:23,210
I used mayonnaise,

1663
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,782
some lime juice, and honey.

1664
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,536
It was tangy and sweet. It was amazing.

1665
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:33,087
It went so well
with that deep-fried squid.

1666
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,555
(It goes perfectly with fritters.)

1667
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,623
- Well...
- What is this?

1668
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,059
This one is...

1669
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:39,704
(Satisfied)

1670
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:41,796
Salmon?

1671
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,028
I'm not sure what kind of fish it is.

1672
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:45,887
- Try dipping it in here.
- Man, it's crazy.

1673
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,237
The squid is not rigid at all.
It's so good.

1674
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:51,640
Yes, it's not that tough.

1675
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,107
Hyun Seok made this sauce.

1676
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,395
(He dips it in Hyun Seok's sauce.)

1677
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,465
(A big dip)

1678
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,347
Su Young handled that fish...

1679
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:00,480
That sauce is just insane.

1680
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:06,221
(The sauce is making him want to conduct?)

1681
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,655
- It's really good.
- That's your honest response?

1682
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,423
- Of course.
- No exaggeration?

1683
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:11,392
- No exaggeration.
- Okay. It was real.

1684
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,761
I was serious.

1685
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,997
We'll keep watching
and see if you make any exaggerations.

1686
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:17,166
- He's sharp.
- I'm nervous.

1687
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,134
The Peruvians have it.

1688
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,936
(Exclaiming)

1689
01:12:22,537 --> 01:12:24,805
This sauce is seriously good.

1690
01:12:24,806 --> 01:12:25,874
The sauce is marvelous.

1691
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,777
(An irresistible taste)

1692
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:35,551
I'd understand if someone flew to Peru
just to have deep-fried squid.

1693
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,153
- It takes more than 24 hours...
- I wouldn't put that much effort.

1694
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:39,253
Actually...

1695
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:42,323
No one would fly to Peru
just to have deep-fried squid.

1696
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,759
It's just that delicious.

1697
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,493
- You took it too far.
- You exaggerated too much.

1698
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,261
I can't believe he said that.

1699
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,262
(But it was really good.)

1700
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,931
You should change your name
to Mr. Fake Reaction.

1701
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:52,432
- I agree.
- That's just ridiculous.

1702
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,170
Who wants to fly for over 24 hours
to have deep-fried squid?

1703
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:57,271
I wouldn't even fly to Japan for that.

1704
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,506
I admit that was a bit of a stretch.

1705
01:12:58,506 --> 01:13:01,241
(I got too passionate at the moment.)

1706
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:05,647
Is there something more?

1707
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:07,616
Things just keep coming up.

1708
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,903
They keep giving you mission cards.

1709
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,887
(What is this envelope
that is somewhat familiar?)

1710
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:16,114
- Is money in that envelope?
- Maybe it's a secret mission?

1711
01:13:16,139 --> 01:13:17,525
Oh, it's a mission.

1712
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:21,228
"Bombonaje."

1713
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,998
Longitude and latitude
are written on this.

1714
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:25,400
What is that?

1715
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,590
- It's a fish.
- It looks like a red grouper.

1716
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:31,838
(PERU BOB,
the second Tasty Mission card)

1717
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:35,502
That's a fish.

1718
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:36,655
Is it the Dimafro card again?

1719
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:37,846
(Unidentified fish?)

1720
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:39,781
"Bombonaje."

1721
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:42,851
Now, just the sight of fish
makes me scared.

1722
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,720
Do they go fishing again?

1723
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:46,889
That's sea bream!

1724
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:51,326
- Its teeth are...
- The teeth look totally different.

1725
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:52,761
It's a kind of sea bream.

1726
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,595
A grouper?

1727
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,565
Its mouth is too big
to call it a sea bream.

1728
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,936
(What is this?)

1729
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,870
Or it could be this.

1730
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,073
The man-eating fish.

1731
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,542
- Piranha.
- Piranha?

1732
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,245
That must be it.

1733
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:10,512
I guess it's Piranha.

1734
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:12,447
(Forget about the city!)

1735
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,716
You flew for over 24 hours,

1736
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:16,478
worked your butt off, and cooked
all this while.

1737
01:14:16,502 --> 01:14:17,620
And you get piranhas!

1738
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,275
Really. This isn't a joke.

1739
01:14:20,223 --> 01:14:21,456
The real Amazon.

1740
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:25,894
(They go to the Amazon in Peru.)

1741
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:30,331
(The last supper of the Amazon expedition)

1742
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:36,971
(Realizing their desire
for the gourmet trip)

1743
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,342
(Have you enjoyed it?)

1744
01:14:39,343 --> 01:14:40,475
(Drooling)

1745
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,411
(You shall cough up as much as you ate.)

1746
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,781
(Don't get fooled by its cuteness.)

1747
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,951
(It'll reveal its claws at any time.)

1748
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:53,588
(Taste the Amazon with all your body.)

1749
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:57,984
(Fulfilling the five senses)

1750
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:01,429
(It's beyond anything you expect.)

1751
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:05,533
(The feast of the Amazonian ingredients)

1752
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,770
(That can't be true!)

1753
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:11,866
(The wildest
and the most extreme labor...)

1754
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:16,478
(for the Tasty Mission is coming!)

1755
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,814
(And in the end, they arrive...)

1756
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,584
(at a strange village...)

1757
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:25,654
(deep in the Amazon jungle.)

1758
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,090
(Do people actually live here?)

1759
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:31,893
(What is this village under the veil?)

1760
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:33,062
(JUNGLE BOB 2)
