1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,566
(The second morning in San Rafael dawns.)

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,566
(With the sound of the chilling waves,)

3
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,166
That's picturesque.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,433
(people start their day.)

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,366
(Today, it's sunny in the Caribbean.)

6
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,401
The weather is truly amazing.

7
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:29,763
It is.

8
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:32,054
I'm at my best right now.

9
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:34,487
Do the waves seem gentler than yesterday?

10
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,420
- Will this work?
- No, they seem strong.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,854
(But where's Su Young?)

12
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:39,720
What?

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,320
Yes!

14
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,487
It should be fun there.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,420
Where is he headed?

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,254
I'm curious.

17
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,720
Currently, I'm going...

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,622
to a place called the Dunes of Baní.

19
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,592
I didn't even look at the photos...

20
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:01,287
so that I could fully appreciate it.

21
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,120
We'll be taking the plane soon.

22
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:09,287
And you mentioned a fascinating place.

23
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:10,754
- Right.
- The Dunes of Baní.

24
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:11,738
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yes.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,987
It's always been my dream
to visit the dunes in another country.

26
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:20,120
I've always wanted to go there
before I die.

27
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:25,154
(This treasure island is
surrounded by the sea.)

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,120
There's a desert?

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,587
The ocean isn't the only spectacle
in the Dominican Republic.

30
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:32,220
There's a fascinating place.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,654
(To Baní, where the desert is,)

32
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:36,854
(Su Young drove alone.)

33
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:38,554
Oh, that's where you went.

34
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:41,887
Look at that.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
The view is unbelievable.

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,654
(He drives forward without a break.)

37
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:51,054
(After a long drive,
he runs into a familiar view.)

38
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:51,954
Goodness.

39
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:54,887
They have that too?

40
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:56,720
It's so nice to see one.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,654
I wonder what it is.

42
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,587
(Curious)

43
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,554
Should we try one?

44
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:04,254
What are you selling?

45
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:06,787
- Casabe.
- Casabe?

46
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:10,420
(I don't know what it is,
but give me one, please.)

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,820
(It's good. Try it.)

48
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,054
(Snack vendors on the highway)

49
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,787
There are speed bumps along the way,

50
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,172
and a vendor at every speed bump.

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,987
We'll take one of each.

52
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,154
(Sure.)

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,120
(He buys snacks
to stay awake during the drive.)

54
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,687
Let's try one. It looks good.

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,654
You have to try that.

56
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,220
I wonder how it tastes.

57
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:38,920
What's this?

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,220
- Isn't this a rice puff?
- It looks like one.

59
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,354
Or scorched rice.

60
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:42,562
Isn't that a rice puff?

61
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,520
It looks like scorched rice.

62
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,054
(Casabe:
bread made of ground yuca, baked.)

63
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:49,554
- Casabe!
- It's casabe.

64
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:50,520
It's made of yuca.

65
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,020
It's like a tortilla made of yuca.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,654
- It does look like scorched rice.
- I'd love to know the taste.

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,620
It smells pretty sour.

68
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,020
It's sour. Did they put sesame oil?

69
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,087
(Taking a bite)

70
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,626
I'm not sure about this one.

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,920
(A questionable taste)

72
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,759
It didn't seem that crispy.

73
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:16,187
It's kind of like a tortilla.

74
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,754
- But it's peculiar.
- Is it soft?

75
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:20,620
Yes, it's neither chewy nor dry.

76
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,387
It's somewhere in between.

77
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,554
You're really avoiding saying
you didn't like it.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,420
(Guilty)

79
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,354
- Say it was bad if it tasted bad.
- I bet it tastes bad.

80
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:32,187
- Just tell us the truth.
- Nicely put.

81
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,814
None of that was a compliment.

82
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,387
It didn't suit my palate.

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,454
(He couldn't hide his feelings.)

84
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,887
(Let's try the next snack.)

85
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,354
It looks like taffy.

86
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,087
- It's obviously taffy.
- Yes.

87
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,020
It's taffy.

88
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:53,720
I have a feeling
this is made from sugar cane.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,287
Because I didn't see
any wheat or rice fields.

90
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:01,820
(As soon as he puts it in his mouth,
he grins.)

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,654
I'm so curious.

92
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,154
It's so good.

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,166
It's like a glucose candy.

94
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:09,931
My sugar level is rising.

95
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:11,364
It's made of coconut.

96
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:13,931
The coconut flavor bursts in your mouth.

97
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,131
(One more bite)

98
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:18,692
It tastes like powdered sugar.

99
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,031
Oh, powdered sugar.

100
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,231
It's tasty.

101
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,464
It melts like cotton candy.

102
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,031
It's making me feel good. It's tasty.

103
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,464
So, that's how they make it.

104
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,331
It's good.

105
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:32,397
Snacks.

106
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,031
- That's...
- It's a national snack.

107
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,164
It looks good.

108
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:37,997
Like pretzels.

109
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,964
It's like a twisted breadstick.

110
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,897
It looks like onion rings.

111
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,997
This is deep-fried.

112
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:47,531
(Crunchy)

113
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:50,597
This taste is familiar.

114
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:51,864
(Even Koreans know this taste.)

115
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:55,564
(Los aritos: seasoned flour dough,
shaped into rings, deep-fried.)

116
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,531
Are they hard like pretzels?

117
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,164
It's close to a deep-fried hardtack.

118
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:02,231
(Crispy like deep-fried hardtack.)

119
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:07,164
Eat these two together,
it's like Star Popeye.

120
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:09,397
(An old man knows this snack.)

121
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:10,631
I perfectly understood.

122
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,331
It's like eating hardtack and star candy.

123
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:16,797
I feel like eating Star Popeye.

124
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:18,131
It definitely looks like it.

125
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,264
I bet it's tasty.

126
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,897
Great.

127
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:25,797
(His sugar level rises,)

128
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,731
It's delicious.

129
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,897
(and he drives to the desert.)

130
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,297
(Meanwhile,
the other three are on the ocean.)

131
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:35,764
It's rocking so hard.

132
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:38,197
It's rocking.

133
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:39,364
Are you all right?

134
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,564
No.

135
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:41,931
(He feels seasick, even before departure.)

136
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:44,897
Why did he come with us?

137
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:46,497
I don't know.

138
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:49,964
I'm just a kitchen maid.
Why did they drag me here?

139
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:53,331
It's awkward seeing you here.

140
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,031
What's our barmaid doing here?

141
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,590
What are you doing on our boat?

142
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,897
(Nam No told everyone his dream
on the first day.)

143
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:02,464
Do you know Sanji in "One Piece?"

144
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:03,764
The floating restaurant.

145
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,931
(Nam No has a dream.)

146
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,264
Really?

147
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,297
(His ultimate cooking career goal)

148
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:14,397
- He looks so happy.
- Yes.

149
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,153
- You said that was your dream.
- To run a floating restaurant.

150
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:23,964
Running a floating restaurant is my dream.

151
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,397
I don't want to be remembered
as a normal chef.

152
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,831
I hear there are
many different ingredients here.

153
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,964
We don't know what we'll find.

154
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:35,064
I got it!

155
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:42,297
(Tasty Mission ingredients found
on this treasure island)

156
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:44,964
- Crayfish.
- King crab.

157
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:47,364
Swordfish.

158
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,631
They have so many food ingredients.

159
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:51,231
(Which ingredient will help him
fulfill his dream?)

160
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,397
We'll be back!

161
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,831
(The three take the first step
toward their dreams.)

162
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,397
Why is it rocking so hard?

163
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,997
(Off to the ocean, dreaming of a big fish)

164
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:06,764
All right!

165
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,164
Step on it!

166
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,331
Harder!

167
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,764
Faster!

168
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,997
(His passion ignites from the start.)

169
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,997
(Sailing across the breaking waves...)

170
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:25,864
(into the heart of the Caribbean)

171
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,797
(Rocky)

172
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,589
Are you sure this is safe?
What's wrong with this boat?

173
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,297
(The boat rocks wildly
as soon as it sets sail.)

174
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:39,531
That boat could flip.

175
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:42,431
I know. The waves are too hard.

176
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,497
(The waves are especially big today.)

177
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:51,031
This is a pirate ship ride.

178
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:57,431
(They feel the wild sea
with their whole bodies.)

179
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:59,897
It's too much. Hold on.

180
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:00,797
Stop!

181
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,131
- Didn't it tilt way too much?
- Yes.

182
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,231
This is...

183
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,197
Here comes another one.

184
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:09,531
That's too big!

185
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,158
It's too big!

186
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,997
(Nam No is suffering.)

187
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,997
What's wrong with this place?

188
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,864
I want to go home!

189
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:23,031
I'm actually afraid of water.

190
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,031
(But we've only begun.)

191
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:33,931
This is literally a pirate ship.

192
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,464
(A real-life flume ride)

193
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,031
Are you all right?

194
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,064
(Dying)

195
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:46,531
I want to go home.

196
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:51,697
(His floating restaurant dream fades.)

197
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:55,164
(Send me home!)

198
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,064
Oh, no. Nam No is crying.

199
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:01,731
(But the Aqua Siblings seem
perfectly fine.)

200
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:03,797
I was sure they hired me to cook!

201
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:07,264
I was a little disappointed.

202
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,364
These two took motion sickness medicine.

203
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,031
Oh, right.

204
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:12,931
You didn't?

205
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:14,131
- I didn't.
- Why not?

206
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,764
No, Joon and I shared my pill.

207
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,231
I went to give you one,

208
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,931
and you said you'd already taken one
from the doctor.

209
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:21,964
- I did?
- Yes.

210
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:23,131
- How did that happen?
- So, I...

211
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,864
- Oh, he doesn't remember. I apologize.
- How much have you forgotten?

212
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,467
- How much do you remember?
- What's the last thing you remember?

213
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:33,264
Nam No, you've never been fishing
on a boat?

214
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:36,131
I once wanted to pickle anchovies myself,

215
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:38,199
so I went on an anchovy fishing boat.

216
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,299
- Seriously?
- That's a tough one.

217
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,265
The sailors stopped me,
saying I couldn't take it.

218
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:45,599
But I brought them
coffee and everything...

219
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:48,832
and asked them to help me make
my own salted anchovies.

220
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,799
And I got salted instead.

221
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,465
You turned into a salted anchovy.

222
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:54,699
Pickled Nam No.
Dead Nam No!

223
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,926
That sounds so lame.

224
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,597
(Dead Nam No returns.)

225
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:09,512
(I don't want to run a restaurant
on the water!)

226
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:12,921
Where's the cool Nam No from yesterday?

227
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,281
This is a new Nam No!

228
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,066
Please don't make me do anything
other than cook.

229
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,891
He was so cool when cooking!

230
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,359
This is a new him!

231
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:22,956
This isn't yesterday's cool Nam No.

232
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,935
Are you dead?

233
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,981
(Feeling his pulse)

234
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:34,234
Check if he's breathing.

235
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:36,809
He's gotten pale!

236
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,177
(Please help me.)

237
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:42,428
We must be getting close.

238
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,092
We must be here.

239
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,170
This is it.

240
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,929
(After getting through the rough waves)

241
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,697
Do we fish here?

242
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,451
That's not going to be easy.

243
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,087
We went pretty deep.

244
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,656
- The waves are calmer.
- Yes, they've gotten calmer.

245
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,828
- The fish...
- They're alive!

246
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,429
They use live bait.

247
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,903
- Do we only use the lines?
- Yes, only lines.

248
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,875
You'd feel the fish better when it bites.

249
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,611
This is the classic style.

250
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,980
(Deep in this ocean)

251
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,816
(Grouper)

252
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,154
(Dolphin fish)

253
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,322
(Flocks of pilchard)

254
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,490
That's incredible!

255
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,326
Red snapper!

256
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,994
(And even red snapper!)

257
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,431
You catch the fish with that line!

258
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,467
(You can fish all of them with a line!)

259
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,940
We could get really lucky today.

260
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,676
(Who will enjoy catching live fish today?)

261
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:52,921
(It won't be me.)

262
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,847
- Oh, no!
- You were half-dead!

263
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,815
Your eyes seem lost.

264
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,250
This is terrible.

265
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,787
(General Ok Vin is setting
up the bait first.)

266
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,189
(So fresh)

267
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,025
Let's go!

268
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:09,938
(Far away)

269
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,797
That's so cool.

270
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:14,705
(Aqua Ok Vin is skilled at fishing too.)

271
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,763
(I can't lose to her!)

272
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,361
(Nam No, just trust me!)

273
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,265
(Throwing his line with determination)

274
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:30,832
It landed so close to the boat!

275
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,034
(It only went this far.)

276
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,003
(Swim further, okay?)

277
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:35,837
Okay!

278
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,375
- It's serene.
- So peaceful.

279
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,343
It's perfect.

280
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,846
It's so calm despite the rough waves.

281
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,517
Poor Nam No.

282
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,452
(I feel a bit better now.)

283
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,452
I've heard...

284
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:57,392
we should bob the bait
to make it look alive.

285
00:12:57,946 --> 00:12:59,179
Up and down.

286
00:12:59,223 --> 00:13:01,014
You have to go with the flow.

287
00:13:01,505 --> 00:13:03,105
Up and down.

288
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:05,929
This will make fish think
the bait is alive.

289
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,298
That's what makes them take the bait.

290
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,700
You can't stay still.

291
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,669
I know it's a lot of work,
but bob the bait.

292
00:13:13,938 --> 00:13:15,228
It's normal...

293
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,140
not to feel anything when fishing.

294
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,509
But it's so satisfying
when something bites.

295
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,711
That's why they compare fishing to life.

296
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,767
(Throwing up)

297
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,424
(Seasick again)

298
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,617
Oh, no!

299
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,188
He must be really seasick!

300
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,522
Are you okay?

301
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:33,857
(Sorry.)

302
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,582
- You're suffering.
- Do you feel queasy?

303
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,294
- Yes.
- Should I pat your back?

304
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:38,338
Yes.

305
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:39,562
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

306
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:42,332
Oh, goodness!

307
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,067
(The seasick man
who dreamed of being a prince)

308
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:48,138
Help me!

309
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,474
The issue is...

310
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,476
that you can't escape from it.

311
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,645
The worst thing about motion sickness is
being trapped.

312
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,380
- Seriously.
- Right?

313
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,148
It's the worst kind of motion sickness.

314
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,885
I want my floating restaurant dream.

315
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,388
(Nam No's dream is sinking.)

316
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,857
- This is...
- We said we'd make Ok Vin a dessert!

317
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,326
Don't pay me. Just get me back to land.

318
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:10,526
You don't want to get paid?

319
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:11,728
This is on camera.

320
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,664
(The camera rushes in
as Nam No refuses his pay.)

321
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:14,921
He doesn't want to be paid!

322
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:16,900
Don't pay me. Just get me back to land.

323
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,159
You don't want to get paid?
This is on camera.

324
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,339
- You don't want to be paid?
- No pay!

325
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,307
Don't pay me.

326
00:14:24,308 --> 00:14:27,043
Just get me back to land. Don't pay me.

327
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:28,879
I can't do this anymore.

328
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:32,248
Why did you drag me here?

329
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:37,320
(You said you wanted to make
your dream come true.)

330
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:40,223
Doesn't he look drunk?

331
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:41,658
I can't do this.

332
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,126
(Turning back without any fish for Nam No)

333
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,494
I don't need to make money.

334
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:47,230
- You didn't return with any fish!
- No, we didn't.

335
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,366
I don't remember anything I said.

336
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:50,399
- Really?
- No.

337
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,103
- He was in real pain.
- You said so yourself,

338
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,205
- so return your pay.
- Yes, pay it back.

339
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,238
- Pay it back?
- Yes.

340
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,273
Why don't we get dinner with it?

341
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,775
I won't get paid for the show.

342
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,779
(We're getting a staff dinner
with Nam No's pay.)

343
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,584
(The three barely made it back.)

344
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:10,686
(Snoring)

345
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,623
Who's that?

346
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:14,724
(Snoring)

347
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,460
- It's Ok Vin.
- No!

348
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,962
It's loud, so it's OK Vin.

349
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:21,064
No!

350
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:22,299
That's Joon.

351
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,667
Is that my snoring?

352
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,601
- He doesn't snore.
- No, I don't!

353
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,970
It must be Ok Vin, then!

354
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:27,904
- No!
- Joon doesn't snore.

355
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,272
DinDin knows it from "2 Days and 1 Night!"

356
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,574
I know from "2 Days and 1 Night"
that Joon doesn't snore.

357
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:32,408
I don't snore!

358
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:34,567
- And that snoring is so familiar.
- Yes!

359
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:37,314
- No!
- We heard it from Peru!

360
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,681
The tractor-starting sound!

361
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,950
(It's definitely Ok Vin's snoring.)

362
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:42,218
Can you replay it?

363
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,419
Yes, one more time.

364
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:45,155
Let's listen again.

365
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,481
We can see whose stomach is moving.

366
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,163
- It's him.
- No, it came from the left.

367
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,432
- Right.
- It looks like it's Joon.

368
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,536
- I snore?
- It's Joon!

369
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,037
It was funny...

370
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:05,742
how Ok Vin was unsure,
after being caught snoring so much.

371
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,078
She was only sure after rewatching.

372
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:14,417
(We'll leave it up to you to decide
who snored.)

373
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:19,121
(While Joon and Ok Vin are passed out,
snoring)

374
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,758
(Where's Nam No?)

375
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,261
(Eating something)

376
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:28,064
(What's that sound?)

377
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,236
(Familiar sounds from the kitchen)

378
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,104
My gosh!

379
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,705
(In love)

380
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,709
- You're something else!
- It's ramyeon!

381
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,044
How can you eat after seasickness?

382
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,013
How can you eat ramyeon after seasickness?

383
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:46,082
(Devouring the noodles)

384
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:47,584
Ramyeon cures seasickness.

385
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,718
(Recovering from the seasickness
with ramyeon)

386
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:51,688
You look like Shin Chan from the side.

387
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,558
- So cute!
- Shin Chan!

388
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,459
- I see it!
- Yes!

389
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,994
How are your cheeks so plump?

390
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,128
- Shin Chan!
- He's Shin Chan!

391
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,363
His cheeks are adorable!

392
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,789
That has to be a cartoon!
He's a cartoon character!

393
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,404
He looks like he's walked
out of the cartoon.

394
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:09,538
Yes, he's a cartoon man!

395
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:10,797
Is that his second bowl?

396
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,809
You can tell he's already had two.

397
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,177
Did you eat two?

398
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:16,747
- I only eat ramyeon in even numbers.
- Right.

399
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,081
(Sticking to his guns despite sickness)

400
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,583
The ocean only brought you sickness.

401
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,853
(The floating restaurant is now
just a painful dream.)

402
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:24,654
I'm done.

403
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:29,359
(Meanwhile, in the southwest region
of the Dominican Republic)

404
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:31,260
What's that?

405
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:33,195
What's that? Are those not clouds?

406
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,166
I feel like there will be a scorpion!

407
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:43,305
(The land of the unknown...)

408
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,374
That must've been incredible.

409
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,677
(that Su Young has always dreamed of)

410
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,651
It's endless.

411
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:00,523
That's magical. The ocean was right there.

412
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,093
My gosh!

413
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:05,694
That's wonderful!

414
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,229
I'd be scared there.

415
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:10,115
We've been everywhere, and now, a desert!

416
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,669
It's an endless desert.

417
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:20,377
- Imagine being there alone at night.
- That'd be terrifying.

418
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,210
- It's scary.
- So scary.

419
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,611
It'd be a struggle.

420
00:18:22,613 --> 00:18:23,546
It's cold.

421
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,617
We've been everywhere, and now, a desert!

422
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:34,658
I want to get as far as possible,

423
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:38,260
even when it's hard.

424
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,330
Here I am.

425
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,598
(Reaching the heart of the desert)

426
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,570
Potato sack rides down that hill
would be fun.

427
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:49,138
You'd slide right down.

428
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,844
(Dunes are his only friends.)

429
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,045
This place is unbelievable.

430
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:02,485
(Nobody is to be seen in this desert.)

431
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,625
(The beautiful Caribbean,
known as paradise on Earth)

432
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,796
(The richest ocean)

433
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,054
That's incredible!

434
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,602
(And the most deserted land)

435
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:20,903
There must be centipedes here.

436
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,339
(A place where both coexist)

437
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
Seriously.

438
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:28,811
How can there be a desert
on an island surrounded by water?

439
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:33,459
Winds carry sand to make dunes.

440
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,118
They're called coastal dunes.

441
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:37,653
They're so big they look like a desert.

442
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,590
They're coastal dunes, not a desert.

443
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:42,715
Yes, but they're huge.

444
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,129
The hot sand is making me hot.

445
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:50,433
It's winter in the Dominican Republic,

446
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,169
but it feels like Korean summer.

447
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,020
- It's 33 degrees Celsius?
- In winter!

448
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:58,197
- It must be so hot there.
- If it's this hot in the winter...

449
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,411
- Summer must be unbearable.
- It must be scorching.

450
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:02,339
- You probably couldn't stand it.
- It must go over 40, even 50 degrees.

451
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,667
(He's come all this way...)

452
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:09,293
(to make one of his dreams come true.)

453
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,387
- The sand must be burning hot.
- Yes, it felt like fire.

454
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,184
The ground radiated heat.

455
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,322
It's scorching.

456
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,687
There's nothing around.

457
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:20,257
I just went to a spot on the map
with no info at all.

458
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:23,911
(Under the scorching sun,)

459
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:25,499
(he can't even rest or sit down.)

460
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,159
- Let's keep going.
- It feels like another planet.

461
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:28,765
It doesn't look like Earth.

462
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,095
Let's go.

463
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:33,837
Walking one kilometer on sand feels
like three on the road.

464
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,067
Right. That must be exhausting.

465
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:36,533
(Panting)

466
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,424
(Panting)

467
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm so tired.

468
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,923
(Walking with no clear destination)

469
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,123
Gosh. Look over there.

470
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,753
It looks like something from "Dune."

471
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,077
(Surreal, like an alien sci-fi scene)

472
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,268
(Massive dunes now stretch...)

473
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,356
(across the desert before his eyes.)

474
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:04,108
Look how tall that is.

475
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:08,918
(A towering wall of sand,
shaped by countless winds)

476
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:10,812
There are no footprints ahead of him.

477
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,837
- You're right.
- He's the first to step there.

478
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:14,695
Gosh.

479
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,007
- It's stunning.
- That's insane.

480
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:19,029
You're right.
There really are no other footprints.

481
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,033
Timothée!

482
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,362
Timothée!

483
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:35,326
(You can't see what's beyond the dune,)

484
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:37,848
(but an endless sea of sand
must be waiting.)

485
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,713
- It's breathtaking.
- It's awesome.

486
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:42,583
He's come so far.

487
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:45,022
(Dizzying)

488
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,620
It looks like a tough climb.

489
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:52,783
(He's speechless
in front of the towering dune.)

490
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:55,032
(But even overwhelmed,)

491
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:57,251
- You're amazing.
- That must be exhausting.

492
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,457
(he keeps walking toward the dune.)

493
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:01,885
No one else would try this.

494
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:07,431
(He begins climbing the dune
without a word.)

495
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:14,214
In places like this,
you realize how small you are.

496
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,970
I always learn something
in moments like this.

497
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,010
It's steeper than I thought.

498
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,976
I couldn't even get over one
of those dunes. It was too much.

499
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:29,921
The slope is so steep.

500
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,651
It looks harder than you think.

501
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,535
(He's already exhausted.)

502
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:39,045
Look at that slope.

503
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,651
- He should crawl.
- He should.

504
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,703
- It really was that steep.
- My goodness.

505
00:22:42,703 --> 00:22:43,904
It's so steep!

506
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,243
- My gosh.
- It's tougher than you'd expect.

507
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,010
(Stumbling)

508
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:52,952
Do you know why I'm doing this?

509
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:58,004
To discover something new.

510
00:23:01,475 --> 00:23:03,240
This is insanely steep!

511
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:05,363
One wrong step,

512
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,111
and he could slide all the way back down.

513
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:13,781
(I'm going to conquer this dune!)

514
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:18,465
(He pauses near the peak again.)

515
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:22,058
(It's too steep to climb.)

516
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,427
- Even one step is hard.
- Look at all that sand.

517
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:26,471
(But he keeps going, step by step,)

518
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,776
He looks amazing, though.

519
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:30,482
(not giving up.)

520
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,339
(And when he finally reaches
the top of the dune,)

521
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:40,613
(a new world unfolds.)

522
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,762
- Look at that!
- It's amazing!

523
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,160
That's it!

524
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,630
It gave me chills.

525
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:54,736
The ocean is right beyond the dune.

526
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:56,835
He's completely alone out there.

527
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,427
(A jaw-dropping sight, only possible
after crossing the sea of dunes)

528
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:02,510
- It's stunning.
- It's so unique.

529
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,146
Look! You can even see the wind
blowing across the sand!

530
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:07,215
It's like a movie scene!

531
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,485
Unbelievable.

532
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:12,031
(The glittering sea greets him.)

533
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:15,323
It must be more overwhelming
than finding an oasis.

534
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:21,033
(This is the view he's dreamed of seeing.)

535
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,666
Gosh, the color of the sea is incredible.

536
00:24:29,188 --> 00:24:30,944
(After crossing
a seemingly alien desert...)

537
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,179
The long journey made it
even more beautiful.

538
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,044
It's stunning!

539
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:38,737
(the emerald Caribbean Sea stretches out
at the end of the desert.)

540
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:43,018
(The massive ocean and desert lie
side by side here.)

541
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,574
- Nature is incredible.
- I know.

542
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,622
I've never seen a desert
right next to the sea.

543
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,472
Me neither.

544
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,125
It's picturesque.

545
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,062
(The Dunes of Baní: a Caribbean mystery)

546
00:24:54,062 --> 00:24:57,866
This place would be perfect
for a movie or music video.

547
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,201
- It'd be a masterpiece, right?
- Right?

548
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:03,169
(Dunes of Baní: formed over millennia
by wind and Caribbean Sea sediments.)

549
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:04,005
Absolutely stunning.

550
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,112
Eo Nam Seon is here
in the Dominican Republic!

551
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:15,583
(A moment when mixed emotions cross)

552
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,619
Su Young seems genuinely happy.

553
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:23,088
It's kind of touching, isn't it?

554
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,627
I would feel the same if I were him.

555
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:32,297
Yes, it's really moving.

556
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,669
I didn't expect it to be that steep.

557
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:37,038
I want to go there too.

558
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,573
It was practically vertical.

559
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,183
Okay.

560
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,080
- What are you on?
- What are you sitting on?

561
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,798
A board.

562
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:52,153
(Sledding on a board in the Dunes of Baní)

563
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:53,251
That must be so much fun!

564
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:56,871
(Sliding down)

565
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,226
That's so fast!

566
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,630
It looks incredible!

567
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,265
It really was fast.

568
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:07,836
Oh, no.

569
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:09,871
JUNGLE BOB!

570
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:11,896
(Falling)

571
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,442
You've got sand all over your face.

572
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,322
(Spitting out sand)

573
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:20,381
I think my head went
at least 50cm into the sand.

574
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:21,673
It literally got buried.

575
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,069
In the desert...

576
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:27,088
Well, I know it's dunes, not a desert.

577
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:29,557
I mean...

578
00:26:30,228 --> 00:26:32,293
There's something
about these endless dunes...

579
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:35,163
that sparks your imagination.

580
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:36,631
It's really inspiring.

581
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:41,046
(He staggers after the sled ride.)

582
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:44,364
But it's exhausting.

583
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,021
I really wanted to go there, personally.

584
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,506
- It was healing.
- Just amazing.

585
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,578
- Totally worth it.
- I'd never seen...

586
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:52,130
- a view like that before.
- Exactly.

587
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,281
- Right.
- Even just for a moment,

588
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,551
I wanted to escape civilization
to be alone...

589
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:57,418
- with the sand.
- I get it.

590
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,784
- It was amazing.
- I want to go there too.

591
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,581
(Meanwhile, what are the other three up to
after their fishing fail?)

592
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,758
I'm still seasick.

593
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:08,329
I hate the sound of the waves!

594
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:10,722
(He's totally over it.)

595
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:12,200
He's traumatized.

596
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,370
What do we do now?
We should've caught something.

597
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,353
Tell me about it.

598
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:19,898
(We have no food for today.)

599
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:24,404
After suffering at sea, I hate fish now.

600
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:26,148
I used to love seafood.

601
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,260
(I'm so happy.)

602
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,330
(He was crazy about seafood.)

603
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,722
From now on, I'm all about meat.

604
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,221
(I'm going full meat mode.)

605
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,959
A seafood restaurant?
What was I even thinking?

606
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,794
- No seafood restaurant?
- No.

607
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,263
He changed career paths
after that fishing trip.

608
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:47,636
(Goodbye, my dream.)

609
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,469
(Knocking)

610
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,319
Yes?

611
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,693
- Look at his face.
- How adorable.

612
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:57,750
(Reiling, the young foreman, returns.)

613
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,780
Hey!

614
00:27:58,805 --> 00:27:59,814
It's Reiling.

615
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,521
I can take you to that cacao farm
I mentioned yesterday.

616
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,030
Oh, right.

617
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,020
A cacao farm?

618
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,590
(Last night,
after a brutal coffee-making session...)

619
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,991
Hold on! This is it!

620
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:11,542
What is that?

621
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,199
I saw this on the map!

622
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:16,097
- Isn't this the one?
- Is it a dragon fruit?

623
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:17,102
It's not a dragon fruit.

624
00:28:17,102 --> 00:28:18,733
- It's cacao.
- Cacao?

625
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:20,018
Why is it here?

626
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,480
We have tons of it.

627
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,240
I can take you to the farm tomorrow.
We can pick some up together.

628
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,542
For real?

629
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,681
Then I'll make a dessert tomorrow!

630
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:31,446
- Tomorrow morning?
- Yes.

631
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,247
(And just like that,
the Cacao Expedition is born.)

632
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:34,395
We'll go there together tomorrow.

633
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,150
- All of us, okay?
- A cacao farm?

634
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:37,819
I've never seen one!

635
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,587
I'm not going.

636
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,532
(He's still on strike from seasickness.)

637
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,010
Chocolate can help with seasickness.

638
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:45,724
No. I don't want it.

639
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,477
Come on, Nam No.

640
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:52,950
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

641
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,818
(He joins the cacao expedition
against his will.)

642
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,318
- Let's go, Nam No.
- Let's get it.

643
00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:01,251
Okay. We're going to a cacao farm now.

644
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:02,518
Put on your gloves.

645
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:04,285
I like this style of gloves.

646
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,485
(They're going to the cacao farm
in a pick-up truck.)

647
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,385
Is that how you hold onto it? Okay.

648
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:13,685
This is just like Amazon.

649
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,618
Doesn't Reiling look
like a part-timer at a theme park?

650
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:20,218
It was like "The Adventures of Sinbad"
at sea.

651
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,451
Now we're about to go on a rollercoaster.

652
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:23,151
- It's no joke.
- Seriously?

653
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:27,118
(San Rafael theme park is open.)

654
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:28,651
We'll go in threes.

655
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:33,351
- Three people here.
- Okay.

656
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,551
Nice!

657
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:37,118
- We won't get carsick, will we?
- We'll be okay, right?

658
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:38,918
This is like a tour in a theme park.

659
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:39,985
Here we go.

660
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:42,585
- It's like Everland.
- All right.

661
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,218
Nice!

662
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:46,985
(The cacao express takes off.)

663
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,051
- Ah.
- Zon.

664
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:50,585
Zon.

665
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:54,885
This is so fast. Yes!

666
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:56,651
They seem peaceful so far.

667
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:58,851
Hold on to the safety bar!

668
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:02,351
Go, Reiling!

669
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,718
Reiling.

670
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,351
Let's go.

671
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,785
(The car is at its maximum output.)

672
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:10,318
This is so fast. Yes!

673
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,118
(I'm excited.)

674
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:18,185
(About to cry)

675
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,751
I love the expression on his face.

676
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,551
- You can make so many faces.
- They can be made into emojia.

677
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,551
So cute.

678
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:25,251
It feels great to shout.

679
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:26,518
It helps de-stress.

680
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,051
This is fun.

681
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:31,251
(A customer satisfaction rate
of five stars)

682
00:30:32,085 --> 00:30:33,485
How much more are we going?

683
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:35,285
I'm curious too. I forgot to ask him.

684
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:36,685
You went quite far.

685
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,385
(Stopping abruptly)

686
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,785
- What is it?
- Are we there?

687
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:41,685
Are we?

688
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,185
- Is this the place?
- Is it?

689
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:46,218
(Reiling gets off all of a sudden.)

690
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:49,585
Okay. Now, you have to hold on tight.

691
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,118
We're going to climb the mountain.

692
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,485
It's going to be fun.

693
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,785
That's like a scene from a movie.

694
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:57,351
Oh, really?

695
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:59,251
- Okay. Hold on tightly.
- Okay?

696
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:00,318
Let's get it.

697
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,685
It's just getting started.

698
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:05,951
Let's go.

699
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,785
- Yes.
- Let's do this.

700
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:09,018
(Are you ready?)

701
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,018
(We're ready.)

702
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,751
Here we go.

703
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,418
This is unbelievable.

704
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:16,985
How will we go up?
Oh, it's going up just fine.

705
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,585
It's an unpaved road from here.

706
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:20,218
That won't be easy.

707
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,385
- It's a real jungle.
- Yes.

708
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,285
I've never been to a real jungle before.

709
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:30,685
It's like going into a dense forest.

710
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:31,551
Oh, my.

711
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,551
The trees look gorgeous.

712
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:37,518
(The kind of jungle you'd see
in "Indiana Jones")

713
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:38,885
It really looks like a Hollywood movie.

714
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,918
The road looks rugged.

715
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:46,118
Don't touch this plant.

716
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,418
Don't touch it. It'll kill you.

717
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:49,985
You can't touch it.

718
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:52,518
- Will I die if I touch it?
- You'll die right away.

719
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,951
(Scared)

720
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,351
Don't touch it.

721
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,000
Don't let any part of your body touch it.

722
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:01,549
We shouldn't touch it.

723
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:04,285
(He's desperate to survive)

724
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:05,585
So he doesn't touch it.

725
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:08,685
He's afraid of it.

726
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:12,551
Be careful. Hold on tightly.

727
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:13,618
It's so dangerous now.

728
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:17,485
(The mountain gets more rugged.)

729
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,418
Yes!

730
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,351
I guess Reiling goes through here
every day.

731
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:23,185
I guess so.

732
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,585
Get down.

733
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:29,551
Get down.

734
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,818
Don't you feel like Mario?

735
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:36,251
I think it's kind of cute.

736
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,551
We have to duck down
when there's a branch.

737
00:32:38,518 --> 00:32:39,551
That's so funny.

738
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:43,718
(Avoiding an obstacle)

739
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:44,618
Get down.

740
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:48,651
You have to get a good view.

741
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,385
They're doing a great job.

742
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,051
Oh, my gosh.

743
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,051
(Avoiding a tree,
which is an advanced-level task)

744
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,285
They're doing so well.

745
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:57,518
- Amazing.
- It's crazy.

746
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,951
- They're good.
- It's crazy.

747
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:02,051
(Avoiding a tree)

748
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,185
My goodness. It's the ocean!

749
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,018
- It's stunning.
- Look at the view.

750
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:09,051
To your right.

751
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:10,785
It's awesome.

752
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:15,351
- It's so wide too.
- It sure looks amazing.

753
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,418
- Amidst all this.
- Amazing.

754
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,451
You traveled so far.

755
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:21,885
I can keep watching this.

756
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,951
- That view.
- This place has everything.

757
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:25,951
It has everything.

758
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:28,985
Are you feeling better?

759
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:29,818
Yes.

760
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:31,818
This is nice.

761
00:33:32,318 --> 00:33:33,818
The view is amazing.

762
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:35,651
(He feels fine
as long as he doesn't get on a boat.)

763
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:39,018
Hold on tightly.
We're going to keep going up.

764
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,885
(The real off-road starts now.)

765
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:47,451
(A rough cornering)

766
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:48,518
That must've been fun.

767
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:52,151
(Shaking)

768
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:53,385
Oh, hey.

769
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:55,451
(Please drive gently.)

770
00:33:55,885 --> 00:33:57,751
Oh, boy. It's an open road.

771
00:33:57,751 --> 00:33:58,985
The car might tip over at that rate.

772
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:02,518
A speed bump is coming up. Hold tightly.

773
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:04,518
(Rattling)

774
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:10,185
(Tagada ride in the Caribbean)

775
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:13,185
(This is no joke.)

776
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,018
(Please, somebody help me.)

777
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:19,485
Nam No just recovered from being seasick.

778
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,585
He only just got better.

779
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,918
- But now you'll be carsick.
- This is...

780
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,251
- What do we do?
- It's an off-road.

781
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:27,385
(He suffers from motion sickness
twice a day already.)

782
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:32,251
When I had to enjoy off-road
after getting exhausted on the ocean,

783
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:33,085
it was much tougher.

784
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,585
I miss my mom.

785
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,651
My gosh. It's going really high up.

786
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,818
How far are we going?

787
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:43,851
We came so far out.

788
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,385
How far were you going?

789
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,618
We went quite far.

790
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,551
We're almost there.

791
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,651
I feel like I'll see something new here.

792
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:51,818
It seems we're almost there.

793
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,351
Is this a new Amazon? Where are we?

794
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,118
We're here.

795
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:00,585
Okay. We're here.

796
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:01,551
How was it?

797
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:02,785
Was it fun?

798
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:04,051
Yes, very fun.

799
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:06,451
Now, we're going to find Mr. Choi.

800
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:10,685
- Mr. Choi?
- Choi?

801
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:16,618
(Is there a Korean immigrant here?)

802
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,285
It'll be hilarious
if Choi Daniel comes out.

803
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:20,318
Dressed as an old man.

804
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,418
- Out of the blue.
- He'll go, "You're here."

805
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,518
(They came all along the way
by the cacao tourist attraction to...)

806
00:35:26,518 --> 00:35:29,585
(The Cacao farm)

807
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:32,928
(This Tasty Mission spot is their chance
to make up for the fishing fail.)

808
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,385
That's awesome.

809
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,951
(Cacao is called the fruit of the gods.)

810
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,251
It's my first time seeing it.

811
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:40,051
I didn't know it was that big.

812
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,351
It's bigger than a Korean melon.

813
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:43,385
(About 12 acres of vast land
bearing the fruit of the gods)

814
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:44,418
That's crazy.

815
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:49,218
(And the real owner of this farm)

816
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:50,785
(I'm Mr. Che, not Choi.)

817
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:51,751
Mr. Che?

818
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,818
- He's a relative of Reiling's.
- He looks laid-back.

819
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,951
It must be a family business.

820
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,985
(He seems to be a big name
in cacao in San Rafael.)

821
00:35:57,985 --> 00:35:58,851
- He looks relaxed.
- Yes.

822
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:00,385
Right. He looks charismatic.

823
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:02,085
He's so cool.

824
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:05,785
(They go into the waves of cacao
with Mr. Che.)

825
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:07,751
Isn't that red thing a cacao?

826
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:09,918
- In front of him.
- Right?

827
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,385
The red fruit over there.

828
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:12,851
- That red fruit?
- Right?

829
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:20,151
Yes, they are all cacao.

830
00:36:20,151 --> 00:36:22,685
You can pick these
because they've ripened.

831
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:26,385
You can pick the cacaos
that look like this.

832
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:27,551
- The red ones?
- The red ones.

833
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:29,918
(Trinitaro is a key product
of the Dominican Republic.)

834
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:31,385
- The ones that look like this.
- Okay.

835
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:32,885
The red one.

836
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,118
I can see that cacao comes
in different colors.

837
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:38,085
There must be different varieties.

838
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:39,551
(Ripened)

839
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,351
It becomes green and then turns yellow.

840
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:43,951
Joon, can you try and pick this?

841
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:45,651
- This one?
- The yellow one?

842
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:46,718
Yes, the yellow one.

843
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:48,751
Do I go like this?

844
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:51,051
Yes, twist it like that.

845
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:52,118
- How will he do it?
- What?

846
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:53,385
I've never seen that before.

847
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:54,351
It looks like a Korean melon.

848
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,885
(He twists it, then picks it.)

849
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:57,818
Okay.

850
00:36:57,818 --> 00:37:00,085
(Easily acquiring his first cacao)

851
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:01,018
Cacao.

852
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:02,318
The shell is very hard.

853
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:05,551
(Now is the perfect time to harvest
when it's soft enough to press slightly.)

854
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:06,485
I can smell it.

855
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:11,485
What?

856
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:16,451
(He suddenly takes out his knife.)

857
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,251
What is he going to do?

858
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:20,718
I have a knife too.

859
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:21,618
What is he going to do?

860
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,885
(I didn't say anything.)

861
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:26,751
I guess he'll open it right away.

862
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:30,551
(It looks like he's going
to open the cacao for them.)

863
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,785
- That's fascinating.
- It looks like cotton.

864
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,918
(It's full of cacao beans.)

865
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:39,951
It's amazing.

866
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:42,751
(The white pulp is huddled here.)

867
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,018
Is that how it looks inside?

868
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:45,918
I didn't know the pulp looked like that.

869
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:47,585
- It's like garlic.
- It's so interesting.

870
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:48,518
How can we eat it?

871
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,051
You can eat it by sucking it.

872
00:37:53,051 --> 00:37:53,951
By sucking it?

873
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:55,951
It looks delicious.

874
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:57,518
- We just suck it to eat?
- Yes.

875
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:02,318
(Eyes wide open)

876
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:03,818
I wonder how it tastes.

877
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,385
I really want to try it.

878
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:10,385
It's sweet and sour.

879
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,718
- It's delicious.
- It's so good.

880
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:15,218
(The cacao pulp is sweet and sour.)

881
00:38:15,218 --> 00:38:16,985
That tastes sweet and sour?

882
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:17,885
That's so fascinating.

883
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:19,985
I never thought cacao would be
sweet and sour.

884
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:23,018
I thought it'd be similar to mangosteen.

885
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:24,251
It's 8 to 10 times more delicious.

886
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,518
It tastes much better.

887
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:26,351
Is it sweet?

888
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:28,785
It's sweet, has a rich taste,

889
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:29,818
and has high acidity too.

890
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:32,451
I think I had around 20 of those.

891
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:34,585
- That's how I eat.
- I had so many.

892
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:37,085
(It's good, isn't it?)

893
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,818
- It tastes good, right?
- This is amazing.

894
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,818
How can it taste like this?

895
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,185
How can cacao taste like this?

896
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:42,985
What's this?
So this is how it tastes.

897
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,151
(I'm glad I used my knife.)

898
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:49,270
But they make chocolate with the seed,
so just eat the flesh and spit it out.

899
00:38:50,178 --> 00:38:52,429
- So, we're using the seed.
- Right.

900
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,014
Do I spit it here...

901
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,852
We're using the seed that was in my mouth?

902
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,087
Really?

903
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,089
Are we not supposed to eat this, then?

904
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:03,290
Can't we?

905
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,426
(Actually, the chocolate we know...)

906
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:08,761
(is the seed left after we eat the pulp.)

907
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,765
That's the one I know. The black one.

908
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,400
- Yes, that's it.
- I thought the same.

909
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:16,470
- We know the one without any pulp.
- Yes.

910
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,940
(The seeds are fermented for a week.)

911
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:22,096
Yes, that's it.

912
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,444
That's the one.

913
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:27,259
That's where the process of making
the chocolate we know started.

914
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,852
I'll try my best to help you out.

915
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,757
(They'll be doing not only Tasty Mission,
but also helping out Mr. Che.)

916
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:38,191
It seems relatively easy.

917
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:40,727
Compared to how we had to climb high
to pick fruits yesterday.

918
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,429
- Like how we picked fruits yesterday?
- They're near land.

919
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,164
I think we can pick tons of them.

920
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:45,465
It'll be easy.

921
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,067
(Behold, cacao pods!)

922
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:48,068
Let's get it.

923
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,504
You can pick ones that look like this.

924
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:52,505
It looks like a Korean melon.

925
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,173
Oh, we can pick the yellow ones?

926
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:55,175
Is that right?

927
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,845
It has a different color
because it's a different kind.

928
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,914
This one has a different color.

929
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:02,549
(Two different cacao pods ripe
in red and yellow.)

930
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,152
(I expect you do well, Koreans.)

931
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:07,054
Snap this one, and I'll catch it.

932
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:09,356
Which one? This one? Okay.

933
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:10,424
You can snap that one off.

934
00:40:10,424 --> 00:40:12,139
With the blade here.

935
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,694
(After a short complaint,
he is now working hard.)

936
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:15,662
- Is that a knife?
- Yes.

937
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,798
The blade is like a sickle.

938
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:20,788
(Cutting off with his muscles)

939
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,760
(He has no problem getting
the cacao pod up high.)

940
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,465
That was pretty stable.

941
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:28,396
- Isn't he great?
- He is.

942
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:29,497
Yes, he's good at this.

943
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:30,766
- He's got the talent.
- Right.

944
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:31,767
Where is it?

945
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,902
It's too high. Hold on.

946
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:36,405
(Jun pulls down the branch.)

947
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,573
Did you get it?

948
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:38,974
Yes.

949
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:40,411
Okay.

950
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:41,953
(Nam No jumps to pick it.)

951
00:40:41,977 --> 00:40:42,978
Okay.

952
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:48,550
(Ok Vin does the final check.)

953
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:51,498
The one inside there looks good.

954
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,520
- This one is the gold mine.
- It's a jackpot.

955
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:55,670
Look here. This is what I'm talking about.

956
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,163
(Cacao pods are piling up.)

957
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:01,430
That's something
you'll never experience again.

958
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,733
(He said he didn't have
to get paid, but...)

959
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:09,839
(Nam No braves the jungle alone.)

960
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:11,783
How can I resist this one?

961
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,508
I really enjoyed doing that.

962
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:15,344
I'll pick one more.

963
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:19,847
(As they pick cacao non-stop)

964
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:21,837
I never thought I'd see a raw cacao pod
in real life.

965
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:22,762
I know.

966
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:27,692
(It's already been an hour.)

967
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,633
(Team Cacao is harvesting
without a break.)

968
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:31,260
Go for that one. I'll hold this stem.

969
00:41:31,326 --> 00:41:34,629
We almost picked
all the ones near the land.

970
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:38,109
- Can you reach it?
- Hey!

971
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:39,433
- Are you all right?
- He was hit.

972
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:42,870
(He can surely snap this one
without a sweat, right?)

973
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:43,738
What happened?

974
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,174
(The cacao pod hit Nam No's head.)

975
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,076
- That must be painful.
- Oh, my.

976
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:50,044
It is painful. It's really hard.

977
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:54,355
(The production crew is stirred.)

978
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:57,487
- Just talk to me if you want to complain.
- Gosh.

979
00:41:57,853 --> 00:41:59,554
Goodness. I'm so sorry.

980
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:02,056
- Oh, dear. Are you okay?
- What do we do with injuries?

981
00:42:02,057 --> 00:42:04,459
- Reiling, I can't do it anymore.
- I think he's done here.

982
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:07,090
We could all get hurt like him.

983
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:09,864
Just tell me what you want.
Please don't hurt me.

984
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:11,019
It's such a dangerous job.

985
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,186
You just cracked my skull.

986
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:14,656
I know. He could get a concussion.

987
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,746
What should we do?

988
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,293
Take a five.

989
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,693
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

990
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:21,997
- I'll take a five-minute break.
- The injured should rest.

991
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:28,171
Can you drop it on my head too?

992
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,737
- That's pretty embarrassing.
- Smart move.

993
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:31,908
I'm sweating like a dog.

994
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:38,446
Where are you going?
You've got work to do!

995
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:42,885
Hey, man. Where do you think you're going?

996
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:44,452
Seriously, it hit my temples.

997
00:42:44,453 --> 00:42:45,788
Are you seriously feeling sick?

998
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:49,357
(Liar)

999
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,758
Just tell me if you want to complain.

1000
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:53,929
(I can't blame them. It's hard.)

1001
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,630
- It's so cute.
- That donkey is adorable.

1002
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:57,932
(He spots Mr. Che's cute donkey.)

1003
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,033
Hi there.

1004
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:00,769
Oh, it's a horse!

1005
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:02,871
That's just so cute.

1006
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:04,505
(Sneakily in a break,
thanks to the donkey)

1007
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,474
- Isn't it a donkey?
- It is.

1008
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:09,111
It's as small as Jeju horses.

1009
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:11,112
Look, before you take a break,

1010
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:13,781
you need to fill two sacks up
with cacao pods.

1011
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,385
- I knew he was going to put them to work.
- No worries. I'll do it.

1012
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:20,923
We used up gas to get all the way here.

1013
00:43:20,923 --> 00:43:23,759
- We should at least bag two sacks.
- You don't have to worry about it.

1014
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:26,929
Don't worry.

1015
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:28,964
I'll be good.

1016
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:35,369
Not a chance.
Let's fill two sacks up already.

1017
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,373
Come on, give us a break.

1018
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,398
- He's such a hardhead.
- He is.

1019
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,277
We can enjoy nature
while also studying it.

1020
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:44,044
Come on. We're doing it for the show.

1021
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:46,848
(Reiling, my boy...)

1022
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:50,485
(Do you need my help?)

1023
00:43:51,553 --> 00:43:52,553
Why the blade?

1024
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:56,023
(A fixer to settle things down appears!)

1025
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:58,959
(Getting close)

1026
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:01,129
Oh, hey.

1027
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:06,844
(Sometimes actions speak louder
than words.)

1028
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:07,870
- Is that a machete?
- What's that?

1029
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:09,933
- Is that a machete?
- What's that?

1030
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:10,805
That's...

1031
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:14,882
I've got a blade too.
I just don't have it right now.

1032
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:16,812
Let's just get back to work now.

1033
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,080
We should work.

1034
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:18,985
Hold on.

1035
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:20,532
(Suddenly, it became a thriller movie.)

1036
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,083
The genre has changed.

1037
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:24,052
(No, it's not a thriller.)

1038
00:44:24,053 --> 00:44:25,186
What is this?

1039
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:27,655
That's an orange?

1040
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,456
Reiling, what is it?

1041
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:32,059
- He peels it off with that machete!
- It's an orange?

1042
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,262
That's so romantically wild.

1043
00:44:34,263 --> 00:44:38,255
And it's really hard to peel it
without cutting into it.

1044
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,496
- Right.
- That's incredible.

1045
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:42,738
He's better than my mom.
He's way better than any Koreans.

1046
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,702
- Yes, that's perfect.
- It's amazing.

1047
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:45,974
How? With that machete?

1048
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,374
Is this the palm heart?

1049
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,877
(He peeled it in a flash.)

1050
00:44:48,878 --> 00:44:50,994
- Try it.
- He peeled it so well.

1051
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,383
(A big bite of an orange)

1052
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,340
How is it?

1053
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,721
This one is well-ripened.

1054
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:01,690
- Is it?
- Yes.

1055
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:03,292
There are many seeds, though.

1056
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,012
- There are many seeds, though.
- Look at its color.

1057
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,458
It is perfectly ripe.

1058
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,529
How juicy.

1059
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:10,465
It's actually really good.

1060
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:12,567
- It's good, right?
- That looks great.

1061
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:13,300
I like it.

1062
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:16,638
It's nothing like
what you gave me yesterday.

1063
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:19,481
- That bitter one?
- It was really bitter and sour.

1064
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:21,076
An orange should taste like this.

1065
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:23,444
He knows how to peel these.

1066
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:24,779
(Mr. Che is quietly
peeling off an orange.)

1067
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,315
He's so good with the blade.

1068
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,640
His skills are incredible.

1069
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:31,545
Ironically, people like him struggle
with small knives.

1070
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:37,559
- It's just like how Chinese chefs...
- That's just crazy.

1071
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,925
- do it with their cleavers.
- Right.

1072
00:45:40,596 --> 00:45:45,767
(This orange is for Nam No,
who's withering away.)

1073
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:48,369
Actually,
it seems like it's not quite ripe yet.

1074
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,571
(He's cracking up.)

1075
00:45:50,806 --> 00:45:54,342
(Well, he doesn't speak Spanish.)

1076
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:56,811
(Yuck)

1077
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:58,814
Come on. This isn't right.

1078
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:02,250
(Let me taste it.)

1079
00:46:02,274 --> 00:46:04,286
- Yes, it's not ripe.
- Come on!

1080
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:07,054
(The whole family is out to get him.)

1081
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,856
- How did you get the unripe one again?
- I have no idea.

1082
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:10,257
They always get the tasty ones.

1083
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:13,594
(He entertains everyone
and gracefully leaves.)

1084
00:46:13,618 --> 00:46:15,254
I can't believe this!

1085
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,966
He got you again.

1086
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:19,987
Why do we keep getting messed with?

1087
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:22,498
(Nam No ended up with tasty orange too.)

1088
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,265
He's a great man, just with a machete.

1089
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:27,309
I'd like to have chocolate today.
I'm tired.

1090
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:29,311
A really expensive one.

1091
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:33,649
Do they have chocolates here?

1092
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,384
(There's something Nam No has forgotten.)

1093
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:37,216
What's the matter?

1094
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,087
(The first day in the Dominican Republic)

1095
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,621
You need to be careful
what you wish for here.

1096
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:44,391
Or else you'll have to work your butt off
for the ingredient.

1097
00:46:44,393 --> 00:46:46,160
I should choose my words carefully.

1098
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:49,963
Let's say you craved lobster.

1099
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,500
Then, you have to get it yourself
from the water.

1100
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,328
(He was so excited
about not getting in the water.)

1101
00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:56,681
(Well, now he's done for.)

1102
00:46:56,705 --> 00:47:00,074
(Nam No, I think we're going
to work in the fields.)

1103
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:01,215
She's swearing with her eyes.

1104
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,779
Well, then.
I'd have to show you the chocolate.

1105
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,817
We'll show you how to process
cacao beans into chocolate.

1106
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:14,155
(What about processing it into chocolate?)

1107
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:16,082
(Thus,
Reiling's chocolate factory is open.)

1108
00:47:16,106 --> 00:47:17,368
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no.

1109
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,093
I feel so sorry for them.

1110
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:23,031
Wait. Why is this...

1111
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:24,835
Hold on.

1112
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,768
- Just give me a minute.
- Reiling.

1113
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:29,237
Why is this here?

1114
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:39,414
(Reuniting with the mortar and pestle
that plunged them into a coffee nightmare)

1115
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,884
(Please, not again today.)

1116
00:47:42,884 --> 00:47:44,811
Their faces tell me
they sensed what's going to happen.

1117
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:50,091
(Welcome to the chocolate factory...)

1118
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:54,362
(run by the cocoa godfather of San Rafael,
Mr. Che, and Railing.)

1119
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:57,397
I'll walk you through the schedule.

1120
00:47:57,399 --> 00:47:59,533
In order to make chocolate,

1121
00:47:59,534 --> 00:48:02,436
we ferment the cacao beans
on banana leaves.

1122
00:48:02,437 --> 00:48:05,539
Roast the beans and separate the shells.

1123
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:07,049
- Then, put them in a mortar...
- Good grief.

1124
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:08,509
and grind them.

1125
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,312
So that's how the chocolate we know
is made.

1126
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:13,447
I see.

1127
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:14,416
Are you all right?

1128
00:48:14,816 --> 00:48:16,718
Can you show us how to do it?

1129
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:18,587
Okay.

1130
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:25,626
You take out the beans like this
and ferment them.

1131
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:28,255
(First step is to ferment them
for a week...)

1132
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,874
(to reduce bitterness
and add more flavor.)

1133
00:48:29,898 --> 00:48:31,072
Wrap it in the banana leaves.

1134
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,134
How long do they ferment it?

1135
00:48:33,135 --> 00:48:34,769
- For a week.
- For seven days.

1136
00:48:34,903 --> 00:48:35,837
Right.

1137
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,541
Okay. That's easy.

1138
00:48:40,342 --> 00:48:41,642
Take out the seeds from the cacao pod.

1139
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:43,478
I just shove my fingers in here.

1140
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:48,409
(Just like Oompa Loompas
from the chocolate factory)

1141
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:49,766
It's easy.

1142
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:52,936
That looks neat.

1143
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:55,182
(Reiling's Chocolate Factory is
manufacturing in perfect order.)

1144
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:57,641
- They look like garlic cloves.
- They do.

1145
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,043
That looks so tasty.

1146
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:01,778
Yes, they look like that.

1147
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:04,501
These are the cacao beans
that we're familiar with.

1148
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,336
(Roasting)

1149
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,437
Okay. Now, let's try roasting
the fermented beans.

1150
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:17,995
(Roasting is my specialty!)

1151
00:49:18,065 --> 00:49:19,762
(Roasting removes
the astringent and bitter flavors.)

1152
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:22,083
They look like coffee beans right now.

1153
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:23,725
- They do.
- Yes, or almonds.

1154
00:49:23,725 --> 00:49:25,076
- Yes, they do look like almonds.
- Yes.

1155
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,001
It takes a lot of work.

1156
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:32,179
(Let's see how they taste different now.)

1157
00:49:33,747 --> 00:49:34,748
It's like an almond.

1158
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,642
I still can't believe
how this turns into chocolate.

1159
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,779
I don't smell any chocolate right now.
How does that happen?

1160
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,380
They're just like almonds.

1161
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:46,999
(There are two more steps left.)

1162
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,511
(Removing the shells)

1163
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:52,200
(Removing the shells)

1164
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,473
The color makes me think they're burnt.

1165
00:49:54,473 --> 00:49:55,947
Isn't that burnt?

1166
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,324
(Aren't they over-roasting beans?)

1167
00:49:57,571 --> 00:49:59,273
We burned them so that...

1168
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:01,607
(It easily comes off.)

1169
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,857
- See?
- It's really easy.

1170
00:50:03,858 --> 00:50:05,424
(The shell comes off as easy as a peanut.)

1171
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:07,202
You can peel them like peanuts!

1172
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:11,773
It's so easy.

1173
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,825
Okay.

1174
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:17,545
Check out the kernel.

1175
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,414
(General Ok Vin with fast hands grabs
a handful.)

1176
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:20,264
Okay.

1177
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:22,784
I got it now.

1178
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:25,186
It feels pretty good to de-shell them.

1179
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:26,554
- Yes!
- It's fun.

1180
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:27,569
(The shells come off.)

1181
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:33,025
(General Ok Vin's
incredible performance...)

1182
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:34,529
So, that's how they do it.

1183
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,554
The first person to figure that out was
a genius.

1184
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:38,266
- How did they come up with that?
- I know, right?

1185
00:50:39,024 --> 00:50:41,187
(Crushing them in a mortar)

1186
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,141
(Pestlig Time has come!)

1187
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:47,676
Okay. It's time.

1188
00:50:47,701 --> 00:50:49,277
Harder!

1189
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:52,194
(When crushing the coffee beans,)

1190
00:50:52,194 --> 00:50:55,154
(Joon and Nam No had a nightmare
of endless "sigue.")

1191
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:56,324
Let's go gentle.

1192
00:50:57,385 --> 00:51:00,952
Nam No, it's the same time as yesterday.

1193
00:51:00,952 --> 00:51:01,802
Yes.

1194
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:04,311
- What did you crush last night?
- Coffee beans.

1195
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,396
- Coffee beans.
- Coffee beans and cacao nibs.

1196
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:10,231
It's about the same time.

1197
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:11,783
(He gently crushes...)

1198
00:51:11,783 --> 00:51:14,233
(the cacao beans.)

1199
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:17,272
You're good. You're very delicate.

1200
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:18,506
Otherwise, it'd be popping.

1201
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:21,276
Yes. These beans go everywhere.

1202
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:22,617
I noticed that.

1203
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:25,280
(Super-focused on the mortar)

1204
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,949
Don't you have a work song for this one?

1205
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:30,552
A song.

1206
00:51:30,552 --> 00:51:32,787
- Song.
- Majar

1207
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:34,422
- Majar
- Majar

1208
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:36,524
What does that mean? "Majar?"

1209
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,093
- Majar.
- Majar.

1210
00:51:38,156 --> 00:51:39,761
- What does "majar" mean?
- "Crush."

1211
00:51:39,858 --> 00:51:41,863
- "Crush?"
- "Crush the cacao beans."

1212
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,565
- Okay. "Majar."
- Yes.

1213
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:52,484
(Crushing with all his power)

1214
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,242
- Cacao.
- He's good.

1215
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:57,746
(Mr. Che also joins them.)

1216
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,018
(Majar cacao)

1217
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:01,816
- He's cute.
- So cute.

1218
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:03,362
Harder!

1219
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:05,508
(Desperately crushing them for chocolate)

1220
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:08,590
As hard as you can!

1221
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:10,896
(The mortar factory...)

1222
00:52:10,896 --> 00:52:12,484
(is bursting out.)

1223
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:14,433
Yes! That's good!

1224
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,815
(I will give it my all.)

1225
00:52:16,815 --> 00:52:17,966
You're doing great!

1226
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:21,669
- Harder.
- Yes!

1227
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:26,131
(The mortar train can't be stopped.)

1228
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,676
Harder!

1229
00:52:28,676 --> 00:52:30,345
Yes!

1230
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:34,293
(The chocolate factory is
about to explode.)

1231
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:35,289
- Harder!
- Start.

1232
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:41,923
(Keep going!)

1233
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,125
Why are you going so fast?

1234
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:46,895
He's going too fast.

1235
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,374
- Slower.
- Okay.

1236
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,735
Slower.

1237
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:53,859
- Sigue.
- Sigue.

1238
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:56,292
He's so good at controlling them.

1239
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:57,605
He's a good trainer.

1240
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,991
(He successfully trained Ok Vin and Joon.)

1241
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:03,788
(The last spurt)

1242
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:06,648
It looks incredibly fine now.
How interesting.

1243
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:09,851
- They worked so hard.
- It's finely crushed.

1244
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:12,865
(Bringing out all their power...)

1245
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,757
(to crush them down to the atoms)

1246
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:17,302
(I gave my all.)

1247
00:53:17,302 --> 00:53:19,527
It's tough, isn't it?
Just ten times, and you're exhausted.

1248
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:22,207
- It really is tough.
- How heavy is it?

1249
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,565
- It's huge.
- I'm out of breath.

1250
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:25,988
What if they find a grinder after this?

1251
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,886
(Were they tricked again?)

1252
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,604
- To grind the beans.
- Like, "It's tough, isn't it?"

1253
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:30,805
He might have.

1254
00:53:30,805 --> 00:53:32,040
I bet he has one.

1255
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,975
It's finely crushed.

1256
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,343
It's like fine sand
you see at playgrounds.

1257
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,850
It smells...

1258
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:43,571
It's finely crushed.

1259
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:47,455
Smell this. I would use it
as an air freshener.

1260
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,023
(It's so sweet and deep that he wants
to use it as an air freshener.)

1261
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:49,873
How sweet.

1262
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:53,228
- It's extremely sweet, right?
- It's rich.

1263
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:56,102
I wish my body smelled like this.

1264
00:53:56,126 --> 00:53:57,529
We should put it on our bodies.

1265
00:53:58,293 --> 00:54:01,669
It was so aromatic.

1266
00:54:01,669 --> 00:54:03,805
- You did want to use it as a diffuser.
- Yes.

1267
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:06,958
You're supposed to crush them
until you see oil.

1268
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,790
(You crush them longer,
and thick oil comes out...)

1269
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,009
(to turn it into a lump.)

1270
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:12,917
- Oh, right!
- You have to crush them that long?

1271
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,569
- They're seeds, so you'll get oil.
- Yes.

1272
00:54:15,393 --> 00:54:17,152
You get that if you keep going.

1273
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:19,125
(This is 100-percent real cacao.)

1274
00:54:19,149 --> 00:54:20,922
It becomes like peanut butter in the end.

1275
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:23,758
It smells so sweet.

1276
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:24,836
(Rummaging)

1277
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:27,230
What's that?

1278
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:29,964
- It looks like that?
- What is that?

1279
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:31,799
It looks like a gold bar.

1280
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:32,883
This is chocolate?

1281
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,602
It's 100-percent cacao?

1282
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:36,063
Interesting.

1283
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:37,505
It's so interesting.

1284
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:39,874
This isn't chocolate. It's cacao.

1285
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:42,544
- It's authentic cacao.
- It's compressed.

1286
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:45,313
- Can I try it?
- It's like an extract.

1287
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:46,618
Exactly.

1288
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:48,062
It's 100 percent.

1289
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:53,755
Why does it taste like coffee?

1290
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:56,090
I don't sense any chocolate.

1291
00:54:56,288 --> 00:54:57,292
Really?

1292
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:58,693
Why did he bring ketchup?

1293
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:01,126
- That's so random.
- I thought...

1294
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:02,654
(Reiling brought another thing?)

1295
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:03,504
What's that?

1296
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,303
What is that? Sugar?

1297
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:06,725
Is that ketchup?

1298
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,415
(There's sugar in the ketchup bottle.)

1299
00:55:11,897 --> 00:55:13,341
(Mix the cacao with sugar.)

1300
00:55:13,374 --> 00:55:14,597
With sugar...

1301
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:16,508
- That was so good!
- It turns into chocolate.

1302
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:19,484
- Because it's sugar.
- Cacao nibs and sugar...

1303
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:20,334
- make chocolate?
- It's so good.

1304
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,016
It tastes incredibly good.

1305
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:23,111
Let me try some.

1306
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:24,672
Okay.

1307
00:55:27,712 --> 00:55:28,690
It's really good.

1308
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:30,892
I'm so curious.

1309
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,228
It tastes like chocolate!

1310
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:35,063
Really?

1311
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,183
How interesting.

1312
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:37,522
It's different.

1313
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,568
So, this is genuine chocolate.

1314
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:44,776
The cacao itself tastes like coffee,

1315
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,945
but you get chocolate
by mixing it with sugar?

1316
00:55:46,945 --> 00:55:48,079
- Yes.
- When you put the two together?

1317
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,478
You can feel the sugar in your mouth,

1318
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:54,161
and the crushed powder
that we roasted mixes with it.

1319
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:57,452
Then, you think,
"So, this is how chocolate tastes!"

1320
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:00,488
- It's the original taste.
- That's so cool.

1321
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:03,691
After eating that, I was convinced
that I should make dessert.

1322
00:56:04,692 --> 00:56:08,380
Dessert made of local cacao beans
that you picked yourself...

1323
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,587
- would make anyone excited.
- I'm excited.

1324
00:56:09,587 --> 00:56:10,531
And Nam No is known for his desserts.
- Yes.
- Indeed.

1325
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:12,267
That's true.

1326
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:16,948
You can take the cacao powder
that you crushed.

1327
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:18,063
Great.

1328
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:20,525
(Cacao bar is also a present.)

1329
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:21,509
Thank you so much.

1330
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:24,479
I'll be able to make
such delicious desserts today.

1331
00:56:24,776 --> 00:56:25,947
I can't wait to try it.

1332
00:56:26,077 --> 00:56:27,615
Nam No is known for his great desserts.

1333
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,950
I can't wait.

1334
00:56:31,342 --> 00:56:34,179
(The three returned home
after the Tasty Mission.)

1335
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:39,884
(Slurping)

1336
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:41,005
- Is that ramyeon?
- He's eating again?

1337
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:41,855
I bet it's Nam No.

1338
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:43,454
- Again?
- No way.

1339
00:56:43,454 --> 00:56:44,332
Could it be?

1340
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:47,568
Ramyeon is possibly
the best food in the world.

1341
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,404
Ramyeon is the best.

1342
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:51,927
(This ramyeon enthusiast is eating
three cups of ramyeon a day.)

1343
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:54,442
He ate so much in between.

1344
00:56:54,842 --> 00:56:56,077
How is he eating...

1345
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,783
(Nam No kept deliciously eating ramyeon,
and it led to...)

1346
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:04,185
Chef, could you make
Chapaghetti for us too?

1347
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,954
Sure. Just get the water boiling.
I'll cook for you.

1348
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:07,889
Seriously?

1349
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:11,963
Chapaguri? Yes, I can make it.

1350
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:13,194
I can make Chapaguri.

1351
00:57:13,194 --> 00:57:14,429
Okay.

1352
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:15,646
Okay.

1353
00:57:16,575 --> 00:57:17,665
I can't wait to see it.

1354
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:18,599
How many are you?

1355
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,948
- We're a big staff.
- About 30.

1356
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,461
Hang on. How big is the pot?

1357
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:25,884
- Okay.
- No matter how good he is,

1358
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:28,376
it'll be tough to make 30 servings.

1359
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:29,482
Of course, it is.

1360
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:32,080
Try making it that way. It's so different.

1361
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:34,179
Oh, my gosh.

1362
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,640
(His recipe will be revealed now.)

1363
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,490
That looks scrumptious.

1364
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,620
It's better to split them in half
when you're making them in bulk.

1365
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:43,458
When you're cooking in bulk,
you need to split them in half...

1366
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:46,794
so that the noodles don't get too soggy.

1367
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:48,162
They don't get soggy.

1368
00:57:49,847 --> 00:57:51,566
So far, it seems pretty normal.

1369
00:57:51,566 --> 00:57:53,591
- Even we could do it.
- Should we take notes?

1370
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:54,441
We should take notes.

1371
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:56,461
(The real recipe begins now.)

1372
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,507
He's got the vibe.

1373
00:57:59,507 --> 00:58:01,014
(Today's Chapaghetti cook,)

1374
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,576
(Yun Nam No)

1375
00:58:05,377 --> 00:58:07,415
If you want to make Chapaghetti better,

1376
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:11,819
you need something spicy.
Like we add chili powder to jjajangmyeon.

1377
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:13,488
- What's that?
- Cheongyang chili?

1378
00:58:13,513 --> 00:58:14,929
(Spicy chili)

1379
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,095
(Olive oil)

1380
00:58:17,095 --> 00:58:17,945
Olive oil?

1381
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:20,561
Olive oil and Chapaghetti go so well
with each other.

1382
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,662
(A bunch of chili powder)

1383
00:58:24,662 --> 00:58:26,291
Chili powder makes it spicy.

1384
00:58:26,316 --> 00:58:27,692
That's a lot of chili powder.

1385
00:58:27,692 --> 00:58:29,540
I know, right? He's adding so much.

1386
00:58:29,894 --> 00:58:30,744
Salt.

1387
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,074
Chili, olive oil, salt...

1388
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:36,828
You want the oil to soak up the salt
to season it properly.

1389
00:58:36,828 --> 00:58:38,646
Without salt, it gets bland over time.

1390
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:40,915
- Because you added a lot of olive oil.
- Yes.

1391
00:58:41,025 --> 00:58:42,150
Chili and...

1392
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,985
Chili and chili powder.

1393
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:48,890
It's like making
seasoned red-pepper sauce.

1394
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,993
- Oil.
- And you put it afterward.

1395
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,260
There's one more thing left.

1396
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,026
(Nam No's final kick will be added.)

1397
00:58:54,026 --> 00:58:57,354
It's delicious
with hot oil poured over and mixed in.

1398
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:00,535
It tastes like
Sichuan-style jjajang ramyeon.

1399
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,260
(He boils the olive oil briefly.)

1400
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,212
Here we go.

1401
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:09,893
- It's like chili oil.
- Right.

1402
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:13,493
(Pouring the hot oil)

1403
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:15,957
- You add the boiling olive oil?
- Yes.

1404
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,860
(Boiling hot chili oil)

1405
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,494
I could try this at home.

1406
00:59:20,693 --> 00:59:22,126
(Adding the flakes from the ramyeon)

1407
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,398
Ramyeon flakes?

1408
00:59:24,026 --> 00:59:26,512
They puff up nicely in the oil.

1409
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:28,102
They add more flavor.

1410
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:30,893
That has to be good.

1411
00:59:30,893 --> 00:59:33,493
- Just that itself looks delicious.
- I know, right?

1412
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:36,126
(The water is boiling.)

1413
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:38,835
(It's time to boil the noodles.)

1414
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,616
You have to break the noodles in half.

1415
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,959
That way, it's easier to take out
when it's perfectly cooked.

1416
00:59:48,658 --> 00:59:50,258
- Just look at that.
- It looks delicious.

1417
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:53,326
(The pot is full.)

1418
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:55,660
He's excited.

1419
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,760
He got excited while boiling ramyeon.

1420
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,593
(Just the look of ramyeon
makes him smile.)

1421
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,737
Nam No, what are you cooking?

1422
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:04,439
I'm cooking...

1423
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:08,026
I'm cooking Chapaghetti for the crew.

1424
01:00:08,026 --> 01:00:09,210
The smell is crazy.

1425
01:00:09,426 --> 01:00:10,493
I'll whip something up.

1426
01:00:10,493 --> 01:00:11,426
- Please wait a little.
- Gosh.

1427
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,350
- Thank you. I love you.
- It's nothing.

1428
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:16,918
You worked so hard.

1429
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:18,848
You're back.

1430
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,215
Yes, I'm back. Are you all right?

1431
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:21,282
You got so tanned.

1432
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:22,548
- Did I?
- Yes, you turned brown.

1433
01:00:22,573 --> 01:00:23,920
I haven't seen myself in the mirror yet.

1434
01:00:23,944 --> 01:00:24,991
Gosh!

1435
01:00:25,015 --> 01:00:26,548
- It smells amazing, right?
- What are you cooking?

1436
01:00:26,548 --> 01:00:27,382
It's Chapaghetti.

1437
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,515
- I was cooking it for the crew.
- Really?

1438
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:31,309
(Salivating)

1439
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,525
I'm seeing
so many different sides of Nam No today.

1440
01:00:36,782 --> 01:00:39,455
He looks so sexy when he cooks.

1441
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:41,598
He's so sexy now,

1442
01:00:41,782 --> 01:00:43,982
but he was a child this morning.

1443
01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:45,068
Was he?

1444
01:00:46,154 --> 01:00:49,269
He was struggling so hard
on the boat earlier.

1445
01:00:49,715 --> 01:00:50,941
It's too hard for me.

1446
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:54,877
When he's not cooking,

1447
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:58,217
he's like a completely different person.

1448
01:00:59,548 --> 01:01:02,815
(Chef mode is on.)

1449
01:01:03,248 --> 01:01:06,207
If you deliberately undercook
the noodles...

1450
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,173
and let them simmer down,
the starch will make it better.

1451
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:12,996
- It's like a pasta.
- You reserved some noodle water.

1452
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:14,764
That's significant.

1453
01:01:17,982 --> 01:01:20,548
(He doesn't forget to slurp the noodles.)

1454
01:01:21,915 --> 01:01:25,315
(Adding the jjajang powder)

1455
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:28,323
I wonder what the ramyeon cooked
by a chef will taste like.

1456
01:01:28,347 --> 01:01:29,379
Same.

1457
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:32,282
You've shown me...

1458
01:01:32,306 --> 01:01:34,158
- so many sides of yourself today.
- That looks scrumptious.

1459
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:35,305
That looks amazing.

1460
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,088
It's just so different.

1461
01:01:38,382 --> 01:01:41,358
He looks so happy when he cooks.

1462
01:01:41,715 --> 01:01:42,859
But we put him on the boat.

1463
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:46,215
Let me just...

1464
01:01:47,515 --> 01:01:48,598
It's hot in here.

1465
01:01:49,515 --> 01:01:50,900
Should I wipe off your sweat?

1466
01:01:51,348 --> 01:01:53,882
I made some chili oil there.
Please bring it.

1467
01:01:53,882 --> 01:01:55,548
- What do you need?
- Chili oil.

1468
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:57,607
You need chili oil? Where is it?

1469
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,310
Where... Oh, I found it.

1470
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:03,346
Here you go.

1471
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:06,015
Are you going to put this in there?

1472
01:02:06,315 --> 01:02:07,182
I'm going to...

1473
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,548
That's fascinating.

1474
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:10,415
I wish I could have it again.

1475
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:13,415
You know what?
I know I'm going to love this.

1476
01:02:13,415 --> 01:02:15,015
That's just awesome.

1477
01:02:15,015 --> 01:02:16,826
This is only for the production crew,
right?

1478
01:02:17,982 --> 01:02:19,729
I want to taste this so badly.

1479
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:23,082
Gosh, it looks great.

1480
01:02:23,082 --> 01:02:28,145
I've never had ramyeon cooked
by a professional chef.

1481
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:30,982
Seriously, that looks amazing.

1482
01:02:30,982 --> 01:02:33,115
- He's a genius.
- That's just crazy.

1483
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:34,848
When we want to eat jjajang ramyeon
a bit differently,

1484
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:37,382
- we usually think of adding chili powder.
- Right.

1485
01:02:37,648 --> 01:02:38,748
I didn't use any special ingredients.

1486
01:02:38,782 --> 01:02:40,548
- I just used what we all have at home.
- This is fascinating.

1487
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,515
I never thought of making chili oil.

1488
01:02:42,515 --> 01:02:44,654
It's not easy to come up
with such an idea.

1489
01:02:46,482 --> 01:02:48,525
It's a bit thick, right?

1490
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:50,658
Then, you can add a bit of this.

1491
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,782
If you add this...

1492
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:54,482
- What is that?
- It's the noodle water.

1493
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:57,948
(Moisten the noodles
with some noodle water.)

1494
01:02:57,948 --> 01:03:01,154
Then,
the powder dissolves nicely and evenly.

1495
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:03,082
I really like ramyeon, you know.

1496
01:03:03,082 --> 01:03:05,575
- That's the best one.
- I must try that at home.

1497
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,448
That definitely seems delicious.

1498
01:03:10,015 --> 01:03:11,414
It's painful.

1499
01:03:12,315 --> 01:03:13,717
I desire it more than anything.

1500
01:03:14,382 --> 01:03:16,152
- Watching it is painful too.
- Seriously.

1501
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:19,015
- Please hand me a chopstick.
- A chopstick?

1502
01:03:19,015 --> 01:03:20,657
- Just one.
- Okay.

1503
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:21,791
- Should I scoop it?
- Hold on.

1504
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:22,982
(He succeeds in snagging a bite.)

1505
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:24,301
I came in at such a perfect time.

1506
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:29,264
- I came at the perfect time.
- That's when it tastes the best.

1507
01:03:29,288 --> 01:03:30,466
I'm having the first bite of it.

1508
01:03:30,648 --> 01:03:32,015
I'll have it first to see...

1509
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:34,315
- if it's poisoned or not.
- Hey!

1510
01:03:34,315 --> 01:03:35,772
No way!

1511
01:03:37,082 --> 01:03:38,475
Why are you hogging it?

1512
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:40,010
Let's have it together.

1513
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:41,311
Let's enjoy it altogether.

1514
01:03:42,182 --> 01:03:43,048
Hey!

1515
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:45,448
(Undeterred by the grumbles,
he takes a bite.)

1516
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:47,617
I seriously crave it.

1517
01:03:47,948 --> 01:03:49,919
Knowing the taste just makes me hungrier.

1518
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,215
- Gosh.
- That must be so good.

1519
01:03:53,215 --> 01:03:55,258
Can't we have this for dinner?

1520
01:03:55,548 --> 01:03:57,127
It's insanely good.

1521
01:03:58,007 --> 01:03:59,154
This is crazy.

1522
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:01,915
(Eyes wide open)

1523
01:04:01,915 --> 01:04:02,999
I envy you.

1524
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,715
- Let me have a bite.
- We want this too.

1525
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,302
This is insane.

1526
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,315
- So, he put chili oil.
- It's one of the best.

1527
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:11,015
(He can smell the spiciness.)

1528
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,510
I can't believe I got to taste this here.

1529
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:21,482
(It automatically makes him smile.)

1530
01:04:21,507 --> 01:04:23,420
That must be absolutely amazing.

1531
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:25,482
Isn't it good?

1532
01:04:25,982 --> 01:04:26,882
Have dinner, everyone.

1533
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:29,548
- Right? This is just so good.
- Come here.

1534
01:04:29,548 --> 01:04:31,015
Let me just have one more.

1535
01:04:31,015 --> 01:04:33,082
Hey, this is too good!

1536
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:34,748
(Let me please have another bite.)

1537
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:36,648
- Do you remember the taste?
- Of course!

1538
01:04:36,648 --> 01:04:39,215
- How was it?
- I can elaborate on the taste so well.

1539
01:04:39,215 --> 01:04:40,648
- We'll look forward to it.
- Please do tell.

1540
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,782
- Please look forward to it.
- Okay.

1541
01:04:41,782 --> 01:04:42,815
- So...
- That was funny.

1542
01:04:42,815 --> 01:04:44,882
- Don't say "It was tasty."
- I won't.

1543
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:47,115
- I'll explain so everyone can imagine it.
- How was it?

1544
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:51,482
Let's say we climb a mountain
like Halla or Baekdu.

1545
01:04:51,482 --> 01:04:53,382
- We spend hours climbing the mountain.
- Okay.

1546
01:04:53,382 --> 01:04:54,448
- That'll be so exhausting, right?
- Right.

1547
01:04:54,448 --> 01:04:55,518
And that moment,

1548
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:57,154
- someone gave us ramyeon.
- Yes.

1549
01:04:57,415 --> 01:04:59,015
- That's it.
- So, how did it taste?

1550
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:02,215
- We climb the mountain, so what?
- No, let me just...

1551
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:04,248
(What is he talking about?)

1552
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:06,348
We wanted you to describe
the taste in detail.

1553
01:05:06,348 --> 01:05:08,865
- Not your mood.
- Tell us if it was too spicy or not.

1554
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:12,115
We were not asking how you felt
when you ate that, but the taste.

1555
01:05:12,482 --> 01:05:15,015
We don't want to know how you feel
when you climb a mountain.

1556
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:16,139
I never climbed a mountain, though.

1557
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:17,748
Anyway...

1558
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:22,115
But I prepared this description
as I came here.

1559
01:05:22,115 --> 01:05:24,115
- Let's have Su Young describe it.
- Sure.

1560
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:25,815
How was it?

1561
01:05:25,815 --> 01:05:28,048
It's chili oil with chili peppers in it.

1562
01:05:28,048 --> 01:05:29,830
Once it goes into my mouth,
it wraps around your taste buds.

1563
01:05:30,148 --> 01:05:33,115
And it tastes better
when the oil oozes out while chewing.

1564
01:05:33,115 --> 01:05:35,548
It makes you feel
you're actually having jjajangmyeon.

1565
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,015
That's what we wanted.

1566
01:05:37,015 --> 01:05:39,348
Not "You're given ramyeon after climbing."

1567
01:05:39,348 --> 01:05:40,948
He never went climbing either.

1568
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:42,615
That was just nonsense.

1569
01:05:42,615 --> 01:05:44,868
That was such a neat description.

1570
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:48,482
- Wouldn't it be too much for them?
- It's for the crew.

1571
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:49,715
(Dinnertime for the crew)

1572
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:51,615
Just a second!

1573
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,277
Let me have another bite. Come on.

1574
01:05:55,215 --> 01:05:56,148
Please!

1575
01:05:56,148 --> 01:05:59,148
(Wrapping up one after another)

1576
01:06:00,682 --> 01:06:02,101
Please.

1577
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:03,748
Let me have one bite.

1578
01:06:03,748 --> 01:06:05,054
How much should we scoop it?

1579
01:06:05,948 --> 01:06:06,848
About this much.

1580
01:06:07,015 --> 01:06:08,915
- I think this should be enough.
- That's enough.

1581
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:10,560
You're going to give him that much?

1582
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:12,115
- It's not as much as it seems.
- That's a lot.

1583
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:13,615
Please don't take too much.

1584
01:06:13,615 --> 01:06:15,182
- We'll serve one round first.
- Show some loyalty.

1585
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:16,366
We've got to eat too.

1586
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:21,443
I wish I could have it like that.

1587
01:06:22,097 --> 01:06:24,348
(The privileged one is relaxed.)

1588
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,082
(Blazing eyes)

1589
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:30,382
It feels unfair that I can't have this.

1590
01:06:30,382 --> 01:06:31,948
You can't have this.

1591
01:06:31,948 --> 01:06:32,982
Come on.

1592
01:06:32,982 --> 01:06:34,751
He's giving out 1.5 times
the usual portion!

1593
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,787
He should control the portions carefully.

1594
01:06:38,148 --> 01:06:40,282
- Why won't you line up?
- Stand in line, please.

1595
01:06:40,282 --> 01:06:43,728
- He said I couldn't have it.
- Pretend you're one of the crew.

1596
01:06:44,415 --> 01:06:45,948
- Come in line.
- He's going to pretend it?

1597
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:50,115
(He rushed to stand in line.)

1598
01:06:53,782 --> 01:06:56,172
- It's not going to be enough.
- I think so too.

1599
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,882
- It won't be enough for all.
- It's not enough for all?

1600
01:06:58,906 --> 01:07:00,906
- No way.
- Come on.

1601
01:07:01,114 --> 01:07:02,886
- It won't be enough.
- Look at how he's tiptoeing.

1602
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:04,686
I was so desperate.

1603
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,319
(Current amount of ramyeon remaining)

1604
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:10,059
Six more people are waiting.

1605
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:10,860
Thank you.

1606
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,306
There are still six more people.
Please keep that in mind.

1607
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:15,632
Geez. It looks too good.

1608
01:07:16,094 --> 01:07:18,327
- Hold on.
- That looks amazing.

1609
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:20,470
- Six people?
- Not much is left.

1610
01:07:20,594 --> 01:07:23,049
Wait a minute. Let me just...

1611
01:07:25,194 --> 01:07:27,460
- Don't call my name.
- Is there enough?

1612
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,457
- He won't give me.
- He's pretending to be one of the crew.

1613
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,427
He's going to distribute it.

1614
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,316
We have the rookie waiting here.

1615
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,027
Hello, sir.

1616
01:07:35,027 --> 01:07:37,494
Let me give these four first.

1617
01:07:37,518 --> 01:07:39,486
(It doesn't fly with Nam No,
who is strict.)

1618
01:07:42,256 --> 01:07:43,156
The rest is yours, Joon.

1619
01:07:46,727 --> 01:07:48,261
- Can we take it now?
- Thank you.

1620
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:49,662
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1621
01:07:49,663 --> 01:07:51,631
Thank you so much.

1622
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:52,902
That's how things always go.

1623
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,038
(Taking a quick bite on the spot)

1624
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,473
That looks so tasty.

1625
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:01,307
He's enjoying it.

1626
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:04,243
(A magical taste
that you can't stop eating)

1627
01:08:05,512 --> 01:08:07,246
- You're not giving it to anyone.
- This?

1628
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:08,647
When you feed a puppy,

1629
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:11,151
it glares at you so no one takes its food.
I saw that just now.

1630
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:12,488
This is pretty good.

1631
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,654
The lighting director didn't get any.

1632
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:17,857
(His happiness ended in three mouthfuls.)

1633
01:08:17,858 --> 01:08:19,759
They took it away. Oh, no. He lost it.

1634
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:23,062
(Each of the staff members
got a hearty serving.)

1635
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:24,497
- Is it good?
- It's amazing.

1636
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:25,865
It's good.

1637
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:29,068
That looks so good.

1638
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:31,908
It's so good. It melts in my mouth.

1639
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:34,210
- His face says it all.
- It has a smoky flavor.

1640
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:40,216
It's super good.

1641
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:43,116
The chili oil gives it a kick.

1642
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:46,085
- That's what makes it spicy.
- It's so good.

1643
01:08:46,086 --> 01:08:47,754
(A jjajang ramyeon
with chili oil that gives it a kick)

1644
01:08:47,755 --> 01:08:48,988
It looks terrific.

1645
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:54,294
That would've been perfect
with green onion kimchi or just kimchi.

1646
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:56,095
You don't even need them.

1647
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:57,431
It'd be even better with it, though.

1648
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,066
- You really don't need it.
- Still, it's better with kimchi.

1649
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:01,801
- You don't need it.
- But you do.

1650
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:04,137
I'm a kimchi lover, but you don't need it.

1651
01:09:04,138 --> 01:09:05,939
Since you're a kimchi lover,
you might as well have it too.

1652
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:06,843
It's okay.

1653
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,379
- It tastes great even without it.
- But still.

1654
01:09:10,811 --> 01:09:13,546
(Among the staff members
who are enjoying the dish,)

1655
01:09:13,547 --> 01:09:15,683
(one man enjoys it especially more.)

1656
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,051
He really likes it.

1657
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:19,296
(Pedro, a local coordinator)

1658
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,220
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

1659
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:22,488
It's a little spicy,

1660
01:09:22,656 --> 01:09:24,090
- but it's good.
- A little bit. Yes, it's good.

1661
01:09:24,091 --> 01:09:25,726
- Yes, your style, right?
- Yes.

1662
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,293
(It suits the taste of the locals too.)

1663
01:09:28,328 --> 01:09:31,997
(A magical taste that captured the taste
of the Caribbean)

1664
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:33,900
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1665
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:35,034
It's amazing.

1666
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:36,735
I'm full.

1667
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:39,038
(A small happiness in the Caribbean...)

1668
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:40,439
I should help Su Young now.

1669
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:42,075
(brought on by a ramyeon lover)

1670
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:45,311
(The last journey of the CARIB BOB)

1671
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:46,612
Another one?

1672
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:49,782
(The last ingredients
that the Caribbean will pour out)

1673
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:51,985
(The best ingredients yet)

1674
01:09:52,519 --> 01:09:55,087
(With the finest ingredients
in the Caribbean)

1675
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,624
- What?
- It's huge.

1676
01:09:58,525 --> 01:10:00,359
(Cook a last feast in the CARIB BOB!)

1677
01:10:00,894 --> 01:10:03,629
(Fire up the passion for the last dish.)

1678
01:10:03,997 --> 01:10:06,866
(With the title of a genius chef,)

1679
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:09,836
(he will showcase the pinnacle of taste
in the Caribbean.)

1680
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:11,337
(Another skilled cook
who will take him on)

1681
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:13,172
(The master of homemade food appears.)

1682
01:10:13,407 --> 01:10:15,842
(A battle or pride between the two)

1683
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,645
(The last feast in the CARIB BOB)

1684
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,579
(Who will be the winner of the battle?)

1685
01:10:20,814 --> 01:10:23,449
(And...)

1686
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:27,720
(On the last day of the CARIB BOB,)

1687
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:30,756
(Joon meets the worst trial.)

1688
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:33,326
(Both his arms and legs...)

1689
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:34,627
(won't work.)

1690
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:37,764
(The last chapter of the CARIB BOB)

1691
01:10:37,764 --> 01:10:39,832
(The story of a desperate escape unfolds.)

1692
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:41,270
(JUNGLE BOB 2, Caribbean BOB)
