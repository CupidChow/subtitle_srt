1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,467
The tasty journey teetering
labor and delicacies.

2
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:04,860
Welcome to PERU BOB.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,760
Unusually, we're starting the show
in a special place.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,827
- What do you think?
- That's right.

5
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:14,033
Unfortunately, our journey ends...

6
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:16,360
- with today's episode.
- I know.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,593
We haven't done much for you,

8
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:19,979
so today, we're treating you to a meal!

9
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:22,927
What's the menu?

10
00:00:22,927 --> 00:00:24,660
Today's menu is the trending food,

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,693
- shabu-shabu.
- Shabu-shabu!

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,932
- I can have shabu-shabu every day.
- Of course.

13
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:31,527
- I can eat it all day.
- Why didn't you call me last week?

14
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,527
Thanks to that, the shooting ended
two hours earlier than usual.

15
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:34,860
- Really?
- Yes.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,327
- But it was a bit inconvenient for me.
- How come?

17
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:38,677
Without him,

18
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,534
my dullness becomes conspicuous.

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,293
You became the only dull one.

20
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,260
Yes, they have to be together.

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,510
He stood out too much.

22
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:49,680
(Last week,
Choi's Andean fine dining course...)

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,685
(was served
to the villagers in the Andean.)

24
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:58,827
(The Andean potato balls
for the appetizer)

25
00:00:58,852 --> 00:00:59,860
How in the world?

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,027
(The strict instructor
of the salt mine tasted it.)

27
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,415
It's good.

28
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,327
That looks delicious.

29
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:11,587
(Carrot soup with croutons)

30
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,793
(The second meal of the course
was also...)

31
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,193
(Amazed)

32
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:17,547
(a mega hit.)

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,293
(Now, they're waiting for the main dish.)

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,820
(Mr. Eo Nam Seon's braised alpaca ribs...)

35
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:28,117
(with Chef Choi's cream risotto)

36
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,227
(Cooking the braised ribs
with a pressure cooker)

37
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,927
Now, we wait for 30 to 40 minutes.

38
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,756
(Meanwhile,
Chef Choi focused on the risotto.)

39
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,160
- He's so passionate.
- It's like tidal waves.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,360
(After putting braised alpaca ribs
on the risotto,)

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,935
(the main dish should be completed.)

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,422
He got it done in no time.

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,360
(At that moment)

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,427
Geez. That scared me.

45
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:53,593
- What is it?
- What happened?

46
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,246
- What's wrong?
- Geez. That scared me.

47
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,493
(Suddenly, the pressure cooker exploded.)

48
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,564
Is it burnt?

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,139
(It holds Su Young's braised alpaca ribs.)

50
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,427
No, let me take care of it.

51
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,860
It could be...

52
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,892
(Actual emergency)

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,851
It didn't have a top,
so I pressed it down with that.

54
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:17,135
(The massive clouds of steam
froze Su Young in his place.)

55
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:18,766
You must've been worried sick...

56
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,869
- if the ribs were all burnt.
- Yes, you're right.

57
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,127
- You put so much effort.
- I know.

58
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,543
If the ribs are all burnt,

59
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,410
- the course is all ruined.
- Yes, it's over.

60
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,560
- That'd be the end of it.
- Since that's the main dish.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,375
- The only meat dish.
- Right.

62
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,365
And the only Korean food.

63
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:36,027
(Standing in the distance)

64
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:38,860
I can't even go closer
because that thing can explode.

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,460
(It continues to gush out steam.)

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,618
What a disaster.

67
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,327
I had to settle the steam first.

68
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:48,660
You should release the steam from it.

69
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,125
I got it.

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
We're good.

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,027
It lost all the pressure.

72
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:57,493
It wasn't the old model,
so it didn't blow off.

73
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,591
It's getting quiet.

74
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,927
- What a relief.
- That's so much better.

75
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:05,460
(However, what about the braised ribs?)

76
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,360
(He checks on the ribs right away.)

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,102
(Is it all right?)

78
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,894
The meat seems tender for now.

79
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,219
There you go.

80
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:19,393
(He tastes it with a nervous heart.)

81
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,373
It's mild and nice.

82
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,291
- It didn't burn.
- It's all right.

83
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:26,273
- It's cooked enough.
- It's saved.

84
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,539
That's good.

85
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,173
- Chef, I'm here.
- Hey.

86
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:30,973
- Here's the braised short ribs.
- You can put it there...

87
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,139
- Gosh, I really want to try that.
- Me too.

88
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,021
Put it on top.

89
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,806
We'll taste this one first.

90
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,473
This should be enough for the course.

91
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:40,531
Really?

92
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:47,214
But I'm not sure
if the creamy sauce blends well...

93
00:03:47,238 --> 00:03:48,582
with the braised short rib sauce.

94
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:49,607
I wonder how it tastes.

95
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:53,073
We'll have Daniel taste it.

96
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:54,806
Is it for the sampling?

97
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:57,113
The other guys always give him
the food first.

98
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,239
It's because he makes honest remarks.

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,306
He's more candid than others
in his opinions without censoring them.

100
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,606
(The mouth of truth with slow wits)

101
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:05,006
You two are perfect together.

102
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:06,675
It's well-cooked.

103
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,939
- We can pull out the meat later on.
- Okay.

104
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,673
I'm curious.

105
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:17,906
(He's suddenly nervous.)

106
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,539
(Enjoying it)

107
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:23,952
Is it good?

108
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,106
- Is it all right?
- The butter flavor is so good.

109
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:27,406
How is it?

110
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,473
- It's delicious.
- I'm so curious.

111
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,106
(Su Young,
who made braised alpaca ribs, also tries.)

112
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,216
It's a harmonious taste.

113
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,539
It's just braised short ribs
but with the cream...

114
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:38,773
Just take out the meat later.

115
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:39,874
It's so good.

116
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,258
They go so well together.

117
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:45,315
But if I were to have them separately,
it'd taste so weird.

118
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,706
One would taste too strong
and the other one too greasy.

119
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:50,291
But putting these together,

120
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,873
it's wonderful.

121
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:54,773
So, they complete the flavor altogether.

122
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,006
It's excellent.

123
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:57,206
I really want to try it.

124
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:58,406
It was so good.

125
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:00,444
Why did I have to be sick then?

126
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,139
- You were going through a lot.
- It was the altitude sickness.

127
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,273
I missed that delicious food
because I was sick.

128
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,417
What a shame.

129
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,439
(Meanwhile, the guests...)

130
00:05:10,306 --> 00:05:11,439
She's waiting for the next dish.

131
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,539
- She's Anh-susa.
- Anh-susa.

132
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:17,606
(They're emptying the bowls.)

133
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,406
They're scraping the bottom.

134
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,973
(Everyone is almost finished
with the soup.)

135
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:25,339
- Hit the bottom five times.
- It should keep going.

136
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,239
It's annoying when the flow is disturbed.

137
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,406
The first portion is ready.

138
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:30,706
- It's all about the time.
- I'll put it here.

139
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,739
(Choi is serious about his job.)

140
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,277
He looks cool when he's focused.

141
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,339
(On top of Hyun Seok's risotto,)

142
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,173
(Su Young's braised alpaca ribs are laid.)

143
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,039
(Staring)

144
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,613
- I'm getting emotional right now.
- It's really tasty.

145
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,201
- I'm choking up with tears.
- You're tearing up?

146
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:47,665
Yes, cooking with him...

147
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,797
The chef, with 30 years of experience,
is using my cooking...

148
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,328
to go along with his meal course.

149
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,306
And that really touches my heart.

150
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,206
- Seriously?
- Yes, I'm tearing up.

151
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,517
I see you're very sentimental.

152
00:05:58,664 --> 00:05:59,664
Yes, it's...

153
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,530
- Just keep hitting the plate.
- Yes.

154
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,285
Listen to him.

155
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,126
- I'm more of a thinker, so...
- I see.

156
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,839
(Getting ready to serve right away)

157
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:13,363
People in South America, including Peru,

158
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,382
- love cilantro.
- Is that right?

159
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,573
They'd love the combination
of cilantro and soy sauce.

160
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:18,606
I bet they'll love it.

161
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:21,339
- The main dish is prepared.
- Please come here.

162
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,039
That's incredible.

163
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,706
The main dish is being served.

164
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:27,539
(They serve the main dish in no time.)

165
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,406
(Big smile)

166
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:34,006
She just smiled.

167
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,173
This is my first time seeing her smile.

168
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,273
(She's actually very gentle.)

169
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,373
(As soon as the main dish arrives,)

170
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,339
(everyone starts to talk.)

171
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,799
(Looking closely)

172
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:54,439
(It's something
they have never seen before.)

173
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:58,441
We made the traditional Korean food,

174
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:01,039
braised short ribs, together.

175
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:02,806
Under the Korean braised short ribs...

176
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:05,753
is the Western dish, risotto.

177
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:09,606
And topped with cilantro,

178
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:12,440
completing the menu
that Peruvians would like.

179
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,306
Enjoy.

180
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:16,973
(Bowing)

181
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,273
It smells so nice.

182
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:23,473
It smells delicious.

183
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,773
This must be their very first time
trying Korean food.

184
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:28,873
- That's right.
- Yes.

185
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:32,606
(Jesusa tries the risotto first.)

186
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,639
- Anh-susa.
- As expected.

187
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:37,367
She tried it.

188
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:38,987
The strict instructor ate it.

189
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,273
(Pleased)

190
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:42,673
It's good.

191
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,975
Is this made with rice?

192
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:51,606
(Melissa also nods her head.)

193
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,906
(On the other hand,
the kids try braised alpaca ribs first.)

194
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,677
They're trying that food
for the first time.

195
00:07:58,773 --> 00:07:59,773
That should be so good.

196
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,073
(The braised alpaca ribs
they first try are sweet.)

197
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,439
(Pleased)

198
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,506
I wanted to see their reaction,

199
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,019
but I didn't want them
to feel uncomfortable.

200
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:09,406
(Yummy)

201
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:11,521
- Are you enjoying it, Eva?
- Yes.

202
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,706
I like it too.

203
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:13,973
They're so cute.

204
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,306
It's really good.

205
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,640
I want to visit Korea now...

206
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:22,339
- and try food like this.
- Oh, she wants to try Korean food.

207
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,773
I can tell the meat is tender.

208
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,535
- I know. He cut it with his front teeth.
- That was easy.

209
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:33,506
The meat is so tender.

210
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,655
Yes, the meat is really soft.

211
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,573
I worried it might be tough.

212
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:41,773
They might have never had
such tender meat.

213
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:42,939
You're right.

214
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:48,873
I'd like to learn
how to cook meat this tender.

215
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:50,677
They said they steamed it.

216
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:55,306
We should cook steamed dishes from now on.

217
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:59,683
I guess a pressure cooker
can cook meat like this.

218
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,406
Normally, they'd just grill the meat.

219
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:05,773
So, they're new to steamed dishes.

220
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:08,206
- The texture could be new to them.
- Right.

221
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,473
(Soon, they cleaned their plates.)

222
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:12,773
They really enjoyed it.

223
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:13,939
(Finally, the last dish of the course!)

224
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:15,339
- The dessert.
- It's a must.

225
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,934
How did you enjoy the meal?

226
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,406
- It was so delicious.
- It was so delicious.

227
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:21,439
Thank you.

228
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,965
We prepared the dessert.

229
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,506
- It's chocolate mocha tiramisu.
- That was exceptional.

230
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:31,806
We put sponge cake soaked
with coffee syrup at the bottom.

231
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,239
You can dig your spoon deep
and scoop everything.

232
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,273
Everyone would like that.

233
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:37,554
I agree.

234
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,506
(It puts them on a smile again.)

235
00:09:41,006 --> 00:09:43,573
(It looks delicious.)

236
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,001
It's exquisite.

237
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,830
The texture is like ice cream.

238
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,465
(Rich and moist texture,
just like ice cream)

239
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,001
That looks so good!

240
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,884
(Eating a spoonful)

241
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,208
Kids would love it.

242
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,543
- They must've loved it.
- They love sweets.

243
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,512
(An eye-widening taste)

244
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,314
How cute!

245
00:10:11,314 --> 00:10:12,548
(The kids are in love with it.)

246
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,650
- They're adorable!
- Yes, they are!

247
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:16,886
(A fierce fight for more)

248
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:18,488
They're so nice for not fighting.

249
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:20,622
(It's mine!)

250
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:22,421
You can tell they're enjoying it.

251
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:23,993
They love it.

252
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:27,697
(Feeling proud just by watching them)

253
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:29,565
Isn't it so nice...

254
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,269
looking at a big family with many kids?

255
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,303
- It feels like a community.
- Right.

256
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,835
Sharing good food...

257
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:39,041
with grandparents, parents,
and kids feels wonderful.

258
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,210
We have three generations here.

259
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,111
I know.

260
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:44,179
Despite that,

261
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,416
when I see my younger friends,

262
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,685
it feels like I need financial stability
to consider getting married.

263
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:52,354
I feel anxious about not being able
to raise a child well.

264
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:53,823
- Same here.
- I know.

265
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:58,060
That's why they're expanding
housing benefits...

266
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,862
for newlyweds and families with newborns.

267
00:10:59,863 --> 00:11:01,797
Use those benefits well,

268
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:04,299
and considering getting married
won't be so burdensome.

269
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,869
There are government benefits
for having kids, right?

270
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,203
Yes, there are. You can enjoy
double the fertility leave.

271
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,904
You can also split the days.

272
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,610
I hear the government provides...

273
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,579
so many benefits to newlyweds
and families with newborns.

274
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,082
- People don't need to worry so much.
- Indeed.

275
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:22,151
Kids, are you enjoying it?

276
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:24,887
- Yes!
- Yes!

277
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,055
Yes?

278
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:28,124
(I have something to say!)

279
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:29,926
- What?
- What is it?

280
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:38,334
(Speaking very fast in Spanish)

281
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,171
What did she say?

282
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:43,739
"The food was incredible."

283
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,144
"I wish I could share it
with my school friends."

284
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,846
Really?

285
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:52,582
What's your name?

286
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,951
- Dina.
- Nina?

287
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,061
Nina.

288
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,420
Oh, Dina?

289
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,455
Did you enjoy the food today?

290
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,293
Yes, it was incredible!

291
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:06,996
- I was blown away at how good it was.
- We, the chefs,

292
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:09,564
will visit you at school...

293
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:11,800
to cook something delicious
for your friends too.

294
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,369
(Really?)

295
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:16,439
See you tomorrow.

296
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:19,338
Did you even discuss it
with the other guys?

297
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:21,610
He always decides things alone!

298
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:24,814
- He just...
- He never asks for our opinions.

299
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:26,649
See you tomorrow.

300
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,588
(There he goes again.)

301
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:33,689
Look at his face!

302
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,391
How many friends do you have at school?

303
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,328
- About 100.
- About 100 friends?

304
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,529
There are 100 of them?

305
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,299
- A hundred?
- A hundred?

306
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,368
A hundred students?

307
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,007
What's with your face?

308
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:53,742
(Already dissociating)

309
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:55,778
(Nobody expected to cook for 100 people.)

310
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,546
That's too many.

311
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:02,651
(But Dina is already getting excited.)

312
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:06,722
He spoke too soon again!

313
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,624
He volunteered to do this.

314
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,326
Are we really cooking for them?

315
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
Yes, we have no choice.

316
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,629
Darn it.

317
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:15,597
Hyun Seok signed us up.

318
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,966
A chef must be willing to fry his hand...

319
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,233
to thank those who know
to appreciate his food.

320
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:21,937
Always keep that in mind.

321
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:23,672
(But I'm not a chef.)

322
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:24,673
It's too spicy!

323
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:29,478
(He's about to fry some tears
instead of hands soon.)

324
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,114
What kind of food would kids like?

325
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:35,251
What did you like as a kid?

326
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:39,822
You know the braised short ribs we made
with alpaca meat?

327
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,090
Everyone loved it.

328
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:44,994
Let's use local meat
to make other dishes too.

329
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,496
What we had this afternoon was great.
I had another one.

330
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:48,731
- Cuy!
- Yes, cuy!

331
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:50,333
Guinea pigs. That's cuy here.

332
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,234
It'd be nice to cook with the guinea pigs.

333
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:53,502
(We'll cook with cuy.)

334
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:56,238
It was absolutely delicious.

335
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,403
(The comfort food in the Andes, cuy)

336
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,372
(It may look strange, but...)

337
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,306
It looks so good!

338
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,209
It tastes identical to chicken.

339
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,678
- I agree.
- Yes.

340
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,147
Every part of it tasted
like chicken thighs.

341
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,181
That's right.

342
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,818
- Cuy will cook...
- In no time, right?

343
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,154
Yes, in no time, as it's not tough.

344
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,556
We can make
spicy or soy sauce braised chicken.

345
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,025
Spicy or soy sauce braised chicken.

346
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:22,662
- Soy sauce braised chicken sounds great!
- It was so good.

347
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,929
Spicy braised chicken may be too spicy.

348
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,564
But soy sauce braised chicken is fine,

349
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,799
- Right.
- as it uses soy sauce.

350
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,668
We can make it sweet and salty.

351
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,202
- How?
- Sweet and salty.

352
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,038
What do you think?

353
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,873
- That's a good plan.
- Okay.

354
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,308
- Okay.
- For kids.

355
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,111
We'll make Andong braised cuy for kids.

356
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,279
We can do that.

357
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,049
(The K-homemade food master's big project)

358
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,919
(Combining Peruvian cuy...)

359
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,488
(with Andong braised chicken
from Korea...)

360
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,926
(for collaboration beyond borders)

361
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,829
(A big operation to make the locals...)

362
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,299
(fall in love with his cooking
where Korean food is unknown)

363
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,868
(But they must cook...)

364
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,838
(for 100 children!)

365
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,675
(The first meal was for four.)

366
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:14,280
(The second meal was for 20.)

367
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,682
(And soon, they'll cook
for the biggest crowd so far,)

368
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,985
(a hundred people.)

369
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,221
(The legendary crowd size is...)

370
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,657
(causing everyone to get impatient.)

371
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:28,227
(The school lunch is served at 11 a.m.)

372
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,999
(Can they satisfy the 100 judges?)

373
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,676
We don't have anything prepared.

374
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,912
You have to buy
the ingredients first, right?

375
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:48,381
Transporting ingredients for 100 servings
is already hard.

376
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:52,451
Can we carry out yesterday's plan fine?

377
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:53,553
Don't worry.

378
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,854
You have us.

379
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,155
Yes, you're already a chef.

380
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,527
- It feels...
- Chef Choi.

381
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,093
What is he wearing?

382
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,963
What is he wearing?

383
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,365
Su Young, what are you wearing?

384
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,534
I got it there. It's a poncho.

385
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,635
Are you naked under it?

386
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,103
No!

387
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,604
Are you naked under it?

388
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,474
(It looks so questionable.)

389
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,209
I got it in Lima for 40 dollars.

390
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,677
- You wasted 40 dollars.
- I thought...

391
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,113
- you were wearing a potato sack.
- It's warm!

392
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,116
A barber should cut your hair from behind.

393
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:25,584
- Yes, he needs a barber.
- He does.

394
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,453
He can get a haircut before coming home.

395
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:33,058
I'm worried as I've never cooked
for a big crowd.

396
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,562
I know how to cook small portions
for myself...

397
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,231
but not for a big crowd.

398
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,802
Cooking for a big crowd is
completely different...

399
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,236
from regular cooking.

400
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,137
Really?

401
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,872
What is it like?

402
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,407
It's like using a forklift to eat rice...

403
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,845
after using a teaspoon your whole life.

404
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,113
That's the perfect way to put it.

405
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,314
- Seriously.
- Really?

406
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,349
You often have to cook with a shovel.

407
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,551
I mean it.

408
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,386
The utensils look more like shovels.

409
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,088
(Have you cooked with a shovel?)

410
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,357
- He's serious.
- You need a shovel to cook for 100.

411
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,359
- That's so much.
- Military cooks are...

412
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,429
better than Chef Choi
at cooking for big crowds.

413
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,130
(Making a river of soup)

414
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,032
- That's what cooking for a crowd is like.
- Yes.

415
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,435
You need more than 10kg or 10L
of everything.

416
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,238
That means it could be more food
than we expected yesterday.

417
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,875
It might be a lot more than you think.

418
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,512
I hope the kids enjoy it.

419
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,347
I hope our food suits their palates.

420
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,281
(Driving with worries)

421
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,583
It was our first visit to the town,
and it was beautiful.

422
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,451
That's beautiful.

423
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,254
- Have we arrived?
- Yes, we have.

424
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,922
(The BOB expedition
has arrived somewhere.)

425
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,727
We have to move quickly.

426
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,862
Hurry!

427
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:45,997
My gosh!

428
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,733
(They drove early in the morning...)

429
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,858
Were the trees there?

430
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,502
I remember this!

431
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:51,971
- My gosh.
- It's beautiful.

432
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,505
(Where you feel the Incan spirit)

433
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,141
It's like a painting.

434
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,544
The town is called Urubamba.

435
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,346
- Urubamba!
- The view is exquisite.

436
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,647
What a beautiful place!

437
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,651
That was the biggest town
near where we were.

438
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,952
It was beautiful.

439
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,220
(Along the busy and exotic roads)

440
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,722
They sell fritters.

441
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,757
Are they like doughnuts?

442
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,459
I guess so.

443
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,563
- They smell like vegetable fritters.
- Or croquettes.

444
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,397
They have everything here!

445
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,834
- Even radios.
- This place...

446
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,635
It's like the markets near Cheonggyecheon.

447
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,636
What's that?

448
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,605
(The BOB friends are here...)

449
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
What's this?

450
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,612
That's huge!

451
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,580
What a nice market!

452
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,651
(The Andean kitchen, Mercado de Urubamba)

453
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,219
My goodness!

454
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:41,854
There's so much.

455
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,623
This is a proper market.

456
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,657
It's impressive!

457
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,130
(Along with Andong braised cuy,
the main dish...)

458
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,663
Kids don't eat anything weird.

459
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,033
We have to tailor our food for the kids.

460
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,236
Let's keep it simple, as it's for kids.

461
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,261
(we're shopping for 100 kids.)

462
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,172
We don't have much time,
so let's split up to be efficient.

463
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,543
Let's go in groups of two...

464
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,311
- to shop for the ingredients.
- Okay.

465
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,312
- Okay?
- Yes, Chef!

466
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,080
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

467
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,148
- Don't mess up.
- Of course not.

468
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,152
You had to move fast
as lunch was at 11 a.m. sharp.

469
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,286
(Shopping for 100 servings of food)

470
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,224
Let's get some vegetables
for the Andong braised cuy.

471
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,825
We need potatoes.

472
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,429
Since we're cooking for kids...

473
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,596
(Well-cooked potatoes are a must.)

474
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,165
Potatoes.

475
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,068
We need to buy potatoes.

476
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,569
We need a lot of them.

477
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,937
(On an expedition for potatoes...)

478
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,306
(in endless rows of delicacies)

479
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,440
What a fun market.

480
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,408
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

481
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,411
I see them there!

482
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,916
- Potatoes!
- There are so many kinds!

483
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,786
They're all different types.

484
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,488
They're not the same kind?

485
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,557
Each sack holds a different type.

486
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,593
There are different potatoes
by different sellers.

487
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,426
They're not all selling the same kind.

488
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:59,631
Each offers something different
because there are so many varieties.

489
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,422
(The market has
all kinds of local potatoes.)

490
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,265
(But which ones should we buy?)

491
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:11,399
They're all different
in shape, color, and size.

492
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:12,901
(What kind of potatoes
are you looking for?)

493
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,722
(Sorry? Just regular potatoes, I guess.)

494
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:19,037
(There's no such thing
as regular potatoes in Peru!)

495
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:20,418
(There are 4,500 different kinds.)

496
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,877
I see.

497
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,112
So, no such thing as common potatoes.

498
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:26,745
(They may look similar,
but they all taste different.)

499
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:29,374
(What are you planning to make?)

500
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:32,177
(If you're boiling them,)

501
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:36,936
(go for yungay. It's soft and creamy.)

502
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,071
(Do you want to fry them?)

503
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,126
(Then you need papa criolla.
Crispy outside, soft inside.)

504
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,197
That looks scrumptious.

505
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,313
It looks so tasty.

506
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:47,135
(Are you going to stir-fry them?)

507
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:49,171
You need different potatoes
for different dishes.

508
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,764
(You need papa huayaro
with a deep, nutty flavor.)

509
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:55,681
It might take a while
to find the right one.

510
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,491
Is that also potato? Look at the color.

511
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,743
I heard some potatoes have
a buttery flavor.

512
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,287
(Potatoes that taste buttery?)

513
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:08,557
Do you have yellow potatoes?

514
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,221
Is there a reason
you're looking for yellow potatoes?

515
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,590
Since cuy doesn't have much fat,

516
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,659
I thought adding...

517
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,882
- So you're going for buttery ones?
- Yes.

518
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:22,631
a rich buttery flavor
would enhance the dish.

519
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,177
Yellow potatoes.

520
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,560
Papa amaria?

521
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,708
We have them here.

522
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,350
(Heart pounding)

523
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,341
(Are these the buttery potatoes...)

524
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,741
(they've been looking for?)

525
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,169
Yes, there they are.

526
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:49,394
(Yes, I'm here.)

527
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:52,694
Papa amaria tastes really good.

528
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:53,692
Is it really buttery?

529
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,101
I'm really curious about how it tastes.

530
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,008
- It's incredibly good.
- Me too.

531
00:21:56,008 --> 00:21:57,399
Okay. We'll get some of these.

532
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,267
It's absolutely good.

533
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,607
- Did she say 8?
- It's 3.2 dollars for 2kg.

534
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:03,929
- That's crazy!
- It's about 3.2 dollars?

535
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:05,106
That's so cheap.

536
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,248
- It's so inexpensive!
- Thank you.

537
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:10,512
We need carrots and a lot of green onions.

538
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,114
Su Young, isn't it green onion?

539
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,974
Yes, that's green onion.

540
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:16,151
- That's it.
- Green onion.

541
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:19,354
Gosh. Green onion is huge here.

542
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:20,817
Green onion!

543
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,258
- It's so big.
- That's incredible!

544
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,476
It's as thick as my wrist.

545
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,678
See? It was big and thick.

546
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,833
Look at the thickness.

547
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,798
That's technically a lumber!

548
00:22:30,907 --> 00:22:31,834
Isn't that aloe?

549
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,977
This is leek,
not the green onion we use in Korea.

550
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:36,171
It looks similar,
but it's actually pretty different.

551
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:37,156
So it's not green onion?

552
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,573
- It tastes a bit different.
- Different?

553
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:39,625
It's a bit different.

554
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,649
We need three bunches.

555
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,383
Scallions.

556
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,910
(They decided to buy milder scallions
instead of leek today.)

557
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:47,048
- Can you hand me a 50-sol bill?
- Okay.

558
00:22:49,074 --> 00:22:49,924
I have 40.

559
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,389
Why do you keep it there?

560
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,882
- What's that about?
- You kept it in socks?

561
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,276
It's to make sure I don't lose it.

562
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,320
(The stall owner let her guard down.)

563
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:05,864
- Look at her face!
- It's so I don't lose it.

564
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,570
She seems really grossed out.

565
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:11,439
It's pricey.

566
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,308
I messed up the number.

567
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,521
(He hands over the bills,
now warm from his sock.)

568
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:21,280
(Daniel stashes the change in his socks.)

569
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,254
To avoid losing it.

570
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,753
- Since I was wearing joggers...
- What's the matter with you?

571
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,721
I was wearing joggers, so...

572
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,523
(What did the money ever do to you?)

573
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:31,860
We have onion and a big piece of ginger.

574
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,295
Oh, they have peeled garlic!

575
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,863
Let's buy some peeled garlic!

576
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:37,766
We need it to make cooking quicker.

577
00:23:38,443 --> 00:23:39,972
It's garlic, right?

578
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:41,206
Garlic.

579
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:43,274
- Is it really garlic?
- Garlic looks strange here!

580
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,031
- Are you sure it's garlic?
- The garlic is round.

581
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,574
Is it the same garlic we know?

582
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:47,989
What's that?

583
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:53,098
- They're plump.
- Isn't it an onion?

584
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,079
- It looks like an onion.
- It's like an onion.

585
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,735
This clove looks like a head of garlic
that hasn't been separated.

586
00:23:56,985 --> 00:23:57,835
The size is small.

587
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:02,424
She says it's a kind of garlic,
and it tastes sweet.

588
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,430
(It just looks like macadamia to Daniel.)

589
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,995
- I see. Macadamia nuts.
- Right?

590
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:08,730
It does look like macadamia.

591
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:10,485
No way.

592
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:11,876
Did you taste it?

593
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,599
To see if it's really garlic.

594
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:15,429
I bet he thought it was macadamia.

595
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,306
Does he really need
to taste it to be sure?

596
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,610
She seems worried.

597
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:25,965
Is it spicy?

598
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:27,199
It's garlic, then.

599
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,918
Eating garlic
on an empty stomach isn't healthy.

600
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:31,987
It's not good.

601
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:34,019
(Laughing)

602
00:24:34,219 --> 00:24:35,069
It is garlic.

603
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,325
- It's garlic.
- Of course, it is.

604
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,948
Was eating it the only way
to figure it out?

605
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:40,795
He's right. It's rough on your stomach.

606
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:42,330
It is really spicy.

607
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,099
They have so many things
over here! What's this?

608
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,935
(What is it?)

609
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,318
(Flavorful and subtly sweet
sacha tomatoes)

610
00:24:51,343 --> 00:24:52,374
Four-dimensional tomato?

611
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,209
- "Four-dimensional tomato."
- Sacha tomato.

612
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,255
It means it's an "Interstellar" tomato.

613
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,362
- Is it similar to normal tomatoes?
- No.

614
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:01,797
- Is it spicy?
- No.

615
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:03,302
- It's sweet.
- Is it sweet?

616
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,152
Let's try it.

617
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:05,190
It looks like persimmon.

618
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,521
It's just like persimmon!

619
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,590
How pretty!

620
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,326
- It looks like persimmon, indeed.
- It does! Amazing.

621
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:14,429
I love all those colorful vegetables!

622
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:15,964
Is it delicious?

623
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:22,683
Is it good?

624
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,023
If regular tomatoes are down here,
this one is way up there!

625
00:25:25,138 --> 00:25:25,886
Seriously?

626
00:25:26,547 --> 00:25:28,527
(They're so tasty,
even his eyes are sparkling!)

627
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:30,512
- It's so good!
- Is it?

628
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:32,097
It has a bit of a touch of oranges.

629
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,815
It also has melon flavor, no.

630
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,358
It has a kiwi flavor too.

631
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,218
It's like a mix of kiwi,
tomato, pineapple,

632
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,821
- and passion fruit all in one.
- What's wrong with his face?

633
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:40,755
It's incredible!

634
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,256
(Everyone needs to taste this!)

635
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,311
- It's really yucky, Su Young.
- What?

636
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,648
- It's even spicy.
- Let's search for it on the Internet.

637
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:51,433
- It's too spicy.
- No, it's not!

638
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:54,235
It's like passion fruits
and chili combined.

639
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,438
Why are we reacting so differently
to the same thing?

640
00:25:56,438 --> 00:25:57,705
- It was too spicy and awful.
- Let's search the web.

641
00:25:57,705 --> 00:25:58,973
I don't like it at all.

642
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,109
- Really? I love it.
- I have the taste buds of a kid.

643
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:02,683
Putting the taste aside,

644
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:05,513
I couldn't understand why Su Young made...

645
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:06,851
such a fuss about it.

646
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,060
He made me even more confused.

647
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,096
He practically worshipped it.

648
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,842
- He kept saying, "Oh, my goodness."
- He kept saying it.

649
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:13,205
Let me ask you this one thing.

650
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:14,956
Will you go back to Peru for it?

651
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:16,307
No.

652
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,864
You were right, after all.

653
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:20,583
Told you! If it wasn't that good,

654
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:22,864
why did you conduct an orchestra over it?

655
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:24,232
Sorry. My bad.

656
00:26:24,257 --> 00:26:25,617
It wasn't that good.

657
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:27,552
Glass noodles.

658
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:29,681
Glass noodles?

659
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:31,806
Glass noodles are a must
for braised chicken.

660
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,141
- Right.
- We had to search for it.

661
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:34,645
Glass noodles?

662
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:36,161
Do you have glass noodles?

663
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,272
- No.
- No?

664
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,201
Do you not have thin noodles too?

665
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,501
We only have pasta.

666
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:45,253
- You only have pasta?
- They're just plain pasta.

667
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:47,739
(They only have pasta
instead of glass noodles.)

668
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:49,958
They don't have thin noodles.

669
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,363
(But we need thin noodles.)

670
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,361
It's linguine.

671
00:26:54,644 --> 00:26:56,848
Su Young, how about we skip the noodles?

672
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,634
Isn't that pasta too?
We could use macaroni instead.

673
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:01,768
We can cook it...

674
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,599
the way we usually make our food, right?

675
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,542
We're aiming for something
kids will enjoy.

676
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,457
People here use spoons
instead of chopsticks at the table.

677
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,449
We'll make japchae with macaroni?

678
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:16,985
Japchae with macaroni?

679
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:20,688
It might be easier
for Peruvians to eat with macaroni.

680
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,238
I think it's better
to blend the two cultures.

681
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,860
Macaroni japchae sounds refreshing.

682
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,496
- You're a genius.
- As long as it has that japchae flavor.

683
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:29,982
No arms for a hug now.

684
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,267
It's his first compliment in Peru.

685
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:35,303
(That's my idea.)

686
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,973
(Korean flavors...)

687
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,075
(meet macaroni.)

688
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,044
(The second main menu)

689
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,259
(Spoonable Japchae)

690
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:48,755
- It'd be a hit in Korea too!
- He's so right!

691
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,219
You should totally patent
macaroni japchae!

692
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,787
But I can't make it myself.

693
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,374
All he can do is to eat.

694
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,032
What time is it?

695
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,461
- What time is it?
- We don't have much time.

696
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:02,030
- Did you get everything?
- Yes, we did.

697
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's hurry up.

698
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:04,062
(They set off for the school.)

699
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,678
(They drove up into the clouds.)

700
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:08,369
Look at those clouds!

701
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,405
- It was dreamy.
- It's like a scene from a cartoon.

702
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:14,709
- What's that?
- Is that the school?

703
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,044
(A building comes into view.)

704
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:17,412
It didn't take that long.

705
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,937
(An elementary school
in a place like this?)

706
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,014
Are we here?

707
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,585
The school is in the clouds.

708
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,165
(The clouds feel within reach.)

709
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,154
It's so mythical.

710
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,112
It must be one of the highest-altitude
schools in the world.

711
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:30,580
Right.

712
00:28:30,604 --> 00:28:32,710
It's located 4,000m above sea level.

713
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,029
- The cloud surrounds it.
- Right.

714
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:37,732
The clouds are next to us, not above.

715
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,069
Looking out the window,
they'll see clouds floating by.

716
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,904
You're right.

717
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,339
It's so pretty.

718
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:46,191
Look over there.

719
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,846
- It's insane.
- It'd be hard to focus on studying here.

720
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,958
Look at the road.
I need to take pictures of it.

721
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:54,933
It's insanely good.

722
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:57,418
It looks like they're in a fairy tale.

723
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,347
It's incredibly beautiful.

724
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,789
- Where else can I see...
- It's magnificent.

725
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,409
- It's stunning.
- Where else can you see a view like this?

726
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,760
Look at this road.

727
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:07,528
- This is the school!
- Right.

728
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:09,764
- That was school all along!
- That was.

729
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:13,009
I didn't know it was a school.

730
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,535
What a panorama.

731
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:20,981
Hi.

732
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,144
So, are we making lunch...

733
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:24,682
- Hello there.
- for them today?

734
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:28,106
Are you playing hooky today?

735
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,236
- Are you skipping school today?
- How appropriate.

736
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,413
I think they got here early
before school started.

737
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:36,770
When I was in school,

738
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:39,177
I remember seeing jobless guys
hanging around outside.

739
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:40,986
On their way to the Internet café,

740
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,131
they'd say things like,
'"Playing hooky today?"

741
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:45,233
"Your mom is going to scold you
if she finds out!"

742
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:48,993
"If you don't study,
you'll end up like me!"

743
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,106
The school is so pretty!

744
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:55,127
There's no sign showing the school's name.

745
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:56,656
- Maybe we missed it.
- I bet it has one.

746
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,730
I bet the school has a name.

747
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,364
(Anccoto, the elementary school
located at the highest place in the world)

748
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:02,730
"Anccoto."

749
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,803
How cute!

750
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,470
The school is called Anccoto.

751
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,003
Do you remember "Carrusel," the TV series?

752
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:11,470
- Oh, right.
- That's how it felt.

753
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,370
You're an oldie, aren't you?

754
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,203
There are no high buildings
with just an open space.

755
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:17,470
(With the sky as the roof
and Andes plains as the yard)

756
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,037
That's lovely.

757
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:25,003
It's like a school
that you'd see in a fairy tale.

758
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:27,370
(The schoolchildren in Andes frolic
in Mother Nature.)

759
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,770
Look at those adorable eyes.

760
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:35,937
(They're grown
on organic home foods from the Andes.)

761
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:36,937
Should we go there?

762
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,303
(It's a cafeteria...)

763
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:43,137
Over there.

764
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,603
(for the students of Anccoto.)

765
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:46,603
"Comer" means to eat.

766
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,437
Eating? Oh, it's a cafeteria.

767
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:50,870
(The cafeteria of Anccoto)

768
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,970
This is the kitchen.

769
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,470
- It's the cafeteria.
- The cafeteria.

770
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,337
They have many kitchen tools
as it's a school.

771
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:58,903
- It's clean.
- They have decent stoves.

772
00:30:58,903 --> 00:31:00,970
- They have tableware too.
- Because they serve school lunches.

773
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:02,537
We don't have much time.

774
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:05,570
- How much time do we have?
- We have very little time.

775
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,437
I'd say we have about three hours left.

776
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:09,870
Should we get started now?

777
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,337
How will they cook for 100 people?

778
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:15,637
(The biggest number in PERU BOB,
100 people.)

779
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:16,970
(The BOB expedition has prepared...)

780
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,237
It's like a survival show.

781
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:19,337
(five different menus.)

782
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,137
(Andong braised chicken made with cuy)

783
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,903
That looks good.

784
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:25,470
(Japchae...)

785
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,270
(with macaroni)

786
00:31:29,303 --> 00:31:31,670
(And three hidden menus)

787
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,103
Right. Only two of the menus
have been revealed.

788
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:37,503
(Lunchtime, 11 o'clock)

789
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:39,037
(Current time, 07:55 a.m.)

790
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:40,737
We'll be able to make it on time, right?

791
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,303
We're really short of time.

792
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:45,437
On another show,

793
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,737
- I've prepared a large meal before.
- Oh, right.

794
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:50,603
The hardest customers are the kids.

795
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,037
It's so hard to meet their taste.

796
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:53,970
Yes.

797
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,570
They don't say,
"It's not good, salty, or sweet."

798
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,570
- They just don't eat it.
- They won't eat it.

799
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,370
That's the hard part.

800
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,603
Kids are really honest.

801
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:04,537
Let's prep the ingredients first.

802
00:32:04,537 --> 00:32:07,170
- You can peel the onions, Daniel.
- I'm on it.

803
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,303
- We need the onions most.
- Right.

804
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,337
- I'll do all of it.
- That's the hardest job.

805
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:13,170
I did some hard stuff there.

806
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,003
(They start by prepping the ingredients.)

807
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,803
Chef Choi is the executive chef.

808
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,603
- There's our chef.
- He's a legend.

809
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:22,603
A master of school lunches.

810
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:26,637
(In charge of the main menu)

811
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:29,470
(Chef Ryu)

812
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,537
(Chef Ryu,
Andong cuy and macaroni japchae)

813
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:33,437
Are you cooking both dishes?

814
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:36,003
(Chopping)

815
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,037
- Goodness.
- So cool.

816
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:42,970
- Onions are no problem.
- How can he cut it like that?

817
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,270
- That's so cool.
- My goodness.

818
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,937
Are you cutting it diagonally on purpose?

819
00:32:47,937 --> 00:32:50,603
I'm cutting it diagonally
as the onions are too small.

820
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,203
- Daniel.
- Yes?

821
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:55,703
We're busy, so let's hurry up.

822
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:59,203
You can't talk
when preparing for a large group.

823
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:00,370
We need to hurry up.

824
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,637
What do you want sliced?

825
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:02,537
Anything that needs cutting?

826
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:04,470
Please julienne the carrots.
It's for japchae.

827
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,403
Got it.

828
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:07,870
Do you want it sliced thinly?

829
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,737
Not too thinly,
because I'm going to stir-fry it.

830
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:16,370
- We...
- They're chopping on both sides.

831
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,437
We had such reliable chefs in Peru.

832
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:21,270
That's incredible.

833
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:24,837
(Glancing)

834
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,670
The way you're cutting it.

835
00:33:28,003 --> 00:33:30,270
Don't say anything.

836
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,703
He sure is a chef.

837
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,070
Peel it already.

838
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,370
Peel it already.

839
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,537
(Both are scolding Daniel.)

840
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:42,903
You don't have time
for conversations there.

841
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:44,803
We're cooking for 100 people, after all.

842
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:48,703
(They're using knives all around.)

843
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:51,103
(Swiftly)

844
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:52,937
She's sharpening it on a cup?

845
00:33:53,403 --> 00:33:55,337
I've never seen that before.

846
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,403
A master in sharpening knives.

847
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:01,070
You seem to be a decent cook.

848
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:03,837
(Now that I'm done, let me slice it.)

849
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,037
There she goes.

850
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:08,670
Let's watch it.

851
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:11,803
That's nice.

852
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,470
That one is thick
as it's for the braised cuy.

853
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,603
(Sniffling)

854
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:25,770
- She's crying.
- I was in tears.

855
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,670
(Biting on it)

856
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:30,203
What's she doing?

857
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,970
Is it less spicy if you do that?

858
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,303
(Does it sting less
if you bite on an onion?)

859
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,703
It has begun.

860
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:41,237
That's what I heard,
but there wasn't much of a difference.

861
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:42,070
It stings more, right?

862
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,503
Oh, dear.

863
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:46,903
(Sniffling and sighing)

864
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:47,837
So spicy.

865
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,170
Right. It was so spicy.

866
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,937
- My eyes sting.
- Seriously.

867
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:00,937
My eyes are burning.

868
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:04,503
Their onions and garlic are both so spicy.

869
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,003
Can you tell us the time?

870
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:07,970
It's 8:53 a.m.

871
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,903
- We have two hours left.
- Two hours?

872
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:11,603
That's enough time.

873
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:16,303
(The students are taking
their morning classes.)

874
00:35:17,537 --> 00:35:19,303
The hard part is prepping the ingredients.

875
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,770
Every ingredient needs to be cut out.

876
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:24,303
We have a long way to go.

877
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,170
There's no end to it, right?

878
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,370
I'm done with the bell pepper.

879
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,903
(She's done prepping
the bell pepper and onions.)

880
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,837
There.

881
00:35:36,103 --> 00:35:36,970
What is it?

882
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,503
(Cuy, the main ingredient
of Andong braised cuy)

883
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:41,937
- Cuy.
- Oh, it's cuy.

884
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:43,937
Do they sell cuy all prepped like that?

885
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:45,770
Yes, since it's a food ingredient there.

886
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,270
We ordered 30 of them.

887
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:50,437
I guess Andong braised cuy
will be delicious.

888
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:53,737
(He starts cooking the cuy.)

889
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:54,737
Look at the flame.

890
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,137
(Adding a heap of onion on the pan)

891
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,603
- Thankfully, the fire is strong.
- Right.

892
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:08,303
It'll get all smokey.

893
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,837
He looks so cool.

894
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,803
(In an instant,)

895
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,837
(the onion is cleared.)

896
00:36:18,837 --> 00:36:21,070
He just blanched it slightly.

897
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,237
That's awesome.

898
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:24,503
(Up next are the chives.)

899
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:27,503
(Adding a smokey flavor...)

900
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:30,103
(and stir-frying it slightly)

901
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,403
That's amazing.

902
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:34,537
(Veggies for the Andong braised cuy)

903
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:38,470
After stir-frying the veggies,

904
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,103
he adds soy sauce.

905
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:44,303
What is that? Apple juice.

906
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,737
There it is.

907
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,603
If you put fruits in it,

908
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:50,403
it becomes more flavorful.

909
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,737
He's doing it so swiftly,
even without measuring it.

910
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,703
(The master of sauce
doesn't need measuring.)

911
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:58,237
He's a master at making sauces.

912
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,037
I should trust my tongue.

913
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:02,070
(He can only depend on his tongue now.)

914
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:05,503
(Here comes the cuy.)

915
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,670
(In the sauce
for the Andong braised chicken,)

916
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,837
(he puts the cuy.)

917
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,437
- Andong.
- Braised cuy.

918
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:14,370
I know, right?

919
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:18,370
(Adding garlic that will remove the odor)

920
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,603
(Now, he just needs to boil it down.)

921
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:21,670
That's awesome.

922
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:23,570
(Ok Vin...)

923
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,870
(gets started with her menu too.)

924
00:37:26,637 --> 00:37:27,770
What is it?

925
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,903
(Is the main ingredient...)

926
00:37:28,903 --> 00:37:30,003
(sausages?)

927
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:32,103
- For the kids.
- Kids will love it.

928
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:33,370
Kids love that.

929
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,603
I wonder what she's making.

930
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,603
The recipe for sausage veggie stir-fry.

931
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:38,937
- Sausage veggie stir-fry!
- With sausage.

932
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,803
- I used to love it.
- Of course.

933
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:43,303
- It's a favorite for kids.
- For sure.

934
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,403
- Everyone likes that.
- Sausage veggie stir-fry.

935
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:47,637
It's the only way
to make kids eat the veggies.

936
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:50,470
- Because of the sausage.
- Even soldiers will come for it.

937
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,303
- For sure.
- "It's sausage veggie stir-fry today?"

938
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,870
- They'll come even after their discharge.
- Right.

939
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,103
Will the sausage be enough?

940
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,737
(Looking closely)

941
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:05,903
What is it?

942
00:38:05,903 --> 00:38:07,503
She's just checking it.

943
00:38:07,503 --> 00:38:09,537
I think the casing needs to be removed
from the sausage.

944
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:12,270
- It's the old kind.
- Oh, right.

945
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,437
It's the kind
where the casing needs to be removed.

946
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,170
How should I cut it?

947
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,203
You need to remove it first, then.

948
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,670
For each piece?

949
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,803
That'll be tough.

950
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:21,870
I just freaked out.

951
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,537
- These sausages.
- Yes.

952
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:26,970
Or you can slice it down the middle.

953
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,270
- Down the middle?
- If it's sliced in half,

954
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,337
then the sauce will seep in.

955
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:32,103
- Right.
- So slice it in half.

956
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:32,970
Okay.

957
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,003
On the long side.

958
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,803
I got a mental breakdown right there.

959
00:38:35,803 --> 00:38:37,870
My gosh. How will I remove all of it?

960
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,070
- The plastic is...
- It's for 100 people too.

961
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,703
not easy to remove,

962
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:44,837
- Right.
- and it's stuck too.

963
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:47,537
How could the plastic...

964
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:50,070
- Had they known it,
- It won't be easy.

965
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,903
- they would've bought another one.
- That's right.

966
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,537
The casing is plastic.

967
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:54,570
Yes, I can see that.

968
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,970
We didn't know when we bought it.

969
00:38:55,995 --> 00:38:58,528
(Struggling)

970
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,670
I can't take a break.

971
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,803
I should remove all the plastic.

972
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:09,478
(Endlessly removing the plastic
through gritted teeth)

973
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,370
I'm all done.

974
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:13,503
Ok Vin is fast with her hands.

975
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,203
We just need to cut the sausage now.

976
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:18,203
(Now, she has to cut them.)

977
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:21,637
Hyun Seok, should I cut it into thirds
of fourths for the kids?

978
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:22,837
- Make it this big.
- This big?

979
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:24,037
- Into thirds?
- Into fourths.

980
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:25,137
Into fourths.

981
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:26,537
It's the size of a Vienna sausage.

982
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:28,803
A Vienna sausage will be
around a fourth of it.

983
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:29,670
Got it.

984
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,770
You worked so hard, Ok Vin.

985
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:37,170
But it's getting done
since she's fast with her hands.

986
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,570
- She's fast.
- I can tell.

987
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,770
I'm done. I'll make the sauce now.

988
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,737
My gosh.

989
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:48,103
- Kids will love ketchup.
- They'll go crazy over it.

990
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,603
- The Worcester sauce.
- The Worcester sauce.

991
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:52,138
(Ketchup, sugar, Worcester sauce)

992
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,256
Yes.

993
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,695
I'll pour it so you stir it.

994
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:58,762
Okay.

995
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,133
(Stir-frying the sausages first)

996
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,013
Where's Daniel?

997
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,374
He's over there.

998
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:10,911
Do you see me in the top-right corner?

999
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,779
- He's doing the dishes.
- I'm...

1000
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,348
like "Where's Waldo?"

1001
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:16,383
That's me.

1002
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,084
You're showing up even less than the pot.

1003
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:20,086
(You have less airtime than the pot.)

1004
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:20,954
The pot?

1005
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,190
(But I worked hard too.)

1006
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,624
- I'll pour them.
- Okay.

1007
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,859
Here. Keep stirring.

1008
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,395
(Adding the vegetables
after cooking the sausages)

1009
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,131
(For a crispy texture,)

1010
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,265
(they stir-fry them last.)

1011
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,266
- All right.
- Add the sauce after stir-frying.

1012
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
- So that the veggies...
- Gosh!

1013
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,735
can stay crispy.

1014
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,770
- It's tough, right?
- It's so heavy.

1015
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,673
I need a shovel for this.

1016
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:44,774
- It's tough, isn't it?
- It is.

1017
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,814
He's got sexy forearms.

1018
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:52,882
He's alive and kicking for his age.

1019
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,186
You sent him away in one blow.

1020
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,454
- That was a tough blow.
- Sorry.

1021
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,523
- After I said, "Sexy forearms..."
- "For his age."

1022
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,092
You made him look bad with one sentence.

1023
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,530
I could only do 15 minutes of that
on my normal days,

1024
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,299
and I had to do a hundredfold of it.

1025
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,268
- It must have been tough.
- There were so many ingredients.

1026
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,739
She's also showing us her forearms.

1027
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,075
Goodness.

1028
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,475
- I didn't know there were so many.
- Your arms hurt, right?

1029
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,444
Yes.

1030
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,546
It's pretty heavy.

1031
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:23,613
It's a lot.

1032
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,782
Try it.

1033
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,918
It's sausage veggie stir-fry
from the old days.

1034
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,355
Yes, I think it tastes fine
because the sausages are salty.

1035
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:32,455
That must have tasted good.

1036
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,790
- Turn the heat off,
- Okay.

1037
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,759
and sprinkle some sesame seeds.

1038
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,093
That looks scrumptious.

1039
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:38,896
One hour remaining.

1040
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,829
- One hour.
- How long?

1041
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,965
How come time goes by so fast?

1042
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,401
We have an hour left,

1043
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,936
but we don't have rice, meat,

1044
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,970
or any side dishes... Wait.

1045
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,305
- We have sausage veggie stir-fry.
- It's done.

1046
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,205
We're doomed.

1047
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,740
All right, guys.

1048
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,075
We have nothing prepared.

1049
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,745
This is ready to be boiled, right?

1050
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,213
- Which one?
- The cuy just need to be cooked, right?

1051
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,213
- Yes, we just have to boil it down.
- Okay.

1052
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,483
- Okay.
- Can you cook some pasta?

1053
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,718
- Pasta?
- Yes.

1054
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,453
Okay.

1055
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,589
(They haven't even gotten started
with the macaroni japchae.)

1056
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,225
(100 servings of macaroni)

1057
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,662
Get some water here.

1058
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,730
(An extra-large pot for boiling them)

1059
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,368
When will the water start to boil?

1060
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,070
(He quickly boils water first.)

1061
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,004
Where's the pasta?

1062
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,812
(The pasta expert pours
bags of macaroni in.)

1063
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,780
Where's the salt?

1064
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,948
Over here.

1065
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,917
- Done.
- Good?

1066
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,052
That's so cool.

1067
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,386
He's a pasta expert, after all.

1068
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,757
(While the macaroni cooks,)

1069
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,225
(he stir-fries the ingredients
for japchae.)

1070
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,493
Oh, the japchae ingredients.

1071
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,098
We need to stir-fry them separately.

1072
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,467
- Separately?
- You need to cook them separately...

1073
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,569
to enhance the flavor
when they're put together.

1074
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,806
If you stir-fry them together,
they cook at different speeds,

1075
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,272
so the whole thing turns mushy.

1076
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,341
You need to cook them separately
depending on how fast they cook.

1077
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,178
- What kind of meat is that?
- Pork.

1078
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,613
It's pork.

1079
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,249
(In the meantime)

1080
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,518
- He still manages to get it done.
- I know, right?

1081
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,387
(The macaroni is all cooked.)

1082
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,687
The macaroni is cooked well.

1083
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,657
Now, we only need to season them, right?

1084
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,593
Yes, I'll season them with the sauce.

1085
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,296
(Adding the macaroni...)

1086
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,498
(to the soy-sauce-based sauce)

1087
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,467
All right.

1088
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,536
Japchae is finished.

1089
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,838
(Add the stir-fried veggies.)

1090
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,040
I wish I could scoop some and try it.

1091
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,307
I know, right? Me too.

1092
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,576
Macaroni japchae would work,
even in Korea.

1093
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,711
- Right?
- How easy is it to scoop japchae?

1094
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:36,947
Exactly.

1095
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,684
Wait. How should I cut it?

1096
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,320
- Focus. Here's my part.
- How am I supposed to cut it?

1097
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,387
- This is...
- Focus.

1098
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:45,789
The onions are flat.

1099
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,357
I only know...

1100
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,560
Are you going to slice them or dice them?

1101
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,128
- Dice them.
- Slices?

1102
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,596
- Dices.
- Dices?

1103
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,466
(He begins by dicing the onions.)

1104
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,466
You know,

1105
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,234
- like cubes.
- Cubes.

1106
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,636
And I'll sprinkle them on top.

1107
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,305
It's what I usually make...

1108
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,540
when I have guests over at my house.

1109
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,475
It's his signature dish!

1110
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,143
- So, you know how to make it.
- You bet.

1111
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,511
It's so simple.

1112
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,780
- He's cooking something on his own...
- I just have to get on with it.

1113
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,248
for the first time.

1114
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,183
(What's Daniel's dish for the school?)

1115
00:44:15,553 --> 00:44:17,888
I put cheese on top and some onions.

1116
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:18,888
On a tortilla!

1117
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,757
It's kind of like a quesadilla.

1118
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,993
(The sweet honey is his kick.)

1119
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:24,397
(Daniel's Dish: Sweet quesadilla)

1120
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,928
It's like a quesadilla.

1121
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,765
I bet kids will love that!

1122
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,067
You all know I have the palate
of an elementary school kid.

1123
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,569
- I know exactly what kids like.
- You might have the upper hand.

1124
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:34,705
- That's right.
- Because they're in elementary school.

1125
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,107
All kids from all over the world
will love that.

1126
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,976
That's what I made.
It's right up their alley.

1127
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,744
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

1128
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,014
(Chopping the onions)

1129
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,582
You see,

1130
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,453
what I'm making has a little backstory.

1131
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,830
- I...
- That sounds unnecessary.

1132
00:44:51,831 --> 00:44:53,031
That was random.

1133
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:55,001
It was when...

1134
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:58,303
(What backstory does his quesadilla have?)

1135
00:44:59,272 --> 00:45:00,305
It's just a tortilla.

1136
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:03,909
(Everyone's busy cooking their food,
and he starts a personal show.)

1137
00:45:04,177 --> 00:45:06,512
It was when...

1138
00:45:06,513 --> 00:45:09,015
I was dating this girl,

1139
00:45:10,284 --> 00:45:12,518
and she made it for me. It tasted so good.

1140
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:17,689
I've been making it from time to time
ever since.

1141
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,725
Are you talking about your ex-girlfriend?

1142
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,061
- His ex?
- You told everyone.

1143
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,064
- So, it's like...
- The ex's legendary toast.

1144
00:45:25,064 --> 00:45:28,366
the famous ex's legendary toast. Right?

1145
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,736
- It's...
- An ex...

1146
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,671
- Ex-girlfriend's Quesadilla.
- Ex-girlfriend's Quesadilla.

1147
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:35,342
(It's called
the Ex-girlfriend's Quesadilla.)

1148
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:36,341
Ex-girlfriend's Quesadilla.

1149
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:39,511
Every time I make this,

1150
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:40,879
it reminds me of her.

1151
00:45:42,215 --> 00:45:43,116
She taught me this recipe.

1152
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:44,417
- What is he talking about?
- He's telling that story there?

1153
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,017
You must be wondering who it was.

1154
00:45:46,986 --> 00:45:47,986
But I can't tell you that.

1155
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,390
But...

1156
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:54,026
I actually have zero curiosity.
It's so interesting.

1157
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:56,595
- It doesn't make me curious at all!
- But...

1158
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:58,363
- We normally ask him in the studio.
- Yes.

1159
00:45:58,364 --> 00:45:59,331
But no one's asking.

1160
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:00,566
No one's interested.

1161
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,968
We simply want him to finish the dish.

1162
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,802
I'm preparing myself to tell the story,

1163
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,237
and no one's asking.

1164
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,472
It's spicy.

1165
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,007
(Sniffling)

1166
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,914
(Are the onions what makes him cry?)

1167
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,048
This is Ok Vin's, right?

1168
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:22,287
- How adorable.
- What a cute kid.

1169
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:25,790
The kids sent him to see how it's going.

1170
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:27,426
(40 minutes before distributing the food)

1171
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,563
(No time to reminisce!)

1172
00:46:30,563 --> 00:46:32,098
The cheese will melt,

1173
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,265
so you can roughly cut it.

1174
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:37,102
I'm done.

1175
00:46:37,103 --> 00:46:38,337
(He quickly cuts the cheese.)

1176
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:40,105
- Start frying them.
- Sorry?

1177
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:41,707
- Start frying them.
- Right.

1178
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:43,108
Where's the frying pan?

1179
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,805
- That will take the least time to make.
- Right?

1180
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,174
(Putting the cheese on the tortilla)

1181
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,777
A tortilla, cheese, and onions,
and it's done?

1182
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:55,011
Yes.

1183
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:57,105
A recipe from his ex.

1184
00:46:57,707 --> 00:46:58,774
It doesn't take too long to cook them.

1185
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,743
- Okay.
- You need to make one every minute.

1186
00:47:01,744 --> 00:47:04,446
- I can do it.
- It's the most efficient and delicious.

1187
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,681
I had that all planned out.

1188
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,715
(All he needs to do is cook them
to a golden brown.)

1189
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,286
That looks good.

1190
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,454
It looks so tasty.

1191
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,090
Very good.

1192
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,225
(He has to make 100 of these.)

1193
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,427
- Let me try one.
- Sure.

1194
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:20,695
Here's honey.

1195
00:47:22,064 --> 00:47:23,631
(Moaning)

1196
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,899
It's the taste I was going for.

1197
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,436
It perfectly suits a kid's palate.

1198
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:31,906
(Will it suit the palates of the kids?)

1199
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:37,779
- It was really good.
- Really?

1200
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,415
It's simple yet delicious.

1201
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:41,582
So far, so good.

1202
00:47:41,784 --> 00:47:44,185
(The maker is even more satisfied.)

1203
00:47:44,186 --> 00:47:46,721
I have a feeling
his dish may be number one.

1204
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:49,023
(Getting another piece)

1205
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:49,858
What?

1206
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,327
(Moaning)

1207
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,329
He's eating all of them!

1208
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,998
(He forgets about his job
and enjoys his ex's recipe.)

1209
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,233
Does he ever stop eating?

1210
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:01,737
I think you're eating more
than you're making.

1211
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,740
(Be quiet.)

1212
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,376
Is that meant to be a sign for his ex?

1213
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:09,811
- This was a sign?
- Yes.

1214
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:12,013
At this rate,

1215
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,414
you'll have to send her a video message.

1216
00:48:13,616 --> 00:48:14,716
Right. You should.

1217
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:17,052
We'll let you have this one. Go ahead.

1218
00:48:17,053 --> 00:48:19,187
- You need to do that...
- Face the camera.

1219
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,789
to get some more screentime.

1220
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:22,858
He's right.

1221
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,459
- You need to beat the pot, at least.
- I don't...

1222
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,461
I don't need so much airtime.

1223
00:48:25,462 --> 00:48:27,129
- You need to beat the pot, at least.
- At least the pot.

1224
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,030
- Face the camera.
- Yes.

1225
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:30,419
Anyway,

1226
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:32,521
I hope you're doing well.

1227
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:37,894
Thank you so much
for sharing that tasty recipe.

1228
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:39,261
This is so funny.

1229
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,530
I went to Peru one day,

1230
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,766
- Isn't that too long?
- and that dish occurred to me.

1231
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,334
- He's dragging on.
- Stay put.

1232
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:47,937
So, thank you.

1233
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:49,839
Take care.

1234
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,107
I'm still not curious,
even after all he's done.

1235
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,511
- But...
- This is driving me insane.

1236
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:58,381
(Daniel makes us want to protect
his privacy.)

1237
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:02,084
It smells good.

1238
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,553
It actually smells like chicken.
How fascinating.

1239
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:06,422
One might think this was a chicken dish
if it weren't for the toes.

1240
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:08,891
- That looks good.
- It's nicely cooked.

1241
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:10,125
I think it'll taste good.

1242
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:11,793
It's like jokbal.

1243
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:13,695
- Only potatoes are left now.
- Are you adding them?

1244
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:14,564
In a little while.

1245
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:16,198
It's 30 minutes?

1246
00:49:16,266 --> 00:49:18,801
I'll cut the potatoes in the way
that they'll cook in 25 minutes.

1247
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,437
Or in 20 minutes.

1248
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:23,773
(Andong braised cuy progress: 90 percent)

1249
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:26,742
- Goodness.
- The potatoes.

1250
00:49:26,743 --> 00:49:28,744
(He slices them thinly and adds them
so they'll cook in under 20 minutes.)

1251
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:29,945
Did you put the potatoes...

1252
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,815
after boiling them or not?

1253
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:34,817
You need to put the uncooked ones
and cook them in the pot.

1254
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:36,686
That looks so delicious.

1255
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:40,089
I wonder what that tastes like.

1256
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,524
(Ok Vin, the lab rat, tastes it first.)

1257
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:43,759
I want to know
if it tastes like braised chicken.

1258
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:46,196
Unbelievable!

1259
00:49:46,197 --> 00:49:47,630
- Do you like it?
- It's so delicious!

1260
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:49,338
This is so good, Su Young.

1261
00:49:49,707 --> 00:49:50,907
I added some jjajang sauce too.

1262
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:53,443
It's a little spicy, though.

1263
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:56,193
The garlic scent is pretty strong.

1264
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:57,628
Gosh, this is so good.

1265
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,897
The meat itself is already good.

1266
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,234
That braised cuy had
the epic balance of taste.

1267
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,469
That looks great.

1268
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,611
There we go. Braised cuy is all done.

1269
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,016
(Andong braised cuy is complete.)

1270
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,309
What are you going to do with honey?

1271
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,778
- I'll just drizzle it later on.
- They have to add honey too.

1272
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,890
It won't be easy doing it while serving.

1273
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,045
You should try it yourself.

1274
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,983
I'll take the harder way.

1275
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:20,418
I can do it for the kids.

1276
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,392
(Current time is 10:35 a.m.)

1277
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:25,160
(They have 25 minutes left.)

1278
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,490
That's perfect.

1279
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:29,090
(When everyone is moving swiftly...)

1280
00:50:31,058 --> 00:50:33,198
Eggs? I thought you were done.

1281
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:38,837
- That's Hyun Seok's menu.
- We never heard what he was making.

1282
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:40,705
- What could it be?
- You're right.

1283
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,418
(He starts to crack eggs
with only 25 minutes left.)

1284
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:46,369
(Using both hands,)

1285
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:49,324
(he keeps cracking eggs
with flashy skills.)

1286
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,194
(Now that he cracked all the eggs,
he starts to stir it like crazy.)

1287
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,331
What is he making?

1288
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,254
Maybe it's steamed eggs.

1289
00:50:56,279 --> 00:50:59,356
(And he just pours it into a pot?)

1290
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:03,720
(Hyun Seok is making egg soup for kids.)

1291
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:04,765
It's egg soup.

1292
00:51:04,964 --> 00:51:10,256
There are japchae
and braised cuy on the menu,

1293
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,174
and they need soup other than solid food.

1294
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,878
It was in between steamed eggs
and egg soup.

1295
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:16,808
- Oh, like that?
- It was good.

1296
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,139
So that it's fluffy.

1297
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:19,177
With lots of chunks.

1298
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,542
(He easily finished it in ten minutes.)

1299
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,604
(Tasting it right away)

1300
00:51:22,604 --> 00:51:23,781
Kids like that.

1301
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:26,693
(Satisfied)

1302
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:28,218
(Egg soup is complete.)

1303
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:29,520
They're getting them done.

1304
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:32,260
- You have 15 minutes.
- Okay.

1305
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:35,393
That tortilla is the problem.

1306
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,982
(Quesadilla is the only dish
that's not done.)

1307
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:38,363
Will all of it fit?

1308
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:39,674
(Wrapping up quickly)

1309
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:41,132
I don't want them to go cold.

1310
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,401
Kids wouldn't like their soup too hot,
would they?

1311
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:44,669
Like boiling hot?

1312
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,887
- They wouldn't like that.
- Right?

1313
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,295
Of course.

1314
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,276
I didn't know they were watching us.

1315
00:51:51,595 --> 00:51:54,823
They must've gotten curious
because of the delicious smells.

1316
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:55,747
It's cooked.

1317
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:58,182
- Is that rice?
- You cooked rice too?

1318
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,284
Yes, 100 portions.

1319
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,830
Look at this. This is just excellent.

1320
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:04,989
Seriously.

1321
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,255
I thought it was braised chicken.

1322
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:09,127
(Everything is ready!)

1323
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,029
- That looks scrumptious.
- We'll start serving.

1324
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:11,933
- Yes.
- Yes.

1325
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,995
- Let's take them out.
- I'm almost done.

1326
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:16,467
They managed to do it in time.

1327
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:19,848
(They quickly get ready to serve.)

1328
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:21,973
- Should we put this in the middle?
- Let's put it here.

1329
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,064
In 1, 2, 3.
- Hold on.
- Wait.

1330
00:52:25,987 --> 00:52:27,300
- It won't work.
- How should we hold this?

1331
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:28,846
- What should we use?
- You hold that side.

1332
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:29,847
I'll hold this side.

1333
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,106
- Okay.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1334
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:32,641
Here we go!

1335
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:33,952
- It's so heavy!
- Gosh!

1336
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:35,183
- Keep holding it up.
- Hey...

1337
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,587
- Keep it up.
- Wait...

1338
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:38,206
- It's so heavy!
- It's no joke.

1339
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,969
- Just...
- It's really heavy.

1340
00:52:41,226 --> 00:52:44,073
This should weigh about 50kg.

1341
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:45,102
Hyun Seok...

1342
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,405
Seriously, it's no joke.

1343
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:49,155
- Keep it up.
- Don't spill it.

1344
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,361
- You're almost there.
- It's crazy heavy.

1345
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:53,991
- Let's lift it higher.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1346
00:53:00,726 --> 00:53:01,673
Hey.

1347
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:03,569
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

1348
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:05,238
Can you keep it down?

1349
00:53:06,578 --> 00:53:08,929
But it's so heavy
that you automatically yell.

1350
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,867
(Korean school meal is all ready.)

1351
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:13,372
- It's amazing you've done it in time.
- I agree.

1352
00:53:13,536 --> 00:53:14,914
Well done.

1353
00:53:16,272 --> 00:53:19,535
We'll start serving food with less soup.

1354
00:53:19,535 --> 00:53:23,155
So, it'll be rice,
tortilla, japchae, sausages,

1355
00:53:23,352 --> 00:53:24,924
cuy, and soup.

1356
00:53:25,124 --> 00:53:27,583
Kids might spill while moving in the line.

1357
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,707
So, the soup goes to the end.

1358
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,989
(The verified K-homemade food master)

1359
00:53:33,766 --> 00:53:35,639
(Even the guinea pig is transformed...)

1360
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,474
(into fusion Korean cuisine
with his touch.)

1361
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:41,030
- I'm so curious about that one.
- Same.

1362
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,909
It's tasty.
It was the first thing to run out.

1363
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:45,975
(Andong braised cuy)

1364
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:50,306
This macaroni japchae is so interesting.

1365
00:53:50,306 --> 00:53:51,717
Spoonable japchae is a great idea.

1366
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:53,119
Yes, it's brilliant.

1367
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:56,813
(Made by one of the best chefs in Korea)

1368
00:53:57,323 --> 00:53:59,674
- The little ones would like that.
- Yes, like that.

1369
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:01,613
It's so fluffy.

1370
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:04,130
It's a regular menu for school lunch.

1371
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:07,233
(The action-taker, General Ok's menu)

1372
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:09,936
It was good. It made me crave beer.

1373
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:12,541
- That savory taste.
- You'd eat it with just rice.

1374
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:14,073
Every kid loves the menu.

1375
00:54:14,098 --> 00:54:15,732
(Sausage veggie stir-fry)

1376
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:20,456
(The one with a childish palate
finishes it with a fine touch.)

1377
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:23,582
It's exactly what children would like.

1378
00:54:24,754 --> 00:54:26,697
The honey wouldn't get
to the bottom like that.

1379
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:29,232
I'd drizzle it again while serving.

1380
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,357
Some kids may not like sweet food.

1381
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:33,592
Are you afraid
they might like mine better or what?

1382
00:54:33,592 --> 00:54:36,095
There are menus the kids would...

1383
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,431
- want refills.
- The ones they like particularly.

1384
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,403
- Yes.
- And that really touches your pride...

1385
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,388
if they don't want your food...

1386
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:44,014
I get the feeling that there will be
a pile of leftover quesadillas.

1387
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:47,373
(The ex-boyfriend is anxious.)

1388
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:50,677
(It's 11:00 a.m., Lunchtime)

1389
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:55,181
(They run as soon as the bell goes.)

1390
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:57,216
That's the same as Korea.

1391
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,697
We also start running
as soon as the bell rings.

1392
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:00,547
Right.

1393
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:03,535
(Serving 100 elementary kids starts now.)

1394
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,805
- So cute. Hello.
- Okay, come here.

1395
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,505
(A brave-looking boy is the first to go.)

1396
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:13,006
You're wearing gloves.
Just use your hands.

1397
00:55:13,006 --> 00:55:13,856
Okay.

1398
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:16,126
You can give him some more.

1399
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:17,544
(I want a lot!)

1400
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,459
It's a quesadilla.

1401
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,489
- Pizza?
- Tortilla.

1402
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,887
(Pouting)

1403
00:55:26,984 --> 00:55:28,255
"I don't want that."

1404
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:29,856
He's so cute.

1405
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,836
This one is sausage veggie stir-fry.

1406
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,246
This one is cuy.

1407
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,269
It's braised cuy.

1408
00:55:36,669 --> 00:55:38,271
Can you hold this with one hand?

1409
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,107
It's egg soup. Enjoy your meal.

1410
00:55:41,107 --> 00:55:42,525
(Enjoy your lunch.)

1411
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,577
Sausage veggie stir-fry.

1412
00:55:44,602 --> 00:55:45,842
(The first guest is served.)

1413
00:55:47,924 --> 00:55:51,737
We should try them ourselves.
What a shame.

1414
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:55,245
(Will Peruvian kids like it?)

1415
00:55:57,054 --> 00:56:00,078
(The first student entered
the dining hall.)

1416
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:05,049
(A sip of egg soup)

1417
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:07,435
(A bite of a sausage)

1418
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,222
Sausage!

1419
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:13,729
It's sausage!

1420
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:16,974
He likes sausage.

1421
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,571
(It's so good that he can't stay still.)

1422
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:24,259
Once they taste ketchup, they'll go crazy.

1423
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:25,493
- I know.
- They'll dig it.

1424
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,707
He might pester his mom
to get him ketchup.

1425
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:31,308
(He picks up the quesadilla.)

1426
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,257
(Munching heartily)

1427
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,781
(Way to go, Daniel.)

1428
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,136
No, he has to swallow it.

1429
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:39,986
That...

1430
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:41,855
You can already tell.

1431
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:43,747
- He has to swallow it.
- It's game over.

1432
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:44,658
That's really...

1433
00:56:45,442 --> 00:56:48,412
(He munches on the quesadilla.)

1434
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:56,392
- He has no idea what he's eating.
- That's so funny.

1435
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:58,972
(But it's really delicious.)

1436
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:01,193
(Distribution is going smoothly.)

1437
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:02,976
It's a tortilla with cheese.

1438
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,979
Oh, it's hot. Hold it like this.

1439
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:07,084
(Endless line)

1440
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,654
(Dashing)

1441
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:13,817
(The quesadilla boy takes a great spot.)

1442
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:15,288
He really enjoyed the food.

1443
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:16,323
I see he ate it outside.

1444
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:17,724
He's really loving it.

1445
00:57:17,749 --> 00:57:21,792
(Looking at the sky after a bite)

1446
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,881
It's nice to see him eating so well.

1447
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:26,766
I think he had his food refilled.

1448
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:30,136
- I remember. He came for another tray.
- Yes, he wanted more.

1449
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:35,426
(A normal school lunch becomes special
with the landscape of the Andes.)

1450
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:38,243
It's a tortilla with cheese.

1451
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:42,182
(Before delicious food)

1452
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:44,906
Even the smallest breeze
will make them happy.

1453
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:48,255
Look at how happy their faces are.

1454
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,608
(Soon, the cafeteria is filled
with students.)

1455
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:54,918
(The younger students start eating first.)

1456
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,943
(They carefully explore
the cuy sauce first.)

1457
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:06,617
(The unfamiliar look makes them hesitate.)

1458
00:58:09,241 --> 00:58:12,117
(Trying a bite)

1459
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:19,089
(Another bite right after)

1460
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,927
(She goes for the japchae,
which is easy for them to spoon.)

1461
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:30,948
(Bell pepper)

1462
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:34,234
Hey, little one.
This will be too spicy for you.

1463
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:36,747
I tried it, and it's really spicy.

1464
00:58:37,921 --> 00:58:40,719
(You're eating that spicy thing?)

1465
00:58:40,823 --> 00:58:42,409
(Oh, I can't eat it.)

1466
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:43,810
I guess the bell pepper was too spicy.

1467
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,945
It could be spicy for kids that age.

1468
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,661
I also didn't like it when I was a kid.

1469
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:49,716
Because it's spicy.

1470
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:55,723
(She finished japchae in no time.)

1471
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,026
(They all start with japchae
since it's easy to eat.)

1472
00:58:59,026 --> 00:59:01,294
They tried japchae first,
the easy-to-eat menu.

1473
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:03,430
Japchae satisfied their taste buds.

1474
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,766
(It's a fantastic combination.)

1475
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:09,002
We had glass noodles separately
because we had to slurp it,

1476
00:59:09,002 --> 00:59:12,511
but you can scoop everything like that
and enjoy it all together.

1477
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,588
(As they continue serving
without any problems)

1478
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,243
It's a tortilla with cheese.

1479
00:59:19,786 --> 00:59:20,920
Enjoy your meal.

1480
00:59:21,973 --> 00:59:24,287
(A girl with a familiar face appears.)

1481
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,586
- Here you go.
- It's a tortilla with cheese.

1482
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:30,474
(Everyone is busy with their work.)

1483
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,572
It's me, Dina.

1484
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:39,376
Hey, Dina.

1485
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:40,751
(Dina! Enjoy your meal with friends.)

1486
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:43,503
Right. She's Dina.

1487
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:46,773
Her friends are having a great lunchtime,
thanks to Dina.

1488
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:50,635
What do you think this is? I'm so curious.

1489
00:59:50,735 --> 00:59:52,345
It warms up my heart looking at them.

1490
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:54,114
It makes me feel relaxed.

1491
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:56,593
She feels proud in front of her friends.

1492
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,593
- Right.
- She's so proud.

1493
00:59:58,593 --> 01:00:00,193
- She's saying it's all thanks to her.
- Yes.

1494
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,427
Is there more? There they come.

1495
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:04,760
We've got more coming.

1496
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:09,027
Hi. Good morning.

1497
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:12,060
- They're so cute.
- It's got cheese inside.

1498
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,160
Good morning.

1499
01:00:13,612 --> 01:00:16,179
You need to place the tortilla
on one side.

1500
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,045
This way, I have to put the chicken
on the rice.

1501
01:00:18,045 --> 01:00:20,750
Place this on one side.

1502
01:00:20,774 --> 01:00:22,012
That way, they'll eat it as a dessert.

1503
01:00:22,012 --> 01:00:24,079
So that they can have the rice
and this together.

1504
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,845
- Okay?
- Okay.

1505
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:28,679
- He's pretty nonchalant.
- What's going on?

1506
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:32,212
Look at the way he's standing.
He's something.

1507
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,612
He's very nonchalant.

1508
01:00:34,612 --> 01:00:36,245
Do you want a lot? Sure.

1509
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:39,679
(He looks cool
with one hand in his pocket.)

1510
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,279
It's like the chill guy meme.

1511
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:42,345
- I'll give you a tasty one.
- Chill guy.

1512
01:00:42,345 --> 01:00:43,945
- Look at his legs.
- Hold on.

1513
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:47,145
"Put some on my plate.
I'll give them a taste."

1514
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,245
Do you want more?

1515
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:51,612
No?

1516
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:53,512
He's so cool.

1517
01:00:54,312 --> 01:00:56,479
One moment.

1518
01:00:58,712 --> 01:01:00,612
- All right.
- He's aloof.

1519
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:02,612
Look at his hand!

1520
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:05,149
He's the chill guy!

1521
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:06,949
He's literally the chill guy meme.

1522
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:08,349
He's the meme itself.

1523
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:10,849
I bet he's the best fighter
in that school.

1524
01:01:10,849 --> 01:01:12,082
He's the best fighter.

1525
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:13,182
I think we're done.

1526
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:14,716
(The last student left,
looking nonchalant.)

1527
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,682
Are they eating?

1528
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:18,282
I hope it suits their palates.

1529
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,149
Now, we need to see their reactions.

1530
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:23,116
(Sneakily entering)

1531
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:26,216
Try this.

1532
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,582
It tastes weird.

1533
01:01:28,882 --> 01:01:30,282
- Which one?
- What tastes weird?

1534
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:32,616
Oh, that.

1535
01:01:32,616 --> 01:01:35,882
It doesn't look
like what they're familiar with.

1536
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:39,649
(Looking intently)

1537
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:43,016
(He tries picking it up.)

1538
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:44,549
This is cuy.

1539
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:47,416
He just realized it was cuy.

1540
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,582
He went, "This is cuy."

1541
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:50,516
He's never seen it cooked that way.

1542
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:54,982
(They're used to fire-grilled cuy.)

1543
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:58,982
(On the other hand, Andong braised cuy
looks and tastes unfamiliar.)

1544
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,882
(He takes a big bite.)

1545
01:02:05,216 --> 01:02:06,116
What do you think?

1546
01:02:06,116 --> 01:02:08,982
It's cuy. Try it.

1547
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:14,616
(I'll give it a try.)

1548
01:02:18,182 --> 01:02:21,649
(He ends up eating,
holding it in his hand.)

1549
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,582
(So? It tastes good, right?)

1550
01:02:28,016 --> 01:02:30,516
I'm going to finish this.

1551
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:34,849
Once one of them started eating it,
they all tried it too.

1552
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:37,449
They tried it after asking if it was good
and hearing it was.

1553
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,649
He's enjoying it.

1554
01:02:40,116 --> 01:02:41,316
This is cuy.

1555
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:44,557
(Cuy foot)

1556
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:47,449
They know it's cuy
only when it maintains its shape.

1557
01:02:47,449 --> 01:02:49,116
- There needs to be one whole cuy.
- Yes.

1558
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:50,049
How interesting.

1559
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:52,582
(They all love Andong braised cuy.)

1560
01:02:53,949 --> 01:02:55,149
(Completely lost in eating cuy)

1561
01:02:55,149 --> 01:02:58,382
Goodness. Look at him go.

1562
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:02,282
He's eating it so well.

1563
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:04,416
Now that they've tasted cuy that way,

1564
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:08,682
they might say it's too bland
when they get the fire-grilled one.

1565
01:03:08,682 --> 01:03:10,082
They'd want the seasoned ones now.

1566
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,649
Yes, if it isn't seasoned that way...

1567
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:16,016
(Andong braised cuy: 4.5 stars)

1568
01:03:16,016 --> 01:03:17,882
(It's deliciously spicy all the way!
Cuy took a whole new turn.)

1569
01:03:19,782 --> 01:03:20,916
(The quesadilla cook appears.)

1570
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:22,049
He's still there?

1571
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:23,682
Hi, kids.

1572
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:27,116
I made the quesadillas you're eating.

1573
01:03:31,672 --> 01:03:32,738
Do you like the quesadillas?

1574
01:03:33,972 --> 01:03:35,572
(Nodding)

1575
01:03:35,572 --> 01:03:37,438
- Yes.
- Yes.

1576
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:40,238
There's no way they don't like it.

1577
01:03:40,238 --> 01:03:42,738
Once you taste it,
you can't help but like it.

1578
01:03:43,072 --> 01:03:45,738
All the other members are outside,
and you went in there alone...

1579
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,938
- to urge them to try your quesadillas?
- Well...

1580
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:50,105
That's not it.

1581
01:03:50,105 --> 01:03:52,272
You keep telling them
to try the tortillas.

1582
01:03:52,972 --> 01:03:54,605
(His door-to-door sales begin in earnest.)

1583
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:56,738
Give it a taste.

1584
01:03:57,472 --> 01:04:00,772
The tortilla.

1585
01:04:00,772 --> 01:04:01,838
It's the chill guy.

1586
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,072
"Chill guy."

1587
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,105
He's a scary one.

1588
01:04:04,105 --> 01:04:05,642
Right. He shouldn't mess with him.

1589
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:10,672
(Try the quesadilla.)

1590
01:04:14,872 --> 01:04:17,272
He picked the chill guy of all the kids
to ask.

1591
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,072
He might throw it at you.

1592
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:21,205
(I can't eat it with you there.)

1593
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:25,805
(He persistently asks him to try it.)

1594
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:29,605
Please try it.

1595
01:04:30,205 --> 01:04:31,372
The tortilla.

1596
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:32,938
It's got cheese inside.

1597
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:34,738
"Fine. I'll try it."

1598
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:38,205
He's enjoying it.

1599
01:04:38,772 --> 01:04:42,938
Is the quesadilla tasty?

1600
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:46,205
(I'm not going to answer.)

1601
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:49,005
Keep eating. Sorry.
I'll stop talking to you.

1602
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:51,272
Enjoy your food.

1603
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:53,205
I never knew he was the chill guy.

1604
01:04:55,172 --> 01:04:58,005
How did you not know when all of us knew?

1605
01:04:58,005 --> 01:04:59,205
I just realized it here.

1606
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:03,605
Back then, I had no idea...
if he was the chill guy or the chili guy.

1607
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:05,772
(Dumbfounded)

1608
01:05:06,638 --> 01:05:09,438
(The romantic boy came outside
at that moment.)

1609
01:05:10,138 --> 01:05:11,574
Wasn't he the first one to get the food?

1610
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:14,305
Do you want more?

1611
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:15,945
I want some more.

1612
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,205
- Do you want more?
- More? Okay.

1613
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,405
(The first kid to ask for a refill)

1614
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:23,538
We have a customer
who's asking for a refill.

1615
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:25,538
Once someone asks for a refill,

1616
01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:27,605
you know that you cooked it right.

1617
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:28,572
- Right.
- He cleaned the plate.

1618
01:05:28,572 --> 01:05:29,872
Goodness.

1619
01:05:29,872 --> 01:05:31,272
What was your favorite?

1620
01:05:33,405 --> 01:05:35,972
(He picks Su Young's Andong braised cuy.)

1621
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:37,672
What else?

1622
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,038
It must have been right up his alley.

1623
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:41,772
He liked yours too.

1624
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:42,838
(The sausage dish is next.)

1625
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:47,138
- How cute. You can come back for more!
- Come back for more.

1626
01:05:47,138 --> 01:05:48,772
He must not like tall guys.

1627
01:05:48,772 --> 01:05:49,672
What about my quesadilla?

1628
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:51,472
Hey, kiddo.

1629
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:52,938
- What about the quesadilla?
- He didn't ask for it.

1630
01:05:52,938 --> 01:05:54,072
Hey!

1631
01:05:54,438 --> 01:05:55,572
Make sure you finish the quesadilla.

1632
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:57,620
(Don't you dare leave
my Ex-girlfriend's Quesadilla.)

1633
01:05:57,938 --> 01:05:59,538
He's eating, lying on the grass.

1634
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,523
That's so cute.

1635
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:02,772
That's very romantic.

1636
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:05,238
(The romantic boy found a spot
on the grass.)

1637
01:06:05,638 --> 01:06:07,272
It looks like
he's in reserve duty training.

1638
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:11,338
"Sir, sit up when you eat."

1639
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:13,372
(It even looks like
he's living his second life.)

1640
01:06:13,372 --> 01:06:14,272
"Sit up."

1641
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:16,605
Look at his face too.
That's not the look of a kid.

1642
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:18,172
It's like he's saying,
"You guys can cook."

1643
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:20,072
What...

1644
01:06:20,072 --> 01:06:21,205
There's no more to serve, right?

1645
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:22,838
(Lunchtime is almost over.)

1646
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:24,372
- I think we're done.
- Yes.

1647
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,338
Do you have "bolsa?"

1648
01:06:27,272 --> 01:06:28,472
What is he asking for?

1649
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:30,038
- What?
- "Bolsa."

1650
01:06:30,038 --> 01:06:32,105
"Bolsa?"

1651
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:33,405
"Bolsa" is...

1652
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:36,105
- a plastic bag.
- A plastic bag!

1653
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:38,705
They liked it so much
that they wanted to take it home.

1654
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:41,505
They'd want to share it
with their families.

1655
01:06:41,505 --> 01:06:44,038
Yes. It's a new type of food
that they like so much,

1656
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:45,938
so they want their families
to taste it too.

1657
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,374
(It turns into a to-go restaurant.)

1658
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,909
(I want 1 serving
that's the size of 2 servings.)

1659
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:56,846
(Even making handles for him)

1660
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:01,048
(You guys are good at packaging food too.)

1661
01:07:01,048 --> 01:07:02,281
They want to take it home.

1662
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:04,681
It's "Carrusel" in real life.

1663
01:07:04,681 --> 01:07:06,781
Yes, I realized
that they didn't leave any food.

1664
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:08,614
I've been leaving all that food so far.

1665
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:09,748
I learned a lot.

1666
01:07:10,114 --> 01:07:13,348
(Even the chill guy takes the leftovers.)

1667
01:07:13,348 --> 01:07:16,014
(He's a warm-hearted boy
who helps out a younger kid.)

1668
01:07:18,523 --> 01:07:20,689
(The crowded cafeteria...)

1669
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:24,014
(turned quiet.)

1670
01:07:25,614 --> 01:07:28,281
(I'm leaving too.)

1671
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:34,548
(This lonesome gourmet is left all alone.)

1672
01:07:37,948 --> 01:07:43,014
(A dog snuck in to join him.)

1673
01:07:43,848 --> 01:07:46,748
The yellow dog turned black.

1674
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,181
He enjoys me-time
without caring about anything else.

1675
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:54,014
They finished the japchae.

1676
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:56,448
- It's over. Let's eat.
- Should we eat now?

1677
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:57,914
Great work, everyone.

1678
01:07:57,914 --> 01:08:00,814
- Good work, guys.
- Good job, everyone.

1679
01:08:00,814 --> 01:08:02,448
You all worked so hard.

1680
01:08:03,181 --> 01:08:06,548
(Thank you for your hard work, everyone.)

1681
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:10,481
- They worked so hard.
- Right. Awesome.

1682
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:11,448
Can we talk as we eat?

1683
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:13,214
- I'm starving.
- Yes.

1684
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,081
- We need to get some food in.
- Yes.

1685
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:17,314
I've seen this place so often
on social media.

1686
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,386
Is this a hotel-style shabu shabu buffet?

1687
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,487
It's kind of like that.

1688
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:22,822
Young Ji, let's get ourselves a plate.

1689
01:08:22,822 --> 01:08:24,322
There's such a variety.

1690
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,401
The meat is sorted by cut.

1691
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,036
We can just pick what we want?

1692
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,874
- Chuck rolls, brisket, and bottom round.
- Brisket is good.

1693
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,008
Brisket is tasty.

1694
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,143
Enjoy, everyone!

1695
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:38,713
I'll make a vongole broth with garlic.

1696
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:40,283
(Vongole shabu-shabu)

1697
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:41,783
- I'll turn it on.
- Yes, go ahead.

1698
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,552
It's 240 degrees Celsius.

1699
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,221
- For how many minutes?
- Put in the broth.

1700
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,822
Add some garlic.

1701
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,858
This could be a challenge.

1702
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,526
It'd be crazy not to add garlic
to the vongole broth.

1703
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:53,862
Who'd be crazy enough to do that?

1704
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:55,896
- What's that?
- It's parsley.

1705
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:59,167
You can put pasta or meat
in the vongole broth.

1706
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:00,435
The vongole broth is amazing.

1707
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,304
- Isn't it so convenient and modern?
- I agree.

1708
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,305
I love the vibe here too.

1709
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,407
- You can come here with your family.
- That's right.

1710
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,510
- I...
- It's fabulous.

1711
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,047
- There are so many sauces too.
- Right.

1712
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:13,281
(The shabu-shabu eating show begins.)

1713
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,785
It tastes different each time
since there are four sauces.

1714
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,152
- Right.
- It's good.

1715
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:20,087
- It's delicious too.
- It's so good.

1716
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,289
I love it.

1717
01:09:23,857 --> 01:09:25,961
- I told you so.
- It is a job scam.

1718
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,695
I went there expecting a gourmet trip,

1719
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,163
but it was very tough.

1720
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,366
Someone did tell me that my memories
would be romanticized afterward.

1721
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,371
The time we had there laughing and working
has become a good memory.

1722
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,106
(All they have in their minds
are the fun memories.)

1723
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,643
But it's the kind of experience...

1724
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,278
- you can't have even with money.
- Exactly.

1725
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,779
It was so much fun.

1726
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,080
(Even though PERU BOB is over...)

1727
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,316
- They're going to the Caribbean Sea next.
- That's right.

1728
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,153
Over there, Ok Vin will be in her element.

1729
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:53,755
More than she was in Peru.

1730
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:54,856
In the preview,

1731
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,093
- we said she was like a fish at sea.
- Yes.

1732
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,627
Next time, it's the Caribbean Sea.

1733
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,201
(The most beautiful sea on earth,
the Caribbean Sea)

1734
01:10:05,225 --> 01:10:07,903
It's so beautiful. My heart is fluttering.

1735
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:12,942
(Sea creatures
that live under the sea there)

1736
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:16,012
(Blessed with a climate that gives
ingredients from the land, sea, and air)

1737
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,315
- It looks appetizing.
- Oh, my gosh.

1738
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:19,414
It's amazing here.

1739
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,318
(And there appears...)

1740
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,952
(Nam No, the Cooking Maniac.)

1741
01:10:23,954 --> 01:10:27,723
(He crushed it as soon as appearing
on "Culinary Class Wars.")

1742
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:31,961
(He's the hottest chef
