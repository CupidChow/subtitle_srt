1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:03,560
(The third Tasty Mission card of PERU BOB)

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,784
(The mysterious numbers)

3
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:12,736
(And an animal on top of the mountain)

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,472
- Isn't that an alpaca?
- An alpaca?

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:17,739
It looks like one.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,095
Our next trip is to a high-altitude area.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:22,906
We're going up high.

8
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,106
(3,718m above sea level)

9
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,772
- It's one extreme after another.
- That's true.

10
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:30,772
- It's practically touching the sky.
- You can see the clouds.

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,972
Still, the environment should be better
than that of Amazon.

12
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:36,839
- No, but it's a high-altitude area.
- It's not easy.

13
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,172
- They'll get headaches.
- It wasn't easy at all.

14
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,572
- Only the ones who went know.
- It's just different.

15
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:41,649
I'm curious.

16
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:43,981
Have they finally arrived?

17
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,148
Gosh, Hyun Seok.

18
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:46,954
We're at Cusco.

19
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,906
(This is Cusco,
a city high in the mountains.)

20
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,506
- That was such a long journey.
- It sure was.

21
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:55,106
There are so many houses in the mountains.

22
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,639
Really?

23
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,339
The whole city is at a high altitude?

24
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,739
The airport is located 3,310m
above sea level.

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:02,839
What?

26
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,872
That's incredible.

27
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:08,504
The airport itself is
in a high-altitude area.

28
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:12,916
This place used to be the capital
of the Inca Empire.

29
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,056
- This was the capital.
- Cusco.

30
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,972
It's like Gyeongju in Korea.

31
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,339
The old capital with
over a thousand years of history.

32
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,323
That's so cool.

33
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:24,772
Machu Picchu!

34
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:26,460
- Machu Picchu...
- "Machu Picchu train."

35
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:28,506
That must be a train to Machu Picchu.

36
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,439
- A train to Machu Picchu.
- Oh, really?

37
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,639
(The city is famous for Machu Picchu.)

38
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,306
I've always wanted to visit Machu Picchu.

39
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:36,039
Cusco.

40
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,906
That's so beautiful.

41
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,972
- That looks like the urban area.
- Right.

42
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,372
The scenery is amazing.

43
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:45,572
(One of the most famous
Andean towns in Peru)

44
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,606
That place was the capital of Peru
before the invasion.

45
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,606
- It was the capital of the Inca Empire.
- Right.

46
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,872
Is that right? Gosh.

47
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:55,039
(The UNESCO World Heritage City, Cusco)

48
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,772
That's incredible.

49
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:02,545
(Along with traditional recipes
of the Inca Empire,)

50
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:04,872
Is that a rat or something?

51
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:06,006
(natural Andes ingredients are here.)

52
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,939
Everything from the alpine area
is delicious.

53
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,339
Cabbages, radish, potatoes, you name it.

54
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,658
I can't wait to see this episode.

55
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:16,306
(Cusco, the city closest to the sky)

56
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,047
- That way?
- Let's go that way.

57
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,772
- Look at the clouds behind them.
- That place was splendid.

58
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:27,172
- Doesn't this suitcase move so smoothly?
- It's very light too.

59
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,856
It hardly makes any sound.

60
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:31,739
(As they walk...)

61
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,172
Everyone is panting.

62
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,595
I'm getting out of breath a bit.

63
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,597
A little bit.

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,306
- Breathing is a bit...
- It's hard.

65
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,998
Yes, I'm getting out of breath.

66
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,013
I can feel it too.

67
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,705
That must be the altitude sickness.

68
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:47,072
We're at a very high altitude, right?

69
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,043
- We're at a highland.
- About 3,400m above sea level?

70
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:54,106
The moment we landed,
it felt like I was being choked.

71
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:56,239
- Is that right?
- Is it that hard?

72
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,639
Mount Halla is only about 2,000m.

73
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,971
- Around 2,000m?
- It's way higher.

74
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,372
It's not even comparable.

75
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:01,772
It's even higher than Mount Paektu.

76
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:03,339
- That's right.
- It's more than 1,000m higher.

77
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,339
- Almost 1,000m more.
- Seriously?

78
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,061
But where we were going was higher.

79
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,812
We went up higher.
It's about 3,700m above sea level.

80
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,606
(Hyun Seok stops by a small stall
in front of the airport.)

81
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:17,905
They even have cheese.

82
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,072
- That's cheese.
- Yes, cheese.

83
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,506
- Maybe I'll get some with salt.
- That looks thick.

84
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:27,006
- It's a local ingredient.
- He noticed cheese the moment we arrived.

85
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,706
He's already thinking of a recipe.

86
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:29,717
Is this made here?

87
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:33,739
- Yes, it's an Andean sheep milk cheese.
- Is this local?

88
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,472
What cheese do the locals have the most?

89
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:38,706
This one. Paria cheese.

90
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:39,572
This one?

91
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,472
The one that looks like soap?

92
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,872
Oh, really?

93
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,239
(He sniffs it out of curiosity.)

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,435
Is this like mozzarella?

95
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,772
It doesn't have that strong smell.

96
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,939
- I'm so curious about that one.
- Seriously.

97
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,859
Is it the same?

98
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,972
(Tasting the cheese)

99
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:57,839
That should be good.

100
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,206
(It's delicious.)

101
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,983
Let's get this cheese.
It's similar to mozzarella.

102
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:04,772
That looks delicious.

103
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,239
(Holding cheese in his hand)

104
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:07,739
Let's go.

105
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,172
All right! Peru!

106
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:10,372
(The final destination, up to 3,718m)

107
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:11,672
I think that's so cool.

108
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:14,106
What do you call that?
The thing above the car.

109
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:15,606
That's just so cool.

110
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:17,739
- What is it?
- It's so vintage and cool.

111
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,572
It says, "municipal..."

112
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:23,072
"Municipal?"

113
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,106
(Welcome to Cusco.)

114
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:30,306
Welcome to Cusco! Bienvenido Cusco!

115
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:31,672
- That's so fake.
- Faked energy.

116
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,872
(Once again, his fake energy appeared.)

117
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,706
I'm the only one acting out.

118
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,072
- That should've been edited out.
- I look so annoying.

119
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,439
(He can't hold his head up.)

120
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,839
(Here we go again.)

121
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,139
(The complete opposite)

122
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,306
The city of gold, Inca!

123
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,706
(He's quite the character.)"

124
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,106
What cheese did you get?

125
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,039
- Paria cheese that's like mozzarella.
- Oh, mozzarella?

126
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,838
It's not mozzarella, but it's close.

127
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,939
I have a question.

128
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,772
I buy all kinds of cheese
since I like them.

129
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,561
But often, I forget about them,

130
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,115
and they end up
in the freezer for too long.

131
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,172
- So they get moldy when I take them out.
- Right.

132
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,472
Should I throw them away?

133
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:11,939
- No.
- Can I still eat it?

134
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,372
- Do I just wipe it off?
- It depends on the cheese.

135
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,072
- With mozzarella,
- Yes?

136
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:19,639
when it gets moldy and stinks,

137
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,639
- that's spoiled. You shouldn't eat it.
- Okay.

138
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,672
But the blue mold on gorgonzola cheese
is supposed to be there.

139
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,672
- It's okay to eat.
- Really?

140
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,606
It's beneficial bacteria.

141
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:34,939
It grows during fermentation.

142
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,339
Mozzarella molds easily.

143
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,146
But never eat it. It doesn't taste good.

144
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,839
- He knows so much.
- Tell us more about cheese.

145
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,442
I don't know much about it.

146
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:47,272
(Grouchy Choi is back.)

147
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:49,562
Look at the left.
That building gives off...

148
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:52,059
an old Portuguese vibe, don't you think?

149
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,988
Also, I'm starting to see people
with that vibe.

150
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,065
When you think of Peru,
you imagine guys...

151
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,339
with a traditional wide-brimmed hat
and long braided hair.

152
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,082
I've been spotting people like that.

153
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,472
They're wearing wide skirts and fedoras.

154
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,072
- That's the traditional outfit.
- Right.

155
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:07,394
- The typical Peruvian outfit.
- Yes.

156
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,639
(Fascinating Andean town)

157
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,239
It's incredible.

158
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,613
This place is really cool.

159
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,939
(However)

160
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,039
We're slowly driving uphill...

161
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,772
They keep going up from the highlands.

162
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:21,439
- They're going higher and higher.
- They've been going up.

163
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,690
You just keep going higher.

164
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,159
- Aren't you getting more out of breath?
- Yes.

165
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:28,072
I'm starting to pant.

166
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,472
(They're slowly getting out of breath.)

167
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,772
- I suddenly feel suffocating.
- Yes, I'm out of breath too.

168
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,606
- It's really hard to breathe.
- Yes.

169
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:36,706
It feels like a weight on your chest,

170
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:39,006
and it gets heavier as we go higher.

171
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:41,506
- You feel pressure on your chest.
- Yes, it gets heavier.

172
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,377
I feel this pressure on my chest.

173
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,113
I think this is altitude sickness.

174
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,806
- What?
- What?

175
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:53,247
(Current altitude, 3,607m above sea level)

176
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:54,272
What in the world?

177
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:59,672
(Climbing up
to the final altitude of 3,718m)

178
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:01,139
I think we drove for about two hours.

179
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,006
- It was far.
- Yes.

180
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,306
We kept going for two hours.

181
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,539
(Higher and higher,)

182
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,739
(they keep going up without stopping.)

183
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:11,972
They just keep going.

184
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:14,875
Are we almost there?

185
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,678
We'll be there soon.

186
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,815
They must be cold
and struggling to breathe.

187
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,472
Yes, they all look tired.

188
00:07:23,472 --> 00:07:26,039
- It's going from one extreme to another.
- I know.

189
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,372
(Current altitude above sea level)

190
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:35,339
(Current altitude above sea level
is 3,718m.)

191
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,406
This must be it.

192
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,039
They've arrived.

193
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,372
That's the place?

194
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:42,106
The view is incredible, though.

195
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:44,451
That place is beautiful.

196
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,506
There's even a house on the mountaintop.

197
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,272
- There's a house?
- Really?

198
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,406
- That's the village's name.
- Where?

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,739
- It's "Misminay."
- "Misminay?"

200
00:07:57,672 --> 00:07:59,539
(The third location for the Tasty Mission)

201
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:00,542
Finally.

202
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:04,839
(3,718m above sea level)

203
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,306
(Misminay, the sky-high village)

204
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:08,706
It's "Misminay."

205
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,706
That view is quite something.

206
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,739
Gosh, how magnificent.

207
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:16,939
You can see the clouds.

208
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:18,572
They're right in front of your eyes.

209
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,572
This place is amazing, isn't it?

210
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:24,376
The view is accessible
by simply opening a window.

211
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,172
It's remarkable.

212
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,439
So cute!

213
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:29,072
(It touches the sky.)

214
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,006
It's pretty surreal.

215
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,306
Goodness, it's awesome.

216
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,106
Although I was scammed to work there,

217
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:35,815
I have to admit, the view was amazing.

218
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,406
- There are tons of ingredients.
- What ingredients do they have?

219
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:42,439
- They have a lot of different potatoes.
- Really?

220
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,772
I can't wait to watch this episode.

221
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,806
So, this is the Andes Mountains
I've only heard about.

222
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:48,539
(Welcome to Misminay Village.)

223
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:52,106
The mountain is above the clouds.

224
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,876
I'm really out of breath.

225
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,506
Is it just me?

226
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,139
- I'm also out of breath.
- Right?

227
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,039
Everyone is panting.

228
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,684
- It's so hard to breathe.
- Oh, no.

229
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:08,253
I'm getting out of breath.

230
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,606
(At that moment)

231
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:11,859
- What is it?
- What's going on?

232
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,378
What?

233
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,372
(The villagers found the BOB friends.)

234
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,333
The people who live there...

235
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,706
(They rush off to somewhere.)

236
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,770
What is she doing?

237
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,006
Guests are coming to our village!

238
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,739
(Guests?)

239
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,372
What's going on?

240
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,772
(After tidying up,)

241
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,672
(the villagers gather one by one.)

242
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:38,272
(Take me with you!)

243
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,239
That's so cute.

244
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,815
I'm really out of breath.

245
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:44,406
It's because we're
at high altitudes, right?

246
00:09:44,406 --> 00:09:45,239
I think so.

247
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,639
Someone is standing in a colorful outfit.

248
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,072
What's happening?

249
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:54,406
- That's so cute!
- Hello.

250
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,739
(She's wearing so many colors.)

251
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,063
- I love her outfit.
- She's just lovely.

252
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,632
Her outfit is vibrant.

253
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,633
Hi.

254
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:07,571
- Come in and make yourself at home!
- Sorry?

255
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,907
(Just come in.)

256
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,244
She's welcoming us into her home.

257
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,077
I know that means something.

258
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,981
(Florien, the female chief of Misminay)

259
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:17,881
- Come on.
- Let's go.

260
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:19,616
(Entering Florien's home)

261
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:20,618
Here we come!

262
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:24,955
What a nice garden.

263
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,358
(Welcome to Florien's house.)

264
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,892
What a beautiful house!

265
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,660
The dogs are so cute.

266
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,630
This is my home.

267
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,233
Please make yourself at home here.

268
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,332
- Oh, my!
- My gosh!

269
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,168
Isn't this so much better...

270
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,371
- It's beautiful here!
- than the Amazon?

271
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,679
(What's this sound?)

272
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,281
- What is it?
- Hello!

273
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,415
Hello!

274
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:52,783
What?

275
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:56,353
(Where is this upbeat music coming from?)

276
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:59,389
(Dancing away)

277
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:01,458
Hello!

278
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,197
(Here come the men with magic pipes.)

279
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:07,331
That's adorable!

280
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,967
Is this a welcoming ceremony?

281
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,568
- How fun!
- That's adorable!

282
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,939
This must be their traditional music.

283
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,098
Is this a welcome ceremony?

284
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:18,375
- They're in the back too!
- In the back!

285
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,280
(We're also here!)

286
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:23,981
- Hello!
- Hello.

287
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,416
(A huge welcome to the guests)

288
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,687
We have to hold hands!

289
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:28,886
- Hold hands?
- Yes.

290
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,254
(Confused)

291
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,523
Are we all holding hands?

292
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,660
(Suddenly forming a dance circle)

293
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,797
Is this a dance circle?

294
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,532
This must be their tradition.

295
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,432
Our arms aren't moving together.

296
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,035
- You go opposite ways.
- You're right.

297
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:45,903
- They go up, you go down.
- Right.

298
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,273
(Overjoyed by the surprise welcome)

299
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,272
Hooray!

300
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,410
(This is so much fun!)

301
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:59,049
(Singing in clear and loud voices)

302
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,154
- They're singing in such a high key!
- You're right.

303
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,525
- Misminay!
- Misminay!

304
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,459
- We believe!
- We believe!

305
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,861
(It's not "We believe," but "Misminay.")

306
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,738
- Misminay!
- Misminay!

307
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,197
It's "Misminay!"

308
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,032
- Misminay!
- Misminay!

309
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,034
- The village name!
- Misminay!

310
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,402
(The men play the music,
and the women dance.)

311
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,741
(The villagers are giving
a heartfelt welcome.)

312
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,410
(But they're starting...)

313
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,448
(to run out of breath.)

314
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,484
Am I the only one running out of breath?

315
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,152
- Me too.
- We're not used to this yet!

316
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:38,191
Is it not over yet?

317
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,390
Look at Hyun Seok!

318
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:45,529
(There's a second verse too.)

319
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,866
You're exhausted, but the song won't end!

320
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,801
- I'm out of breath!
- Me too!

321
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,136
- It's so tiring!
- Why is it so tiring?

322
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,473
I'm barely breathing!

323
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,872
Hold on.

324
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,740
Oh, no!

325
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:00,210
The locals aren't running out of breath.

326
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:01,945
They're used to it.

327
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,549
(Their lung capacities are
on another level.)

328
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,483
Please!

329
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,218
How many verses are there?

330
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:09,419
How many more verses?

331
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,888
(Barely breathing
with the endless dancing)

332
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,158
- Is there a spell to end this song?
- There are six verses!

333
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,003
- Oh, gosh.
- Misminay!

334
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:21,131
(A breathtakingly memorable welcome)

335
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,470
(Thank you!)

336
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,205
- Thank you.
- It's hot.

337
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,973
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

338
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,277
- Thank you.
- That was...

339
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:36,479
such a warm welcome!

340
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,316
We've prepared a present for you.

341
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,085
(You've even prepared a gift?)

342
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,790
I thought the outfit looked beautiful!

343
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:50,060
The herringbone tweed jacket
looks stunning.

344
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:50,961
Really?

345
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,496
- It's beautiful!
- We've prepared...

346
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:53,497
our traditional clothing...

347
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,800
- so you can join us.
- It's a skirt!

348
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,267
It suits you!

349
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,336
I love it!

350
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,439
- Thank you.
- It looks so nice.

351
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,173
- Yes, it does.
- It suits you well.

352
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,843
It's so nice to be here
after being in the jungle.

353
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,778
(The hat looks fantastic too.)

354
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,517
Is it a bit too small?

355
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,582
Is it too tight?

356
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,050
(Too tight)

357
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:14,020
Is my head too big?

358
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,921
His head is too big.

359
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:18,889
- It's large.
- Very big.

360
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,958
It's massive.

361
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,827
(Don't worry!)

362
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,931
(He brought an extra-large one.)

363
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,802
- Thank you.
- Is it bigger?

364
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,136
- It's much bigger.
- Nice!

365
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:34,904
- It's so colorful.
- I love the colors.

366
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,241
- Thank you. This...
- It's even prettier!

367
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:39,477
- It looks even better.
- Isn't that a window duster?

368
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,678
- "A duster!"
- "A duster!"

369
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,347
Isn't that a window duster?

370
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,785
(Whipping his duster around)

371
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,086
She's telling us to follow her.

372
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,255
Do you think so?

373
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:53,990
My gosh! Look at them!

374
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,993
What are those?

375
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:58,497
- They're so cute!
- Those are alpacas, right?

376
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,730
Yes, they are.

377
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,531
- Hey!
- Alpacas.

378
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,067
- How cute!
- They're adorable!

379
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:06,403
- They're adorable!
- Oh, my!

380
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:07,704
They're so cute!

381
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,840
- They're fluffy.
- How adorable!

382
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:14,279
- Can we pet them?
- Their teeth look like human teeth.

383
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,579
Yes, they do.

384
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,615
(A proper healing session)

385
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:21,084
They're so people-friendly.

386
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,054
Oh, my!

387
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:24,955
That's adorable.

388
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,623
It's too cute.

389
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,091
(The gentlest animal)

390
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,127
It's so cute.

391
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,433
- All the animals...
- It's huge.

392
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,599
in the Amazon and here seem harmless.

393
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,601
- They're so cute.
- Yes, they are.

394
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,837
They live in a peaceful environment,
so they're not aggressive.

395
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:42,340
(The alpaca lover can't look away.)

396
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,840
Oh, goodness!

397
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,543
(There's another gift waiting for you.)

398
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,710
It's adorable.

399
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,746
What is this? Our meal?

400
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,981
(A table full of welcome food nearby)

401
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:54,117
- The food must be a welcome meal.
- Right.

402
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:55,285
I see empanadas too.

403
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,855
(An organic brunch made
with local Andes specialties)

404
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,156
What are those?

405
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:04,795
- They're tortillas made with cornmeal.
- Cornmeal?

406
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:07,530
Tortillas?

407
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,969
I've never seen such thick tortillas.

408
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,637
(Enjoy your meal!)

409
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,439
- They're like Korean potato pancakes!
- They're...

410
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,608
- like pancakes.
- Yes, they are.

411
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,543
They taste like potato pancakes.

412
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,246
(This is delicious!)

413
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,481
It reminds me of mung bean pancakes.

414
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:27,984
It reminds me of the thing we had earlier.

415
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:29,553
It's good.

416
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,088
It tastes like potato pancakes.

417
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:34,992
- It's delicious.
- Yes.

418
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,094
It's incredible.
It's like potato pancake...

419
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,130
but has a very savory flavor at the end.

420
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,336
It's often made
with vegetables and cornmeal.

421
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,104
(Mix cornmeal from the Andes...)

422
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:50,341
They must be tortillas
as they're made with corn.

423
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,111
(with eggs,)

424
00:16:54,112 --> 00:16:56,647
(and the easiest batter ever is made.)

425
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,650
(Fry the well-mixed batter in oil.)

426
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,451
The recipe is similar to Korean pancakes.

427
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,852
Yes, it's similar.

428
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:05,755
That's why it tastes familiar too.

429
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,427
(Delicious and familiar-looking pancakes)

430
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,394
They're like mung bean pancakes
that are extra fried.

431
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,162
- Yes.
- They look so good!

432
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,330
I bet they're so good.

433
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,735
These are boiled potatoes from the Andes.

434
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:18,635
Potatoes!

435
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,704
- There are so many types of potatoes.
- Yes!

436
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,574
- Potatoes?
- That's where potatoes originate from.

437
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,609
- It spread worldwide from there.
- Really?

438
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,077
They had potatoes before everyone.

439
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,545
- This is the origin.
- Yes, it is.

440
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,548
- Is it boiled?
- Yes.

441
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:32,416
Onion!

442
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,490
It's so good!

443
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:45,462
(Amazed)

444
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:47,898
- It's so good.
- It's incredible.

445
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,535
It's very fluffy, like an Idaho potato.

446
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:53,671
It's crumbly and fluffy
like American potatoes.

447
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:55,541
It's a floury potato.

448
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:56,840
I haven't tried it yet.

449
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,808
- Don't peel it.
- It's so good!

450
00:17:57,809 --> 00:17:58,710
- Keep the peel on.
- The peel?

451
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,910
- Yes, it's better that way.
- It tastes incredible.

452
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,980
(So obedient)

453
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,949
(Potatoes are on another level
in their birthplace.)

454
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,784
- It's good.
- The peel is flavorful.

455
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,922
Is it different from our potatoes?

456
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,956
There are so many varieties,

457
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,224
- and each kind tastes different.
- Yes.

458
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,495
Why does it taste seasoned?

459
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,496
- Just at first.
- Because it's flavorful.

460
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,599
- Did you boil it with salt?
- Do you want some salt?

461
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,568
- No.
- It's fine.

462
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,402
- It's seasoned enough.
- I always need salt.

463
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:27,471
Do you?

464
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,239
I always need salt.

465
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,374
(Salt is...)

466
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:37,347
(like Mother Nature's gift to Hyun Seok.)

467
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,216
I'd appreciate some salt.

468
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,051
- I'd like some too.
- Some salt?

469
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,120
Please give me some salt.

470
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:48,559
- Salt!
- Salt!

471
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:49,692
- Salt?
- Salt.

472
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,028
- It's salt!
- Salt!

473
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,897
- Who needs salt?
- Salt?

474
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,967
(I do.)

475
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,602
- Let's go!
- Do we follow her?

476
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,338
Why?

477
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:08,612
(What is happening?)

478
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,683
(We just asked for some salt.)

479
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,050
- Salt!
- Is she bringing us to the salt?

480
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:15,151
- Where's the salt?
- Come with me.

481
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,887
- Come with me.
- Salt.

482
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,890
(Is the salt at home?)

483
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,526
Where are you going to get salt?

484
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,662
(A long expedition for some salt)

485
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,073
- We're driving there?
- Driving?

486
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,367
- We're driving?
- For salt.

487
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,269
- We're driving to get salt?
- Salt?

488
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,844
- Okay.
- Salt!

489
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:32,872
Where are we going?

490
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,973
(Confused, they get in the car.)

491
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:38,308
Gosh, salt!

492
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,446
(They promised them some salt...)

493
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,447
(but they're hopping in the van.)

494
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,349
I thought...

495
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:49,452
she'd just go home
to get some salt for our potatoes.

496
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,725
We have to drive somewhere to get salt?

497
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,590
That sounds odd.

498
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,428
Are we going to the market?

499
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:57,839
Are we on our way to buy salt?

500
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,063
Are we going to buy salt?

501
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,723
"Gracias."

502
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,566
(Wait. This feels familiar.)

503
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:06,329
Where on earth are we headed?

504
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:11,699
(Three days ago in Lima, Peru)

505
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,549
(They went to an unknown place...)

506
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:20,028
(and found the boat
for catching giant squid.)

507
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,632
(They felt seasick instead of enjoying
delicious cuisine.)

508
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,461
I guess there are
various kinds of salt there.

509
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,590
(I don't feel good about this.)

510
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,830
It's the same van they took
to the giant squid boat.

511
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:35,566
Where are we going?

512
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,465
(Where is the salt expedition headed?)

513
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:41,406
We're practically going all the way down.

514
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,020
Earlier...

515
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:44,848
Look!

516
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:45,733
- What's that?
- What is that?

517
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,245
"Marasal." It's salt.

518
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,120
I can't see it.

519
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:49,882
- What is that?
- It's a salt farm!

520
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,487
(Welcome.)

521
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,389
They said it was a mountain...

522
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,753
We're not getting rock salt.
It's a salt farm.

523
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,490
Is there an ocean in front of them?

524
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,097
(Down the steep hill,)

525
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,404
That's all salt?

526
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:04,979
(they find a giant salt farm.)

527
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:06,397
That's a salt farm?

528
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:09,597
(Salineras de Maras)

529
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,235
- The whole thing is a salt farm.
- That?

530
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,103
(Am I really seeing this?)

531
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,026
I'm so surprised.
I never expected to see a salt farm.

532
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,413
It's so interesting that they have that
at an altitude of 3,000m.

533
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,315
(Salt farm hidden in the Andes)

534
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,292
They have a salt farm in the mountains.

535
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,835
(Salineras, salt farm hidden in the Andes)

536
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:30,755
- How does that exist?
- How?

537
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:33,981
(A wonder of the Inca civilization
preserved for over a thousand years)

538
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:36,961
- It's gigantic.
- It's huge.

539
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:41,933
There was a sea here
100 million years ago?

540
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,003
I was so fascinated that I looked it up.

541
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:47,769
Two lands collided
and uplifted each other.

542
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,008
What was on the ocean floor came up.

543
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,009
Oh, I see.

544
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:58,141
(Every salt pond...)

545
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,111
(is owned by different people.)

546
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:07,762
(The final legacy of the descendants
of the Inca civilization)

547
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,129
This is such a rare view.

548
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:13,865
- I know, right?
- This is incredible.

549
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:15,072
It's so...

550
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:16,953
(An unrealistic view stretches out.)

551
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:18,356
It's wild to see it up close.

552
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:20,048
This is literally a spectacle.

553
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,640
I'd love to see that in person.

554
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,977
I didn't find any inspiration
in the Amazon,

555
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,479
but this place made up for it.

556
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,081
This is the source of inspiration.

557
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,050
Shouldn't you cook something with salt?

558
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:34,434
Okay.

559
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,654
I'll cook you something with salt.

560
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:37,722
- For real?
- For real.

561
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:38,823
I can't wait.

562
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,975
- He sounds far more excited.
- I mean it.

563
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,205
This show is so lucky.

564
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:47,098
- I'll make them a masterpiece.
- Great.

565
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,132
Really?

566
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,869
But I'm going to need a lot of salt.

567
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,024
You get as much salt as you harvest.

568
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,113
- What?
- This much?

569
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,609
- You want us to work?
- I had a feeling you'd make us work.

570
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:00,212
You want us to harvest it?

571
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,182
I suddenly lost all my inspiration.

572
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:05,976
(Why do you think
we drove you all the way here?)

573
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,153
I guess we're going in.

574
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,257
He thought that we'd buy the salt.

575
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:11,085
He was expecting to buy it and leave.

576
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:15,426
I had never imagined
that we'd harvest the salt ourselves.

577
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:17,061
I never saw it coming.

578
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,169
(I knew it wouldn't be so easy.)

579
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,868
Wearing these boots...

580
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,836
reminds me of a bad memory.

581
00:23:26,997 --> 00:23:28,606
We caught giant squid on the first day.

582
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,842
(The second victim of giant squid)

583
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:33,054
(This makes me furious.)

584
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:35,680
I actually tried harvesting salt
in a salt farm,

585
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,014
- You've done it?
- and it was arduous.

586
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:37,864
- It was.
- You've tried it?

587
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:38,883
You have to shovel it...

588
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:43,020
- and sieve it.
- That place uses a different method.

589
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,188
I'll have to wait for it.

590
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,888
How do we do it?
I think they're trying to teach us.

591
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:47,815
What is that?

592
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:49,128
What's that thing?

593
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:50,995
This is a hammer.

594
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,546
- Lift it?
- Yes

595
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:54,213
Okay.

596
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,200
- I'll use the big one. Take it easy.
- Thanks.

597
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:57,802
- It's heavy.
- What is that thing?

598
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:58,769
What's this?

599
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:00,404
- I'm not sure.
- It looks like a cutting board.

600
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,150
- You look like Thor.
- That's a hammer?

601
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,975
Why would they need that?

602
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,644
It's tough to breathe here too.

603
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,570
(Stop being a crybaby. Let's get to work.)

604
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,450
(They never give you a break in Peru.)

605
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,386
They just gave us that thing
and told us to come.

606
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:17,286
(Harvest as much salt as you need.)

607
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,356
It's salt farm labor.

608
00:24:19,154 --> 00:24:20,891
Really? In there?

609
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,127
But this is...

610
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,397
How did they even make this place?

611
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,232
It stayed this way for a thousand years?

612
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,434
There's water flowing.

613
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,837
There really is water.

614
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,372
This must be saltwater.

615
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:37,233
This flows down and goes into the ponds.

616
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,666
(Underground water,
formed by dissolved rock salt,)

617
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,044
This is fascinating.

618
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:41,754
(is directed into each pond
through a network of channels.)

619
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,347
That water is salty.

620
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,316
It's warm due to geothermal heat.

621
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,252
This place is fascinating.

622
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,454
I never knew I'd come to such a place
in my life.

623
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:51,655
I know, right?

624
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,925
I feel like we stepped on a sacred place.

625
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,189
- It certainly felt holy.
- It did.

626
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,867
So, this is all salt, right?

627
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:07,204
But it doesn't look like the type of salt
I'm familiar with.

628
00:25:07,204 --> 00:25:08,474
- Is this filtered?
- It's just soil.

629
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:10,420
It seems hard.

630
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:12,843
How do we extract the salt?

631
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,151
This salt pond is different
from what I know.

632
00:25:15,176 --> 00:25:16,781
- Right?
- It was very different.

633
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,283
But I want to let the viewers know.

634
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,118
That's a privately owned land.

635
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,871
We're only entering that pond
because it's their property.

636
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,157
- That was a private land?
- No tourists can enter.

637
00:25:26,182 --> 00:25:27,079
Really?

638
00:25:27,103 --> 00:25:30,628
- Every pond is owned by different people.
- It is.

639
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:33,664
On another travel show I'm on,
they only appreciated the view from afar.

640
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,356
- Here's my opinion.
- Yes?

641
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,469
We should have also appreciated the view
as tourists and left.

642
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:39,964
Why did we work there?

643
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,064
(It was a rare experience
he didn't ask for.)

644
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:45,410
(Over here.)

645
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,547
(Jesusa, 51 years old,
the owner of this salt pond)

646
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,649
Oh, she's the owner.

647
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,484
Her name is Melissa.

648
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,543
It's like how Koreans manage
their rice paddies.

649
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:59,045
- They have...
- They privately own the ponds.

650
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,458
privately owned salt ponds.

651
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:04,065
(Owned by Melissa and Jesusa respectively)

652
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,097
(Jesusa demonstrates how to harvest salt.)

653
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,498
How do they harvest it?

654
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,667
How do they use the hammer?

655
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,603
(What's the use of this hammer?)

656
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,740
First, we stomp the surface
with the wooden hammer.

657
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,177
Be careful.
You need to use your wrists well.

658
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,046
(Demonstrating)

659
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:22,781
(Smashing)

660
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,543
(She wields that 10kg wooden hammer
with ease.)

661
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,476
(His jaws drop.)

662
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,223
We have to smash it evenly.

663
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,258
It's hard labor.

664
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,664
- It is.
- It's physical work.

665
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:37,027
- It's hard labor.
- Indeed.

666
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,259
(This is a strength exercise.)

667
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:40,965
I guess it's the traditional way.

668
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,933
She's hitting the cracks to close them.

669
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:47,264
Otherwise, water will drain out.

670
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:49,475
You can keep more water
if the surface is firm.

671
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,747
Dr. Salt's...

672
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,702
- Dr. Salt's demonstration.
- lecture on salt ponds.

673
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:57,748
Imagine that this is a ttakji
from "Squid Game."

674
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,089
Do it at the same time.

675
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:01,679
Do it at the same time.

676
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,018
(Perfect)

677
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:06,234
(Satisfied)

678
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:07,084
Bravo.

679
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:09,951
(Very good. Next.)

680
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:11,796
You're better at this than I thought.

681
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,832
He keeps at it when they compliment him.

682
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,771
(Wild Ok Vin is the next challenger.)

683
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,656
- It's too heavy for you.
- Use that one.

684
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,138
That's incredibly heavy, Ok Vin.

685
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:22,356
- You want to try that one?
- That one?

686
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:23,758
- You'll hurt yourself.
- She's no ordinary girl.

687
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,277
- Be careful.
- Ok Vin steps up.

688
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,813
Okay, I see.

689
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,854
(That was a clean hit.)

690
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,263
(You're also good.)

691
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,989
Did you hear that slap?

692
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,558
- Slap!
- She was hired as soon as she did it.

693
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,423
(Two members were hired as flatteners.)

694
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,746
(Follow me.)

695
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,596
What now?

696
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:49,684
(Su Young, who was watching,
is also hired.)

697
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:53,774
(They move to Melissa's salt pond.)

698
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,205
There's a lot of water in this one.

699
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:56,875
What is it?

700
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,619
(Do it like this.)

701
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:01,494
What?

702
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,681
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

703
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,226
(They're doing the twist dance
on the Andes?)

704
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,405
Are we filming "Singing in the Rain?"

705
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,793
Oh, are we breaking these?

706
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:10,331
Break the lumps.

707
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:12,223
Oh, break them?

708
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,992
I thought she wanted me to dance.

709
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:18,403
<i>The unforgettable twist of love</i>

710
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:25,052
(They're rubbing their feet because...)

711
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,469
We were doing that because there was salt
sticking to the bottom.

712
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:30,332
We need to rub it before we harvest it.

713
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:32,586
- You're bringing them up.
- Then, we harvest it.

714
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:35,015
Some ponds have water, while others don't.

715
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,342
(Why is that the only pond with water?)

716
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:40,701
(After they finish the flattening,)

717
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,658
(they fill the pond with brine.)

718
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,234
Yes, that's how you do it.

719
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:49,924
(They gather salt from reduced saltwater.)

720
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:51,902
(Impressed)

721
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:54,064
Do you see that salt? It's so cool, right?

722
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:55,423
(They dry the collected salt
for four days.)

723
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:56,834
It's such a traditional way.

724
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,536
- Those ponds are over 1,000 years old.
- Exactly.

725
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:00,738
Those are some big crystals.

726
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:06,761
(She kindly explains it one more time.)

727
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,916
I'll give you all the salt you harvest.

728
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:16,766
- Goodness.
- Really?

729
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:19,369
I'm jealous.

730
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:20,791
Let's do half each.

731
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,163
- Okay.
- We'll see who gets more.

732
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,816
- Let's split it evenly.
- Okay.

733
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,364
This is the line. Don't cross it.

734
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:31,032
(They begin the Tasty Mission
in groups of two.)

735
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,139
They've formed teams.

736
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,540
- They're the flatteners.
- Yes.

737
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,075
And they're the harvesters.

738
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,111
The flatteners' job seems a bit harder.

739
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,674
(The flatteners work hard
with the hammer.)

740
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,654
(The sound of the wood echoes
like a Buddhist temple.)

741
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:55,259
That must be exhausting.

742
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,394
It has to be.

743
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:05,643
(There's a reason they became so quiet.)

744
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,176
(Serious and strict)

745
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:09,243
Oh, boy.

746
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:10,210
She looks so scary.

747
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,010
She really was.

748
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,776
The Maestra was very strict.

749
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,410
You'll get yelled at if you hit it
at the wrong angle and make holes.

750
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,176
- That's understandable.
- Of course. It's her property.

751
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:20,576
We got scolded a lot.

752
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:23,443
- If you let it drop here,
- Okay.

753
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:25,476
- it won't hurt.
- Just make it flat.

754
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:27,710
- All right.
- I got it.

755
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,076
(Perfect salt starts...)

756
00:30:30,076 --> 00:30:31,743
(with leveling.)

757
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,843
(She's a veteran salt-maker
with 40 years of experience.)

758
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:34,976
She looks so stringent.

759
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:41,443
(Her eyes are especially locked on Choi.)

760
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,610
(Groaning)

761
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,743
(He's already tired after just a few hits
at 3,380m above sea level.)

762
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,810
He must be struggling to breathe. No.

763
00:30:50,543 --> 00:30:51,410
Let's keep going!

764
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,943
Oh, yes.

765
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:57,843
(Did I ever tell you to stop?)

766
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,976
(Panting)

767
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:06,776
It was extremely exhausting.

768
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,310
That's literally physical labor.

769
00:31:09,676 --> 00:31:12,376
(She only keeps her eyes on Choi.)

770
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,110
- Gosh. This is so tiring.
- The mallet was really heavy.

771
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,843
I think it was about 15 or 20kg.

772
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:21,976
(It's unbearable to watch.)

773
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,976
She's seriously intimidating.

774
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,943
(I told you the surface should make
even contact with the ground!)

775
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,376
(Like this! With a full swing!)

776
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,410
Unbelievable!

777
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:34,610
She's good, indeed.

778
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,676
Daniel was supposed
to be doing this, not me.

779
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,576
Look over there!

780
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,776
Their boss is too busy working...

781
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,810
to tell them what to do.

782
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:46,343
I see. Should I gather it?

783
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:48,010
(Team Harvesting is so peaceful
that their background music is different.)

784
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:53,043
Look at how big the smile on her face is.

785
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:54,810
She seems so gentle.

786
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,076
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

787
00:31:57,343 --> 00:31:59,743
(Harvesting salt isn't that hard!)

788
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,343
- Tell me about it.
- After gathering it,

789
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:02,810
- just lift it up.
- Okay.

790
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:04,676
You can harvest a lot at once.

791
00:32:05,243 --> 00:32:06,110
There is a ton of it.

792
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,943
Try it over here.

793
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,710
(They almost look like students
on a field trip.)

794
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,043
- Yes!
- Awesome.

795
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:14,376
- Well done.
- Yes!

796
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:16,676
The other team's mood was
really laid-back.

797
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:18,210
I got a lot of it.

798
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:20,376
It was really interesting.

799
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,110
(We're so happy to work with Melissa.)

800
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,843
(They're at the same salt mine,
but the atmosphere feels different.)

801
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:29,576
(It should've been me, not him.)

802
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:31,176
Look at poor Hyun Seok's face.

803
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,543
We flew thousands of kilometers
to come here and do...

804
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:37,143
All right. I'll get to work.

805
00:32:37,743 --> 00:32:39,810
(Who's chatting and not working?)

806
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,410
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

807
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,276
She said to hurry up.

808
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:43,310
I will, but...

809
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:46,876
We should switch roles after a while...

810
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:48,176
for a more varied experience.

811
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:49,010
I agree.

812
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,876
(All he does is complain.)

813
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:52,843
- She's super scary, right?
- She is.

814
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:56,110
I'm sorry to ask,
but didn't she mistake you...

815
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,610
for her servant?

816
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,776
- A servant from Korea?
- I know!

817
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:03,010
- I think it was a miscommunication.
- I know.

818
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,543
Why else would she be looking
at you like that?

819
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,510
(She's just serious about her work.)

820
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:12,643
- Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.
- In 2, 3.

821
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:16,510
(The strict training officer
relentlessly pushes them.)

822
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,110
- Yes. Keep going.
- Let's go.

823
00:33:21,276 --> 00:33:23,810
It reminds me of my time
at the Army Training Center in Nonsan.

824
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,910
(Meanwhile, athletic ace Ok Vin is...)

825
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,976
Ok Vin hasn't said a word for a while.

826
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,876
It must be exhausting.

827
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,376
It was so tiring...

828
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,343
that all I could do was breathe.

829
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:39,476
Daniel!

830
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:42,743
Daniel! You rascal!

831
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:44,043
Daniel!

832
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:45,143
(Choi is taking it out on Daniel.)

833
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,276
Hyun Seok keeps grumbling over there.

834
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:52,376
Daniel!

835
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:55,043
It was the only way to squeeze out
the rest of my energy.

836
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:56,376
(But...)

837
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:57,276
Daniel.

838
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:00,643
Altitude sickness.

839
00:34:00,643 --> 00:34:03,676
(The altitude sickness worsens
even more due to the hard labor.)

840
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,276
It does look exhausting.

841
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,543
It's harder to breathe
because they're at a high altitude.

842
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:09,710
This is too wearying.

843
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,776
- Daniel!
- Yes?

844
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:15,476
We were supposed to be doing that.
Why are you still doing that?

845
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:17,243
Just go back to your work.

846
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:19,310
Hey, Mr. Choi.

847
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,576
Hyun Seok, I'm busy.
Stop talking to me, please.

848
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,343
Whoever has a knack for the job
should do it.

849
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,876
No, listen to me. This part is...

850
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,576
This work requires a lot of oxygen,

851
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:32,610
- Is that so?
- but my lungs are too weak for it.

852
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,776
I think I should go over there.

853
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:35,443
This is as hard as your work.

854
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:37,210
- This is tiring too.
- We've got a lady here!

855
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,776
She's a better athlete than I am.

856
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,776
They're like people who use
their connections to switch positions...

857
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,076
with others in the military...

858
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:45,876
for their own benefit.

859
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,443
Hyun Seok, please stop complaining!

860
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:49,143
I'm sick of it!

861
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:52,143
You never quit complaining!

862
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,010
- Should we switch if you're too tired?
- Yes, please!

863
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,976
If they keep it up, they might end up
hurting their backs.

864
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,143
- He's so considerate.
- Let's switch.

865
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,510
Let's leave and not look back.

866
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,176
(But he did look back.)

867
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:07,410
Boss.

868
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:10,743
I need a translator!

869
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:12,276
Let's go.

870
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,443
I need a translator.

871
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:14,843
Don't come. Look over there.

872
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:16,576
- Yes. Let's go.
- No.

873
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:17,510
"Look over there."

874
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,243
You don't have to come with us.

875
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,976
It's okay!

876
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:23,143
You should stay there.

877
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:26,810
You have to be my teacher
over there. Stay!

878
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,676
No!

879
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,576
Let's go.

880
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:37,943
(What did I do to you?)

881
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,776
In the end, the whole team moved together.

882
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:41,476
- She followed us.
- Did she?

883
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,676
She'll have you harvest
a mountain of salt, won't she?

884
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,243
Hyun Seok, the complainer,
is unbelievable.

885
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:49,243
I'm glad you finally got that on camera.

886
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:50,976
As soon as they start rolling it,

887
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,743
he acts up and says,
"If you want to fillet it..."

888
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:55,343
(He badmouths Hyun Seok
as soon as they switch positions.)

889
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:59,010
(This isn't that hard.)

890
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,510
This is nothing.

891
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,476
- Like the kettlebell swings at a gym.
- Right.

892
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:05,776
Can you see
if that tall guy is doing it right?

893
00:36:05,776 --> 00:36:06,976
Don't you think it's wrong?

894
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,543
(He tries to snitch on him.)

895
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,243
The tall guy over there.

896
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,010
She said her focus was solely
on her team, not the other one.

897
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,776
(My focus is only on you, boy.)

898
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,376
"All I care about is you, Hyun Seok."

899
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:25,110
(A true teacher is dedicated
to her students.)

900
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,376
It's hilarious.

901
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:28,510
Let's come and work with me.

902
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,710
(No need to resist.)

903
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,610
- They chose the wrong person.
- They did.

904
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,643
(He tries to harvest it
the way she taught him.)

905
00:36:33,643 --> 00:36:34,710
I got this much at once.

906
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,143
Here.

907
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:38,676
- Poquito.
- Poquito!

908
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,610
What does it mean?

909
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,343
- A little.
- A little?

910
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:43,876
(I see.)

911
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:45,910
She didn't like
how little I had harvested.

912
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,610
He really chose the wrong person!

913
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:50,643
It's too little again.
I need to hide it from her.

914
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,810
That's too little. Hurry up.

915
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:55,210
She's really strict!

916
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,610
I think she's only focused
on Hyun Seok's case.

917
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,676
You need to scoop as much
as possible at once.

918
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:01,843
She really is a little scary.

919
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:03,184
I'll show you.

920
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:08,010
Oh, I see. You have to pull it out.

921
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,310
In that way,
you can harvest a bigger amount.

922
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,443
(It's a result of 40 years of experience.)

923
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:11,643
She's different, indeed.

924
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,510
- She's so good at it.
- She's a pro.

925
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,443
You are indeed good at it.

926
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,510
Salute!

927
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,510
That's three times more
than Hyun Seok got.

928
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,510
I got lucky.

929
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,676
Let's keep moving.

930
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,743
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

931
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,210
Hurry up.

932
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,876
- More!
- More!

933
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:29,243
Look over here.

934
00:37:29,243 --> 00:37:31,210
- Aca Tambien.
- Aca Tambien.

935
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,243
(Repeating after her)

936
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,043
It felt like I was back in the military.

937
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:42,076
(Will he finally be freed
from her supervision?)

938
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,810
Keep working! Hurry up!

939
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,243
(Oh, boy.)

940
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,043
(He slacks off
as soon as I loosen my grip.)

941
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,176
You need connections in the military.

942
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:57,743
Technically speaking,
she's younger than you, isn't she?

943
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:58,610
She's younger.

944
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:01,543
She's 51.

945
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:03,476
Age doesn't matter here.

946
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,676
Wait. She really is younger than me.

947
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,643
You're older than her.

948
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,910
I behaved myself, assuming she was older.

949
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,576
But she was younger.

950
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:13,510
(He suddenly comes to a realization.)

951
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,576
Soldiers, you are too slow!

952
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:19,443
(The salt training officer
never goes easy on them.)

953
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:21,443
We should call her
his salt younger sister.

954
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:23,343
- She doesn't look like his sister.
- Younger sister.

955
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:25,110
Jesusa, the younger sister.

956
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:28,010
Who wanted salt for sauce
in the first place?

957
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,076
- Ok Vin sounds angry.
- Wasn't it you?

958
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,743
- No, I mean...
- Wasn't it?

959
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,510
We just made a wrong choice.

960
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,043
Ok Vin is mad.

961
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:40,676
(Meanwhile, Team Leveling is...)

962
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:42,976
They're in sync!

963
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:46,176
(Both the synchronization
and the work are going smoothly.)

964
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:48,910
There were many cracks,
but now it looks like one piece.

965
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,676
It's almost flattened.

966
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:54,376
Take a seat over here and take a break.

967
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:55,710
She told them to take a break.

968
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,676
She told them to take a break?

969
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,310
Did you take a break?

970
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,676
You just met the wrong teacher for you.

971
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:03,476
You'll struggle if you get
the wrong boss in the military.

972
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:05,010
Su Young.

973
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,676
- Yes?
- Su Young.

974
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,310
Santa knows
if you've been naughty or nice.

975
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:15,276
(Here is a naughty kid, crying.)

976
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:17,843
I only need enough to go with my potatoes.

977
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:19,176
"Enough to go with my potatoes."

978
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:20,676
(Shaky hands)

979
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,710
Potatoes...

980
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,576
(They're enjoying self-sufficiency
to the fullest.)

981
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:25,943
We shouldn't have eaten the potatoes.

982
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:28,976
When can we take a break?

983
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:30,176
Hurry up and finish it already!

984
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,143
She has no idea he's older.

985
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,810
It was the most tiring job I did in Peru.

986
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,076
Even more tiring
than fishing the giant squid?

987
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,043
- It was way harder than fishing.
- Oh, really?

988
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:41,976
For real?

989
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:44,143
- It was really exhausting.
- It was.

990
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,410
- Is that the salt?
- Yes.

991
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,610
(They harvested
more than enough for cooking.)

992
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,076
That's so interesting.

993
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:54,310
(As they're about to wrap up the work,)

994
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,710
(Jesusa comes back,
holding something in her arms.)

995
00:39:58,383 --> 00:39:59,083
What's that?

996
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,650
- Thank you.
- How nice of her.

997
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:01,317
Thank you.

998
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,486
(They enjoy eating potatoes as a snack.)

999
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,488
- It'd be so delicious after all the work.
- Yes, with the salt.

1000
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,990
(They craved potatoes
and salt from the Andes.)

1001
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,527
(Sprinkling a few grains of salt
over a potato)

1002
00:40:10,996 --> 00:40:12,930
What do you think you're doing
when I'm right here?

1003
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:16,199
(Getting the salt off it)

1004
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:18,802
Ma'am. I'd like to show you something.

1005
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:20,604
Let me do it too. I'm honored.

1006
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:21,572
I see what he's trying to do.

1007
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,573
Don't you think she'll tell him off?

1008
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:25,476
(Putting all the potatoes together)

1009
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:26,443
He's a chef.

1010
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:29,313
(Sprinkling)

1011
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:30,947
There you go.

1012
00:40:31,382 --> 00:40:32,482
- Just the right amount too.
- She'll tell him off.

1013
00:40:34,018 --> 00:40:35,486
(That's Dr. Salt from Korea.)

1014
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:36,486
Thank you.

1015
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:38,889
I got two grains of salt here.

1016
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,691
It's exactly two grains of salt.

1017
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,125
I can't believe I actually got to see it.

1018
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,828
I've stopped doing that for a while,
but here I go again.

1019
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,563
He has a good wrist snap.

1020
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:49,600
It tastes so good with the salt.

1021
00:40:50,568 --> 00:40:52,602
Hyun Seok, don't you love its texture?

1022
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:54,371
It's natural and like Maldon salt.

1023
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,673
It's flaky and crumbles like Maldon salt.

1024
00:40:56,674 --> 00:40:58,576
Here's what's interesting.

1025
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:00,677
When salt contains a lot of iron,
it makes it bitter.

1026
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:02,145
Rough salt tends to be bitter,

1027
00:41:02,146 --> 00:41:03,413
and it's very salty too.

1028
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:05,682
But this tastes a little sour.

1029
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:06,883
- Really?
- I know.

1030
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:08,118
Maybe that's why,

1031
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,053
but it's not as salty as you'd think.

1032
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:11,555
It's subtle and flavorful.

1033
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,423
- It has a nutty flavor too.
- Right.

1034
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:15,959
I love that we acquired salt
after our hard work.

1035
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,827
I'm proud of us.

1036
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:18,829
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1037
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,331
- Maestra.
- I'd like to try that salt too.

1038
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:25,235
(They get back
with enough of the salt they wanted.)

1039
00:41:25,236 --> 00:41:27,070
I do a lot of research on salt,

1040
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,104
and I've learned a lot.

1041
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:29,740
It was inspiring too.

1042
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,241
I wonder what kind of dish
he'll make today.

1043
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,509
(What will Chef Choi make with the salt?)

1044
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:35,312
- Good work, guys.
- My goodness.

1045
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:36,647
We all worked hard.

1046
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,250
We did a good job.

1047
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:42,486
- That was tough.
- Great work, everyone.

1048
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,121
That was tougher than I thought.

1049
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:47,557
- It was a good workout too.
- I got a workout.

1050
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,259
We almost...

1051
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,662
- reached right before our limit.
- I know, right?

1052
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:54,298
It was quite refreshing.

1053
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:56,833
Look at the clouds descending.

1054
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:01,338
It's chilly out here. It's so cold.

1055
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,007
We spent all the day time harvesting salt.

1056
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:05,509
- Right.
- Tell me about it.

1057
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:06,376
The sun went down.

1058
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:11,180
(Everyone takes time
to regroup in their room.)

1059
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:14,183
It's freezing.

1060
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:17,687
Was it really cold, Ok Vin?

1061
00:42:17,688 --> 00:42:20,058
- Yes, very much.
- It was freezing at night.

1062
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:22,559
- Like early winter. Especially at night.
- Seriously?

1063
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,094
- The high altitude.
- It's high in the mountains.

1064
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,163
(Sighing)

1065
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,765
(Sighing again)

1066
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:30,834
(The aftermath of mining salt)

1067
00:42:30,835 --> 00:42:33,837
Hyun Seok had a hard time
after we got back.

1068
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,708
You can see how old he looks after it,

1069
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:39,576
can't you?

1070
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:40,911
(He looks as though he has aged.)

1071
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:44,280
(I'm out of energy.)

1072
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:45,698
You're going to eat, right?

1073
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,486
Yes. We have to cook a meal, right?

1074
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:49,586
Yes, we do.

1075
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:51,287
Will you cook for us, Su Young?

1076
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,624
- What?
- Will you do it for us?

1077
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,058
I'd like to try the food that you made.

1078
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:57,494
I'd love to cook a nice meal for you too.

1079
00:42:57,495 --> 00:42:58,862
Make braised short ribs for us.

1080
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:02,465
(Laughing)

1081
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:03,299
What is it?

1082
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:04,768
It's so funny...

1083
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,237
that you're asking him to cook
when you're a chef.

1084
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:09,606
It's kind of comical.

1085
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:11,641
Food tastes great
if someone makes it for you.

1086
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:14,143
- Is that true for you too?
- Of course.

1087
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:16,880
Chefs love food made by others.

1088
00:43:16,914 --> 00:43:18,314
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1089
00:43:18,316 --> 00:43:19,283
I didn't know that.

1090
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:21,918
- If I make it...
- Don't you cook at home?

1091
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,254
I hardly can.

1092
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:25,823
(the food cooked by someone else
tastes best.)

1093
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,191
- I guess that comes from your job.
- Right.

1094
00:43:28,426 --> 00:43:29,626
Hyun Seok wants me to cook.

1095
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,465
Chef Choi has been cooking
for the last two days.

1096
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:37,233
- So, today...
- They're taking turns.

1097
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:39,569
Today's chef is Su Young.

1098
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,340
(He enters the kitchen right away.)

1099
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:45,976
That's the kitchen
used by the locals there.

1100
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,045
They have a nice kitchen,
although it's in the mountains.

1101
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:50,313
I can see that.

1102
00:43:50,848 --> 00:43:52,515
I have to cook something to eat now.

1103
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:56,820
We will need rice, no matter what.

1104
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:58,555
- Chef Ryu?
- Yes?

1105
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,457
What are you making for dinner?

1106
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:02,792
What are you craving, Hyun Seok?

1107
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:04,494
It's cold here, so...

1108
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,629
- Soup?
- Soup with noodles.

1109
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,731
- Noodles, not rice soup?
- Yes, noodles.

1110
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,033
Sure. If that's what you want.

1111
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:12,169
Noodles that will calm down my stomach.

1112
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:15,605
So, you're the one
who wanted to have noodles.

1113
00:44:16,207 --> 00:44:17,575
(Then noodles will be their dinner.)

1114
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,642
Your eyes are sparkling,
thinking about noodles.

1115
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,679
I'll try my best.
It'll take a little over an hour.

1116
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:23,913
Okay, then.

1117
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:25,515
- You can look forward to it.
- All right.

1118
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:26,816
It'll be game over with laver on top.

1119
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:28,317
Oh, hello.

1120
00:44:30,221 --> 00:44:32,556
(What is she trying to say?)

1121
00:44:33,157 --> 00:44:33,890
I can see something.

1122
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:35,658
Let's go and check it out.

1123
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,694
- My goodness.
- What is that?

1124
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:38,828
(Amazed)

1125
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,177
Thank you.

1126
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,746
- This is so heavy. Hold on.
- What's that?

1127
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,814
I'll have to check it out
and see how I'll use it.

1128
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,050
Thank you so much.

1129
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:48,853
(A chunk of meat is given to them
as a gift.)

1130
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:49,819
What is this?

1131
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,790
What meat could it be?

1132
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,629
(It's alpaca,
the animal in the mission card.)

1133
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,500
- Is it really an alpaca?
- It looks like it.

1134
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,004
Alpaca is a source of meat
over there, right?

1135
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,105
Yes, it's a food source.

1136
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,341
You know how they raise sheep
in the highlands?

1137
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,842
It's like that.

1138
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,445
(The alpaca is a valuable treasure
that gives its all.)

1139
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,546
You can use the fur and have its meat too.

1140
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,249
- It's livestock.
- Yes, it is.

1141
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,218
(Alpaca meat is rich in protein
and has little fat.)

1142
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:26,255
- They have so many food ingredients.
- There's such a variety.

1143
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,958
They don't catch it every day.

1144
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,361
They only have it
for important events or holidays.

1145
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,727
Or when they have important guests over.

1146
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,863
(This is delicious.)

1147
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,666
This is rib finger meat.

1148
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,736
Rib finger meat looks nice.
Here's the skirt meat.

1149
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,994
(It's new even for Chef Choi
with 30 years of experience.)

1150
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,975
I'll make some noodles
and top it with garnish...

1151
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,210
to be Korean-style noodles.

1152
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,847
(Now that we have alpaca meat...)

1153
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:51,147
Meat noodles.

1154
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,216
You're a good cook.

1155
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,818
I'll try to make it like Andong noodles.

1156
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,687
I think one leg will be enough.

1157
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,422
- The leg?
- Yes, just one of them.

1158
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,590
- Shank meat?
- Yes, the shank.

1159
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,891
Shank is good for making soup with too.

1160
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,259
I'll use the whole thing.

1161
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,896
The parts that are used to make soup...

1162
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:07,263
taste much better in a soup.

1163
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,198
Should I debone it this way?

1164
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,366
You know how to do it, right?

1165
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,268
Go along the joint and cut it.

1166
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,070
- Can you show it to me?
- Shall I?

1167
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,171
Show me how it's done.

1168
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,340
- Okay.
- Shouldn't you start from here?

1169
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,441
You have to cut it from the inside.

1170
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,642
That's really cool.

1171
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,045
When you debone any kind of meat,

1172
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,981
- you'll see the joints.
- That's right.

1173
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,217
- Put the knife around it.
- Just around the cartilage?

1174
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,117
And...

1175
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,886
- Here's the cartilage.
- Yes.

1176
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,087
You have to go around it.

1177
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,756
(He separated the leg just clean.)

1178
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,790
There it is.

1179
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,393
- Do the same here too.
- Master.

1180
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,560
So...

1181
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,962
can you also debone
other kinds of livestock...

1182
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,298
- if you know the principle?
- They all have bones.

1183
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,766
Just think that the knife
goes through the flesh...

1184
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,935
that is next to the bone.

1185
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,538
It's much easier
if you cut close to the cartilage.

1186
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,439
Oh, the cartilage.

1187
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,640
That's so cool.

1188
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,742
Like this.

1189
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,011
(After deboning one of the legs)

1190
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:55,879
- That's amazing.
- All right.

1191
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,913
I think this will be enough for dinner.

1192
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,115
Right.

1193
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,419
I'll try my best.
It'll take a little over an hour.

1194
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,555
It's so cool that he can do that.

1195
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,091
(Serious)

1196
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,426
(Sharpening)

1197
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,127
(Sharpening)

1198
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,031
I should keep the juice
and remove the odor too.

1199
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,099
(He preps the alpaca meat.)

1200
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,934
(He debones the meat
to be used for broth.)

1201
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,404
- The tendon is tough.
- He's deboning it, right?

1202
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:23,639
(Cutting it delicately)

1203
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,573
All right.

1204
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,610
Here's the center heel. Look at the size.

1205
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:30,113
(He's done separating the center heel.)

1206
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,948
I'll keep this here...

1207
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,349
and cut the tendon.

1208
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,952
- If I boil it...
- Who is it?

1209
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,622
(Approaching him)

1210
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,260
It could be a new sight for them.

1211
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,563
- When they catch it,
- The whole thing.

1212
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:47,630
they usually boil the whole thing...

1213
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,432
and have random cuts of it.

1214
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,733
Is that so?

1215
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,769
(There's another customer.)

1216
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,308
(That's a new way of doing it.)

1217
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,077
(He holds the center heel
that's been prepped...)

1218
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,547
(carefully in his arms.)

1219
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,150
(He's off to the high-powered burner...)

1220
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,953
(to boil the broth for meat noodles.)

1221
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:12,555
The water is boiling.

1222
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,858
(Alpaca shank that's been prepped)

1223
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:16,959
Let me put it in there.

1224
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,194
That's hot.

1225
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,266
(The center heel that will add flavor
to the soup)

1226
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,501
I'll have to keep watching it.

1227
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,339
I wonder what alpaca meat is like.

1228
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,539
- Right. I have no idea.
- The meat.

1229
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,441
- Does it taste like mutton?
- I'm curious.

1230
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,676
This is fun. Kalguksu is a good choice.

1231
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,879
Kalguksu will be delicious late at night.

1232
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,415
(He drops a bag on a neat table.)

1233
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,651
I hope the noodles turn out well.

1234
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,055
Noodle chefs will laugh at this.

1235
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:46,923
What is he making?

1236
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,460
(Chef Ryu never uses noodles
that have been manufactured.)

1237
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,127
- He'll make it here.
- Hand-pulled noodles?

1238
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,229
- Yes.
- I wasn't expecting that.

1239
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,098
That's unbelievable.

1240
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,835
(He's making hand-pulled noodles
at 3,718m above sea level.)

1241
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,504
(Making the noodles with his own hands)

1242
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,872
This is all for kalguksu.

1243
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,276
The noodles have to be firm.

1244
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,878
That's a crucial step.

1245
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,547
Adding bits of water
over flour that's been sifted.

1246
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,215
(Mixing it)

1247
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,216
That way, it'll become chewy.

1248
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,652
(He keeps mixing it.)

1249
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,389
(Hand-pulled noodles are
all about the effort.)

1250
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,560
(After mixing it dozens of times)

1251
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:27,496
There it is.

1252
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:28,998
That's amazing.

1253
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,333
(The fine flour is turning into a dough.)

1254
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,936
(What is he doing by himself?)

1255
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,438
Let me help you.

1256
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,407
- I'm making noodles.
- Tell me if you need anything.

1257
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,308
I need some salt.

1258
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,344
- Should I bring salt?
- Well...

1259
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:43,312
- The salt that we got is over there.
- Okay.

1260
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,514
Can you grind the salt finely
with the stone mill over there?

1261
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,283
I'm on it.

1262
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,351
(I'm counting on you, General Ok Vin.)

1263
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,587
When you make noodles,

1264
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,755
you need the right amount of salt
to make them chewy.

1265
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,157
(Rustling)

1266
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,759
(Rustling)

1267
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,364
(What's this sound?)

1268
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,800
You're awesome, Ok Vin.

1269
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,070
(Coming up with a sack of salt
on her shoulder)

1270
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,920
You're amazing.

1271
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:08,983
(Smirking)

1272
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,466
It's Ok Vin, after all.

1273
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,410
(She puts the salt sack down...)

1274
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,746
(and sits in front of a stone mill.)

1275
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,517
(Let's make it into fine salt.)

1276
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,355
(Pouring the salt they earned
after hardworking)

1277
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,391
Where did she even get a stone like that?

1278
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,951
That's the millstone the locals use.

1279
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:30,427
It really is an ancient civilization.

1280
00:50:30,452 --> 00:50:32,596
(With the local tool she earned,)

1281
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:35,632
(she's pressing as hard as she can.)

1282
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,059
It works like a charm.

1283
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,294
- Ok Vin also has skills.
- It's so cool.

1284
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:41,405
The finer it is, the better for me.

1285
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:44,072
(Transforming them into fine salt)

1286
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:45,042
It became fine salt.

1287
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:46,310
Can I check?

1288
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,020
- Hey, this is remarkable.
- Is it okay?

1289
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,213
Thank you so much.

1290
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:50,914
I'll put it in this bowl.

1291
00:50:50,939 --> 00:50:52,403
(Fine salt is ready in an instant.)

1292
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:55,419
She's amazing.

1293
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:57,992
(Shall I sprinkle some salt?)

1294
00:50:58,886 --> 00:50:59,523
(Sprinkling)

1295
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,892
You did a great job with the salt.

1296
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:03,861
It's perfect.

1297
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,197
- It's perfect.
- These two have great teamwork.

1298
00:51:07,222 --> 00:51:08,496
(He sprinkles the salt ground by Ok Vin.)

1299
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,735
(It's time to knead.)

1300
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,606
(Making noodles with all his might
at a high altitude)

1301
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:16,974
As you knead it...

1302
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:21,011
- We call it a baby bum texture in baking.
- Yes.

1303
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,380
That moment comes very dramatically.

1304
00:51:24,107 --> 00:51:25,348
And it makes you feel good.

1305
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,553
(For that moment,)

1306
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,889
(he kneads again and again.)

1307
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,057
There we go. It's getting softer.

1308
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,594
(As he keeps kneading...)

1309
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,519
Now, it has become like a baby's bum.

1310
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,466
Do you want to give it a poke?

1311
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,701
Poke this part slightly.

1312
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:46,903
It's become soft, right?

1313
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:48,405
- Doesn't it feel good?
- It does.

1314
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:50,908
- All that rough texture is gone.
- Yes, it's all gone.

1315
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:55,396
Let's roll it out.

1316
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,283
(He brings the wooden roller.)

1317
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,935
There was no rolling pin,
so I pulled it out from an axe.

1318
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,283
- That's an axe haft?
- Yes, I pulled it out.

1319
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:05,189
- You got that from an axe?
- That's something.

1320
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:06,356
- I couldn't find one.
- It would've been...

1321
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,425
much easier
if you had just made rice soup.

1322
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,224
But Hyun Seok wanted noodles.

1323
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:12,066
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you wanted to have noodles?

1324
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:15,065
All the hardship we went through
began from my tongue.

1325
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:18,269
- That noodles were...
- But that is actually true.

1326
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:20,453
(The troublemaker of PERU BOB, Chef Choi)

1327
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,307
(The arduous noodle-making starts.)

1328
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,844
It's too thick.

1329
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:28,112
(First off, roll out the dough.)

1330
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,413
Su Young is incredible.

1331
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:35,085
(Flattening out with maximum power
until it gets thin)

1332
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:40,724
(Rolling...)

1333
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,659
(and rolling out again)

1334
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,963
This is going to be hard.

1335
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,696
It really doesn't get rolled out.

1336
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,740
The roller was a bit too small.

1337
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,754
He's just amazing.
How does he pull that off there?

1338
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:56,816
(With Chef Ryu's touch,)

1339
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,380
(the dough has been rolled out thinly
like a sheet of paper.)

1340
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:02,012
That's incredible.

1341
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,798
(Satisfied)

1342
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:11,622
(He folds the thin dough once...)

1343
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,257
(and twice.)

1344
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,079
Look at that.

1345
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,658
He did a fine job.

1346
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:23,067
(He folds it nicely
and has it ready for cutting.)

1347
00:53:23,092 --> 00:53:24,190
He's crazy.

1348
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,354
(The next step)

1349
00:53:27,379 --> 00:53:29,385
(Cutting the handmade noodles)

1350
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:33,354
(Wielding the knife with a resolute face)

1351
00:53:33,354 --> 00:53:34,594
He looks cool.

1352
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:42,703
(Each stroke is made carefully.)

1353
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:46,723
- How is that possible?
- So that's how he did it.

1354
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:48,897
- Just look at that.
- That thickness!

1355
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:50,303
They're cut into even slices.

1356
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:51,919
(He cuts them into even slices
without hesitation.)

1357
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,302
You guys can do it too.
It's not that hard.

1358
00:53:54,302 --> 00:53:55,346
It just takes time.

1359
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:56,804
Not anyone can do that.

1360
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:58,039
You're awesome.

1361
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:00,408
It's just that I enjoy
making handmade noodles.

1362
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:02,005
(The master's knife works like a machine.)

1363
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:05,413
(Sprinkling corn powder)

1364
00:54:05,413 --> 00:54:07,451
You need to use a good amount of flour.

1365
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:08,633
More than you think.

1366
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:10,784
- Do you?
- But I used corn powder there.

1367
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:15,323
- That looks like udon noodles.
- He managed to make them.

1368
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:17,208
They look like machine-made udon noodles.

1369
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:18,289
(The noodles start to take shape.)

1370
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:24,098
Noodles are made well.

1371
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:27,679
(The handmade noodles are complete.)

1372
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:28,703
That's just amazing.

1373
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,770
The noodles came out nicely.

1374
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,440
Amazing.

1375
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:35,610
- That was remarkable.
- I automatically applauded.

1376
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:38,572
- What?
- What's he doing?

1377
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:43,151
(Meanwhile, Hyun Seok is taking a break
in his room.)

1378
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,210
Hyun Seok did seem exhausted
when we returned.

1379
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:48,682
It was too hot. We sweat too much.

1380
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,596
Look at his face. He looks much older.

1381
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:52,697
Do you see that?

1382
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:53,891
(The aftermath of the salt mine
lasts long.)

1383
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:58,296
(Thanks to it,
Choi is free from cooking duty.)

1384
00:54:58,321 --> 00:54:59,200
(Humming)

1385
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:04,269
(Free from work, he starts singing.)

1386
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:06,571
(Checking his looks)

1387
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:09,894
(I should go have a relaxing time.)

1388
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:13,214
(Before the hot bonfire,)

1389
00:55:13,214 --> 00:55:14,516
(he gets ready for fire gazing.)

1390
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:15,683
He must've been really tired.

1391
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:20,254
We need to boil water
in the biggest pot we have.

1392
00:55:20,254 --> 00:55:22,089
- Boil it hard?
- Yes.

1393
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:23,353
(Struggling)

1394
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:26,243
(What about my relaxing time?)

1395
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:29,463
Still, he goes to help.

1396
00:55:29,488 --> 00:55:31,732
(In the end, he goes to get water.)

1397
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:33,985
(Meanwhile, what is Ok Vin doing?)

1398
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,002
What is she doing?

1399
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,937
(Frying eggs for garnish)

1400
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:37,902
Oh, the egg garnish.

1401
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,184
She even made
yellow and white garnish separately.

1402
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,693
She separated the white and yolk...

1403
00:55:43,311 --> 00:55:44,412
and fried them each.

1404
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,982
Goodness, it's not leveled.

1405
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:52,053
I wanted to make them thin.

1406
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:55,608
- It's all right.
- But it's turning into thick fried white.

1407
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:56,757
It doesn't matter.

1408
00:55:57,295 --> 00:55:59,226
It's pretty enough. Just don't burn it.

1409
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:00,127
Okay.

1410
00:56:01,362 --> 00:56:02,396
How is it going?

1411
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,964
The noodles?

1412
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,866
Wait. That's not right.

1413
00:56:06,544 --> 00:56:08,794
(While coming back with water)

1414
00:56:09,427 --> 00:56:11,906
- That part is going to be really thick.
- Yes.

1415
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:13,164
- But it has to be thin.
- Right.

1416
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,014
Just a second.

1417
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:17,601
I'll teach you how to make it neat like
the ones on "Korean Food War."

1418
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:18,479
Okay.

1419
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,805
I'll toss the oil here...

1420
00:56:19,996 --> 00:56:21,148
I wonder how he'll make it.

1421
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,346
(Focused)

1422
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,115
(He puts his soul
into a sheet of fried egg.)

1423
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:25,720
He sure does it differently.

1424
00:56:27,604 --> 00:56:28,896
There's too much oil.

1425
00:56:30,108 --> 00:56:31,715
You need only a small amount of oil...

1426
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,745
to make thin strips.

1427
00:56:33,745 --> 00:56:35,417
- So, not too much oil.
- Yes.

1428
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,327
It looks like the oil is wiped, right?

1429
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,500
But this is actually in perfect state.

1430
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:42,982
You can put this here facing up.

1431
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,338
Go ahead. You can cook it now.

1432
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:49,400
(The book way
of making the Korean egg garnish)

1433
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:54,919
(Following the way the master taught her,)

1434
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,550
(she puts her soul into the egg wash.)

1435
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:04,622
(The master said,
"Add just a bit of oil.")

1436
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:07,775
Scrape it slowly from the edge.

1437
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,160
(Master Choi guides her...)

1438
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,397
(to make the perfect egg garnish.)

1439
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,238
It's stuck.

1440
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:19,926
(It's stuck?)

1441
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:20,975
Excuse me?

1442
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,591
(It's scorched
and stuck right onto the pan.)

1443
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:29,894
(But that's not possible!)

1444
00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:31,452
It's all scorched.

1445
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:33,621
I wasn't much help, I see.

1446
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:34,755
I'll scrape it off.

1447
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:36,960
It's stuck.

1448
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,723
(I guess it's my turn to step up.)

1449
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,489
(Eventually, the master takes it himself.)

1450
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,133
I think we need more oil, maybe?

1451
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,903
Ok Vin is so doubtful.

1452
00:57:49,482 --> 00:57:52,540
She's saying it needs more oil.

1453
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,905
Don't we?

1454
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,075
This should be...

1455
00:57:55,099 --> 00:57:56,661
(No more doubts)

1456
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:59,380
(It's me, Chef Choi Hyun Seok.)

1457
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:01,182
I can scrape it off.

1458
00:58:02,383 --> 00:58:02,946
(Scraping)

1459
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:07,217
Oh, the pan...

1460
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:09,722
is not coated well.

1461
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,499
(Messy)

1462
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:13,304
- What?
- What is that?

1463
00:58:13,976 --> 00:58:16,542
- What a mess.
- That's just nonsense, isn't it?

1464
00:58:17,091 --> 00:58:20,251
(The biggest crisis in his career)

1465
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:22,220
I ruined Ok Vin's egg garnish.

1466
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,133
Hyun Seok.

1467
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,432
Did you not oil the pan?

1468
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:26,290
- I did, but...
- He wiped it all off.

1469
00:58:26,315 --> 00:58:28,693
I told you to leave them alone
when they're cooking.

1470
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:30,845
Too many cooks spoil the broth, you know.

1471
00:58:31,576 --> 00:58:35,049
- You should've left her alone.
- She was doing just fine.

1472
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,218
- Just let her do it.
- What is the matter with you?

1473
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:39,537
- You need to keep your nose out.
- Why can't you let her cook?

1474
00:58:39,537 --> 00:58:42,920
- She's not your employee.
- She cooks a lot at her home.

1475
00:58:43,756 --> 00:58:46,290
(He just keeps scraping it off.)

1476
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:49,084
This isn't the only problem.
Ok Vin, you can handle this.

1477
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,589
Stop that and follow me.
I need you for something. It's urgent.

1478
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:53,686
- It's very important.
- I'm sorry.

1479
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,035
(Arresting for damaging the egg garnish)

1480
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:56,620
- Come on. Get up.
- Oh, man...

1481
00:58:57,355 --> 00:58:59,003
Watch out for the eggs. Don't kick them.

1482
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:05,776
An old fart like me should retire at once!

1483
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:08,993
(His help was for nothing.)

1484
00:59:08,993 --> 00:59:09,984
"Retire?"

1485
00:59:10,268 --> 00:59:11,785
(You're busted, Choi.)

1486
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:12,561
That's hilarious.

1487
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:14,021
I get it, so follow me.

1488
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:15,449
Sorry.

1489
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,626
It got scorched
because there wasn't enough oil.

1490
00:59:21,138 --> 00:59:22,530
But the non-stick coat is...

1491
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,001
That pan is too poor.

1492
00:59:25,056 --> 00:59:26,448
He's blaming the pan now.

1493
00:59:27,754 --> 00:59:30,314
(Thanks for arresting him, my friend.)

1494
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:32,724
- But where has Daniel...
- Where has he been?

1495
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:34,508
- Were you sleeping?
- Where were you?

1496
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:35,412
I was...

1497
00:59:35,553 --> 00:59:37,444
- What was I doing?
- You should tell us yourself.

1498
00:59:37,444 --> 00:59:38,949
- I don't remember.
- You're not seen much.

1499
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,381
- You need to tell us.
- I can't remember.

1500
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:41,778
I'm sorry to tell you this,

1501
00:59:41,802 --> 00:59:43,751
but the alpaca scene is
much longer than yous.

1502
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:47,476
- Gosh, that's strange.
- Please be generous...

1503
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,323
and air more footage of him.

1504
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:50,414
(We're looking for Daniel.)

1505
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:52,927
- That's no egg garnish.
- I got it.

1506
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:53,794
There we go.

1507
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,088
(Quickly removing the mess)

1508
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,863
(Greasing the pan again
after Hyun Seok has wiped it)

1509
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:01,514
You're good!

1510
01:00:02,314 --> 01:00:05,114
Use the whole mix and make it thick.

1511
01:00:05,114 --> 01:00:06,314
Slightly thicker.

1512
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:09,881
Ok Vin is doing better.

1513
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:11,414
She's so much better!

1514
01:00:11,414 --> 01:00:13,081
(Carefully frying it)

1515
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,381
(Nudging the flipper under)

1516
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:17,414
(Succeeding at it so easily)

1517
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:18,648
Oddly enough,

1518
01:00:19,448 --> 01:00:21,848
I seem to do better
without Hyun Seok around.

1519
01:00:23,114 --> 01:00:24,648
I seem to do better
without Hyun Seok around.

1520
01:00:25,948 --> 01:00:26,814
Nice!

1521
01:00:26,814 --> 01:00:29,581
Ok Vin is better at frying eggs!

1522
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:31,714
She's so much better!

1523
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:34,514
Ok Vin beat Hyun Seok at frying eggs.

1524
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:36,914
(Meanwhile, Hyun Seok is arrested...)

1525
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:39,281
(and called to the kitchen.)

1526
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:42,848
(Screaming in pain)

1527
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:44,441
(Bumping his head)

1528
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:48,314
(Chef Choi's unlucky day)

1529
01:00:48,814 --> 01:00:54,948
That's karma for you!

1530
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:56,981
I forgot to close the lid.

1531
01:00:56,981 --> 01:00:58,981
I ruined it because I forgot it.

1532
01:00:58,981 --> 01:00:59,881
What is it?

1533
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:02,581
- Didn't you make the rice?
- What is that?

1534
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,781
I'll soak some rice, just in case.
We have to eat, after all.

1535
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:09,681
(He prepared rice to go with the soup.)

1536
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,081
- You're making rice too?
- As a side.

1537
01:01:12,848 --> 01:01:16,481
(Upon Su Young's request,
he turns the gas stove.)

1538
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:17,848
We need to close the lid.

1539
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:20,160
We were supposed to cover it with a lid.

1540
01:01:21,414 --> 01:01:24,281
(Ok Vin came right then for some napkins.)

1541
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,217
(He just handed her the napkins...)

1542
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:28,957
(and left without putting the lid on.)

1543
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:31,914
- Now, I see what happened.
- I get it!

1544
01:01:31,914 --> 01:01:34,548
- He looked at it!
- He definitely did!

1545
01:01:34,548 --> 01:01:35,581
That was what happened.

1546
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:37,548
- I get it now.
- He just left!

1547
01:01:37,548 --> 01:01:42,348
What would've happened
had one of your employees done this...

1548
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:43,514
at your restaurant?

1549
01:01:43,514 --> 01:01:45,814
He even forgets garlic
in his vongole pasta!

1550
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:49,414
Garlic!

1551
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,148
He forgot garlic on "Culinary Class Wars"
and the lid here!

1552
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:53,643
My restaurant would have to close down.

1553
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,014
That's hilarious.

1554
01:01:59,614 --> 01:02:01,514
I ruined it because I forgot it.

1555
01:02:01,514 --> 01:02:02,514
What is it?

1556
01:02:02,914 --> 01:02:04,648
Didn't you make the rice?

1557
01:02:04,648 --> 01:02:05,948
I...

1558
01:02:06,448 --> 01:02:07,848
You did it!

1559
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:09,993
I'm not good at making rice.

1560
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:11,781
(A chef isn't supposed to say that!)

1561
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,214
The rice must be undercooked.

1562
01:02:13,781 --> 01:02:14,848
We just need to let it rest.

1563
01:02:17,014 --> 01:02:18,048
It's cooked.

1564
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:20,014
What should I do?

1565
01:02:21,281 --> 01:02:23,448
It's too fluffy.

1566
01:02:26,248 --> 01:02:28,448
(Trying a spoonful first)

1567
01:02:28,472 --> 01:02:29,446
(Hollow laugh)

1568
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,081
(Laughing in shock)

1569
01:02:33,381 --> 01:02:34,714
(Offering a spoonful)

1570
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,648
(I can't enjoy such a delicacy alone!)

1571
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:41,381
(Trying not to laugh
at the thought of him trying it)

1572
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,448
- Try some.
- There's no olive oil. Just cooking oil.

1573
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:46,048
You're offering him some because it's bad.

1574
01:02:46,048 --> 01:02:48,881
(Tasting it first)

1575
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,948
What have you done to the rice?

1576
01:02:52,014 --> 01:02:54,648
It was a total flop.

1577
01:02:54,648 --> 01:02:56,648
The grains weren't cooked at all.

1578
01:02:57,981 --> 01:02:59,414
- That was...
- It was inedible.

1579
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:02,248
What have you done to the rice?

1580
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:04,048
- I'll save it. Just wait.
- You're adding oil?

1581
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:06,148
He's suddenly adding olive oil
to the rice.

1582
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,414
I'm serious.

1583
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:09,814
It's terrible.

1584
01:03:09,814 --> 01:03:11,248
I'll save it.

1585
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:14,048
Can it be saved?

1586
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:15,681
- I'll try.
- It's so bad!

1587
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:18,579
The grains are completely uncooked...

1588
01:03:19,512 --> 01:03:21,246
and stuck to the pot.

1589
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:24,879
Can you keep it down?

1590
01:03:25,779 --> 01:03:26,469
(Sighing)

1591
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:28,746
(Stirring the rice he's trying to save)

1592
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:31,975
(Trying a spoonful...)

1593
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:33,522
(Hollow laugh)

1594
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:37,012
(and putting the lid back on)

1595
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:38,246
Oh, no.

1596
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,116
You can only perform CPR on someone...

1597
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:42,412
when the heart is still beating.

1598
01:03:42,712 --> 01:03:44,212
- But...
- It was already dead, right?

1599
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:45,255
it was already game over.

1600
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:47,912
(Rest in peace, rice.)

1601
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:49,446
That's dog food now, then.

1602
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:51,079
- Not even dogs would eat that.
- No?

1603
01:03:51,979 --> 01:03:54,079
You have no idea
how picky they are with food.

1604
01:03:55,146 --> 01:03:57,912
(We only have
the hand-pulled noodles to count on.)

1605
01:03:59,312 --> 01:04:01,412
I just have to boil them right.

1606
01:04:01,812 --> 01:04:02,979
Boiling noodles is fun.

1607
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:07,712
The noodles stick to the pot
if you don't stir them constantly, right?

1608
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:09,679
Yes, but freshly-pulled noodles snap off
if you stir them too much.

1609
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,612
Is that so?

1610
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:14,279
(Here comes the broth
that's been boiling forever!)

1611
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:16,712
There's no fat.

1612
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:17,946
- We skimmed it off, but...
- I know.

1613
01:04:18,846 --> 01:04:20,212
The broth looks perfect.

1614
01:04:20,212 --> 01:04:21,146
- Right?
- It was a success.

1615
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:23,379
It looks so tasty.

1616
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:29,046
(He's taking out some juicy meat.)

1617
01:04:29,046 --> 01:04:30,679
- That looks so good!
- For sure.

1618
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:33,679
It looks incredible.
I wonder how it tastes.

1619
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:34,846
Is that meat?

1620
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:37,212
It's so tender. I bet it's not even tough.

1621
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:38,912
It's so tender that I can just tear it.

1622
01:04:40,646 --> 01:04:42,012
That looks scrumptious!

1623
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,646
It looks incredible!

1624
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:47,346
(Boiled alpaca shank)

1625
01:04:47,779 --> 01:04:50,846
(Time to slice the juicy boiled shank)

1626
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:54,212
It has the same color as beef.

1627
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:58,312
It tastes like high-quality beef
in beef soup.

1628
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:00,346
(Juice oozing out with every slice)

1629
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:02,346
It looks so tender.

1630
01:05:02,346 --> 01:05:04,846
See how the juice is oozing...

1631
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:06,146
- from every slice?
- Yes, it's not dry.

1632
01:05:06,146 --> 01:05:07,812
Not at all. I was astounded.

1633
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:10,879
- It slices away so smoothly.
- Thin slices taste better.

1634
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:13,012
- Yes, it's more tender that way.
- Indeed.

1635
01:05:14,112 --> 01:05:15,412
(Adding the garnish to the top)

1636
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,412
How can you make such a dish in Peru?

1637
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:19,546
That's wild!

1638
01:05:20,646 --> 01:05:21,846
(And the cherry on top)

1639
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:23,246
It's been boiled once...

1640
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:25,046
- and washed in cold water.
- I'd love to try it!

1641
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,479
- Me too!
- It looks great.

1642
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:28,046
The soup was terrific.

1643
01:05:28,046 --> 01:05:29,012
I remember that!

1644
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,812
That looks unbelievable.

1645
01:05:30,812 --> 01:05:31,979
(Alpaca kalguksu)

1646
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:33,912
That was amazing.

1647
01:05:33,912 --> 01:05:36,079
I wonder how it tastes.

1648
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,412
(The best kalguksu in the world)

1649
01:05:39,012 --> 01:05:40,846
(How does the alpaca kalguksu,)

1650
01:05:40,846 --> 01:05:42,312
(full of the Andes flavor, taste?)

1651
01:05:42,312 --> 01:05:43,646
It's time to eat!

1652
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:47,846
- You've made art!
- No.

1653
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:49,779
Try it.

1654
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:53,950
(Sipping on it)

1655
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,190
(Sipping the soup)

1656
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,779
(Chef Choi is also trying the broth.)

1657
01:06:05,779 --> 01:06:06,812
How's the broth?

1658
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:10,446
(Nervous)

1659
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:11,812
I love it.

1660
01:06:12,312 --> 01:06:13,412
It tastes like pho broth.

1661
01:06:17,379 --> 01:06:19,212
It's like the clear beef broth
from Hadongkwan.

1662
01:06:19,212 --> 01:06:20,812
- The restaurant?
- Yes, it's like that.

1663
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:23,146
Rice goes the best with such broth.

1664
01:06:27,479 --> 01:06:31,146
(The hot broth makes up...)

1665
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:34,446
(for the long day of laborious tasks.)

1666
01:06:36,312 --> 01:06:38,279
(I'm glad you're enjoying it.)

1667
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:41,946
(Also enjoying the broth)

1668
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:44,279
Did you only boil the alpaca meat
for the broth?

1669
01:06:44,279 --> 01:06:46,579
Yes, with green onions and onions.

1670
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:50,146
That's why it tastes like pho
or beef rib soup.

1671
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:58,912
(The stretchy noodles are perfect
for the alpaca broth.)

1672
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:05,746
(It's double times flavorful
as the rough surfaces...)

1673
01:07:05,746 --> 01:07:10,479
(of the hand-pulled noodles make
the broth soaked in better.)

1674
01:07:12,379 --> 01:07:15,712
(Also trying a slice
of the boiled alpaca meat)

1675
01:07:20,212 --> 01:07:22,912
(Laughing)

1676
01:07:22,912 --> 01:07:23,779
This is...

1677
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:27,146
You know what this is? Boiled beef!

1678
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:28,046
I mean it!

1679
01:07:28,646 --> 01:07:30,312
Yes, it tastes identical to beef.

1680
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,379
It tastes like boiled beef.

1681
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:34,446
Alpaca meat tastes identical to beef.

1682
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:37,379
I expected it to be close to goat meat,
but why is it so different?

1683
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:39,579
Goat meat is totally different
from lamb meat.

1684
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:40,746
And this is closer to beef.

1685
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:45,912
It tastes like 15 percent lamb
and 85 percent beef.

1686
01:07:45,912 --> 01:07:49,012
It's so cool how it doesn't smell gamey.

1687
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:52,379
Not even chefs could guess
what meat this was.

1688
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:53,346
You're being too kind.

1689
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:54,212
I mean it.

1690
01:07:55,979 --> 01:07:58,546
(Chef Ryu, you're the best.)

1691
01:07:59,812 --> 01:08:01,246
Ok Vin's egg garnish.

1692
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:04,246
(Slurping on Ok Vin's sliced eggs)

1693
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:06,879
- Ok Vin!
- Yes?

1694
01:08:06,879 --> 01:08:08,546
You fried these eggs perfectly.

1695
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:11,079
- I did well, right?
- Yes, it's so good!

1696
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:13,579
- It was amazing!
- It was the best.

1697
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:15,979
The eggs were incredible!

1698
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:17,679
(Only one person can't laugh.)

1699
01:08:18,112 --> 01:08:19,146
How did you make it so well?

1700
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:21,979
She did so well...

1701
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:25,312
because I stopped nagging her midway.

1702
01:08:27,246 --> 01:08:28,905
Did you discard the egg
that Hyun Seok fried?

1703
01:08:29,646 --> 01:08:30,712
- Yes, I did.
- Good job.

1704
01:08:30,712 --> 01:08:32,512
Even the dog refused to eat it.

1705
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:34,279
Not even the dog!

1706
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,646
See? Dogs don't eat everything!

1707
01:08:35,646 --> 01:08:37,512
They're such picky eaters!

1708
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:38,748
Did the dog really refuse it?

1709
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,016
- They did.
- Seriously?

1710
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:42,378
I ruined some earlier. Do you want it?

1711
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:45,147
(Sniffing)

1712
01:08:45,148 --> 01:08:46,281
I guess it's not its type.

1713
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:47,482
(Turning away)

1714
01:08:47,717 --> 01:08:49,418
You're a picky one, aren't you?

1715
01:08:49,419 --> 01:08:51,620
(Even the dog refuses to eat
Hyun Seok's egg garnish.)

1716
01:08:53,056 --> 01:08:54,156
It must be a gourmet.

1717
01:08:54,157 --> 01:08:56,825
(I'll make you a proper dish soon.)

1718
01:08:56,826 --> 01:08:58,460
It's warm and nice.

1719
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:00,262
- This is therapeutic.
- Yes.

1720
01:09:00,263 --> 01:09:01,963
This food is therapeutic, Hyun Seok.

1721
01:09:01,965 --> 01:09:03,800
(Wait for the post-credit scene.)

1722
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,701
And it must have been so hard
to knead the dough.

1723
01:09:06,703 --> 01:09:08,271
Su Young did it all by himself.

1724
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:10,139
- You should have helped him.
- Where were you?

1725
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,774
Can you find the tape of my footage?

1726
01:09:12,775 --> 01:09:15,043
- Where's...
- Who uses a videotape nowadays?

1727
01:09:15,044 --> 01:09:17,112
Where are the files of my footage?

1728
01:09:17,113 --> 01:09:19,314
Who was the cameraperson that filmed me?

1729
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:24,620
Did you lose the tape of me?

1730
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,555
- We don't use tape anymore.
- Is it deleted?

1731
01:09:26,556 --> 01:09:28,931
- Maybe the producer got rid of it.
- Did you accidentally delete my files?

1732
01:09:30,026 --> 01:09:30,959
I mean...

1733
01:09:31,261 --> 01:09:33,028
They must have deleted my files
by accident.

1734
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:36,164
Where's my part? I worked so hard.

1735
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:39,000
("Want to Know,
The Time When Daniel Went Missing")

1736
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:40,035
Okay.

1737
01:09:40,036 --> 01:09:43,841
(He was trying to light a fire
by the fireplace all evening.)

1738
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:45,274
They told me to go like this yesterday.

1739
01:09:46,009 --> 01:09:46,875
Or was it this way?

1740
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,679
(He was watching over the two pots
with great care.)

1741
01:09:51,848 --> 01:09:52,748
Or was it this way?

1742
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:56,851
(He's been in front of the fire
the whole time like a royal cook.)

1743
01:09:57,287 --> 01:09:59,521
The meat must be soft now.

1744
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,458
(Let's find out the food
that Daniel has been boiling.)

1745
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:03,458
- Turn off the heat?
- Yes.

1746
01:10:04,127 --> 01:10:08,430
(He carefully moves it
so that he won't spill any of it.)

1747
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,668
Where do I put the rice pot?

1748
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,472
(Time for a close-up shot
of the finished food.)

1749
01:10:16,472 --> 01:10:18,840
(The camera for the close-up shot)

1750
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:20,108
(But...)

1751
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:23,244
(it looks a bit dark.)

1752
01:10:24,814 --> 01:10:27,749
(What is this thing?)

1753
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:29,351
Should I put the rice pot there?

1754
01:10:29,352 --> 01:10:32,988
- Wait. This isn't ours.
- Whose is it?

1755
01:10:32,989 --> 01:10:35,491
- You don't have to film it.
- Why not?

1756
01:10:35,491 --> 01:10:36,858
- What is it?
- This soup isn't anything.

1757
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:39,328
I think the locals were boiling water
to sanitize their rags.

1758
01:10:39,328 --> 01:10:42,330
Why did you boil it, then?

1759
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:43,865
To cover the fire because it was too hot.

1760
01:10:46,235 --> 01:10:49,370
(The one to cover the fire,
and another for boiled meat.)

1761
01:10:49,372 --> 01:10:50,938
I've been boiling this down
the whole time, though.

1762
01:10:50,939 --> 01:10:52,174
- You were boiling this down?
- Yes.

1763
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:53,475
Not the pressure cooker?

1764
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:54,977
I did that without any fire.

1765
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:56,077
Oh, gosh.

1766
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,915
(He's been fanning the fire
only to end up with this.)

1767
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:01,950
This water is for boiling rags.

1768
01:11:02,318 --> 01:11:03,218
Rags?

1769
01:11:04,654 --> 01:11:06,755
This is for boiling rags?
