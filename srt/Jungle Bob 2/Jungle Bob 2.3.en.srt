1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:04,168
(They came to Bombonaje,
following the Tasty Mission card.)

2
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:06,534
They say piranhas are plentiful here.

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,668
- I'll try to catch some.
- Are you serious?

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:12,643
(Predators that charge
at the scent of blood)

5
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,548
Only the bone is left.

6
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:18,168
(Catch the piranhas.)

7
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,377
(Horrifying sawteeth)

8
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,047
It can cut through your fingers.

9
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,434
(Goodness)

10
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:27,701
(How could anyone catch that?)

11
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,701
Was one of you bitten
while trying to catch them?

12
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:34,267
We need the scent of blood
to attract the piranhas.

13
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,001
We need to catch the piranhas. Let's go.

14
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,001
(Tonight, it's a piranha feast!)

15
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,368
(Searching for the bloodthirsty piranhas)

16
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:47,501
We kept going for so long.

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,734
You guys went far.

18
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,434
(To the core of the endless Amazon River)

19
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,568
Look at that jungle.

20
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,734
(Will they be able to catch piranhas?)

21
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,534
Did they manage to catch any?

22
00:00:56,234 --> 00:01:01,434
They might fail again
and have to go to the market.

23
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:04,668
(They ended up paying
for the giant squid in Lima.)

24
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:05,501
They sell them at the market.

25
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,268
I won't let it go this time
if you go to the market again.

26
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,268
(You'll find out soon.)

27
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:12,434
(Darkness falls on the Amazon.)

28
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,559
Is the piranha team in trouble?

29
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,601
When will they return?

30
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:20,401
They haven't returned
because they haven't caught any.

31
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,234
If they don't return by late tonight...

32
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:24,101
We continued until sunset.

33
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,501
I thought I heard Choi Daniel.

34
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,334
It was him.

35
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,301
Hyun Seok!

36
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,368
Our piranha team is back.

37
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:32,201
You're back!

38
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,468
Look at this.

39
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,534
It's night, so they must have gone
to the market.

40
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:38,868
Right?

41
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,268
- After four hours...
- Suddenly...

42
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,201
You could easily travel there and back
in four hours.

43
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,034
I'm curious too.

44
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,201
Did they catch them or not?

45
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,834
- You'll find out now.
- We'll show you.

46
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:49,034
Did you catch any?

47
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,201
We caught so many.

48
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,534
Really?

49
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:54,734
That's amazing.

50
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,701
We caught so many.

51
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,419
Really?

52
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,834
(The Amazon predators are in the bucket?)

53
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,168
So, there are many piranhas.

54
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,701
(The water is full of piranhas.)

55
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,701
(They're looking forward
to today's catch.)

56
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,201
Let's catch some.

57
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:11,834
At least one.

58
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:12,808
(Eager)

59
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:18,901
(Twitching)

60
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:22,368
It's biting!

61
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:23,901
Here we go.

62
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,301
- Something's biting it.
- Here they come.

63
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,168
- They're biting.
- They are.

64
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,001
It's Ok Vin's.

65
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:30,801
Do I pull it?

66
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,401
No?

67
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,401
It's touching the bait.

68
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,501
(The rookie fisher doesn't know
what to do.)

69
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,468
(Should I pull it or not?)

70
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:40,301
(She pulled it!)

71
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:44,501
Oh, it took the bait.

72
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,501
- It took it.
- It took the bait and swam away.

73
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,468
It only took the bait.

74
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,268
(She unfortunately lost the piranha.)

75
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,868
(Quiet)

76
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:53,968
(At that moment...)

77
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:57,834
- She caught one.
- Where?

78
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:00,234
- Where?
- Was it Ok Vin?

79
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:01,101
The kid?

80
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:03,676
The little girl caught it.

81
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,201
(The Amazonian girl did it!)

82
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,934
Oh, my gosh!

83
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,134
- That's a piranha?
- Yes.

84
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:12,034
Look at its teeth.

85
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,501
Oh, my gosh. They're so good at this.

86
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:16,501
That was impressive.

87
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:18,101
(The Amazonian predator's skin is
blood-red.)

88
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,201
It looks bloodthirsty.

89
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,434
(Even on a table,)

90
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,934
(the piranhas are menacing.)

91
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,968
(It even tastes good.)

92
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:32,268
(They grill it...)

93
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:36,601
(and deep-fry it.)

94
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:40,034
(One of the Amazon's
best delicacies, piranha)

95
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,534
I wonder what the texture is like.

96
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,468
It eats other fish, so it must be tastier.
The meat is...

97
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:49,334
It'd be Korean perch
that tastes the most similar.

98
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:50,601
Korean perch is quite expensive, you know.

99
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,568
- She got one!
- Did she catch it?

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,234
She caught one.

101
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,668
(She catches another one right away.)

102
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:00,701
Where?

103
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,168
You're really good at this, aren't you?

104
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,368
The kids are good.

105
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,701
They were experts.

106
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:09,834
(The BOB friends: 0, the kids: 3)

107
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:10,801
You caught another one?

108
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,868
She caught another one! Oh, my gosh.

109
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,268
Another one!

110
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:17,634
(The BOB friends: 0, the kids: 6)

111
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,301
The piranhas they brought were caught
by those kids.

112
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,034
- They were all caught by the kids?
- All six of them.

113
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:27,934
They are small, indeed.

114
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,868
There are large and small kinds,

115
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,301
but we caught the small kinds.

116
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,201
Right? They're smaller than I thought.

117
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,001
It's because it didn't rain.

118
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,501
You can see larger fish when it rains,

119
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,309
but we only saw the small ones
because it didn't.

120
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,801
They say it depends on the water level.

121
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,668
(Though he never caught any piranhas,)

122
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:49,434
(he'll make sure to catch our attention
with his cooking.)

123
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,568
(Using the Tasty Mission ingredients...)

124
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:55,268
I'll make French food for dinner.

125
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,601
Where's the pirarucu?

126
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,201
It's over here.

127
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,536
Have you prepared this before?

128
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,501
I can easily skin a fish.

129
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,273
But isn't this your first time
skinning a pirarucu?

130
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,934
Oh, the scary one.

131
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,068
It's seriously big.

132
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,101
I bet it's easy since it's thick.

133
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:14,314
- Will it be easier than others?
- Yes.

134
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,168
- But it's surely huge.
- It is.

135
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,234
(Extra thick)

136
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,834
- It looks thicker than beef.
- Exactly.

137
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,501
I wanted to make a fine dining dish.

138
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,101
- Fine dining.
- I wanted to make a steak.

139
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:27,601
As you know, a steak has to be thick.

140
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,901
- That's the perfect fish for that.
- Yes, it's the right size.

141
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,434
I can't wait to see how it's cooked.

142
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:32,568
(Piracuru steak)

143
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,801
It was incredibly good.

144
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,434
- This is...
- Yes?

145
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,201
- It's got that.
- It's got what?

146
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:43,801
Fascia?

147
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,201
No, it has bones.

148
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,134
- Bones?
- Oh, it has bones.

149
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:49,201
(Crunching)

150
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,034
No way!

151
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,634
You can hear the bones breaking.

152
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,201
The sound of cutting bones.

153
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,234
It has so many bones.

154
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,534
And they're tough.

155
00:05:58,534 --> 00:05:59,601
- They sound tough.
- Yes.

156
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,301
It's not like normal fish.

157
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,201
It's like cutting pork.

158
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:07,634
(Preparing fish that feels like pork)

159
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,301
That's incredible.

160
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:12,668
It's just like land animal meat.

161
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:14,534
Who would even think that's fish?

162
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,468
I've never seen a fish fillet that thick.

163
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,334
- Except for tuna.
- That's incredibly thick.

164
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,234
Right?

165
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,068
It's as big as pork or beef.

166
00:06:27,868 --> 00:06:30,234
(Sprinkling salt and pepper)

167
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:32,034
(He seasons them...)

168
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,168
(and cooks them.)

169
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,568
That was delicious.

170
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:37,701
It looks like meat!

171
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,268
- It does.
- It was insanely good.

172
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,568
It looks like a grilled pork neck.

173
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,868
(The pirarucu steak will
soon be revealed.)

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,409
It's really firm.

175
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:45,501
(Meanwhile, Daniel is...)

176
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,068
I have a feeling
it's getting more viscous.

177
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,334
- Maybe it contains a type of starch.
- What is that?

178
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:52,601
What is that?

179
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:53,668
What's that?

180
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:55,868
I'll tell you what it is.

181
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:58,434
There were so many mosquitoes...

182
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:01,201
- that I wore a mosquito net jacket.
- Okay.

183
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:06,134
So, I gave him one.

184
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,815
- That's not what we asked.
- We asked what you were making.

185
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,334
- I'm sorry, but we didn't ask.
- We didn't ask that.

186
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,501
(Oh, you're so frustrating.)

187
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,568
No, what were you making?

188
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:19,734
What were you doing in the video?

189
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:22,801
Oh, what was I making?

190
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:24,101
Oh, that stuff?

191
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:24,968
I thought...

192
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,668
We don't care about your outfit.

193
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:27,901
We were asking what were you making.

194
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:30,101
- That was so...
- Answer our question.

195
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:30,968
Sorry about that.

196
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,534
- We wanted to know what that was.
- You know what this show is, right?

197
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,834
- We weren't even curious!
- Sorry.

198
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:34,668
What was it?

199
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:37,334
- He said there were too many mosquitoes.
- It's called cassava.

200
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,168
- Yuca.
- Yes, yuca.

201
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,201
- Now, you know.
- Yes.

202
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:41,934
- Sure. Thanks.
- Yes. Now, we know.

203
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:42,834
Do you need my help?

204
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,268
Can you pass me the apple mangoes?

205
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:45,434
- The apple mangoes?
- Yes.

206
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,068
My pants were coming down.

207
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,334
Why didn't anyone tell me?

208
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,001
- What's that?
- Stop.

209
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:53,034
Excuse me!

210
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:57,368
- It's not like I'm Justin Bieber. Yes?
- Hey.

211
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:58,978
- Daniel, cut some firewood.
- Yes?

212
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,548
We're out of firewood?

213
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,707
Ok Vin.

214
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,075
I cut some earlier.

215
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,234
- He made Ok Vin cut firewood?
- Ok Vin did that?

216
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,834
- What on earth is that?
- What is going on?

217
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,201
What did you do?

218
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:19,234
Ok Vin isn't even wearing a mosquito net.

219
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:23,734
He wore the mesh jacket
to protect himself,

220
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,601
while Ok Vin was in short sleeves.

221
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,968
Don't you have any clips of me
cutting firewood?

222
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,501
No. Because you never did it.

223
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:32,401
(Come on, Daniel.)

224
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,068
(At that time, Hyun Seok is...)

225
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,281
Bring me the chicken feet.

226
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,168
Right. It was boiling.

227
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:47,034
(Adding the chicken feet
he bought at the market)

228
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:50,568
(On top of firewood cut by Ok Vin,)

229
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,134
(the water is boiling vigorously.)

230
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,968
(While the chicken feet are cooked,)

231
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:00,868
(he stir-fries the onions and celery.)

232
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,934
(He cooks them until caramelized...)

233
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:10,034
(and adds the cooked celery and onions...)

234
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,501
(into the water
where the chicken feet are boiling?)

235
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:20,101
(Full of chicken feet and vegetables)

236
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,301
(What is this soup?)

237
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,068
- What would it be?
- What is it?

238
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,834
(And the highlight of the day)

239
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,368
Bring me butter.

240
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,901
I'm eager to try that pirarucu steak.

241
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,668
I wonder what that tastes like.

242
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:37,068
(Let's grill them now.)

243
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,068
(Sizzling)

244
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,168
(As thick as ever)

245
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,001
That's impressive.

246
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:55,768
Check out the color.

247
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,693
It looks delicious.

248
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,362
It looks like pork belly from here.

249
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:01,964
Are you sure this is not meat?

250
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,332
- It's just like pork neck.
- Look at that.

251
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,867
- This is pork neck.
- It's not?

252
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:07,136
I know. You can't find a fish
that's so firm.

253
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:11,543
I know, right? Fish can't be that springy.

254
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,780
(Adding two spoons of butter)

255
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:19,352
Adding butter brings out a savory flavor.

256
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,823
It's like watching pork being grilled.

257
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,024
(It's coated in butter.)

258
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,092
- That looks good.
- I'm hungry.

259
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,227
Seriously. It looks so good.

260
00:10:29,606 --> 00:10:32,408
(Now, he's in the realm of culinary art.)

261
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,567
(Adding flavor one spoonful at a time)

262
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,235
It looks so tasty.

263
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,704
I'm almost done grilling it.

264
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,906
Do you need anything else?

265
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,776
- No, it's all done.
- It smells amazing.

266
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,478
- That looks delicious.
- The smell is crazy.

267
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,380
I was so surprised.

268
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,649
- I can't believe that's a fish steak.
- Me too.

269
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:55,088
- I have to make the sauce.
- Okay.

270
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,122
What is it?

271
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,057
- I'm going to...
- Yes.

272
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,259
Oh, the chicken feet.

273
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,327
I'm going to reduce it on high heat.

274
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,796
(Are the chicken feet for the sauce?)

275
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,764
Really?

276
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,734
This is pirarucu steak.

277
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,236
I'll make the accompanying sauce.

278
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,537
I wonder what this will be like.

279
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,438
Bring the pot.

280
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,609
(Daniel is here for the pot
on the chef's orders.)

281
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,211
(Halting)

282
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,044
But...

283
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,747
(His eyes are wide with apprehension.)

284
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:21,681
This is...

285
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,216
Will I be able to carry this?

286
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,318
Is it safe for me to pick it up?

287
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,654
I don't think so.

288
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,589
It looks very hot.

289
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,658
(He gives it a try.)

290
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,795
(Shaking)

291
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,231
- Gosh, no.
- Please be careful.

292
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,867
You almost tipped it over, didn't you?

293
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,835
(Looking over)

294
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,137
How should I pick this up?

295
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:46,639
Wait, no.

296
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,607
- Please don't do it.
- What's he doing?

297
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,511
This must be very hot.

298
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,910
You didn't set the house on fire, did you?

299
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,581
(Why isn't my sauce here yet?)

300
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,517
Daniel, hurry and get it for me.

301
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,589
(He uses the towel
that's soaked with his sweat.)

302
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:05,960
Hey, that's the towel
you've been carrying.

303
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,992
That's for wiping your sweat.

304
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:10,096
I held the pot with it.

305
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,032
It's so heavy. Why is this so heavy?

306
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,234
So heavy.

307
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,138
- That must've been boiling hot.
- It really was.

308
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:20,674
Pour it here.

309
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,174
- Should I pour it?
- Yes.

310
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,745
(What kind of sauce will he make
with chicken feet broth?)

311
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,181
It's my first time seeing a broth
made with chicken feet.

312
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,349
I can't believe I'm making...

313
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:34,153
this gravy sauce, chicken jus,
in this jungle.

314
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,855
Chicken jus?

315
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,990
This will become a sauce.

316
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,225
It's for the sauce?

317
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,927
Jus is the reduction of broth.

318
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:42,796
- Jus.
- Jus.

319
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,397
That's what jus is.

320
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,903
Fine dining restaurants often use
chicken feet.

321
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,070
Really?

322
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,805
Because more than the taste,
chicken feet help...

323
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,874
achieve the right sauce viscosity.

324
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,611
You're using collagen
to set the viscosity,

325
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,046
- so it improves the texture.
- The texture.

326
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,750
They use chicken feet a lot
when they boil the jus.

327
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,384
- To make it sticky.
- He looks competent today.

328
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,685
- I agree.
- I know, right?

329
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,187
- He's not complaining either.
- He looks cool.

330
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:09,923
That's awesome.

331
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:11,924
(The broth made from chicken feet,
celery, and onion)

332
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,960
For the sauce, I soaked the chicken feet.

333
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,129
You have to grill the chicken feet,
soak them, and reduce them.

334
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,734
Can you give me some milk too?
There's some left there.

335
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,736
(Butter)

336
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,339
(Flour)

337
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,840
Tell me when to stop.

338
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,442
That looks good.

339
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:32,745
That way, the sauce will be glossy...

340
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,013
and have a better texture.

341
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,650
You use that to adjust
the sauce viscosity.

342
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,452
(He adds the chicken feet broth.)

343
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:42,089
It feels a little sticky.

344
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,489
It feels very good.

345
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,724
That's awesome.

346
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,427
(It's just right.)

347
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:49,662
Okay.

348
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,466
(He puts it through a sieve
one last time.)

349
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,668
Then, you get an amazing sauce.

350
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,304
It looks so tasty.

351
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,405
It was amazing.

352
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,274
The sauce looks so good.

353
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,209
Ok Vin was a great help.

354
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,280
- Where was Daniel during all this?
- Where am I?

355
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,683
- Oh, right. I was mashing that.
- Right.

356
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,184
That's all you do.

357
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,120
Cassava is high in fiber,

358
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,254
so you have to sift it.

359
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:16,749
It's really dry.

360
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,991
It has a high viscosity.

361
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,526
It's so dry.

362
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,694
(What is he struggling to mash?)

363
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,198
(It's what they harvested in the field
during the day.)

364
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,967
(Yuca, Amazon's staple crop)

365
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,569
It's a staple in that region.

366
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,237
It looks a bit like sweet potatoes.

367
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,306
It looks like potatoes,
but it's sweet, like sweet potatoes.

368
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,686
I bet you've tried them. At bars,

369
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,312
they serve cassava chips,
not potato chips.

370
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,413
- Oh, right.
- Sure.

371
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,117
Isn't the texture similar to potatoes?

372
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,853
- Somewhere between potatoes and yam.
- Yam.

373
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:48,120
It feels similar to that.

374
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,822
(He has to press down and sift it.)

375
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:50,956
It's really dry.

376
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,993
How long should I do this?

377
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,562
Su Young.

378
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:58,731
- Can you clean the piranha for me?
- Okay.

379
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,766
- Ok Vin, can you get some rice?
- Got it.

380
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,435
- Right.
- They've sped him up.

381
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:04,804
(Playing five times faster)

382
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,805
Why is this so hard?

383
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,274
(He's endlessly working the yuca.)

384
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,042
Are you doing okay?

385
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,412
- It's not easy, right?
- What? Oh, well.

386
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,282
It seems like Hyun Seok needs it.

387
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,017
I think he'll put it under the steak.

388
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,319
- Under it.
- Really?

389
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,487
For butter-grilled fish,

390
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:23,923
they usually place...

391
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,392
mashed potatoes underneath as garnish.

392
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,661
They'll use it as mashed potatoes.

393
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:29,996
Yes, like mashed potatoes.

394
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,998
You add a bit of cream to make a puree.

395
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,100
- It's often used as a garnish.
- For that purpose.

396
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,668
I used the cassava for that.

397
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,104
- By making mashed yuca.
- Mashed yuca.

398
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,142
(Putting milk on the frying pan)

399
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,243
We didn't have whipped cream,

400
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,845
- Are you making it?
- so I mixed milk with butter.

401
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:48,581
It'll become like whipped cream.

402
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:49,827
I've never seen that before.

403
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,619
That's the one I made.

404
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,921
- Yuca.
- That was my work.

405
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,158
(His eyes are sunken
after two hours of labor.)

406
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,328
(This is how much he made in two hours.)

407
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,700
That's why it was so soft.

408
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,735
That's why it was creamier and softer.

409
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12,137
(Once it's boiled down, it's done.)

410
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,872
- Daniel.
- Yes.

411
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,744
Since you did a good job,
I'll let you have a taste.

412
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:17,576
- Okay.
- Here.

413
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,514
Have a taste of the cassava you made.

414
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,218
Gosh. It's delicious!

415
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,587
The kind you get
at a gourmet restaurant, right?

416
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,755
- That must be so good.
- It's delicious.

417
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,523
- Mashed yuca.
- This is the result.

418
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,326
You can only get it there.

419
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,296
(Is he cooking another dish?)

420
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,364
- What?
- What is it?

421
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,599
What is he making now?

422
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,835
- What is it?
- Oh, that was amazing.

423
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,104
- It was hard to make, right?
- Why? It's fried eggs.

424
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,439
- It's not. Keep watching.
- It's eggs, right?

425
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,573
That was so delicious.

426
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,041
- The celery.
- I was so surprised.

427
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,519
(He added all the leftover celery
from the broth.)

428
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,777
- What is he making?
- What is it?

429
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:53,613
What could it be?

430
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,114
(He's adding rice?)

431
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,015
Oh, fried rice.

432
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,384
- It goes well with fried rice.
- I agree.

433
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,886
(Celery fried rice
with leftover ingredients)

434
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,957
The rice you have in Peru
has low viscosity and is fluffy.

435
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,492
- It's fluffy.
- It's that type of rice,

436
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,327
so it's good for making fried rice.

437
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,232
(He starts working the wok.)

438
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,300
I mean...

439
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,169
(Working the wok vigorously)

440
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,405
(Impressed)

441
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,404
I mean,

442
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,273
he cooks Western food,
but he's good with the wok too.

443
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,174
Right. He specializes in Western food.

444
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,943
I can't believe he said that himself.

445
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,145
You could've waited.
I was just going to say it.

446
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,383
(Hyun Seok, a Western cuisine chef,
claims to be versatile.)

447
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,019
I can't believe I get to see a chef
working his wok.

448
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,519
I know. You've lived a good life.

449
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,158
(The versatile chef shows off his skills.)

450
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,362
(But his posture is rather awkward.)

451
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,663
He's too tall.

452
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:46,767
My back was killing me.

453
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,800
(Bent over and crouching)

454
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,903
(The chair where Su Young was sitting)

455
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:51,971
I need the chair.

456
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,443
(Stealing the chair
while its owner is away)

457
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,145
That's why I couldn't find it.

458
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,781
I went back, but my chair was gone.

459
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:02,806
(Yes. This is comfortable.)

460
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,252
Where did my chair go?

461
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,731
Where did my chair go?

462
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:09,688
I had no idea.

463
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,057
(Pretending not to know)

464
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:11,957
Really?

465
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:13,792
Someone is sitting on it.

466
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,161
(Now that he's settled in a seat,)

467
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,229
(he works the wok, adding a smoky aroma.)

468
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,364
It must be so delicious
with all that fire.

469
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,466
It smells amazing.

470
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,768
(Celery fried rice
with a smoky aroma is done.)

471
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,670
- That looks delicious.
- Thank you for the food.

472
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,839
- Have a seat.
- It looks so appetizing.

473
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,275
(Their first meal in the Amazon)

474
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,576
We haven't eaten some rice in so long.

475
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,444
Daniel.

476
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,813
- Have a seat.
- It must've been amazing.

477
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,648
You worked hard, Hyun Seok.

478
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,915
You worked really hard.

479
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,519
(Now, they get to try
the Chef Choi Hyun Seok special.)

480
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,954
My goodness. Look at this.

481
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,291
- Yuca.
- This is made with yuca.

482
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,494
- It's mashed yuca.
- Mashed yuca.

483
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,730
I wonder what that one tastes like.

484
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,198
And this one is...

485
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,633
(Pirarucu steak)

486
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,102
- pirarucu steak.
- I'm curious about its taste.

487
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,004
- Me too.
- Pirarucu steak.

488
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:58,504
I'm so curious about its texture.

489
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,974
This is from the chicken
that you grilled earlier.

490
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,276
After grilling it for some time,

491
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,710
I boiled it down with chicken feet.

492
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,079
(The chef explains the dinner menu.)

493
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,380
So, that's how you make it.

494
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,950
This is fried rice
made with leftover celery.

495
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,518
(Celery fried rice)

496
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,787
You're really like the chef
explaining each dish.

497
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:17,056
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

498
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:19,258
- Great cooking, everyone.
- Great work.

499
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,293
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

500
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,996
They're having such a gourmet dish...

501
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,497
- That doesn't happen every day.
- in the Amazon.

502
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,729
I can't believe I'm using a knife here.

503
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,703
Fine dining in the jungle.

504
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,539
Try the fish with the sauce.

505
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,775
I can't believe we're having fine cuisine
in the Amazon jungle.

506
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,448
(Getting tense)

507
00:19:41,449 --> 00:19:43,049
That's how you were looking at me.

508
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,650
The look in your eyes.

509
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,385
- He was looking at you.
- I had no idea.

510
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,255
- But the look in your eyes.
- He was.

511
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,056
(Tense)

512
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,073
This is crazy.

513
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:56,158
This is so good.

514
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,766
You are a genius. It's incredible.

515
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,217
- That was his genuine reaction.
- It's amazing.

516
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:03,699
(The genius is pleased.)

517
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:04,903
This actually works.

518
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,635
The pirarucu is also delicious.

519
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,073
(Ok Vin tries it
with plenty of mashed yuca.)

520
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:09,304
(Satisfied)

521
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,872
The mashed yuca
and the chicken feet sauce...

522
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:13,726
complement each other perfectly.

523
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,450
That sauce looks so good.

524
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:16,433
He pours on it...

525
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:18,790
Cooked, it had elasticity like a sponge.

526
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,544
That must be very chewy.

527
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:21,854
The outside should be chewy,

528
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,426
- and the inside should be soft.
- And very moist.

529
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,153
That must be so good.

530
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:26,989
It's amazing.

531
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:28,954
That dish can be the reason
to go to the jungle.

532
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,980
Where is the nearest place
we can go to have a pirarucu dish?

533
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,329
There.

534
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,191
Come on.

535
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,736
Somewhere else in Peru would sell those.

536
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,500
It's so good.

537
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,705
- We're in the jungle, but I feel like...
- Yes.

538
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:46,542
- we're at a fine restaurant.
- I agree.

539
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,686
It actually happened.

540
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:50,712
It's like fine dining
with the Han River view.

541
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:51,818
Have it with the sauce.

542
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,615
Pirarucu is truly delicious.

543
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,800
It has the savory taste of hairtail.

544
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:58,654
And its texture is truly amazing.

545
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:00,255
Isn't it good?

546
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,590
- It's great.
- It's amazing.

547
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,788
It's insanely good.

548
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:04,039
- Hyun Seok.
- What?

549
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,427
You amazed me.

550
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,129
I'm even starting to think he's handsome.

551
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:08,196
This is amazing.

552
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:11,867
- What did you think of him?
- Seriously, the fish is cooked perfectly.

553
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,605
Is it evenly cooked?

554
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,280
Did he really say that?

555
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,541
Frankly,

556
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,102
I hate that word.

557
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:24,446
That's true. He hates that word.

558
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,383
What about this gesture?

559
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:35,090
Chef Anh Sung Jae looked the happiest
at that moment.

560
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:37,893
Which one do you hate more?
This gesture or the word "evenly?"

561
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,127
I hate you.

562
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,800
You even resemble him without the glasses.

563
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,110
- Don't you think so?
- Do I?

564
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:48,835
- Yes.
- I do see the resemblance.

565
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:51,296
- I can see him.
- They do resemble.

566
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,825
- A sloth face?
- "A sloth face."

567
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:57,128
Their eyes do look similar.

568
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,548
Is this piranha?

569
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:01,994
- Yes, it's the one we caught earlier.
- It's a piranha.

570
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:04,042
Piranha?
You cooked this as the side, right?

571
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,320
- This fritter?
- Really?

572
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,275
I simply deep-fried it.

573
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,626
- Oh, my goodness.
- What about its teeth?

574
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,028
I removed its mouth and used its body.

575
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:17,042
I wanted to fillet it,
but it was too small.

576
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,150
So I fried the whole fish instead.

577
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:21,440
(Into the oil it goes.)

578
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,605
I've never seen fried piranha.

579
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,307
I wanted to offer them some fritters.

580
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:29,341
- My gosh, that's so fascinating.
- It really is.

581
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:30,583
(And so,
Mr. Eo Nam Seon's secret menu is born.)

582
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,711
I see you put fried onions underneath.

583
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,851
Since you cook Western cuisine,
so I made it look like a Western dish.

584
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:36,918
That looks delicious.

585
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:39,972
(Let me taste piranha!)

586
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:45,666
The fish in the Amazon are
freshwater fish,

587
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,829
- but there's no earthy smell at all.
- That's true.

588
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:50,199
Then, it should be good.

589
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:51,942
I'm curious how that tastes.

590
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,212
(The Amazon piranha transformed.)

591
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:57,539
Seriously, I was so tired today
that I lost my appetite.

592
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:00,372
But I had no problem eating this.

593
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:02,144
I emptied my plate. It was so good.

594
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,411
(Pleased)

595
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,716
Finishing up the day
with your amazing food,

596
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,051
I don't feel tired anymore.

597
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:10,519
- I have the energy for tomorrow.
- I'll cook you something better...

598
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,520
- It was fantastic.
- next time.

599
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:13,455
Do we go to bed now?

600
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:14,456
Yes, we do.

601
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,655
But I'm not confident about it.

602
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:18,827
There are so many bugs.

603
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,029
Are you washing up in this situation?

604
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,289
Gosh, that's something.

605
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:26,911
You're the epitome of a gentleman.

606
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,182
(Cleanliness maketh gentleman,
even in the Amazon.)

607
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:31,124
I found a towel.

608
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,598
Haven't seen that undershirt in a while.

609
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:33,508
Is there a towel?

610
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:35,877
Hold on. Whose towel is this?

611
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:37,183
(Hesitant)

612
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:40,382
Can we use these towels?

613
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:44,419
Look how tanned his arms are.

614
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:46,388
Oh, my.

615
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:48,790
What the heck!

616
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:53,967
- What's going on?
- What in the world?

617
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,281
- Please stop playing it.
- What is that?

618
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,088
- Why are you showing your belly?
- Look at that.

619
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:59,668
Why would you pull down your pants
toward the camera?

620
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:01,968
You should be taking off your shoes,
not your pants.

621
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:05,240
- Why would you take your pants off?
- Why is he doing that?

622
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:07,843
What's wrong?

623
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:09,799
What is the matter with you?

624
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,264
Did you have to make a scene
in front of everyone?

625
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,488
- I can't believe it!
- I didn't pull them down.

626
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,385
- Were you just loosening them?
- I simply untied the strings.

627
00:24:17,385 --> 00:24:18,453
Is that right?

628
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,666
I usually wear just underpants in bed.

629
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,900
(Choi tries to make him comfortable...)

630
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,075
(and lies down.)

631
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:31,099
Oh, right. That towel was mine.

632
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:36,385
Darn it. This is too short for me.

633
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:40,406
(The mosquito net is rather short
for a 190cm-tall man.)

634
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,721
See how it's bad to be tall, DinDin?

635
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:44,289
- I don't get it.
- Look at him.

636
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,356
Why go through all that?

637
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,693
We'd be perfectly comfortable in there.

638
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,261
- You should've shortened your height!
- I couldn't agree more.

639
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,888
Two of me could fit in there.

640
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:55,814
(This isn't a conversation
between a hobbit and Gandalf.)

641
00:24:56,224 --> 00:25:01,320
(Going to bed is harder
than cooking for him.)

642
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:06,568
(Meanwhile, the actress starts
washing her face.)

643
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:09,234
I used wet wipes to clean up.

644
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,672
But that's the best option.

645
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:11,940
It must be harder for women.

646
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,220
(She roughly wipes impurities
off her skin.)

647
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,438
(A single wet tissue is all she needs.)

648
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:25,023
(This is clean enough for me.)

649
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,792
- This is not good.
- What is it?

650
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:34,229
My feet touch the mosquito net.

651
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,364
I'll have mosquito bites
all over my soles.

652
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:40,855
- Right?
- Your soles will be covered with bites.

653
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:44,219
I think you're no better.
Your feet will touch it too.

654
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,508
- What's that?
- Your feet will also touch it.

655
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,677
I'm going to wear my shoes in bed.

656
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:51,346
- That's clever.
- Right?

657
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:53,514
In American style.

658
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:55,383
- You'll be wearing shoes in bed?
- Yes.

659
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,719
Have you ever lived in America?

660
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,387
Maybe a week?

661
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:03,826
It was in San Fransico.

662
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:11,904
(Checking in with shoes,
San Fransico style)

663
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,002
(However...)

664
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,818
That is so silly.

665
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:17,672
I bet 20 mosquitos just got in.

666
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:21,109
Do not come in.

667
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,062
Persistent ones will get in.

668
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,849
- Isn't it too short for you?
- Sleep diagonally, then.

669
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,003
There you go.

670
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:33,919
(Aren't you a genius?)

671
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,899
Diagonally.

672
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,249
(The Choi brothers sleep diagonally.)

673
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:38,226
It's pretty good, right?

674
00:26:38,254 --> 00:26:40,195
My legs are still crossed, though.

675
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:44,966
I can't stretch them.

676
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:45,967
(Snoring)

677
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,844
For the first time,
I feel bad for tall people.

678
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,296
(Quickly falling asleep)

679
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:58,722
(While everyone is sound asleep)

680
00:26:58,747 --> 00:26:59,639
That's so pretty.

681
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:00,882
Is that not CGI?

682
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,450
No, it's the actual sky.

683
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,773
(The BOB expedition's lodging, 5:00 a.m.)

684
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:08,125
Hey, you're awake.

685
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,339
It's really cold.

686
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,827
It's freezing at dawn.

687
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:14,519
(Waking up with groans)

688
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:16,106
So cold.

689
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:21,369
I can't believe it's so cold.

690
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:25,712
There are still mosquitos in this cold.

691
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,009
(I should get up, but my body won't move.)

692
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:28,922
Gees, look at my face.

693
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:30,812
Gosh, it's cold.

694
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:34,783
It was colder than I thought that morning.

695
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:35,902
- In the morning, right?
- Yes.

696
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,619
It's a tropical region,
but it was cold in the morning.

697
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:38,687
- It was indeed.
- The dawn was cold.

698
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:42,164
(The three guys wake up shivering.)

699
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:43,958
Should we have something hot to drink?

700
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:48,365
(Thud)

701
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,165
(Thud)

702
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:55,220
(Su Young chops firewood with an ax
quickly.)

703
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,711
Some energy he got.

704
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:02,528
(Meanwhile, Choi is making something
in the kitchen.)

705
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:03,545
What is that?

706
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:04,879
Is it a bug?

707
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:11,990
(He focuses on chopping a coconut
while Daniel makes a fuss.)

708
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,963
(Pouring coconut water into the pot)

709
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,488
(Let's see...)

710
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:23,932
That must be honey.

711
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:27,343
Do you put honey before boiling the water?

712
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,117
Are you adding honey to coconut water?

713
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:31,906
To make it sweeter?

714
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,360
(What is he making?)

715
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,342
I can't quite tell what he's making.

716
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,009
(What's Hyun Seok's impromptu recipe?)

717
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,641
(Slicing the limes
he picked from the garden)

718
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,874
The garden was covered with limes.

719
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,254
It was easy to find them.

720
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:47,522
Limes are quite expensive.

721
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,758
Is it okay to put so many?

722
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:53,227
(Squeezing a little)

723
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:54,489
Put the whole thing.

724
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:56,916
- Do you mean the whole thing?
- Yes.

725
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,073
Do you like sour food?

726
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,174
- Sour food? No, not really.
- Yes.

727
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:04,105
I prefer sweet food.

728
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,025
(He simmers coconut water,
honey, and lime like a ptisan.)

729
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:08,910
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

730
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:12,147
- That chicken was so loud, wasn't it?
- It was.

731
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,078
The chicken kept crowing.

732
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:15,173
I thought it was added in editing.

733
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:16,851
It wasn't fake?

734
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,462
(Choi's special coconut honey tea
is ready.)

735
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,844
(Su Young)

736
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:26,957
Su Young.

737
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,842
Did you take off your jacket?

738
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,845
It's so hot.

739
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:36,742
Listen to all the birds.

740
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:40,829
(Morning tea time,
listening to the Amazon sounds)

741
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:47,219
(Hot morning tea warms you
in the cold dawn.)

742
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,249
That's nice.

743
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:50,585
- How do you like it?
- I love it.

744
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:54,328
I was worried you added too much lime.

745
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,427
I see why you did it.

746
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:57,965
I wonder what it tastes like.

747
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,265
- Coconut water...
- That was really delicious too.

748
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,165
Of course, I've had coconut water before.

749
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,232
It's delicious.

750
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:05,065
This is why you need to have
your chef with you wherever you go.

751
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,040
(Then,)

752
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:10,665
I didn't know so many things happened
to them outside back then.

753
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:11,999
(where is Ok Vin right now?)

754
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,159
It's a mosquito again.

755
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,232
(Before bed last night)

756
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,499
At night, this place is swarming
with mosquitoes.

757
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,232
What should we do about them, Ok Vin?

758
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:22,165
Looks like we're done sleeping.

759
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,965
I know. That's what I'm talking about.

760
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:27,032
I can't sleep at all
when my bed isn't comfortable.

761
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:30,165
I guess I won't be able
to get any sleep tonight.

762
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,632
What if you fall asleep right away?

763
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,465
- That would be hilarious.
- Like immediately.

764
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:41,909
(Ok Vin is just out like a light.)

765
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,665
(Excuse me?)

766
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:45,332
- What?
- Why did you say that?

767
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,271
I didn't know she said that.

768
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,999
- You're totally knocked out!
- I know!

769
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,432
You slept like a baby
that night, didn't you?

770
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:56,894
Are you the type
who can fall asleep anywhere?

771
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:57,965
No, I mean...

772
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,099
You're in a deep sleep.

773
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,032
(Not even a loud rooster can wake her up.)

774
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,432
(The red sun of the Amazon rises...)

775
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:10,499
(above the peaceful rainforest.)

776
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:18,465
(The wild creatures
of the Amazon signal...)

777
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:22,299
(the start of a new day
in the small town...)

778
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:24,565
(of Bombo Nahe Village.)

779
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,132
Gosh. That's crazy.

780
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:36,665
(Everything breaths in the fresh air
from the lungs of the Earth.)

781
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:37,799
That's it!

782
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,765
- That chicken?
- That was the loud one from the morning.

783
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:44,599
They have so many chickens.

784
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:47,399
It's as if humans are the ones living
in the chickens' area.

785
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,965
(The people of Bombo Nahe Village...)

786
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:54,732
(start their mornings in their own ways.)

787
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:59,565
(Good morning.)

788
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:03,467
(What discoveries await
the BOB Expedition today?)

789
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,832
(Ok Vin wakes up vigorously
after a restful night's sleep.)

790
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:22,032
(Is it morning already?)

791
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,899
(They already have a little visitor.)

792
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,232
(Wait. He's not alone!)

793
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:30,265
- What?
- What?

794
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:32,632
Good morning!

795
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,532
What's that?

796
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:34,865
That's an anteater!

797
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:36,532
Anteater?

798
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:42,265
Anteater!

799
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,499
My goodness.
I've never seen an anteater before!

800
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,465
He takes an anteater
with him like it's his pet.

801
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,965
(The cutest baby anteater is here.)

802
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:50,632
- That's so cute!
- It's adorable!

803
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:51,565
- It's a baby!
- What?

804
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:52,699
It was really adorable.

805
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:53,765
It's a baby.

806
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:56,044
(Fascinated)

807
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:56,965
Oh, gosh.

808
00:32:57,232 --> 00:32:58,665
It's an anteater.

809
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:01,665
You look so kind.

810
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,599
I can't believe I'm holding an anteater.

811
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,299
Look, it's not even trying to leave.

812
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:07,524
(Adorable)

813
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:11,432
(Amazonian kids' pet, anteaters.)

814
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,732
It must be gentle enough,
even in kids' hands.

815
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:14,899
That's insane.

816
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:18,132
(Don't let me go!)

817
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,799
Its nose is small when it's a baby.

818
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,832
- Its mouth is short too.
- It's so small.

819
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,699
(Anteaters grow as large as a big dog,
and eat ants with their tongues.)

820
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,399
That's a bit scary.

821
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,565
- Isn't it cute?
- I feel a bit scared.

822
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,032
- It looks like a vacuum cleaner.
- Right?

823
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:33,465
(It digs a hole with its sharp claws.)

824
00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:35,032
- It sticks its tongue there to eat.
- Right.

825
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,364
(They use their long snouts
to catch ants efficiently.)

826
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:37,932
- It eats hundreds of ants at once.
- Right.

827
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,832
Hundreds at once.

828
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,265
Ants?

829
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,499
- Termites.
- It eats ants to grow up, right?

830
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:46,465
Did you see it?
(Its breakfast is nutritious termites.)

831
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:48,665
- Did you see it?
- What's that?

832
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:49,532
It's a termite nest.

833
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:52,799
- It eats termites?
- Termites?

834
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,265
- Seriously?
- Goodness.

835
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,165
(We have fresh food today.)

836
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:58,965
That must be its breakfast.

837
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:00,832
Gosh. It's so interesting.

838
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:02,965
Oh, boy.

839
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:05,232
- It's really cute!
- It's a feast.

840
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,199
My gosh.

841
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,565
That kid seems excited.

842
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,532
I saw a lot of nests in the neighborhood.

843
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:15,699
I guess they stored it to feed them.

844
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:17,865
It seems to enjoy the food to the fullest.

845
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:22,532
I never expected to see
an anteater eating ants in real life.

846
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,199
It looks exhilarated.

847
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,665
Goodness. It seems so happy!

848
00:34:25,665 --> 00:34:29,199
Look at its legs with so many termites.

849
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:31,532
- What? Are they all termites?
- Yes.

850
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:34,365
(Swarming)

851
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:39,532
He looks like Winnie-the-Pooh,
getting honey everywhere while eating.

852
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:40,732
It's all over its paws too.

853
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,299
- That's so cute.
- My gosh.

854
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:44,165
(Just watching it...)

855
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,899
(makes you forget your worries.)

856
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,365
I think I can feel termites
on my legs too.

857
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,865
Aren't we in the middle of an animal farm?

858
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:52,865
It's so interesting.

859
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:54,265
- It's wild here.
- I mean...

860
00:34:54,265 --> 00:34:57,465
We are with all the animals.
Anteaters, chickens, and dogs!

861
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:58,832
It reminds me
of "Town Musicians of Bremen."

862
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,565
It's so surreal.

863
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:02,832
(Let's call it "Town Musician of Amazon.)

864
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:06,365
I think I woke up in "Animal Farm."

865
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:09,665
(It feels like waking up
on a magical animal farm.)

866
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:13,199
With so many animals around,
it looks like Noah's Ark.

867
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:16,399
They live with various animal friends.

868
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:22,665
We have little chicks, big chickens,
and even an anteater passing by.

869
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:28,665
(Let's explore the part
of town we missed yesterday.)

870
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:31,865
I want to take a shower.

871
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:33,199
Me too.

872
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,332
Think of a cozy bed in a cool room.

873
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,132
The air conditioner must be on.

874
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:38,965
(A daydream of city boys)

875
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:40,965
- Hi. Hola.
- Hello.

876
00:35:43,765 --> 00:35:44,765
Was it Hola or Alo?

877
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:46,465
- Alo? It's Hola.
- It's Hola, right?

878
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:48,232
(The only word the two know is pica.)

879
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,499
It seems like
you two are always sticking around.

880
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:53,932
I know! He follows me around all the time.

881
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,532
He comes with me wherever I go.

882
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:58,099
You followed me around.

883
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,732
Do you love me that much?

884
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,632
Hola!

885
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,799
Did you have a good night's sleep?

886
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,932
Oh, boy. You're still sleepy, aren't you?

887
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:10,765
Sleepy boy.

888
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:11,699
Hola.

889
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:14,132
He looks at Ok Vin differently
than he looks at me.

890
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:17,440
My goodness. He adores you!

891
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:20,432
- Oh, he's so cute!
- He's so happy to see her!

892
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:23,032
We met yesterday!

893
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:25,065
He's acting cute!

894
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:27,299
You cried to see me yesterday!

895
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:28,432
I'm hurt!

896
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,432
Babies always love
pretty girls, don't they?

897
00:36:30,432 --> 00:36:31,632
So it's because I'm a man?

898
00:36:32,132 --> 00:36:33,299
Did you just say it yourself?

899
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:35,065
She wanted someone to say it, but...

900
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:36,332
- No one was there to say it!
- I mean...

901
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:38,732
If she had waited,
I could have said it then.

902
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:42,765
He's not letting my hand go.

903
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,165
(Ok Vin, can you wait 20 years
for me to grow up?)

904
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:49,065
(She takes a walk,
holding the baby's hand.)

905
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,932
(At that time)

906
00:36:53,932 --> 00:36:55,132
Are they fishing something?

907
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:57,899
(There's something by their feet.)

908
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,532
What's that?

909
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,765
(What could that be?)

910
00:37:04,865 --> 00:37:06,065
Look. What's all that?

911
00:37:06,065 --> 00:37:06,999
- Where?
- What?

912
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,099
Come on!

913
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,099
- Is it a crocodile?
- A crocodile! My goodness.

914
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,699
- It's a crocodile!
- A crocodile?

915
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,199
- It's a real crocodile!
- No way!

916
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,732
- What? It's a crocodile!
- That's right.

917
00:37:18,732 --> 00:37:19,832
They already caught one.

918
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:20,732
It's a real crocodile!

919
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,065
(Is it really a crocodile?)

920
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:25,499
- My goodness.
- No way!

921
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:29,199
(It sparked their curiosity.)

922
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,565
I can't believe this.

923
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:32,965
Oh, gosh.

924
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:34,199
(The cooking nut and Ok Vin
move forward without hesitation.)

925
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,499
(But...)

926
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,599
Let's go down together.

927
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,465
(Hugging)

928
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,165
If one falls, we're both going down.

929
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,499
My gosh.

930
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,832
They caught one.

931
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,732
It's still alive, isn't it?

932
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:45,699
Watch out.

933
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,499
It's moving.

934
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:50,165
(The predator of the Amazon River is
still alive and moving)

935
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,199
Can I touch it?

936
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,399
That's too dangerous!

937
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,265
May I?

938
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,432
(He picks its tail up without hesitation.)

939
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:01,165
- Be careful!
- With bare hands?

940
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:04,032
Can we just...

941
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,665
Can we touch it just like that?

942
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:13,465
(Please don't try this.)

943
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,999
(Angry)

944
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:21,932
Look at its eyes!

945
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,865
It's not intimidated.

946
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:26,632
It's like it's saying,
"Are you touching me?"

947
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:28,999
(Sharp claws)

948
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,799
- It's so cool!
- That looks super scary!

949
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:36,199
(The charisma
of the apex predator radiates...)

950
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:37,699
Look at its teeth.

951
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,232
(from every part of its body.)

952
00:38:39,432 --> 00:38:41,599
(He's lifting a crocodile
with his bare hands?)

953
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,399
That tail. On the other side.

954
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,299
(They find it hard to understand.)

955
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,532
Are you crazy or something?

956
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,899
It can't bite you as long
as you hold its neck firmly.

957
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:50,462
(He holds a crocodile fearlessly.)

958
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,065
I'm sorry, but just for a while.

959
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,599
It looks like a dragon.

960
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,665
It looked surreal.

961
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:58,799
It's heavy.

962
00:38:58,799 --> 00:38:59,799
Daniel, touch it!

963
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,732
(He's so unrealistic too, isn't he?)

964
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:06,399
- It's heavy, like it has a rock inside.
- It is.

965
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:07,799
It feels like touching armor.

966
00:39:09,674 --> 00:39:10,607
Be careful.

967
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:13,732
I've seen alligators
with bigger jaws in movies,

968
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:15,732
but this one has a sharper jawline.

969
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:18,832
What is its name?

970
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,799
- Caiman.
- Caiman?

971
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:23,765
Caiman.

972
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:25,865
- Caiman.
- It's caiman.

973
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,265
(Caimans mostly inhabit South America.)

974
00:39:29,265 --> 00:39:31,732
- So it's a caiman.
- Caiman.

975
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:34,699
An alligator or crocodile is
generally bigger,

976
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:36,424
but a caiman is smaller than both.

977
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:40,332
(It's Cuvier's dwarf caiman.)

978
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:41,632
Is that an adult, then?

979
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:42,632
Yes, it's an adult.

980
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:44,932
- Oh, really?
- They're not big.

981
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:46,232
So it's a caiman.

982
00:39:46,232 --> 00:39:47,932
It has such a commanding presence.

983
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:48,899
Did you see its eyes?

984
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:53,265
How did you catch them?

985
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,332
How can we catch one?

986
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:58,256
There's a small valley there.

987
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:00,426
I went there at night and grabbed it
from the back of its neck to catch it.

988
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:01,459
Like this!

989
00:40:01,461 --> 00:40:02,728
(Grabbing it from the back of its neck)

990
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:05,364
That's how he caught it.

991
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:06,832
- Really?
- That's insane.

992
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,920
He caught it
like how he'd catch a catfish.

993
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,782
Only such an expert could do that.

994
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:14,139
(Catching it only with his hands
at lightning speed)

995
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,851
With his bare hands!

996
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:20,320
What a macho man you are!

997
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:21,855
He caught it live.

998
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:24,058
That's impressive.

999
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:25,859
How does it feel?
I want to try petting it.

1000
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,060
- Do you?
- Yes.

1001
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:31,198
(You want to try petting that?)

1002
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,867
(Fearlessly...)

1003
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,835
(petting it)

1004
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:39,173
(Grabbing it without hesitation)

1005
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:41,641
Ok Vin, you're brave!

1006
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,144
You're really not scared of anything!

1007
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,048
It's quite heavy.

1008
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:50,451
It's tiny but so heavy.

1009
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,655
These always pretend to stay still
and suddenly attack you...

1010
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:57,124
and go mad, right?

1011
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,158
That's what crocodiles do.

1012
00:40:58,693 --> 00:40:59,960
It looks so cool, though.

1013
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:02,796
(Staying far away)

1014
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,632
How are we going to cook it?

1015
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,367
Are we boiling or grilling it?

1016
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:08,535
How are we going to cook it?

1017
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:12,038
Are we boiling or grilling it? Eat it raw?

1018
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,107
Ok Vin!

1019
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:15,609
My goodness!

1020
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:17,811
You're already thinking about eating it?

1021
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:20,113
- Even I wasn't thinking about that!
- She can't help it.

1022
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:22,817
She's basically an Amazon local!

1023
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:23,850
I know! It's like she lives there.

1024
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:26,320
She got up from a deep sleep and said,
"How shall I eat this crocodile?"

1025
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:27,854
She's so natural there.

1026
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:29,724
She just got up
and said that so nonchalantly.

1027
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:32,426
The skin looks really tough.

1028
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,361
(Wild Ok Vin's biggest interest)

1029
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:37,264
How are we going to get the skin off
to cook it?

1030
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:38,265
The skin is so hard.

1031
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:43,137
We skin the crocodile
and roast it over charcoal.

1032
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:47,308
(Welcome to the world
of cooking with crocodiles.)

1033
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,745
(Roasted on charcoal)

1034
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:53,880
That's the local specialty there.

1035
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:58,018
I heard that the meat texture is similar
to that of chicken meat.

1036
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,386
(Thanks to its chicken-like texture,)

1037
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:00,687
(it's very popular in skewers too.)

1038
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,689
They make skewers with it!

1039
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,158
It's crocodile suyuk.

1040
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:07,895
They boil the meat with the skin on!

1041
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:11,900
Crocodile meat is delicious.

1042
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:13,100
Is it good?

1043
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,101
It's that good?

1044
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,170
He said that it was really good!

1045
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,139
Really?

1046
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:22,343
(Even the cooking nut is intrigued.)

1047
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,443
If you could give us some,

1048
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:26,547
we'll cook it for you.

1049
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:28,382
Could you share some meat with us?

1050
00:42:28,383 --> 00:42:30,050
Of course!

1051
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:34,421
(How will they cook
with the crocodile meat?)

1052
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:43,097
There's something else that we always eat
other than crocodile meat.

1053
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:46,166
It's called "suri."

1054
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,100
"Suri?"

1055
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:50,470
(What is "suri?")

1056
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:52,339
Is that a bird?

1057
00:42:53,742 --> 00:42:54,609
(Suri, only available in the Amazon?)

1058
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,810
It's a common ingredient found here.

1059
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:59,847
- Could it be nutria?
- Maybe it's nutria!

1060
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,682
- I think I know!
- We had rats yesterday.

1061
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:04,718
(The snack
Su Young and Ok Vin had yesterday)

1062
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:07,221
Ratcova!

1063
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:09,523
(The walk...)

1064
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:10,390
What is this?

1065
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:13,627
(deep into the forest has led them...)

1066
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:16,796
(to a mysterious tree on the ground.)

1067
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:18,365
- What is this?
- What is it?

1068
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:19,900
What's this? It just looks like a tree.

1069
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,305
It's just a fallen tree.

1070
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:25,606
(Amazon's comfort food is hiding in this?)

1071
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:28,709
There must be something inside!

1072
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:32,445
Chop the tree using a hatchet,

1073
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,782
and you'll find suri inside.

1074
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:36,883
He's saying that the ingredient is
inside the tree.

1075
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:39,520
(Who will chop the tree?)

1076
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:40,421
Youngster.

1077
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:41,821
(Come here, young one.)

1078
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:42,656
Hey, youngster.

1079
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,292
- Me?
- The young man should do it.

1080
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,093
Do you want me to do it?

1081
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:49,230
Do you want me to do it?

1082
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:50,564
Do you want to try it?

1083
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:51,432
- I'll try it.
- Go ahead.
- Really?
- Yes.

1084
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:54,568
(Wild Ok Vin is always stepping up first.)

1085
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:56,069
Ok Vin, you're something else!

1086
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,172
(Walking up to the tree)

1087
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:01,842
(She's so cool.)

1088
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,544
- Here?
- Right.

1089
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:05,612
Strike it down strong.

1090
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,849
(Okay, I got it.)

1091
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,154
That was such a powerful strike!

1092
00:44:14,922 --> 00:44:16,356
(Startled)

1093
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:17,224
Be careful!

1094
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:20,827
(Aiming for the target point)

1095
00:44:21,363 --> 00:44:22,395
(And swinging the hatchet in full power)

1096
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:23,831
Her aim is good.

1097
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,832
The hatchet can fly out of your hands
if you have a bad aim.

1098
00:44:31,272 --> 00:44:32,706
(She's quite good.)

1099
00:44:32,707 --> 00:44:34,207
The guy seems really impressed.

1100
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,510
Yes, right on! Let's go, Ok Vin!

1101
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,580
Are you guys her cheerleaders?

1102
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,884
- Nice shot!
- Nice!

1103
00:44:45,553 --> 00:44:48,455
(With her chicken cheerleaders)

1104
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:49,356
She's almost done.

1105
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:50,724
(Let's go.)

1106
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:52,058
My gosh!

1107
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,094
She's doing that in sliders? Unbelievable.

1108
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:56,096
I forgot that I was wearing sliders!

1109
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:58,732
- Are you a local here or what?
- It's like you live there!

1110
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:00,767
Why are you in your sliders?

1111
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:02,769
- You look like a local there.
- I just noticed it!

1112
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,972
(Like a local Amazonian)

1113
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:07,908
(Using her feet when things get stuck)

1114
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:08,942
Think of it like chopping firewood!

1115
00:45:10,578 --> 00:45:11,244
(Grunting)

1116
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:13,847
Hold up.

1117
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,016
- Up here?
- A bit farther up.

1118
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:16,884
Farther up.

1119
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:18,318
Farther up.

1120
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,586
Imagine the tree being your ex.

1121
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:23,022
- "Think of it as your ex!"
- Think of it as your ex.

1122
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,229
(Getting super worked up)

1123
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,496
You jerk!

1124
00:45:30,632 --> 00:45:31,832
"You jerk?"

1125
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,233
(So happy)

1126
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:34,468
You jerk!

1127
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:37,070
(Chopped it down in one blow)

1128
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,706
- She chopped it in one blow!
- Was your ex that bad?

1129
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:42,309
(Satisfying)

1130
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,578
(Shuddering in fear)

1131
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,713
What have you possibly gone through?

1132
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:48,749
Tell us later.

1133
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,483
That should be fun.

1134
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:53,053
(Instead of answering them,
she's just chopping the wood.)

1135
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:56,457
It's scary to imagine my ex
thinking about me,

1136
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,625
yelling, "You jerk!" while chopping wood.

1137
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:00,594
I'd be terrified!

1138
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,628
(Getting uncomfortable)

1139
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:04,697
- You're almost done now.
- Gosh!

1140
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:06,167
- It's out.
- Let's pull it out.

1141
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,600
- What is it?
- What?

1142
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:09,402
(Let me see.)

1143
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:12,238
Something must've come out by now,

1144
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,308
but what could possibly be inside?

1145
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:15,341
What is it?

1146
00:46:15,343 --> 00:46:16,877
(What is suri?)

1147
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:17,778
Is there something inside?

1148
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,113
- What's that?
- No way.

1149
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:28,688
(Screaming)

1150
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:31,091
(At last, suri has appeared...)

1151
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:32,059
What is it?

1152
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:33,994
What is it?

1153
00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:35,262
(inside the tree.)

1154
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,400
I'm grossed out all over again.

1155
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:42,969
This is too close up!

1156
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:45,238
- My gosh!
- What's with the sound?

1157
00:46:46,908 --> 00:46:50,177
(Mortified)

1158
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:51,945
(Frozen)

1159
00:46:51,946 --> 00:46:53,513
I was hoping that it wouldn't be those.

1160
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,382
They're so fat.

1161
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,654
(Scared)

1162
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,623
(Taking one)

1163
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:08,361
- What is that?
- No!

1164
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:15,802
(Offering her hand
without realizing what she's doing)

1165
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,170
It's okay.

1166
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,039
(Carefully placing it on her hand)

1167
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,941
Ok Vin's hand is this big.
The larva was this big!

1168
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:22,543
- It was huge.
- That's giant!

1169
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:24,143
(Screaming)

1170
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:27,948
It's moving!

1171
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,316
(Squirming)

1172
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,219
(Escaping her hand)

1173
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:34,955
Oh, no!

1174
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:37,591
They're this big!

1175
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:39,626
(Squirming with so much life)

1176
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:41,861
It moves on your hand!
Do you want to hold it?

1177
00:47:41,863 --> 00:47:43,430
- I'll try it.
- Go ahead.

1178
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:45,065
- I'll try grabbing it.
- Try it.

1179
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:50,070
Put it on your palm. It feels so weird.

1180
00:47:50,738 --> 00:47:52,205
(Wow!)

1181
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,206
It's going crazy!

1182
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:54,340
(So dramatic)

1183
00:48:01,749 --> 00:48:04,584
(I got you, didn't I?)

1184
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,555
(What a cute young man.)

1185
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:13,127
- It's so good.
- How does it taste?

1186
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:14,127
It tastes absolutely good.

1187
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,763
(Looking at it)

1188
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:20,067
I can really smell of...

1189
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:22,536
- The forest smell.
- Yes.

1190
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:25,005
- The tree...
- The rotting tree smell.

1191
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:29,376
I guess the larvae live off of dead trees.

1192
00:48:29,377 --> 00:48:30,777
(Dead trees become
a great feed for the suri.)

1193
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:33,680
They eat the dead trees and grow.

1194
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:36,116
This is a delicacy for the locals.

1195
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:37,484
Really?

1196
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:40,019
- They're skewered alive?
- Yes, they are!

1197
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:42,222
They skewer them alive...

1198
00:48:42,824 --> 00:48:44,358
and roast them right over the fire.

1199
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,461
(Sometimes, they're deep-fried...)

1200
00:48:47,462 --> 00:48:49,195
They're like roasted silkworms
that we eat.

1201
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,229
(with only their guts removed.)

1202
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:52,832
Are they just eaten alive?

1203
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:55,235
- They're...
- They're so rich in protein.

1204
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:56,870
Yes, they're really high in protein.

1205
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:59,272
They must be like protein itself.

1206
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,640
Yes, they're the source of protein.

1207
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,176
Their size and colors are different...

1208
00:49:03,344 --> 00:49:05,078
from those from the South Pacific.

1209
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:07,614
The South Pacific ones are more white,
while these are yellow, right?

1210
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:08,582
Yes.

1211
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:12,752
(Batu from Vanuatu,
the larvae of the South Pacific)

1212
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:17,524
(The larvae expert has
already tried some before.)

1213
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:21,029
(Let me see.)

1214
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,596
- Should I compare this to Batu?
- Again?

1215
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:23,696
Really?

1216
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:26,400
- Right now?
- Yes.

1217
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,935
You'll try it and compare them right now?

1218
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,503
I'll get to become a man...

1219
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,171
who's tried larvae
from both the South Pacific...

1220
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,441
and from South America, then.

1221
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:36,343
You'll eat it live?

1222
00:49:36,344 --> 00:49:37,979
(Oceania, South America)

1223
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,512
The grand slam. What's left?

1224
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:41,013
A larva from Africa?

1225
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:42,849
The three-continent grand slam?

1226
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:44,518
The three-continent grand slam?

1227
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:46,252
(Let's go!)

1228
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:48,021
You just have to go for it.

1229
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,325
Gosh, it exploded!

1230
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,227
Why is he doing that?

1231
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:57,926
It's so tough.

1232
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:00,896
It's too chewy.

1233
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,465
- It's different.
- Really?

1234
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:05,834
- It's totally different.
- How different?

1235
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:07,435
- I'm curious.
- I know, right?

1236
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:09,142
What can I say?

1237
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:11,807
The one from the South Pacific is
a bit more nutty.

1238
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:13,441
This one has a little tartness.

1239
00:50:13,441 --> 00:50:14,509
It's got tartness.

1240
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:16,745
This one has a little tartness.

1241
00:50:16,745 --> 00:50:17,680
It's got tartness.

1242
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:20,779
- I don't like sourness.
- I don't even drink tart coffee.

1243
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:22,974
- You said you liked them.
- I don't.

1244
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:24,169
No, You did.

1245
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:26,621
When you bake a pound cake,

1246
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,357
you dip the grapes in rum
before adding them.

1247
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:31,092
Do you mean panettone?

1248
00:50:31,092 --> 00:50:32,961
Yes, panettone.

1249
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:36,662
It kind of tastes like dipping it
in that rum.

1250
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:38,600
- It's got the taste of rum.
- Rum?

1251
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:40,579
Are you saying
that the worm tastes like rum?

1252
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,629
They have the flavor of rum or whisky.

1253
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:44,606
It has that wooden scent.

1254
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,519
(It tastes like rum?)

1255
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:49,626
He says it's like rum. The drink.

1256
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,536
It's rum flavor.

1257
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,745
- He says it's like rum. The drink.
- It's rum flavor.

1258
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,620
- Enjoy the scent of rum.
- It's so...

1259
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,795
(You want me to try this?)

1260
00:50:58,163 --> 00:51:00,909
(Wiggling its bottom)

1261
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,068
- The bottom...
- Do I eat the anus too?

1262
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:04,993
You start from the anus.
The head is a bit hard.

1263
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,928
- Do you want me to...
- I won't eat its head.

1264
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:07,932
Do you want me to cut the anus?

1265
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:09,648
- I can't cut it.
- No?

1266
00:51:09,648 --> 00:51:10,932
Here. You can try it.

1267
00:51:11,056 --> 00:51:12,534
It's not terrible. It's pretty good.

1268
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:13,835
- I wouldn't offer you otherwise.
- It's so...

1269
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:16,511
I can't...

1270
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:18,170
(Preparing himself)

1271
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,309
This is so... Will I be okay?

1272
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,764
- I'd never be able to try that.
- Me neither.

1273
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:27,476
This is so... Will I be okay?

1274
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,501
- It's fine.
- Can I pray before I try it?

1275
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:32,571
I should at least pray to ease myself.
I don't think I can do this.

1276
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:34,707
- Will I be all right?
- It's not that bad.

1277
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:35,991
- It's food.
- We have a doctor with us, right?

1278
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:37,480
(Dear Lord and doctor, please save me.)

1279
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,123
(Just give it a go.)

1280
00:51:42,372 --> 00:51:44,350
(A big bite)

1281
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,185
Good. It's pretty chewy.

1282
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:51,440
(Screaming)

1283
00:51:53,883 --> 00:51:55,327
I remember.

1284
00:51:56,372 --> 00:51:58,130
Good. It's pretty chewy.

1285
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:01,065
Wait.

1286
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:03,190
Oh, no.

1287
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:05,381
(Screaming)

1288
00:52:05,406 --> 00:52:08,504
(Screaming together)

1289
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:10,144
Oh, no.

1290
00:52:10,259 --> 00:52:11,777
- He's drooling too much.
- Hang on.

1291
00:52:12,102 --> 00:52:14,102
Hang on. Can we rewind that for a second?

1292
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,915
Chef Choi was next to him,

1293
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:19,495
but he started moving away...

1294
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,530
- He ran away.
- as his turn was coming next.

1295
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,488
Tell me about it!

1296
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:26,027
(As soon as he saw Daniel in distress...)

1297
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:28,494
See?

1298
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:31,400
- He switched the order.
- He did.

1299
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,865
- He switched!
- You're right.

1300
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:34,933
- He let Ok Vin go first.
- He went behind Ok Vin.

1301
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:38,828
Look. The order changed.

1302
00:52:38,828 --> 00:52:40,506
- He went to the end of the line.
- See?

1303
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:41,577
He switched.

1304
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:45,444
- Ok Vin.
- What are you talking about?

1305
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,088
(Thanks to Chef Choi, Ok Vin is next.)

1306
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:50,049
- It tastes like rum.
- Nonsense!

1307
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:52,451
(I hate tartness.)

1308
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:54,853
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's got tartness.

1309
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:56,288
She ran.

1310
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:58,055
I honestly can't.

1311
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,809
I tried the roasted rat yesterday,

1312
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:01,927
but I could never try that.

1313
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:03,128
Not that.

1314
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:04,400
- Please.
- Ok Vin!

1315
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,364
Not that.

1316
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,931
Let's try it with the cameras off, then.

1317
00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:09,331
What are you talking about?
Stop chasing me!

1318
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:10,536
- I'm going to run away.
- Here.

1319
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:12,237
No! Never!

1320
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:13,688
Never.

1321
00:53:13,803 --> 00:53:15,357
Did she run that far?

1322
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:17,543
- She ran so far away.
- She went so far.

1323
00:53:17,543 --> 00:53:18,877
Even Ok Vin can't handle this.

1324
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:21,480
I can't eat raw food.

1325
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:23,332
(Wild Ok Vin's weakness is raw food.)

1326
00:53:24,562 --> 00:53:25,412
But...

1327
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:29,688
It tastes like...

1328
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:31,890
Do you know those yam roots?

1329
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:33,158
It's a combination...

1330
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:35,661
of a yam root and custard cream.

1331
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:39,031
It only tastes weird
because you know it's a worm.

1332
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:41,533
If you were to eat it like a pudding
without knowing that...

1333
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:45,501
(Trying another bite)

1334
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,742
That's exactly what it tastes like.

1335
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,729
I think I get what Su Young means.

1336
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,514
(Is it over?)

1337
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:01,524
(She catches her breath nearby.)

1338
00:54:01,524 --> 00:54:02,625
Also...

1339
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,988
(Come here, buddy.)

1340
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:07,576
- Ok Vin.
- Don't be silly.

1341
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:09,094
- No.
- Don't come near me.

1342
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,699
Don't you dare come near me.
You've lost your mind.

1343
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,698
You'll be eaten by a lion
if you stay there.

1344
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,969
Don't come near me!

1345
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:18,280
- Fine.
- Go!

1346
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,130
Go away!

1347
00:54:19,594 --> 00:54:21,259
Go away, lunatic!

1348
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:26,698
What?

1349
00:54:28,744 --> 00:54:29,841
Ok Vin.

1350
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,153
(Roasting them with care)

1351
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,609
(Precious)

1352
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:34,820
What's happening?

1353
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,085
It keeps getting out.

1354
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,156
Isn't that one still moving?

1355
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,791
They're alive, right?

1356
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:39,825
Yes, they're alive.

1357
00:54:40,356 --> 00:54:42,959
(Grilling them over charcoal
until golden brown)

1358
00:54:44,427 --> 00:54:46,665
- Try it.
- We even put cooking oil on them...

1359
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:48,534
and added salt and pepper.

1360
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:49,568
That doesn't look so bad.

1361
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,249
(What does
charcoal-grilled suri taste like?)

1362
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:54,273
This is tasty.

1363
00:54:55,865 --> 00:54:58,014
(Yum)

1364
00:54:58,644 --> 00:55:00,412
- It's like beef tripe.
- Yes.

1365
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:04,149
It's fatty,

1366
00:55:04,376 --> 00:55:06,452
chewy, and has lots of protein.

1367
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:10,055
- And salty.
- That looks like beef tripe.

1368
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,791
It's really good.
You won't be disappointed.

1369
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:14,196
- Try it.
- It's very good.

1370
00:55:14,196 --> 00:55:15,046
I'm fine.

1371
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,027
- I should have added more salt.
- I hope he tries it.

1372
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:18,877
No, thanks.

1373
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:20,231
It's good.

1374
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,568
(Acting pouty)

1375
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:24,269
It's really good.
I wouldn't give it to you otherwise.

1376
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:25,671
- Why do you look so lovely?
- He's cute.

1377
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:27,940
- I had it yesterday too.
- Right.

1378
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:31,153
(He smells it first.)

1379
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:32,337
(Opening up)

1380
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:34,146
(But he closed it immediately.)

1381
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,715
- Even I'm eating it.
- Exactly.

1382
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:38,350
- Even Ok Vin is eating them.
- Even I'm eating them.

1383
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:41,811
(Wild Ok Vin provokes him.)

1384
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:46,658
(He shuts his eyes tightly
and takes a bite.)

1385
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:47,826
It's not as bad as you think.

1386
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,962
- It's pretty good, right?
- I wonder what the texture is like.

1387
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:53,778
This would...

1388
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,102
taste so great
if it was deep-fried with batter.

1389
00:55:57,713 --> 00:55:59,338
(Chef Choi's surprising review)

1390
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:02,708
The skin is really tough when it's raw.

1391
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:04,731
But when you grill it,

1392
00:56:04,755 --> 00:56:06,902
it becomes crispy
like the skin of beef tripe.

1393
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:09,448
- And there's some juice inside.
- Is that like beef's large intestines?

1394
00:56:09,448 --> 00:56:10,298
Exactly.

1395
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:12,885
It's a silkworm pupa on the outside
and beef large intestines on the inside.

1396
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:13,938
Silkworm pupa on the outside.

1397
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:16,889
That would taste good. I bet it's crispy.

1398
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:18,457
We could add more salt to that.

1399
00:56:19,301 --> 00:56:20,926
What is she bringing?

1400
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:22,254
(She brings them something
in a blue basin.)

1401
00:56:24,637 --> 00:56:26,208
(What's wrong?)

1402
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,833
(What terrified even Wild Ok Vin?)

1403
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:31,870
She's startled.

1404
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:34,528
Oh, my gosh.

1405
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:38,110
That's a crocodile tail.

1406
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,060
She's giving us the whole thing?

1407
00:56:43,115 --> 00:56:45,182
Do we have to trim it from scratch?

1408
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:46,485
Did she take out the innards?

1409
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,487
She did.

1410
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:50,222
The belly is cut open.

1411
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:55,227
She had already cut it open
and took out the guts.

1412
00:56:57,086 --> 00:56:58,207
(You can easily cook it now.)

1413
00:56:58,207 --> 00:56:59,731
With such a benevolent smile on her face,

1414
00:57:00,056 --> 00:57:00,906
she trimmed that?

1415
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:03,001
- It's headless.
- She looks like a lady...

1416
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:04,836
on "Hometown Report," going, "Try it!"

1417
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,993
"Try our potatoes!"

1418
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:09,825
"Come visit our region!"
That's what it is.

1419
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,876
Goodness.

1420
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:12,744
What did you say you'd cook
with the crocodile?

1421
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:16,415
I suddenly have a lot on my mind
because it's not a fillet.

1422
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,851
I think the meat will crumble
if I cut the legs off.

1423
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:23,455
Or you can debone the tail
and use the meat...

1424
00:57:23,522 --> 00:57:26,658
to make spicy stir-fried crocodile.
Everyone would enjoy that.

1425
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:29,031
(Spicy stir-fried crocodile?)

1426
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:30,946
- Spicy stir-fried crocodile?
- What should we call it?

1427
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:32,121
Crocodile stir-fry?

1428
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:33,265
- Crocodile stir-fry?
- Spicy stir-fried crocodile.

1429
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:35,237
(Let's think.)

1430
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:42,064
But it's a kid's birthday party,
so gochujang will be too spicy for them.

1431
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:44,375
"A kid's birthday party?"

1432
00:57:46,347 --> 00:57:49,949
(On their way back home
after catching piranhas)

1433
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,717
When's your birthday, Lup?

1434
00:57:52,284 --> 00:57:53,134
Your birthday.

1435
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,075
January 20.

1436
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:57,356
January 20?

1437
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:59,625
It's soon.

1438
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:00,626
Really?

1439
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,428
What do they do on birthdays here?

1440
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:10,572
The villagers gather and share a meal.

1441
00:58:11,247 --> 00:58:15,227
Oh, like a village feast.
They have a birthday party.

1442
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,075
So, they eat delicious food.

1443
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:18,043
She seems so innocent.

1444
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:19,678
We should cook seaweed soup for her.

1445
00:58:22,483 --> 00:58:24,716
He's going to make a birthday meal.

1446
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,253
I'll debone the crocodile
so you can cook it.

1447
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:29,655
Have you deboned it before?

1448
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:30,872
No.

1449
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,157
Debone a crocodile?

1450
00:58:32,624 --> 00:58:34,443
I bet he's never done it before.

1451
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:37,729
Deboning meat is pretty much the same
as you cut it along with the bones.

1452
00:58:37,754 --> 00:58:39,031
- Really?
- Is it?

1453
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:40,075
Seriously?

1454
00:58:40,075 --> 00:58:41,950
(A child's birthday meal made
of a crocodile, an Amazonian predator)

1455
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:42,868
We should start.

1456
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:46,104
Are you sure "a child's birthday meal"
suits that photo?

1457
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,847
(Ridiculous)

1458
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,875
A birthday meal made of crocodile meat.

1459
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:54,476
(He brings his secret weapon
just for the crocodile.)

1460
00:58:56,515 --> 00:58:57,949
That's overwhelming.

1461
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:01,787
(Chef Choi's first time deboning
a crocodile after 31 years)

1462
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:04,109
This must be the first debone crocodile
on a TV Show ever.

1463
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:04,990
He's right.

1464
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,892
I call this knife Asuka.

1465
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:09,428
You normally hear a slicing sound,
but this one is just silent.

1466
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:10,529
Because it's so sharp?

1467
00:59:10,996 --> 00:59:13,165
That knife must cut incredibly well.

1468
00:59:15,724 --> 00:59:16,574
Goodness.

1469
00:59:17,409 --> 00:59:19,838
Have there been any Korean chefs
who deboned a crocodile?

1470
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:21,383
(Crunching)

1471
00:59:22,578 --> 00:59:24,242
(He intimidates us with his forearms.)

1472
00:59:24,242 --> 00:59:25,510
I've never seen that before.

1473
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,329
The bones are incredibly hard.

1474
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,474
We're watching him debone...

1475
00:59:30,498 --> 00:59:31,583
a crocodile.

1476
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:35,157
(Separating the tail)

1477
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:39,068
(It looks gruesome from the beginning.)

1478
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:41,359
Is it very hard?

1479
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,961
- It's seriously hard.
- Is it?

1480
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,363
The meat feels...

1481
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:46,698
- like monkfish.
- Monkfish.

1482
00:59:46,802 --> 00:59:48,734
- Monkfish meat.
- The meat is tender,

1483
00:59:48,734 --> 00:59:51,403
but the skin is like armor.

1484
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,171
An armor. I bet.

1485
00:59:54,906 --> 00:59:55,992
- You know what?
- What?

1486
00:59:57,383 --> 00:59:58,383
It smells like chicken.

1487
00:59:58,383 --> 00:59:59,416
- Really?
- Yes.

1488
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:01,883
(Smelling)

1489
01:00:01,883 --> 01:00:03,716
It totally smells like chicken.

1490
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:06,616
It's like the smell you get
at a chicken meat market.

1491
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:07,783
Really?

1492
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:10,349
- It smells just like raw chicken.
- Seriously?

1493
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,049
I've cooked with frogs before,

1494
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:14,649
- and frogs have a fishy odor.
- That's right.

1495
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:17,755
But crocodile meat doesn't
smell fishy at all.

1496
01:00:18,522 --> 01:00:20,755
The bones are so hard.

1497
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:23,689
(He cuts it with all his strength,)

1498
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,855
(but it won't even budge.)

1499
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:28,722
Oh, you have to chop it like that.

1500
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:30,155
The bones are too hard.

1501
01:00:31,955 --> 01:00:32,989
It's really strong.

1502
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:38,355
The locals probably grill
a whole crocodile with bones in it.

1503
01:00:38,755 --> 01:00:39,689
I guess so too.

1504
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:43,589
Gosh, this is going to be tough.

1505
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:45,989
The skin is super hard.

1506
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:47,655
(The meat is stuck
right under the steely skin.)

1507
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:50,322
(His second secret weapon 2)

1508
01:00:50,322 --> 01:00:52,989
(A chef's shears)

1509
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,089
That sound is...

1510
01:00:55,089 --> 01:00:56,855
(Struggling)

1511
01:00:56,855 --> 01:00:58,255
What the...

1512
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,355
Is it really that hard?

1513
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,755
I can easily crack a lobster with these,

1514
01:01:05,622 --> 01:01:08,389
- but it won't work for this.
- The shears for lobsters won't work?

1515
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:10,122
It must be as hard as an armor.

1516
01:01:12,022 --> 01:01:13,322
My hand hurts.

1517
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:19,289
You wouldn't be able to break it
even with an arrow.

1518
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:20,822
- It'll bounce off.
- It won't pierce through.

1519
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:23,355
You must've deboned
all kinds of meat so far.

1520
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:24,789
How hard was deboning a crocodile?

1521
01:01:25,322 --> 01:01:27,055
- This tops everything.
- It's at the top?

1522
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:29,255
I've caught a sheep before.

1523
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:31,789
I've deboned all kinds of animals,

1524
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,655
- Beef bones?
- but it's tougher than beef bones.

1525
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:35,822
- It's as hard as steel.
- Really?

1526
01:01:36,722 --> 01:01:40,689
(Even the top-class chef struggles
to remove its skin.)

1527
01:01:41,655 --> 01:01:45,789
(He tries removing it with Asuka,
his favorite knife.)

1528
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:48,555
(Showing his capability as a chef
in a serious manner)

1529
01:01:48,555 --> 01:01:49,689
That's so cool.

1530
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,155
(With its sharp blade,)

1531
01:01:55,155 --> 01:01:56,955
That's unbelievable.

1532
01:01:56,955 --> 01:01:57,955
(he separates the meat from it.)

1533
01:01:57,955 --> 01:01:59,622
The skin is thick, for sure.

1534
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:00,855
(This won't be easy.)

1535
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:04,155
The spine and skin are connected.

1536
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:07,189
(To make matters worse,
the skin is connected to the spine.)

1537
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:08,122
Really?

1538
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:11,855
(This is interesting.)

1539
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:13,879
Gosh!

1540
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:18,055
(Choi's blade slides into the meat
without resistance.)

1541
01:02:18,055 --> 01:02:19,455
This is unbelievable.

1542
01:02:19,455 --> 01:02:20,289
Oh, my.

1543
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:24,589
- My gosh.
- Finally.

1544
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:28,622
He separated it so incredibly.

1545
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:31,189
That was so cool.

1546
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:32,655
- That was awesome.
- It really was.

1547
01:02:32,655 --> 01:02:34,055
It was your first time trying,
but you did well.

1548
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:37,089
(The meat that he separated from the skin)

1549
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:39,589
(He cuts it into bite-size pieces
for the children.)

1550
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,989
He's separating the meat
from the bones, right?

1551
01:02:42,722 --> 01:02:43,689
It's like a crocodile fillet.

1552
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:48,589
The meat looks tasty.

1553
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:50,789
- Right. The meat looks so good.
- It's soft.

1554
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:52,889
The neck.

1555
01:02:53,289 --> 01:02:54,155
Loin.

1556
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:57,522
- The belly.
- It looks legit.

1557
01:02:57,522 --> 01:02:59,289
He put it in the shape of a crocodile.

1558
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:00,155
Su Young.

1559
01:03:01,222 --> 01:03:02,089
Yes.

1560
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:04,089
I got them all ready.

1561
01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:05,422
Thank you.

1562
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,622
You're truly amazing.

1563
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:13,155
You're really extraordinary.

1564
01:03:14,122 --> 01:03:15,322
- That's the neck.
- The neck.

1565
01:03:15,322 --> 01:03:16,355
- There's the loin.
- The loin.

1566
01:03:17,055 --> 01:03:19,122
(Neck meat, loin)

1567
01:03:19,122 --> 01:03:21,789
The belly, the thigh, and the tail.

1568
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:23,422
(Chef Choi is
on a different level, indeed.)

1569
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:25,022
- But the meat looks so good.
- Thank you.

1570
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:27,389
- You're the best.
- He's amazing.

1571
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,022
You're the best.

1572
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:30,307
(Perfectly deboned for kids)

1573
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:33,789
What will you make with crocodile meat?

1574
01:03:33,789 --> 01:03:36,289
- That's cool.
- Each part will have a different texture.

1575
01:03:36,289 --> 01:03:37,455
(What kind of dish will they make?)

1576
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:39,255
Crocodile.

1577
01:03:39,755 --> 01:03:42,789
(I'm the crocodile meat chef today.)

1578
01:03:43,055 --> 01:03:46,189
What kind of dish will they make
out of the crocodile meat?

1579
01:03:47,955 --> 01:03:49,555
I have to marinade the crocodile.

1580
01:03:49,555 --> 01:03:50,755
(He seasons it with salt and pepper.)

1581
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:53,155
He seasons it with salt.

1582
01:03:54,322 --> 01:03:55,622
He minces the ginger.

1583
01:03:57,289 --> 01:03:59,389
(He minces the ginger
and puts it on the meat.)

1584
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,355
I like to season my chicken
with ginger too.

1585
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,489
It was like chicken,
so I thought it'd work.

1586
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:05,655
- It does look really like chicken meat.
- Yes.

1587
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:09,422
- That looks like starch.
- Yes, starch.

1588
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:11,322
Removing bad odors.

1589
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:13,622
(What in the world will he make?)

1590
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:17,089
(He cuts the crocodile fillet
into bite-size pieces.)

1591
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:18,822
No one would guess what meat this is.

1592
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,189
I know.

1593
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,789
It looks like you're filleting monkfish.

1594
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:24,455
- It looks similar to it.
- Right. That's how it looks.

1595
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:26,455
(It goes into the batter.)

1596
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:30,489
What's he doing?

1597
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:32,922
(Is he deep-frying the crocodile meat?)

1598
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:34,255
My goodness.

1599
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:37,089
Oh, my.

1600
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,609
It's a sweet and sour crocodile, actually.

1601
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:42,809
Kids really love it.

1602
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:44,009
Kids always like fried food.

1603
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:46,476
(Sweet and sour crocodile)

1604
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:48,009
- Sweet and sour crocodile?
- What?

1605
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:50,409
- What is that?
- It looks tasty, right?

1606
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,958
If I were a crocodile, it'd hurt my pride.

1607
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:52,892
Why is that?

1608
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,891
I'm such a strong animal,

1609
01:04:54,915 --> 01:04:55,901
but they turned me into this dish.

1610
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:56,725
Goodness.

1611
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,392
- Those eyes...
- It became a deep-fried, sweet dish.

1612
01:04:58,392 --> 01:05:01,158
- It's treated like chicken meat?
- Yes, I'd feel so upset.

1613
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:02,592
(The Amazon crocodile's pride is hurt.)

1614
01:05:03,325 --> 01:05:06,525
The kids must be trying it
for the first time.

1615
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:07,458
They were so surprised.

1616
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,458
I also make fritters
when my daughter's friends come over.

1617
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,792
- And sweet and sour pork is popular.
- You can't beat that.

1618
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:14,592
It looks so nice.

1619
01:05:16,392 --> 01:05:18,858
(Crocodile, the predator of the jungle,)

1620
01:05:18,858 --> 01:05:20,125
It looks amazing.

1621
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,925
(turned into a crispy,
sweet and sour crocodile.)

1622
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:25,492
It strove so hard to survive
in the Amazon...

1623
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:26,625
only to become a sweet and sour dish.

1624
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:28,525
It's fried, nice and golden.

1625
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:29,458
Sweet and sour crocodile.

1626
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:33,792
(How will the sweet
and sour crocodile taste?)

1627
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,325
- That looks tasty.
- I wonder what it'd be like.

1628
01:05:35,325 --> 01:05:36,325
It looks really good.

1629
01:05:36,325 --> 01:05:37,792
Pour the sauce on it.

1630
01:05:37,792 --> 01:05:39,958
- No, you should dip it in the sauce.
- Really?

1631
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:40,858
Of course.
(Blowing)

1632
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:44,658
(First, he takes a bite
without the sauce.)

1633
01:05:44,658 --> 01:05:46,292
That crunchy sound.

1634
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:47,158
It's tastier than chicken.

1635
01:05:47,158 --> 01:05:48,858
- Really?
- It's much better.

1636
01:05:53,758 --> 01:05:54,758
Do you want to try a piece?

1637
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:57,558
Daniel always comes over
when a dish is ready.

1638
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,725
- He followed the smell.
- He must've been watching.

1639
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:03,158
(The childish Daniel wants to try
the tasty dish before anyone else.)

1640
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:04,861
It looks good.

1641
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:07,625
(Adding lime juice for Daniel)

1642
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,858
Try it. You must be hungry.

1643
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:09,933
I bet you're starving.

1644
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:10,958
(Crispy)

1645
01:06:11,925 --> 01:06:12,792
It must be really tasty.

1646
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:19,392
- Isn't it better than chicken?
- Yes.

1647
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,477
The meat is so delicious.

1648
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:25,758
This is really good.

1649
01:06:29,092 --> 01:06:31,292
(Devouring it)

1650
01:06:31,292 --> 01:06:33,458
I wonder what it tastes like.

1651
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:35,358
It looks tasty even at a glance.

1652
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,825
It just looks like it.

1653
01:06:36,825 --> 01:06:38,058
It doesn't have a gamey smell at all.

1654
01:06:38,058 --> 01:06:39,492
That's so interesting too.

1655
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,958
- It lives in the freshwater, right?
- Yes.

1656
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:44,525
I'll make the sauce now.

1657
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,825
I used lime as we didn't have vinegar.

1658
01:06:47,825 --> 01:06:48,958
(Slicing it quickly)

1659
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:54,525
That must be healthier
than the original sweet and sour sauce.

1660
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:58,025
We didn't use refined sugar, so yes.

1661
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:01,592
(He boils it down with starch water
until it gets thick enough.)

1662
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:05,658
I put starch in the sauce.

1663
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:08,092
- That's the real sauce.
- So, that's how you made it.

1664
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,458
- You're pouring the sauce on top.
- That's right.

1665
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,625
They need to try the original dish.

1666
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:14,025
You need to dip it.

1667
01:07:14,025 --> 01:07:16,099
They need to try it
with the sauce on top first.

1668
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,292
(Sweet and sour crocodile
for kids in the Amazon)

1669
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:21,158
That's unbelievable.

1670
01:07:22,092 --> 01:07:24,658
- It looks appetizing.
- It really does.

1671
01:07:25,192 --> 01:07:27,925
(They're making seaweed soup,
the highlight of a birthday feast.)

1672
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:28,825
Are you stir-frying seaweed?

1673
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:30,492
Yes, we're making seaweed soup.

1674
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:33,092
- Did you bring the seaweed with you?
- Yes, we did.

1675
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:34,992
I usually bring it with me...

1676
01:07:34,992 --> 01:07:36,625
because there's always someone's birthday.

1677
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,925
It must be their first time
trying seaweed too.

1678
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:41,658
It was their first time in their lives.

1679
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,625
- I should add a lot of water, right?
- Yes.

1680
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,858
For us, it's tasty
with a lot of seaweed in it, though.

1681
01:07:46,858 --> 01:07:47,925
Stop.

1682
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:50,692
(Are water and seaweed all they need?)

1683
01:07:52,825 --> 01:07:55,025
I guess there isn't
any source of protein for this.

1684
01:07:55,025 --> 01:07:57,025
You should stir-fry some beef,

1685
01:07:57,025 --> 01:07:58,292
but there's no beef.

1686
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:01,044
(Choi appears before Ok Vin,
who's looking for the source of protein.)

1687
01:08:04,092 --> 01:08:08,325
I guess we don't have anything like beef
to add to this soup, right?

1688
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:10,392
You can...

1689
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,925
put crocodile bones.

1690
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:16,258
What? Crocodile bones?

1691
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,192
I mean...

1692
01:08:17,925 --> 01:08:19,325
- Seriously?
- Crocodile bones?

1693
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:21,492
- Do you mean that?
- For the broth.

1694
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:24,558
(Crocodile bones)

1695
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,792
Would it taste okay, though?

1696
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:29,358
(The combination of crocodile bones
and seaweed soup?)

1697
01:08:29,892 --> 01:08:32,825
The meat tastes similar to chicken.

1698
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:35,011
- So, the bones must be like ribs.
- Should I try adding it?

1699
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:35,902
Go ahead.

1700
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,637
It should be okay, right?

1701
01:08:39,272 --> 01:08:40,073
Should I put this one?

1702
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,373
- I think we should...
- That's the ribs.

1703
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:42,708
(Adding the whole crocodile bone
that Choi trimmed)

1704
01:08:44,644 --> 01:08:45,777
I'm pretty sure no one has ever put...

1705
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:47,949
the word "crocodile seaweed soup"
as a caption in history.

1706
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:50,001
What even is crocodile seaweed soup?

1707
01:08:50,117 --> 01:08:51,927
It suits you so well.

1708
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:54,220
I mean, you are an experimentalist,

1709
01:08:54,221 --> 01:08:55,588
- who makes new stuff.
- Right.

1710
01:08:55,789 --> 01:08:57,744
- We have to bring it to a full boil...
- Yes.

1711
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:00,259
in order to get milky broth.

1712
01:09:01,896 --> 01:09:04,230
(The crocodile bone is infused well.)

1713
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:06,599
I had never imagined I'd have
crocodile seaweed soup in my life.

1714
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:08,334
(The seaweed soup for a birthday feast)

1715
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:09,536
I wonder what it tastes like.

1716
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:10,804
It's all done.

1717
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:14,483
(The birthday feast prepared
by the BOB friends)

1718
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,151
- Sure.
- Luis!

1719
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,555
(Just for the kids of Bombo Nahe Village)

1720
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:22,191
- There they are.
- Everything there is so beautiful.

1721
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,127
Welcome, beautiful girl!

1722
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:26,562
(A hearty table of crocodile dishes)

1723
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:27,628
- My goodness.
- It's amazing.

1724
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,331
Who knew
I'd have a sweet and sour crocodile?

1725
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:29,875
I know.

1726
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,101
The kids must have loved it.
Look at the finished dish.

1727
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,636
(Crocodile seaweed soup)

1728
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,071
That is a nice birthday meal.

1729
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:38,173
The soup really turned milky-white.

1730
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,808
- Just like bone broth.
- Yes, just like that.

1731
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,109
That was more delicious than bone broth.

1732
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,683
That was just incredible.

1733
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,712
- I'd just gnaw that one down.
- Sweet and sour crocodile.

1734
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:46,148
(Sweet and sour crocodile)

1735
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,749
Sweet and sour crocodile is incredible.

1736
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,550
That's just insane.

1737
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:52,677
(Crunchy deep-fried crocodile
with sweet and sour lime sauce)

1738
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,489
That was pretty fun.

1739
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,926
The fact that I was making
a sweet and sour crocodile itself was fun.

1740
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:00,394
- They're so cute.
- Look at them.

1741
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:01,329
How cute.

1742
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,565
(Tasting her first seaweed soup)

1743
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:04,700
Do you like it?

1744
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,369
It's delicious.

1745
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,705
It's really delicious.

1746
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:10,839
They loved the seaweed soup.

1747
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,940
- Really?
- Kids loved it.

1748
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,809
No one would say no to seaweed soup.

1749
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:14,542
It's their first time.

1750
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,244
- It is quite flavorful...
- Of course.

1751
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,213
and savory.

1752
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,114
Because we put crocodile meat,

1753
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,149
I'm sure they felt...

1754
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,385
- They didn't feel reluctant.
- less reluctant about trying it.

1755
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:27,255
(Among the kids enjoying their food,)

1756
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,424
(these two stand out.)

1757
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,426
- They eat so well.
- Oh, my.

1758
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,393
Boys really dig into it.

1759
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,094
He reminds me of my uncle.

1760
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,596
(His spoon never stops.)

1761
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:36,550
- Have some rice too.
- When he has hangover soup.

1762
01:10:39,095 --> 01:10:40,503
That's Ok Bin's work.

1763
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,037
It's so fascinating. Look at him.

1764
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,304
(Another friend here is...)

1765
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:46,247
(gobbling the entire plate up.)

1766
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,676
You know that kids never eat
what they don't like.

1767
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:49,712
He wants more.

1768
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:51,647
They really love seaweed soup.

1769
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:52,948
The soup might run out.

1770
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:54,582
I know. They're gobbling to the last drop.

1771
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,819
Listen. Everyone loves fritters.

1772
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,688
Deep-fried dishes are loved
by all over the world.

1773
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,157
(Sweet and sour crocodile,
the kids' favorite)

1774
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,558
That's the first sweet and sour crocodile
in their lives.

1775
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,261
(Sweet and sour sauce suits their palate.)

1776
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,869
- They're enjoying it so much.
- Yes.

1777
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,803
I felt rewarded the most at that moment.

1778
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:14,035
I've never had such delicious food
in my life.

1779
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:17,099
He said he had never had
such delicious food in his life.

1780
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:19,975
(Delighted)

1781
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:24,480
It was a delicious dish
that I had never tasted before.

1782
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:27,645
And it made me truly happy.

1783
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:29,017
Thank you.

1784
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,819
She wouldn't forget that day.

1785
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:34,322
This is the only time
to see everyone looking happy.

1786
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,690
(Thanks to Lup,
everyone is having a good time.)

1787
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,059
They genuinely love it.

1788
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,494
That must've really
made you feel rewarded.

1789
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,395
Let's go.

1790
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,297
(They had their last day in the Amazon.)

1791
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,811
(Now, they're off in search
of the third Tasty Mission ingredient.)

1792
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,135
- Thank you!
- Thanks.

1793
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,571
Thank you all. Bye.

1794
01:11:49,172 --> 01:11:50,572
Bye! Luis!

1795
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:58,053
(Leaving the Amazon,
the land of primitive, behind,)

1796
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,450
(they head to the end of the sky,
Andes, Peru.)
