1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,101
(Caribbean Sea)

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,934
(The BOB friends entered Mano Juan.)

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,034
(For the first Tasty Mission
in the Caribbean)

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,734
(The diving team: Ok Vin and Lee Joon)

5
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:19,067
(A crayfish's desperate struggle)

6
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,134
(Overpowering with two hands)

7
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,334
(Two crayfishes)

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,834
(Three crayfishes)

9
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:34,034
(Thanks to General Ok,
each gets a crayfish.)

10
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,034
(A rookie diver Joon)

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,100
(He also succeeded in catching
three lambi.)

12
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:44,727
(With Ok Vin and Joon in their element,)

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,034
(the diving team struck gold.)

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,900
(And)

15
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,967
(A man who dreams of living out
"The Old Man and the Sea")

16
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,900
(He has only one goal.)

17
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,067
(The big fish of the Caribbean,
the swordfish)

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,200
(A fully grown swordfish
weighs up to half a ton.)

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,734
(It is extremely hard to catch.)

20
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:15,521
(When he was waiting
after casting out the bait,)

21
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,034
(things got busy on the boat
all of a sudden.)

22
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:20,867
What's going on?

23
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:24,700
(Something bit the bait!)

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,691
It bit.

25
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,767
Look at how the fishing rod is bending.

26
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:29,942
Did he catch a megalodon?

27
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,130
It's very tight.

28
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,634
(Starting from 554m beneath the surface,)

29
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:38,900
(he needs to reel in the fishing line.)

30
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,391
It's so heavy.

31
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:43,191
I can't reel it in.

32
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,903
(It's not easy to reel the line in.)

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,112
(The fish is putting up a fight too.)

34
00:01:51,137 --> 00:01:52,434
Look how tight it is.

35
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,324
(Su Young does his best to reel it in.)

36
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,624
It's literally a 1-on-1 fight.

37
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,158
It's a 1-on-1 fight with the fish.

38
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:01,258
(He pulls and pulls.)

39
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:04,524
(The battle continued for 30 minutes.)

40
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,446
You'd be absolutely worn out.

41
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:10,791
(His energy slowly reaches its limit.)

42
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,795
It's hard just watching it.

43
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:18,891
(Something starts to appear.)

44
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:19,991
It looks like a shark to me.

45
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,758
- A shark?
- Don't you think so?

46
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:27,851
(The final moment is near.)

47
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,360
(You have to give it your all.)

48
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:37,058
If you manage to catch one like that,

49
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,732
you'll never forget that moment.

50
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,091
- It lasts forever.
- That thrilling pull.

51
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,095
(Judging from its weight,)

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,153
(this one is extraordinary!)

53
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:49,858
(Something gets closer.)

54
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,224
(Its bill is very long.)

55
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:54,058
(It has to be the swordfish!)

56
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,891
- It looks like a shark.
- That must be it.

57
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,424
(Everyone on the boat gets busy.)

58
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,391
(The entire crew came for safety.)

59
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:05,524
We got it. It's close to the surface.

60
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:06,924
It's pulled up.

61
00:03:06,924 --> 00:03:08,658
- There it is.
- I can see it.

62
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:11,224
(Slowly, the swordfish
rises to the surface.)

63
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,724
- Look at that.
- That sword, though.

64
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,791
- Did he actually catch it?
- Is that real?

65
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:19,724
(Su Young keeps reeling it to the end.)

66
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,130
There it is.

67
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,091
It's pulled up.

68
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:31,824
(The swordfish finally reveals itself.)

69
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:32,775
It's here!

70
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:36,324
(That's so big.)

71
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:38,624
He made it.

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,758
(Emotional)

73
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,324
(Finally!)

74
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,324
That's just crazy.

75
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,918
Look at how pink its gill is.

76
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,658
A lot came across in my mind.

77
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:57,158
It was a marvelous experience.

78
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,358
That's amazing.

79
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,591
(After 40 minutes of lonely fight,)

80
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,691
(he gets to hold the swordfish
in his hands).

81
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:04,424
It really looks like a sword.

82
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:05,741
Yes!

83
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:10,584
(Eo Nam Seon made it.)

84
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,391
Gosh, that's so cool.

85
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,624
That deserves applause.

86
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,158
- It's amazing.
- I got it.

87
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,087
I wish it was a bit bigger.

88
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,656
But I got it.

89
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:26,495
- My arms are weak right now.
- Look at its size.

90
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,123
It's so sharp. Touch it.

91
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,901
It's just like a sword.

92
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:35,224
That thing is passed out, though.

93
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,124
It is.

94
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,791
Shouldn't it be flopping?

95
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,924
- Maybe it's worn out too.
- When we pull it up,

96
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:41,458
its lungs expand.

97
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,624
It grows really fast.

98
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,324
That happens when we pull it up
from the deep sea.

99
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,458
- It's the pressure.
- It literally gets sucked out.

100
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,391
It clung to the depths,
refusing to rise...

101
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,624
until it was yanked up in a single moment.

102
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,458
Right.
That's when it dies.

103
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,327
No wonder. The depth matches
the height of Lotte Tower.

104
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,091
- Yes, it's deep.
- It makes sense.

105
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,358
Its gill is bright pink.

106
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,858
(Pink gills show how fresh it is.)

107
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,758
We have to take out the guts...

108
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:08,878
because there could be
harmful parasites inside.

109
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:10,417
I gutted it right away.

110
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,671
It's my first time catching it,
so I'm not familiar with it.

111
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:14,624
I worked with many cods, though.

112
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,491
(Swordfish is a large sea fish
with a long, sharp bill.)

113
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,641
The legendary fish.

114
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:20,691
- That must feel so good.
- It was thrilling.

115
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,524
Do you know how fast that is in the sea?

116
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,858
- It swims up to 80km per hour.
- Right.

117
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,924
- Under the sea?
- Yes.

118
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:26,924
It thrusts its way.

119
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,258
Gosh.

120
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:29,532
That looks delicious.

121
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,432
Just look at that.

122
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,529
Now that I caught it,

123
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:36,265
I am so happy.

124
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,188
They'd love this.

125
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,740
(He gutted it in no time.)

126
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,175
That was awesome.

127
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,758
There we go. It's done.

128
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:51,461
Geez.

129
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:56,258
(It's "Nam Seon and the Sea"
instead of "The Old Man and the Sea.")

130
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,524
- It's absolutely incredible.
- It's amazing.

131
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,658
The wheel is now in Chef Yun's hands.

132
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,624
- With these amazing ingredients,
- Right.

133
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:07,291
- what dishes will you make?
- I'm curious.

134
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,724
- You won't be disappointed.
- Really?

135
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,066
- It's my time to shine.
- Of course.

136
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,568
I can't wait to find out.

137
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,703
Nam No!

138
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:16,472
Ok Vin!

139
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:18,874
What did you catch?

140
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,175
Did he get anything?

141
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:23,385
- I don't think he expected a swordfish.
- No, he would have no idea.

142
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,658
Well, you know.

143
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:26,891
Where are the others?

144
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:27,724
Here.

145
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,084
Ok Vin.

146
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,358
- He's going to prank us.
- Everyone starts with lying.

147
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,091
- I don't know why, but I can't help it.
- What's the matter with you?

148
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,457
- It's funny.
- What is it?

149
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,625
What did you get?

150
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,824
(Behold, it's the life jacket!)

151
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:40,858
Did you really get nothing?

152
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,924
I couldn't get anything.

153
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,433
- For real?
- Really?

154
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,974
I feel so bad.

155
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,391
I got nothing.

156
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,724
(Actually, he feels great,
and he got a prize catch.)

157
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:57,124
(Ta-da)

158
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,058
Look!

159
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,158
That's insane!

160
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:03,742
What is that?

161
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,558
(He flops down to the ground.)

162
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,958
I fought for 40 minutes to catch it.

163
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:11,858
(That's amazing.)
How?

164
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,328
I got it.

165
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,359
How did you catch that?

166
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:17,624
- I caught it.
- It's crazy.

167
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:18,791
I struggled for 40 minutes.

168
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,924
You already gutted it.

169
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,524
Yes, I didn't want it to go bad.

170
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,558
- There are no guts.
- I love it.

171
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:23,991
It's just straight-up insane.

172
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,058
That's mad.

173
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,291
It hits me differently.

174
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,409
I removed the guts.

175
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,758
- That's just impressive.
- Look at it.

176
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,391
It's going to be a feast today.

177
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,658
- Here you go, chef.
- That's insane.

178
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,158
(The big swordfish is given to Nam No.)

179
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:37,058
Take a picture.

180
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,086
It's still so heavy without the guts.

181
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:46,624
(Their eyes are fixed
on this enormous fish.)

182
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,097
How did he catch that?

183
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,599
(In awe)

184
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:53,002
It's intimidating.

185
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:57,391
- You can actually get hurt by it.
- I mean, how?

186
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,790
- That's a weapon.
- It's a spear. How is this possible?

187
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:01,877
It's pretty handsome.

188
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,624
(The majestic figure
that once roamed the Caribbean)

189
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,958
It was heavier with the guts.

190
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,191
(Nam No can't take off his eyes.)

191
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,124
What are you going to make with it?

192
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:13,958
I'm anticipating it.

193
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,991
I made a soy sauce.
So, we'll have it raw first.

194
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,624
(Swordfish sashimi in Nam No's style)

195
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,558
Sashimi would be lovely.

196
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,433
I wonder how it tastes raw?

197
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:25,724
I'll fillet it.

198
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:27,475
- Way to go!
- Let's do this.

199
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,316
This is fantastic.

200
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,824
(Nam No's swordfish filleting show)

201
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:32,491
He looks exhilarated.

202
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,624
This is crazy.

203
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:36,391
It felt like I had a new game console
in my hands.

204
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,060
You were that elated.

205
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,191
- He's so cute.
- Look at him.

206
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:43,452
You loved it.

207
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:46,209
That's me when I got rollerblades
on Children's Day.

208
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,958
It looks like he's excited
with his fish doll.

209
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,707
- He makes me want to catch more.
- He's so excited.

210
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:55,691
(Staring)

211
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:59,258
(Why is Nam No so happy with it?)

212
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:01,074
I don't understand why I'm so excited.

213
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:02,271
So cute.

214
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,754
(His first dish in "Culinary Class Wars")

215
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,615
His eyes are different when he's cooking.

216
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:08,091
(Cod milt and curry butter sauce)

217
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:10,234
So he cooked cod milt for the first dish.

218
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,424
I really wanted to try that one.

219
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,724
(He loves to work with seafood.)

220
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,291
(The seafood lover's seafood dishes)

221
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,758
They look scrumptious!

222
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,391
(During the interview)

223
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,958
A fish that we can eat raw
should be important.

224
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,324
I think we need at least one.

225
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,591
I'd be happy with blue marlin or sailfish.

226
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,565
- To eat raw?
- Yes.

227
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,191
(Nam No hoped for billfish.)

228
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,893
He even mentioned it.

229
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,071
No wonder he was so happy.

230
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,591
(His wish has come true.)

231
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,275
I don't understand why I'm so excited.

232
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:44,791
(Creatures they encountered
in the mysterious Caribbean)

233
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,750
(Crayfish)

234
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,744
I can't wait to find out
what they'll turn into.

235
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,624
Right.

236
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,958
(Swordfish)

237
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,112
The ingredients are extravagant.

238
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:00,048
- It's our fault if it tastes bad.
- Of course!

239
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:01,593
The ingredients are perfect.

240
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,254
- Are you prepping it now?
- Yes.

241
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,288
- You're taking it apart!
- He is!

242
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:12,392
(Getting his precious knife
for prepping the fish)

243
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,814
Should I chop its head off now?

244
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,135
Are you ready?

245
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,770
You're so excited.

246
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,104
(Happy just looking at it)

247
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,205
Approach it with reverence.

248
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,107
Here I go.

249
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,545
(Getting down to taking
the swordfish apart)

250
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:25,712
It looks like Spanish mackerel.

251
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,814
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yes.

252
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,984
- It looks fatty.
- I know.

253
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,421
The knife feels so good in it.

254
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,423
- Isn't the flesh quite tender?
- Yes.

255
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:38,984
It was satisfying to cut into it.

256
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:39,993
It was a good ingredient.

257
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,761
What fish is it similar to?

258
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:45,732
It's like a mix of Spanish mackerel
with regular mackerel.

259
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,833
Is it pretty solid, then?

260
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,836
I can tell from the video
that the flesh is pretty firm.

261
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:54,507
(An ASMR of cutting through the swordfish)

262
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:58,378
- This sound!
- It's the best sound in the world.

263
00:10:58,879 --> 00:10:59,980
(Nam No is continuously in awe.)

264
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:01,881
It feels so different.

265
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:04,150
- Really?
- I'm intrigued.

266
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,352
(In love with the fish)

267
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:08,888
Oh, my!

268
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:18,364
How can chefs handle any ingredient?

269
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,166
- I find it so fascinating.
- You're so cool!

270
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,920
They can even handle
unfamiliar ingredients.

271
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:24,905
It looks like Spanish mackerel.

272
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,373
That was my first time
handling a swordfish.

273
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,542
The fillet looks perfect.

274
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,945
Are you praising yourself?

275
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:33,880
- I know, right?
- Compliment me.

276
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,849
- You did great.
- Thank you.

277
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:39,952
(The giant baby always wants compliments.)

278
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,488
We can get a lot of fillet out of it.

279
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:44,557
We should...

280
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,393
- prop it up.
- Yes, we should.

281
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:49,562
(A swordfish decoration)

282
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:50,463
That's crazy!

283
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,498
Look at him smiling!

284
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,970
(Back to being focused)

285
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,104
He's so cool!

286
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,175
I really want to try its sashimi.

287
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,278
When else would you get to try
swordfish sashimi?

288
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,045
It looks good.

289
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,213
(Fascinated)

290
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:10,817
It's so much fun!

291
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,554
You can tell Nam No loves to cook.

292
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,423
I can feel his excitement.

293
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,367
I'm watching a chef
take apart a fish in person!

294
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:19,225
All right!

295
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,894
(Perfectly filleting the fish)

296
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,964
- That's clean!
- Impressive!

297
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:28,101
What do you do with the bones?

298
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,302
You'll see now.

299
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,872
- Where's the spoon?
- Here.

300
00:12:32,873 --> 00:12:34,374
The spoon? What?

301
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,543
It's perfect timing.

302
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,277
- Is it time?
- Yes.

303
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,347
- I'm too excited!
- Yes, you are.

304
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:43,917
What is he doing?

305
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:45,719
What?

306
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:48,255
I'll scrape it with the spoon.

307
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:52,725
(Scraping)

308
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,427
What is he doing?

309
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,662
(Why is he scraping the bones?)

310
00:12:56,997 --> 00:12:57,997
- What?
- It's amazing.

311
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,832
(Nam No-kase's recommended specialty)

312
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:03,303
What is he doing?

313
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,838
(A special menu for his hungry friends)

314
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,408
That's what you do with Spanish mackerel.

315
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:08,775
- Tartare?
- Yes, tartare.

316
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:11,444
Sushi chefs only serve it to regulars.

317
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,479
- For sure.
- Tartare!

318
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,982
You can only have it
when the chef is breaking down a tuna.

319
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,327
You can't have it on any other day.

320
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,819
That's right!

321
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:23,155
So, it's not something we can get
at a restaurant.

322
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:25,958
Chefs only serve it to regular customers.

323
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:27,961
On the days they break down tuna.

324
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,930
- Really?
- Are we your regulars?

325
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,532
- You're my VIP customers.
- Are we? Amazing.

326
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,502
I've never seen anyone do this.

327
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,604
(Scraping every last bit of meat)

328
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,405
That's precious.

329
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:40,940
For sure.

330
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:42,744
You can only have it there.

331
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:44,276
Meat on the bones is the tastiest.

332
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,281
(The scraped meat is minced
into tiny pieces.)

333
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:48,248
That looks incredible.

334
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:52,252
- The soy sauce smells incredible!
- Look at this.

335
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:53,619
Soy sauce!

336
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:55,455
Is it special soy sauce?

337
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,589
(Nam No's special soy sauce)

338
00:13:57,424 --> 00:14:00,227
(He prepared it in the morning.)

339
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,863
Soy sauce only tastes salty.

340
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,697
Yes, it doesn't blend in with the food.

341
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:07,500
So, I added some flavoring
and cooking wine...

342
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:08,802
to add more flavors.

343
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:11,537
- Is it sweeter?
- Yes, it is.

344
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,106
I keep a 1-to-1-to-1 ratio.

345
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,109
- It's one part sake.
- Sake.

346
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,844
- Sake.
- Yes, sake.

347
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:20,113
- Then, one part cooking wine.
- Cooking wine.

348
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,114
And one part soy sauce.

349
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:24,650
I boil the mixture to let
the alcohol evaporate...

350
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:26,819
and add bonito flakes.

351
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:31,992
I made that soy sauce
to add to some vegetables with rice...

352
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,127
if we couldn't get
any other ingredients to cook.

353
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:35,675
- In case you only had plain rice?
- Yes.

354
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,577
Like rice with fried egg and soy sauce?

355
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,833
You prepared that soy sauce
with a mother's heart.

356
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:42,368
- I had to feed you something!
- You had to!

357
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,203
- You couldn't starve us.
- Exactly!

358
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:45,938
Get ready to eat.

359
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,473
(The tartare is ready with the soy sauce.)

360
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:48,307
All right.

361
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,877
(The last kick)

362
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,379
This is the last kick.

363
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,214
Lime zest!

364
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:57,283
(Adding some fresh lime zest)

365
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,586
- My gosh!
- You're so skilled!

366
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,555
It's easy to make
if I have the ingredients.

367
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,124
That looks incredible!

368
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,626
It even looks pretty.

369
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,494
That's incredible!

370
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,162
(Fascinated)

371
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:10,962
Thank you!

372
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:12,532
- Thank you!
- Hurry and try it.

373
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,501
(Tasting Nam No's special appetizer dish)

374
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,635
I want to try some so badly!

375
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,938
- I'm so curious!
- I know!

376
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,306
It looks unbelievable.

377
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,341
(The hunter gets the first bite.)

378
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:23,376
Do you like it?

379
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,216
It's unbelievably good!

380
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:33,353
- I'm even more curious now!
- Wasabi.

381
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:43,363
It's so good!

382
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,241
(Repeatedly saying delicious)

383
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,999
I can't believe how good it is!

384
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:52,671
Eating swordfish caught in the Caribbean
by the Caribbean...

385
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,074
- will be unforgettable.
- It must've been incredible.

386
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:56,709
(Hemingway, now I understand.)

387
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,978
- I get what you mean now.
- It tastes so fresh.

388
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,449
(Joon is trying some too.)

389
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,051
The meat!

390
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,008
(Eyes widening)

391
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:11,222
It melts in my mouth!

392
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:14,892
He thinks whatever he's eating
at the moment is the best food.

393
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,215
But that was really good.

394
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,151
(Quietly picking up the plate)

395
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:22,254
How was it?

396
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:23,856
(Getting every last bit)

397
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,425
This feels like the reward
for all my hard work until now.

398
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:28,027
I agree.

399
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:30,161
(Flavors suddenly expanded
across the palate.)

400
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,364
The flesh is so tender.

401
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:33,999
Did you starve for days?

402
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:36,878
Did he only have soy sauce with rice
for meals?

403
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,937
It's so tender...

404
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:41,974
that it melts in my mouth.

405
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:44,143
The flesh is tender,
but it also has a crunch burst.

406
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,772
- It has a nice texture.
- Yes, it does.

407
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:50,649
I'm so sad I can't try it.

408
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,050
But it also has a crunchy burst.

409
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:53,441
What is he doing now?

410
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:55,221
He's getting to the main part now.

411
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:58,290
(Trying a piece
before resuming Nam No-kase)

412
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,392
- That's the best.
- Share it with us!

413
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:01,760
Don't do that! Share it with us.

414
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,429
- I'm testing it before serving you.
- Testing it?

415
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:06,498
Tester Nam No.

416
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,930
(Tester Nam No is back to his senses.)

417
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:10,736
(Skinning the fillet first)

418
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:11,737
- He's so good.
- I know!

419
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,772
- He's so fast and good.
- I know!

420
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,178
Are you in awe of yourself?

421
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,416
(Perfect skinning work,
leaving himself in awe)

422
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,684
- He did a perfect job!
- It's precise!

423
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:27,519
He skinned it perfectly!

424
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,589
(The VIPs are very satisfied
with the show.)

425
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,656
It's the belly now!

426
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,392
- That's the belly!
- It's so tasty.

427
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,728
The belly is
the most expensive part of tuna.

428
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,662
It looks dreamy.

429
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:45,304
(The famously precious swordfish belly)

430
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:48,840
(Skinning it perfectly, as always)

431
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,743
- That's amazing!
- I can feel the fat on my knife.

432
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,148
It feels like very fatty Spanish mackerel.

433
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,316
Top-grade Spanish mackerel.

434
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:00,619
(He can feel the rich fat
of the swordfish on the knife.)

435
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,055
This is driving me crazy!

436
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,824
Doesn't it look like meat instead of fish?

437
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:06,258
- For sure.
- It's like meat.

438
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,726
It looks like skirtmeat.

439
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:13,732
(Slicing every piece with care)

440
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,633
That's crazy!

441
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:15,968
(Neatly lining the bite-sized pieces)

442
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,403
That looks so pretty!

443
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,806
- It looks like a yellowtail.
- Right?

444
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:24,376
It has the best traits of all fish.

445
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,579
Digging into it with a knife
feels amazing.

446
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,582
(Showing his best work
as a Japanese cuisine chef)

447
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,516
It sounds so nice.

448
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:34,085
Slice and thud.

449
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,322
(Standing around and watching him)

450
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:37,389
I'm starving.

451
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,357
I can't wait for it.

452
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,927
Let's not have it like Japanese sashimi.

453
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:43,796
I'll chop it up roughly in Korean style.

454
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,965
I'll get chopping.

455
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,199
That's unbelievable!

456
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,802
(Here come the taster pieces.)

457
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,003
He's making slits to add texture.

458
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,040
- To get the sauce in it.
- Yes.

459
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,242
That makes the texture tender
and melt in your mouth.

460
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,044
That's so cool!

461
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:02,748
Take a spoon.

462
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,283
With your special soy sauce.

463
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:06,818
- I'll add it on top.
- My goodness!

464
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:10,022
(Another big kick)

465
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:13,725
- He's adding garlic.
- Here come the garlic slices!

466
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:16,061
That's crazy.

467
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:19,331
(Wrapping sliced garlic
in swordfish sashimi)

468
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,634
(Here comes a bite of Nam No-kase!)

469
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:25,304
How is it?

470
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:26,838
It's so bouncy!

471
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:29,341
- Really?
- It's the best.

472
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,643
Try it already!

473
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:33,145
It's different than earlier.

474
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:37,376
Is it that good?

475
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,145
- What is this?
- Right?

476
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,652
It's bursting with flavors!

477
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:42,721
(Swordfish, you're unbelievable!)

478
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,423
- It's so good!
- I can't believe it!

479
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,958
It's so fatty!

480
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:48,527
- It's unbelievably good!
- So flavorful.

481
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,295
- I'm in disbelief!
- Flavorful?

482
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,430
It's amazing!

483
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:53,799
- Isn't it bouncy?
- Yes.

484
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,394
And the fat bursts when you bite on it!

485
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,021
The soy sauce really brings out
the nutty flavor, doesn't it?

486
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,432
- Exactly.
- It's an absolute delicacy.

487
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,451
Honestly, it's even better this way.

488
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:05,771
Don't we have some soju?

489
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:06,872
She wants what now?

490
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,307
Don't we have some soju?

491
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:09,880
This would be perfect with soju.

492
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,976
- Soju.
- I'd sell my soul for a shot right now.

493
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:14,327
- It's really good.
- I need soju.

494
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,215
You don't have any?
Even the pouched kind is fine.

495
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:19,893
- It's a crime to eat this without soju.
- Seriously.

496
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,147
- Soju.
- This just screams for soju.

497
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,148
It really does.

498
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:26,817
It's insanely good.

499
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:28,919
It's delicious.

500
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,663
It's freshly caught
and prepared in my eyes.

501
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,143
Interesting to see it prepped live.

502
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,041
Totally.

503
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,428
It tastes better
when someone else cooks for you.

504
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:39,997
- It's so good.
- It's really delicious.

505
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:41,966
This is way too good.

506
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,334
It's amazing.

507
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,319
(The sashimi goes into the fridge
for a little rest.)

508
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,169
That one...

509
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:48,761
Once it rests,

510
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,709
- Right.
- the muscle fibers relax.

511
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:53,477
The fat gets richer,
and the quality improves.

512
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,420
Right. Letting it rest makes it
even better.

513
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,158
- You caught conches this big?
- Yes.

514
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:00,484
- Where are they?
- In the back of the boat.

515
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,452
Let's go check them out.

516
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,554
(Heading to the beach to see
the conches they caught)

517
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,019
- It's lambi.
- Lambi.

518
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:06,857
That's what they call it here, lambi.

519
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:10,194
By the way, look at that sunset.

520
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,713
- That's amazing!
- I can't look away.

521
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,231
- It's breathtaking.
- The Sun is so big.

522
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,169
Oh, my. I need to take a photo of this.

523
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,815
That sunset is unreal.

524
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,661
It looks different every day
but always beautiful.

525
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:23,908
It's stunning.

526
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,853
Doesn't it make you want to make a wish?

527
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:28,612
I've never wanted to wish
on the Sun before.

528
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,452
It's massive.

529
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:32,383
- Why is it so big today?
- Should we make wishes?

530
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,784
It's beautiful.

531
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:35,219
That's crazy.

532
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,521
- I need to make wishes.
- I know.

533
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,991
We got only 5 minutes left.
Less than 5 minutes.

534
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:41,841
Really?

535
00:21:42,383 --> 00:21:43,461
Look at the sky.

536
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:47,148
(We hope everyone's wishes come true.)

537
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:48,632
This place is just magical.

538
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:52,369
Where are the conches?

539
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,571
- Right there.
- That's the one!

540
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:54,421
Let me see.

541
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,140
What is this?

542
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,575
We caught them!

543
00:21:57,575 --> 00:21:59,510
You found something amazing.

544
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,804
I've never seen anything like it.

545
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,806
(Heavy!)

546
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,488
What? Who caught the biggest one?

547
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,420
- Ok Vin got the biggest!
- That's wild.

548
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,597
- We caught a bunch, right?
- Yes, we did.

549
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:13,509
Should we prep them here?

550
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:14,658
- Here?
- Yes.

551
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,378
(They meet a local fisherman.)

552
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,881
Need help with that?

553
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:23,037
We want to prep this big lambi we caught.

554
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:25,460
(Let me show you.)

555
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,606
I guess he knows what he's doing.

556
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:28,539
- I know.
- With that?

557
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,875
I told him we wanted to eat the big one.

558
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:31,788
Lambi?

559
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:33,785
That's big, right?

560
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:35,423
- Lambi.
- Conch.

561
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,680
Is that lambi?

562
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,007
(He holds it in one hand...)

563
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:40,215
(and taps it with a hammer.)

564
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:41,065
What is he doing?

565
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:44,499
(Just tapping it like that?)

566
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:46,215
(Making a crack for the knife)

567
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,026
I see. He's cracking it there.

568
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:50,578
(He opens a gap...)

569
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,949
(and cuts the string inside.)

570
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,232
And he cuts the string through the cracks.

571
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:56,275
That's precisely...

572
00:22:58,936 --> 00:22:59,837
My goodness.

573
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,138
(Just the meat slides right out.)

574
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,040
- That's huge!
- That really is, right?

575
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,842
How is it that big?

576
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:08,136
(It's super easy, right?)

577
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:08,986
My gosh.

578
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,114
In one go.

579
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,383
(Is it really that easy?)

580
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:13,514
Very good.

581
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:16,202
You're a pro. A master.

582
00:23:16,377 --> 00:23:17,655
That's really big.

583
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:20,024
Can we eat the insides too?

584
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,071
My gosh.

585
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,629
We don't eat intestines.
We just eat this part.

586
00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:26,130
(The locals only eat the meat,
nothing else.)

587
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,333
They only eat the meat, like abalone.

588
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,050
(Only the flesh is uesd for the locals.)

589
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:33,554
(He even shows how to prep it.)

590
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:34,404
Raw meat?

591
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,370
(What does
fresh Caribbean lambi taste like?)

592
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,942
They usually boil it.

593
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:38,809
Boil it?

594
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:41,204
Is it a conch?

595
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:43,714
It's conch and similar to pen shells.

596
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:45,676
Pen shell.

597
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:51,372
It's not as chewy as you'd expect.

598
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:53,490
It's so good. It's sweet
and like a scallop.

599
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,059
It's got a scallop texture, but chewier.

600
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:58,142
It's sweet and naturally seasoned
by the seawater.

601
00:23:58,696 --> 00:23:59,546
Try it.

602
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,057
- It's crazy.
- You don't need any seasoning.

603
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,033
You don't need anything.

604
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:04,635
(Lambi is full of flavor, even raw.)

605
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:06,704
The ingredients here are so good...

606
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,343
that you don't have to do much
to make them taste great.

607
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:13,077
You didn't need a chef, after all.

608
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:15,176
How could you say that...

609
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:17,522
- when he's right here?
- But the ingredients did all the work.

610
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:20,618
Goodbye.

611
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:25,479
(Nam No's time to shine is coming.)

612
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,617
(Joon tries to remove the meat too.)

613
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:31,552
(Passionate)

614
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,130
He's actually trying to crack it through.

615
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,802
(Suddenly,)

616
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:40,768
(it feels like a sports event.)

617
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:44,585
(The beach turns into a sports field,)

618
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,545
(echoing the sound
of Joon pounding the conch.)

619
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,981
Right on!

620
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:54,015
Right on. I love this rhythm.

621
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:57,254
(He dances like the boss
at the office dinner party.)

622
00:24:57,254 --> 00:25:00,014
- Manager Ryu.
- Right on.

623
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:03,093
(Dancing)

624
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,195
Even the moves look old-school.

625
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:08,530
I couldn't help it. I was excited.

626
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,667
(The old man couldn't hide it.)

627
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,601
That's it.

628
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:12,489
What a man!

629
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,417
Keep going.

630
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:16,526
Pull it out!

631
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:17,812
(Passionate)

632
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,411
(Intrigued)

633
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,880
You should grab it here.

634
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,715
That's it!

635
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:27,468
(Summoning the power
of 6 million gym rats!)

636
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,903
(Muscle!)

637
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,154
- Fail!
- You failed.

638
00:25:30,751 --> 00:25:31,601
Fail!

639
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:33,724
- Why is it so hard?
- It's too hard. It's stuck.

640
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,057
- It's going deeper!
- Joon.

641
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,140
Do you want to try it?

642
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:38,696
I'm exhausted.

643
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:40,422
Should I give it a try?

644
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:42,232
Told you. They're all beach muscles.

645
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:47,395
(Beach muscles don't help you
open conches.)

646
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:48,906
With those muscles?

647
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:51,561
That thing is stuck forever.

648
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:54,411
It was pulling back
like there was a human inside.

649
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:56,747
- Let me.
- It sank deeper again.

650
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:57,988
Right?

651
00:25:58,315 --> 00:25:59,717
- I think something went wrong.
- I got it.

652
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:01,585
- Really?
- No. It just...

653
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,887
Pull it out.

654
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,680
He did it.

655
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:10,829
He did it!

656
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,396
- We did it together.
- We did.

657
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:13,981
Well done!

658
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,300
- We did it.
- Together, we can do anything.

659
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,660
Right on!

660
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,936
(Beautiful)

661
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:22,276
- The old guy's muscles are the real deal.
- Right.

662
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:25,079
- They're not just for show.
- He even caught a blue marlin.

663
00:26:25,104 --> 00:26:27,077
Old guys' muscles are legit.

664
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,107
They don't look flashy,
but they're powerful.

665
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:30,818
He caught the blue marlin.

666
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:32,019
(Screaming)

667
00:26:32,453 --> 00:26:35,116
(Nam No gets ready to cook.)

668
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:36,820
They sound
like they're in "300" or something.

669
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:39,656
I wish I could hang out with them too.

670
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:43,176
Let me try it again.

671
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:46,230
You should stick it right here.

672
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,848
- Let me pull it off.
- Pull!

673
00:26:48,254 --> 00:26:49,104
Try again.

674
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,911
(Big smile)

675
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:55,169
(The youngest just loves
hanging around the older ones.)

676
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:59,610
(Let's pick up the pace!)

677
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,803
(Cutting sounds)

678
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,684
That's incredible.

679
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:09,553
So skilled.

680
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,374
(Smooth, no matter the ingredient)

681
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,324
A man who's good with a knife is
so attractive.

682
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:18,228
- He's really focused.
- He is.

683
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:20,728
(Nam No slices with rhythm and finesse.)

684
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:28,238
Hold on. With the lobsters...

685
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:29,864
If you add some clams...

686
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,449
(What will Nam No make
with these premium ingredients?)

687
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:33,377
I'm about to lose it.

688
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,858
(He rules the kitchen
with his wild cooking skills.)

689
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,752
I haven't felt this competitive
in a long time.

690
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,467
(Crayfish and lambi from the Caribbean...)

691
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:49,393
(transformed by Nam No...)

692
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:53,030
This is going to be an epic jjamppong.

693
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,408
(into a seafood jjamppong stew)

694
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:55,705
Jjamppong?

695
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:58,535
He'll make jjamppong with those?

696
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:00,661
You can look forward to it.

697
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,519
- Really?
- Yes, I'm confident.

698
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:05,591
Right on!

699
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,945
Can you cook rice for me?

700
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:09,246
- Do you want me to?
- Yes.

701
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,096
Okay.

702
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:13,484
- Indica rice is inside.
- It'll take 15 minutes with Indica rice.

703
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,952
- Really?
- Just let me know when you need it.

704
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:16,687
- Got it.
- Good.

705
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:18,630
It'll only take 15 minutes?

706
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,134
Fifteen minutes.

707
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,303
(With seafood jjamppong,
steamed rice is essential.)

708
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,178
Okay.

709
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:28,342
(First, he washes the Indica rice
thoroughly.)

710
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,169
(Then, he adds a piece of kelp.)

711
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,871
Why kelp?

712
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:36,543
As you know, it's full of umami.

713
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:41,311
Plus, alginic acid adds
a little stickiness to the rice.

714
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:44,927
- I'd probably add salt too.
- Really?

715
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,083
Yes.

716
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:50,454
Salt brings out the flavor in carbs.

717
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:51,488
It really does.

718
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:55,092
- Freshly steamed rice is so glossy...
- It adds flavor?

719
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,263
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

720
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:03,684
(While the rice is being cooked...)

721
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:05,969
- What else?
- This...

722
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:08,539
We have to knock them out, one by one.

723
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:09,798
- We'll knock them out?
- Yes.

724
00:29:09,823 --> 00:29:11,808
Crustaceans have blood too.

725
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,447
They do? I had no idea!

726
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:14,511
- Really?
- Yes.

727
00:29:15,078 --> 00:29:16,897
Their blood is clear.

728
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,772
That's creepy.

729
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:20,684
That's too scary.

730
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,040
Hold on.

731
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,111
(Nam No goes straight for the head...)

732
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:25,025
This one right here...

733
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,163
(to knock it out.)

734
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:32,604
Is that its blood?

735
00:29:32,947 --> 00:29:35,299
- Is it?
- That clear stuff dripping is...

736
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:36,374
- Is it its blood?
- its blood.

737
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,436
- It's blood is clear!
- Yes.

738
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,664
- That's not seawater?
- No.

739
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,775
All crustaceans are like this.

740
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,710
- Even the blue crabs?
- Yes.

741
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,679
If you don't remove the blood...

742
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:50,779
You know that fishy smell...

743
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:52,382
- The bitter taste...
- near crab gills?

744
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,585
Then it'll knock out.

745
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:56,194
- After the blood is drawn?
- Yes.

746
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,761
And...

747
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:00,221
hold the body and twist it.

748
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:03,387
(The meat inside comes out.)

749
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,221
- Look at the meat.
- It's plump.

750
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,254
So this is how you separate the head.

751
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:14,387
It's so big.

752
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:19,265
(It's full of meat.)

753
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:20,987
That looks tasty.

754
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:23,854
That's huge.

755
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:25,487
- It's so plump.
- You could...

756
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,854
just grab it and start munching
right away.

757
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:28,621
I actually wanted to do that,
but I restrained myself.

758
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:30,954
It makes you want to tear it off
like a hunk of meat.

759
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,721
- Like this.
- Exactly.

760
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:37,687
(I'll prepare it deliciously.)

761
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:39,187
You can handle all the prep work, Nam No.

762
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:41,454
He can prep all kinds of seafood.

763
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:42,254
I know, right?

764
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,421
- Well...
- You must have a lot of experience.

765
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:46,621
Of course, I should.

766
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:47,954
I've used these a lot.
The offal looks great.

767
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:50,387
(Check out these offal intestines.)

768
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:52,721
- The vibrant orange color means...
- It's extra tasty

769
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,015
- it's super fresh.
- It's fresh.

770
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:55,921
This is amazing.

771
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,121
- My gosh. Seriously.
- What is it?

772
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:00,254
- It smells so good.
- Because it's fresh?

773
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:01,121
Does it smell fresh?

774
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:04,421
- As soon as I open it,
- What's it like?

775
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,387
- I can smell the savory intestines.
- Is it?

776
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:08,121
- It smells like the ocean itself.
- Let me try it.

777
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:09,821
I'm not really getting much of a smell.

778
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,521
- Do you have rhinitis?
- No.

779
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,587
He must have a keen sense of smell
since he's an expert.

780
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:18,487
I've noticed that Nam No goes crazy
when he sees fresh ingredients.

781
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:20,454
This looks amazing.

782
00:31:20,454 --> 00:31:21,554
- I feel pure joy.
- It's huge.

783
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:24,054
It makes me happy just thinking
about you getting to enjoy this later.

784
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:28,154
I prepped the ingredients.

785
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,750
- I'll do that one too.
- This one?

786
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,321
Yes, give it to me. I'll slice it.

787
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:39,821
That looks delicious.

788
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:41,254
(Glowing)

789
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:45,654
It looks so different like this.

790
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,287
- This is...
- It looks so pretty.

791
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:50,454
The texture is...

792
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:52,687
softer than it looks.

793
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:53,954
Abalones are usually hard,

794
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,421
so I make a lot of cuts in them.

795
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,087
Didn't it taste good
when you tried it earlier?

796
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,621
- It tastes like scallops.
- Right.

797
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,354
It's like a scallop of pen-shell.

798
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,454
It has both textures.

799
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,654
Scallop and clam meat.

800
00:32:05,654 --> 00:32:08,187
You'll get a taste of both with this.

801
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:12,187
(I can't resist this.)

802
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:16,854
Sure. He goes first for the best part!

803
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,921
(He's so happy.)

804
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,054
Goodness. He looks so happy.

805
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,725
(I can't help it if it's delicious.)

806
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,321
We had a good harvest today.

807
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,654
I know.

808
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,554
- Puppies, hey.
- Should I get them for you?

809
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:30,354
Well...

810
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:32,887
We have to use the fire,
so they need to move.

811
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:34,221
We're about to start a fire,

812
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,921
so you guys shouldn't be here.

813
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,411
We're going to start a fire.

814
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,521
You know fire. Okay?

815
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:42,887
So, follow me.

816
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:44,188
(Calling them)

817
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:45,921
(Clapping)

818
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:49,554
(Come and play with me.)

819
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:50,921
Turn.

820
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,040
Sit.

821
00:32:53,854 --> 00:32:56,454
That was a huge help.

822
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:57,754
You can start the fire now.

823
00:32:58,187 --> 00:32:59,621
Shall we get started?

824
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:01,754
Yes, let's do it.

825
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:05,954
- Awesome.
- Look at that.

826
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:07,354
Now we get to see it.

827
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,587
- Hold on.
- Okay.

828
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:12,554
I will...

829
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:14,687
put this on the pan...

830
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:17,554
to make the broth.

831
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:20,221
(Is he grilling the crayfish head
on the pan?)

832
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:21,687
Why do you grill it first?

833
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,421
Can't you just boil it in water?

834
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,521
If the water is not
at the right temperature,

835
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,021
- it'll have a fishy odor.
- I see.

836
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:31,621
If I grill it, I can get rid of the smell.

837
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:33,321
- You're getting rid of the smell first.
- Yes.

838
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,754
Since it's partially grilled,
it also gets more flavorful.

839
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:36,654
I see.

840
00:33:37,987 --> 00:33:42,787
(In the pan next to it,
he stir-fries garlic in oil.)

841
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,621
Can you stir-fry this
until it's golden brown?

842
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:47,754
- Before it turns brown?
- Yes.

843
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,354
You just have to keep stirring it.

844
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:50,387
Golden brown?

845
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:52,987
Should I stir it like this?

846
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:53,921
Yes.

847
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:56,254
Hey, this is fun.

848
00:33:57,887 --> 00:33:59,787
It's a beige color right now.

849
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,454
(He stirs the rice paddle excitedly.)

850
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:07,654
(Sizzling)

851
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,487
Now, I'll make chili oil with it.

852
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,687
With garlic and chili powder.

853
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:16,954
(He sprinkles a lot of chili powder.)

854
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:17,821
That's fascinating.

855
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,287
Then,

856
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,454
it'll give off a flavor.

857
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:25,721
I can already smell it.

858
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:27,287
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

859
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:28,121
It has the flavor.

860
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:30,254
But if this turns dark, we're doomed.

861
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:34,721
If you let this garlic burn and turn dark,

862
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,087
- we might not have dinner tonight!
- No way!

863
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:41,121
All I've ever done is make ramyeon.

864
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,587
He just can't cook at all.

865
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:49,221
- I'll try my best here.
- Sure.

866
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:54,021
(He starts stirring it carefully.)

867
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:57,521
(Staring)

868
00:34:57,521 --> 00:34:58,821
I've never done this before.

869
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:01,321
You're amazing when you dance,

870
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,787
but you're a little clumsy here.

871
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:05,287
I'm trying to enjoy this.

872
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:07,487
- Is that right?
- Yes, falling into a rhythm...

873
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:08,721
and taking it easy.

874
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:10,787
I'll add these now.

875
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,687
Oh, okay.

876
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,887
They put octopus, abalones,
and conch in jjamppong.

877
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:19,087
We added lambi.

878
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,321
I'd love to try it when it's stir-fried.

879
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,321
That in itself looks tasty.

880
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:30,621
Every dish is...

881
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:32,887
- It's fun.
- building up those layers of flavor.

882
00:35:33,454 --> 00:35:35,354
Here, I'll add the soy sauce.

883
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,821
I'll add it in low heat.

884
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:40,287
That's really cool.

885
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,987
If it meets with water,

886
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,621
it'll start to splatter.

887
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:44,987
- Really?
- Yes.

888
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,454
It will?

889
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:48,254
I'll put the crayfish now.

890
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:49,454
You're adding it now?

891
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,221
What if it burns?

892
00:35:52,554 --> 00:35:54,287
- No, it'll be fine.
- I don't want to ruin it.

893
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,387
- I'll add some water now.
- Let's do it.

894
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,454
All right.

895
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:01,254
And...

896
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:03,254
don't let it get stuck.

897
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:07,721
(The ingredients for the broth
are finally together.)

898
00:36:08,187 --> 00:36:09,687
It'd be nice to use a broth,

899
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,021
but we have a lot of seafood.

900
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:14,387
(He just pours in plain water,
letting the seafood do the work.)

901
00:36:16,354 --> 00:36:17,421
This is it.

902
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:19,287
It's a soup.

903
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,921
We've been making a soup.

904
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:23,954
That's right. Like jjamppong.

905
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:25,521
I get it now.

906
00:36:25,521 --> 00:36:27,054
- I've seen this whole process.
- Yes.

907
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,521
So this is how you do it.

908
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,921
Should I keep stirring it?

909
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:33,721
No, you can leave it.

910
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:34,821
- Can I leave it now?
- Yes.

911
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:36,287
I'll put on the fire...

912
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,455
and boil the broth.

913
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,087
(While the broth is boiling)

914
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:45,254
(Grilling)

915
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:49,821
That looks tasty.

916
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:51,254
It looks so delicious.

917
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:55,654
This must be great.

918
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:01,321
You can eat it as it is.

919
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,854
Just rip it open and eat it.

920
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,821
It looks so plump and nice.

921
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:07,621
- It's full of meat.
- Yes, the meat.

922
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,787
- I'm so curious what it tastes like.
- Me too.

923
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:13,087
That's unbelievable.

924
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,221
I'd love to try it.

925
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:20,487
So this is how you do it.

926
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,854
- So that it's evenly cooked.
- To cook it evenly.

927
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:27,487
It's game over. What's more to say?

928
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:29,321
Try a bite.

929
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,254
He's trying that?

930
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,821
Only the first bite is so good enough
to make you upset!

931
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,987
This is already perfect,
but you're adding it here?

932
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,054
- Still...
- This alone is a fantastic dish.

933
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:43,887
It's for the broth.

934
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,254
- I'm going to boil it down.
- Really?

935
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:48,987
Isn't it almost a shame to soak them
in the soup?

936
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:49,987
He's not sparing.

937
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:53,087
There's a taste that comes from veggies.

938
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:54,687
It's different from that from sugar.

939
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:58,654
The jjamppong looks good.

940
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,554
The color looks legit.

941
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:02,987
It was all gone
by the time the shooting was over.

942
00:38:03,554 --> 00:38:04,454
Everyone loved it.

943
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:06,821
I'll keep boiling it down.

944
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:09,687
(He tastes the jjamppong broth
that's been completed.)

945
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,354
I don't even have to add salt.

946
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:12,654
You like it?

947
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:16,421
- I love it! So much!
- Really?

948
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,421
- Are you done?
- Yes, it's almost ready.

949
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,021
(The classy and spicy jjamppong broth)

950
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:21,354
It looks scrumptious.

951
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:26,954
- Nam No!
- Nam No!

952
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:27,854
So this is how it feels.
How much would it cost?

953
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:31,487
Shouldn't it be
like 800 dollars at a restaurant?

954
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:32,887
It's good enough to be 500 or 800 dollars.

955
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:35,054
Right? It should be at least 500 dollars.

956
00:38:35,054 --> 00:38:36,654
(The jjamppong soup has priceless flavor.)

957
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:38,821
I added some chili oil.

958
00:38:38,821 --> 00:38:41,587
- It's like spicy fish stew,
- You're something. It's so tasty.

959
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,054
- and it's really good.
- All right!

960
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,587
(Happy Nam No)

961
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:46,687
- It's delicious.
- Usually, it's artificial flavoring.

962
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:48,554
This one is full of crustaceans.

963
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:50,021
- I love it.
- It tastes like jjamppong...

964
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,554
- but an expensive one.
- Right.

965
00:38:51,554 --> 00:38:53,221
The ones you get in fancy hotels.

966
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:54,654
- A fancy hotel?
- Yes.

967
00:38:57,354 --> 00:38:59,987
(He brings out aged swordfish sashimi
from the fridge.)

968
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:00,854
It's aged by now.

969
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:06,121
If I dropped this,
wouldn't it be a comedy show?

970
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:08,054
Right. We have to make it fun.

971
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:11,721
We've come a long way for this moment.

972
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:12,554
So we could try this.

973
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:13,754
I know, right?

974
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,054
Catching fish.

975
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,654
(The first dinner table
in the Caribbean...)

976
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,254
(is full of ingredients
from the Tasty Mission.)

977
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:19,954
- Amazing.
- It's fascinating.

978
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,121
- All those ingredients.
- It's the best.

979
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,287
It tastes better
since it was in the fridge.

980
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:26,113
- It been aged so properly.
- Exactly.

981
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:29,487
This is way better
than yellowtail or tuna sashimi.

982
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:33,121
You can't have this anywhere else.

983
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:35,754
Let me show you a way to eat this.

984
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,321
Yes, please tell us.

985
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:39,621
But if you do this,
you'll gain so much weight.

986
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:40,621
What is it?

987
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:43,654
You'll become like me.

988
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:45,054
(Sesame oil appears.)

989
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:46,921
- If you eat it with that?
- Sesame oil.

990
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,021
I do this for sashimi restaurants.

991
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:51,887
How do you do it?

992
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:54,054
Add one slice of fish.

993
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,849
Dip it in chogochujang.

994
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,251
(Place a slice of sashimi
dipped in chogochujang.)

995
00:39:57,252 --> 00:39:59,887
Then, you put sesame oil
right on top of it.

996
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,623
That's all you need. Nothing else.

997
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:05,559
- That's...
- That was insanely good.

998
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,094
That was the most memorable one.

999
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:08,295
We need to take notes.

1000
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:10,063
- That was unbelievably good.
- We should take notes.

1001
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,232
But we often eat it
with sesame oil and salt.

1002
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:14,001
- But keep watching.
- No.

1003
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:15,176
- It's different.
- We need to take notes.

1004
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:17,078
- What's this? Rice, and?
- It's just chogochujang.

1005
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:19,583
It's nothing grand.

1006
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,118
(A familiar combination of white rice,
sashimi, chogochujang, and sesame oil)

1007
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,719
I wonder what it tastes like.

1008
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,690
I do this so often at sashimi restaurants.

1009
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:27,858
(How good can it be?)

1010
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,328
It's just an ordinary combination.

1011
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,745
(- No way.
- What is this taste?)

1012
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,203
- It's not that special, though.
- We're not exaggerating.

1013
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,236
But it's different, right?

1014
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,038
How is this so good?

1015
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,074
It makes you think,
"How come this tastes so good?"

1016
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,343
- That sesame oil...
- Right?

1017
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:49,513
It's way too good, isn't it? It's superb.

1018
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:50,974
You think you know what to expect,

1019
00:40:51,442 --> 00:40:52,709
but it's completely different!

1020
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,328
I took a bite, thinking,
"Okay, I know this flavor,"

1021
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,387
but it surprised me.

1022
00:40:56,989 --> 00:40:58,822
- That's what I mean.
- We're not faking it.

1023
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,892
- It was surprisingly good.
- I'm surprised it's not so special.

1024
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,894
- But that's...
- Exactly! That's what made me shocked.

1025
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,863
- It's so easy to copy,
- Really?

1026
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,397
yet it tastes unlike anything
I've ever had.

1027
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,500
- It makes you go, "What?"
- You're lying.

1028
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,201
You'll finish
a whole bottle of sesame oil.

1029
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,803
- Yes, you will.
- I'm not exaggerating.

1030
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,171
- Seriously?
- Just any type of sesame oil?

1031
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,672
- The whole bottle.
- Yes, any type.

1032
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,074
These are ordinary stuff
you see every day.

1033
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,010
- But not many people know it, right?
- That's true.

1034
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,445
I could eat this forever.

1035
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,981
(Appetite going up)

1036
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,283
I wish I could go back to that time.
It was so delicious.

1037
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,217
It really was.

1038
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,054
(Moved)

1039
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,423
Where did you find this guy?

1040
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,724
Seriously. Where did you find him?

1041
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,294
I honestly thought
it would taste just as I expected.

1042
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,628
- Yes.
- But it doesn't.

1043
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,896
This smells so good.

1044
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,699
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1045
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,036
You cleanse your palate with that stew
after the richness of the sesame oil,

1046
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,272
- you literally can't stop eating.
- It'd be so refreshing.

1047
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,807
I guess I have to use my fingers!

1048
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,575
I should use my fingers like Nam No.

1049
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:56,319
(Ready to dig in)

1050
00:41:58,121 --> 00:42:01,723
(It's packed with meat.)

1051
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,022
That's how you eat it!

1052
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,756
(A food show expert)

1053
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,426
You finished that in one bite?

1054
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:12,362
That's how you eat it!

1055
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,900
(Wait. This tastes like...)

1056
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:17,968
Did you bite your tongue?

1057
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,469
Did you bite it?

1058
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,870
(It's incredibly good,
it's almost painful.)

1059
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,073
- I love his facial expression.
- He's so expressive with his face.

1060
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,409
(A Nam No emoji of eating food)

1061
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,511
- That's how you eat it!
- Yes. Use your fingers.

1062
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:32,082
(It's literally impressive.)

1063
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,684
- It completely fills my mouth.
- Does it?

1064
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,353
How is it so big?

1065
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,688
(The meat fills his whole mouth.)

1066
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:39,822
- It's huge. Look.
- It's so savory.

1067
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,793
It's like a chicken drumstick.

1068
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:46,253
(See how juicy it is this crayfish.)

1069
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,233
It's so savory, spicy,

1070
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,500
and sweet.

1071
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:51,668
That looks so good.

1072
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,739
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1073
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,074
(Crayfish meat soaked with jjamppong soup)

1074
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,308
It's so savory.

1075
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,080
(One glorious bite)

1076
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,019
There's a taste of success, you know.

1077
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,754
When you eat a full bite of a lobster,

1078
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,056
it makes you think,
"I'm content with this life."

1079
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,360
It doesn't get better than this.

1080
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,661
(Is this the taste of success?)

1081
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:24,101
(Slurping the soup)

1082
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,003
The soup is so unique.

1083
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,440
It's actually relieving my stress.

1084
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:32,276
How can jjamppong soup be so refreshing?

1085
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,678
- Is it the clam?
- Yes, I added clam.

1086
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:38,382
- Lambi is so nice and chewy.
- Yes.

1087
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,641
(The spiciness
of lambi stir-fried in red pepper oil)

1088
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:43,553
- Onions and chayotes.
- Oh, you added chayotes.

1089
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,955
It was so refreshing.
It wasn't greasy at all.

1090
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,491
It hit the spot.

1091
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,328
It had that refreshing kick
like a spicy fish stew, but...

1092
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,696
This could even sober you up
after a whole night of drinking.

1093
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,165
It's the type of taste that wants you
to mess up your stomach.

1094
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,368
You'd want to have that soup
after torturing your stomach...

1095
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,836
- with alcohol all night.
- Exactly.

1096
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,671
I totally get it.

1097
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,706
That looks scrumptious.

1098
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:06,476
- It's insanely good.
- Yes.

1099
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,811
It opens my eyes.

1100
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,046
Why don't we eat a lot today...

1101
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,380
and catch some more tomorrow?

1102
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:16,253
(Aqua Ok Vin is really getting the hang
of this Tasty Mission!)

1103
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:20,524
(Her delicious underwater adventure is
about to begin.)

1104
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,059
- It was worth the effort.
- Yes.

1105
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,094
- It was so worth it.
- This is what we get.

1106
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:33,003
(Their first day in the Caribbean is
coming to an end.)

1107
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,138
(Trudging)

1108
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:40,281
(Joon gets ready for bed.)

1109
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,081
(Taking his shirt off)

1110
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,350
- His stripping again.
- That's practically a sickness.

1111
00:44:50,352 --> 00:44:51,619
No, that's not it.

1112
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,841
The thing about him is
that he strips in every episode.

1113
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:56,294
- Also,
- He finds a way to strip.

1114
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,211
I believe he checks where the cameras are
before he does.

1115
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,727
I honestly didn't know!

1116
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:01,829
What do you mean?
I'm sure you checked them before.

1117
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:08,136
(They accused him of
strategically stripping for the cameras.)

1118
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,173
(He openly gets changed.)

1119
00:45:12,507 --> 00:45:13,407
I should take a shower.

1120
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:15,409
(Time for a shower)

1121
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,905
I was so stinky earlier.

1122
00:45:21,369 --> 00:45:22,202
I'm taking a shower.

1123
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:23,408
(Brushing his teeth first)

1124
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:25,772
How was it?

1125
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:28,061
Hey, honey. How are you?

1126
00:45:28,636 --> 00:45:30,537
I caught a swordfish today.

1127
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:33,060
- It was a meter long.
- Swordfish?

1128
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,408
Yes, swordfish. It was huge.

1129
00:45:34,695 --> 00:45:35,728
Awesome, right?

1130
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:38,965
I miss you, baby.

1131
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,235
Why are you leaving me alone for so long?
Hurry back.

1132
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:43,136
I'll be there soon.

1133
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,430
(Meanwhile, Ok Vin is out of the shower.)

1134
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:53,412
Bugs?

1135
00:45:54,182 --> 00:45:55,315
There were some bugs.

1136
00:45:55,368 --> 00:45:58,470
(Is it the bugs she met in Peru?)

1137
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:02,409
(Her room probably has more insecticide
in it than actual air by now.)

1138
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:06,247
(I refuse to get bitten in the Caribbean.)

1139
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,450
(After thoroughly bug-proofing her room,)

1140
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:10,785
(she heads to sleep.)

1141
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,459
(Nam No, our hardworking chef,
also calls it a night.)

1142
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,133
(Breathing)

1143
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:29,703
(Snoring)

1144
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,340
(Snoring)

1145
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,545
(Everyone falls asleep,
but a few hours later...)

1146
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,847
(A sudden thud)

1147
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:40,981
(Rattling)

1148
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,753
(Someone is in the kitchen
even before sunrise.)

1149
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:47,908
- Oh?
- What?

1150
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,943
(It was Nam No in the kitchen?)

1151
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:52,065
What's he doing?

1152
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:53,433
What is that?

1153
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,198
(Serious)

1154
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,066
(Pouring)

1155
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,003
Are you being serious?

1156
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,588
He's doing that
in the middle of the night?

1157
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,791
(He pours hot water exactly to the line
even when he's half asleep.)

1158
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,260
That has to be the crack of dawn.

1159
00:47:11,312 --> 00:47:13,662
(Precious)

1160
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:18,909
(He gets away from the cameras
with the ramyeon.)

1161
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:21,505
(Slurping)

1162
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:23,440
(Slurping)

1163
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,913
(Slurping after slurping)

1164
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:30,347
This is so good.

1165
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,982
(He slurps the noodles
by himself in the dark.)

1166
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:36,653
After eating that jjamppong
that was worth 800 dollars...

1167
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,655
- I don't need all of that.
- You don't need it.

1168
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:39,756
(The day breaks
while Nam No eats ramyeon.)

1169
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:47,264
(The Caribbean morning sun looks
especially bright and close.)

1170
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:48,632
That's beautiful.

1171
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:53,537
(Day two in Mano Juan is starting.)

1172
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:57,159
(At 6 a.m., their stay in Mano Juan)

1173
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:04,681
(He rinses his mouth
after finishing early morning ramyeon.)

1174
00:48:06,856 --> 00:48:10,192
(And he's washing the pot again?)

1175
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,854
I should eat one more ramyeon.

1176
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:16,170
- One more?
- You're eating another one?

1177
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:17,938
He's eating more!

1178
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:20,673
- That's impressive.
- You're addicted, man.

1179
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:22,543
Wait, why did you even record that?

1180
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:23,943
Are you actually going to air this?

1181
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:26,679
(All his gourmand moments
have been filmed.)

1182
00:48:27,715 --> 00:48:30,183
(He's ready to open the second ramyeon
when it's only 6 a.m.)

1183
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:34,455
Me too. I want some cup ramyeon.

1184
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:36,490
- How many?
- One.

1185
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:37,558
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1186
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:40,764
(He distracts him with another subject.)

1187
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:42,799
They don't have those in this town.

1188
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:46,671
He's acting like it's his first one.

1189
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:48,072
Like I'm preparing food for them.

1190
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:54,378
(As soon as his ramyeon is cooked,
he instinctively takes it...)

1191
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,682
(to where there aren't any cameras.)

1192
00:48:59,163 --> 00:49:00,864
(But this time, we secretly filmed him
anyway.)

1193
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,858
(He eats more noodles
while watching the ocean.)

1194
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:06,295
(Slurping)

1195
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:09,899
(Smacking his lips)

1196
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:11,962
It tastes even better
now that I'm looking at the sea.

1197
00:49:12,964 --> 00:49:14,565
I ate it just to feel that ocean vibe.

1198
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:16,367
- Is that right?
- You couldn't help it.

1199
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:20,134
(He's the first person in the world
to do a whole twirl while eating.)

1200
00:49:24,648 --> 00:49:28,684
(Walking the path of a food expert
with a romantic view)

1201
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:33,009
- That's impressive.
- What do you mean?

1202
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:34,952
You ate three cups of ramyeon
in the morning.

1203
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,453
I only ate 2, not 3.

1204
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:38,608
I only ate 2, not 3.

1205
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,440
(This is a serious matter for a foodie.)

1206
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:42,126
What's that on my chin?

1207
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:45,137
- How many times do you eat it in a week?
- I was wondering the same thing.

1208
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:47,471
I kind of turn into a weirdo
if I don't have...

1209
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:49,600
- at least one every couple of days.
- Really?

1210
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,059
There's a great saying by him.

1211
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,111
He said,
"Always eat ramyeon in even numbers."

1212
00:49:52,112 --> 00:49:53,179
Always eat ramyeon in even numbers.

1213
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,554
It should be at least two bags.

1214
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:56,657
- You wouldn't feel full otherwise.
- You should eat at least two.

1215
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,095
I love all the instant noodles
in the world,

1216
00:50:01,096 --> 00:50:02,998
but I sometimes have noodles without soup
in odd numbers.

1217
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,367
- It's not one.
- Then, three?

1218
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,592
- Three?
- Why are you so serious?

1219
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:08,708
- Because he said odd numbers,
- We thought it was one.

1220
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:10,298
so I just thought...

1221
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:12,308
- he really liked soups.
- Why would you talk...

1222
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:14,179
- And he has only one of them.
- so seriously?

1223
00:50:14,747 --> 00:50:17,324
("Three packs is the minimum
for noodles without soup.")

1224
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,615
Is this going to be aired?

1225
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,040
(He finishes the last drop of soup.)

1226
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:27,881
(This is it.)

1227
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:31,599
It's fantastic.

1228
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,093
What should I cook for today?

1229
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:36,463
Maybe I'll have one more.

1230
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:38,813
He eventually has three.

1231
00:50:38,813 --> 00:50:40,699
I think he definitely had one more.

1232
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,536
(Guilty as charged)

1233
00:50:44,957 --> 00:50:47,315
(Meanwhile, Ok Vin is also up.)

1234
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,908
I feel hungry.

1235
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,177
Should I put some water on to boil?

1236
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:53,178
He's acting like he never had any.

1237
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:55,701
- Every single time someone comes out!
- I'm sick of it.

1238
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:57,860
(The foodie's secret life)

1239
00:50:58,127 --> 00:50:59,317
Should I put some water on to boil?

1240
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,120
No, I'll just crush them.

1241
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:03,821
They said we were running out of time.

1242
00:51:05,346 --> 00:51:07,893
It's so funny that he pretends
he hasn't eaten anything.

1243
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:09,591
With a straight face too.

1244
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:13,198
Do you want some?

1245
00:51:13,355 --> 00:51:14,704
- No, I'm good.
- I knew you wouldn't.

1246
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:17,626
- I'm afraid of puking underwater.
- Okay.

1247
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:20,238
I can't really swim properly
on an empty stomach.

1248
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:23,044
If I do, I get acid reflux.

1249
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:24,482
(Are they going out to the sea already?)

1250
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,183
(She filled her tummy with cup noodles.)

1251
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:30,885
You go to the water right away?

1252
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:32,156
(Let's go hunt our breakfast!)

1253
00:51:33,172 --> 00:51:34,570
(Now, they are changing.)

1254
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,855
- He's without clothes again.
- Oh, come on!

1255
00:51:37,312 --> 00:51:39,003
I didn't even know!

1256
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:44,563
The first thing they do
in the morning is diving for food?

1257
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,798
It's like the daily life
of hardworking fishermen.

1258
00:51:46,798 --> 00:51:49,445
(The two fishermen head out.)

1259
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,203
The weather is nice.

1260
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:53,349
(What incredible weather for a dive!)

1261
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:55,674
Please catch as much as you did yesterday!

1262
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:57,840
- We'll see you later.
- Yes, see you.

1263
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,212
We'll be back after achieving our mission.

1264
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:01,063
Good luck.

1265
00:52:01,081 --> 00:52:03,390
(Our perfectly in-sync diving duo!
What will they find today?)

1266
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,152
Look at how Ok Vin
tied up her hair in one.

1267
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:09,144
We're hitting the sea
first thing in the morning.

1268
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:10,475
It's something new.

1269
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:13,525
We just woke up, and came to swim
in the ocean on an empty stomach.

1270
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,217
(The hunting duo hits the sea
with a light stomach.)

1271
00:52:15,217 --> 00:52:16,886
As we see the rising sun,

1272
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:17,773
Gosh, it's so cool.

1273
00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:19,264
we go off to collect groceries.

1274
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:22,891
(Our hunger comes first
to the lovely vibe.)

1275
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,202
As you can see,
the clouds linger pretty low,

1276
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,537
- and it's just beautiful.
- You're right.

1277
00:52:28,537 --> 00:52:29,397
It's surreal.

1278
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,009
- I feel like I can touch them.
- I know.

1279
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:32,314
(Heading off for the Tasty Mission)

1280
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:33,945
It's beautiful.

1281
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,616
The scenery is picturesque.

1282
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,093
Let's go get some wonderful things again.

1283
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:50,328
(Carrying the glory of yesterday's success
in their hearts)

1284
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:53,306
We went to the deeper water
in the morning.

1285
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:56,001
Way further out in the sea.

1286
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:57,730
(Cutting through
the golden Caribbean waters,)

1287
00:52:57,755 --> 00:52:59,438
- It's splendid.
- I have to agree on that.

1288
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:00,849
(today, they go much further.)

1289
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:02,140
It's amazing.

1290
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:05,310
We use underwater equipment this time.

1291
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,216
- You're going for the harder catch.
- Yes.

1292
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:08,066
Right.

1293
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:11,401
But just look at the water...

1294
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:13,752
- That's marvelous.
- It's awesome.

1295
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,787
(It lives in the deeper,
bluer Caribbean Sea.)

1296
00:53:15,787 --> 00:53:17,489
I wonder what they will catch.

1297
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:20,175
(Today's ingredient for the Tasty Mission:
Lionfish)

1298
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,393
- Lionfish?
- What is that?

1299
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:22,394
Lionfish?

1300
00:53:22,847 --> 00:53:23,895
A lion?

1301
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,665
- You would've seen it at an aquarium.
- You'll know when you see it.

1302
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:29,778
(Within the rich and diverse fishing
grounds of the Caribbean)

1303
00:53:29,878 --> 00:53:33,529
(An intriguing and unknown ingredient
awaits discovery.)

1304
00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:34,606
Oh, I know that one!

1305
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:37,853
- They eat this?
- There's nothing much to eat, is there?

1306
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:39,214
- I recognize it.
- They're all spikes.

1307
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:40,522
- I do too.
- The scary-looking ones.

1308
00:53:40,522 --> 00:53:41,646
It's a famous ingredient.

1309
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:42,914
- Seriously?
- And luxurious.

1310
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:45,584
- How do you eat that?
- I thought i was for a display only.

1311
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:47,569
- So...
- It's poisonous.

1312
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:49,410
It's ornamental and poisonous.

1313
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:52,224
- It's similar to rockfish.
- I see.

1314
00:53:52,224 --> 00:53:54,904
It belongs to the scorpionfish family.

1315
00:53:54,905 --> 00:53:58,006
But the meat is way fatter and harder
with a texture.

1316
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:02,200
I didn't know they use it to make ceviche.

1317
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:05,087
(It's fatty enough to cook it as a steak.)

1318
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:07,269
They say it tastes absolutely amazing.

1319
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:09,875
- Really?
- Yes, it's better than you think.

1320
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:13,082
(The heat will get rid of the poison.)

1321
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:16,979
(Its white meat is also perfect
for fried dishes...)

1322
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:19,067
(and chewy enough to make braised dishes.)

1323
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,085
That should be good.

1324
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:24,620
(It's a hidden delicacy
only who knows go for.)

1325
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:28,830
(The Caribbean versatile ingredient,
lionfish)

1326
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,995
I'd love to taste that.

1327
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:34,957
(Today, we're going to get you.)

1328
00:54:34,957 --> 00:54:36,468
Can you harpoon it?

1329
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:39,538
It's illegal to use a harpoon
to catch fish.

1330
00:54:39,538 --> 00:54:42,729
But it's designated as a harmful species.

1331
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:44,109
- Which allowed us...
- They allowed us to catch them.

1332
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:46,044
to catch it with harpoons.

1333
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,897
(It can only be seen 30m under.)

1334
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:50,015
That's deep.

1335
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:53,031
Yes, we have to go down deeper
to get lionfish.

1336
00:54:54,219 --> 00:54:55,620
How far is it from here?

1337
00:54:56,452 --> 00:54:57,789
It takes about 15 minutes.

1338
00:54:57,942 --> 00:54:59,641
About 15 minutes? Okay.

1339
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,903
(They still need to go 15 more minutes.)

1340
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:05,113
The water should be much colder
where we go.

1341
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:08,975
(Peter, a veteran diver of the Caribbean)

1342
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,213
I think I've seen it in Bohol.

1343
00:55:11,293 --> 00:55:13,138
- While scuba diving.
- You know him?

1344
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,763
No, the fish.

1345
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:16,605
She's talking about lionfish.

1346
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,280
- Oh, the lionfish.
- Wake up!

1347
00:55:18,305 --> 00:55:19,202
Seriously...

1348
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:20,618
- That's hilarious.
- I thought she met him.

1349
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:22,280
He's so unprejudiced.

1350
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:25,641
(He's as pure as the Caribbean Sea.)

1351
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,179
(Glancing)

1352
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:32,661
(Suddenly, Peter looks up something.)

1353
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:33,571
What is he doing?

1354
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:36,565
(Staring)

1355
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:39,531
"Ninja Assassin?"

1356
00:55:41,034 --> 00:55:43,172
- Did he appear in that movie?
- He noticed him!

1357
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:45,483
Hollywood!

1358
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:46,905
"Ninja Assassin?"

1359
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:48,450
(Did Peter recognize him?)

1360
00:55:48,635 --> 00:55:50,218
I watched "Ninja Assassin."

1361
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:51,643
- Really?
- Really.

1362
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:53,595
Have you watched it?

1363
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:55,113
That's crazy.

1364
00:55:56,114 --> 00:55:58,570
- He played the younger Rain.
- Right.

1365
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,959
(I remember you.)

1366
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,154
I was a bald head.

1367
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:05,557
(How is this possible?)

1368
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:06,591
"Kiriko!"

1369
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:08,760
"You can't leave."

1370
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:11,057
"You want to come with you? Where?"

1371
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:12,430
"What's out there?"

1372
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:14,933
"Life. My life is here."

1373
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,786
(A line recited after 16 years)

1374
00:56:17,786 --> 00:56:19,237
- That was excellent.
- Good job.

1375
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:20,809
(I loved that.)

1376
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:24,015
(A surprise fan meeting
in the middle of the Caribbean Sea!)

1377
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:26,535
- You still remember the lines?
- That's incredible.

1378
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:28,749
He'd even read in his dreams. "Where?"

1379
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:30,507
(A fan from Czech watched
his first Hollywood film.)

1380
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:31,728
Poke me, and I'll read the lines.

1381
00:56:32,616 --> 00:56:34,953
We're finally here. That took long.

1382
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:36,821
- That was funny.
- He's a Hollywood star.

1383
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:38,493
The color of the water is just...

1384
00:56:38,493 --> 00:56:42,223
You dive in the middle
of the enormous sea?

1385
00:56:42,223 --> 00:56:44,429
- That'd be so cool.
- We went really far.

1386
00:56:44,993 --> 00:56:46,148
(This is...)

1387
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:48,733
The water is so clear.

1388
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:51,670
(where lionfish inhabit.)

1389
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,405
I can see everything under the water.

1390
00:56:54,899 --> 00:56:56,474
I'm so excited.

1391
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,787
(Mano Juan)

1392
00:56:58,787 --> 00:57:00,445
They're catching all those things.

1393
00:57:01,112 --> 00:57:02,786
This is Zookeper,

1394
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:05,617
and the very special spear guns...

1395
00:57:05,642 --> 00:57:08,109
that are made to hunt lionfish.

1396
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,656
Once you let that go,
it'll shoot like an arrow.

1397
00:57:11,656 --> 00:57:14,069
- It was way more powerful than I thought.
- Right.

1398
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:15,724
- There's recoil, right?
- It's really powerful.

1399
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,429
- That must be dangerous.
- It really is.

1400
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:21,032
Lionfish is a very poisonous species.

1401
00:57:21,056 --> 00:57:21,849
- Okay?
- Yes.

1402
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:24,722
It has 18 spines...

1403
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:28,773
that can inject
highly dangerous neurotoxins...

1404
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,329
into directly under your skin.

1405
00:57:33,808 --> 00:57:34,658
Oh, my.

1406
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:36,776
(One prick from that fin,)

1407
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,355
(you'll feel a burning pain.)

1408
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,230
He's bleeding.

1409
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:42,017
(That's why they use harpoons.)

1410
00:57:42,017 --> 00:57:43,455
Oh, they use it like that.

1411
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,523
He's such an expert.

1412
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:49,257
(However, lionfish is very agile.)

1413
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,396
It's really fast.

1414
00:57:51,396 --> 00:57:54,369
It could be dangerous
if they prick you with that speed.

1415
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:56,000
It slips away so easily.

1416
00:57:56,025 --> 00:57:58,580
(If you fail to get it in one go,
you'll lose it!)

1417
00:57:58,605 --> 00:57:59,604
That's amazing.

1418
00:58:00,555 --> 00:58:04,873
(Now, it's time to meet the lionfish.)

1419
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:08,588
(Taking off)

1420
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,081
He's getting naked again.

1421
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,890
I could describe everything
about your body with eyes closed.

1422
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,385
"Describe his body?"

1423
00:58:14,385 --> 00:58:16,654
That's how much we've seen his body.

1424
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,394
(Boasting muscles, he looks resolute.)

1425
00:58:19,394 --> 00:58:20,942
"You can describe his body?"

1426
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:22,527
No, look...

1427
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:27,275
(I'll take care of today's meal.)

1428
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:29,834
It'd be difficult to wear that like that.

1429
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,210
I was absolutely nervous then.

1430
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,609
- You never dived that deep.
- Yes.

1431
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:38,653
It was so scary.

1432
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:39,988
(Diving 20m is not easy for Joon.)

1433
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,951
(On the other hand, Ok Vin...)

1434
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:47,118
She looks awesome.

1435
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:48,732
(Tieing up her hair...)

1436
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:49,958
(and enjoying the moment)

1437
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,890
I can feel she's confident.

1438
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,092
Should I be the villainess
of the Caribbean?

1439
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:55,160
"The Villainess."

1440
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:57,328
- "The villainess of the Caribbean."
- That sounds great.

1441
00:58:57,353 --> 00:58:58,763
You're The Ninja of the Caribbean.

1442
00:58:58,847 --> 00:58:59,697
I'd like that.

1443
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:01,232
He's the ninja.

1444
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:03,535
(Caribbean Ninja vs. Caribbean Villainess)

1445
00:59:03,535 --> 00:59:05,804
Ok Vin must be so thrilled inside.

1446
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,473
(Today's destination)

1447
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:10,675
That's 20m? It's deep.

1448
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,914
(The 5kg diving weight)

1449
00:59:15,914 --> 00:59:17,649
I see you wore a tank this time.

1450
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:19,017
My goodness.

1451
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:23,892
(Ready to descend
after carrying a hefty 20kg of gear)

1452
00:59:24,756 --> 00:59:26,024
(The tank can hold up to 40 minutes!)

1453
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:27,525
Good. I'm ready.

1454
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,634
(Without any hesitation,
she dives straight into the deep blue.)

1455
00:59:36,568 --> 00:59:37,569
Gosh, look at it.

1456
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:41,106
(Everything is fine.)

1457
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:46,845
(Joon is all nervous,)

1458
00:59:46,871 --> 00:59:50,480
(but carefully checks his equipment.)

1459
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:51,956
Stand up.

1460
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:57,481
- He did well.
- He did great!

1461
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:02,730
(Let's go!)

1462
01:00:03,414 --> 01:00:04,997
(The Villainess and the Ninja
in the Caribbean)

1463
01:00:04,997 --> 01:00:07,864
(Their target is lionfish.)

1464
01:00:07,864 --> 01:00:10,430
Look how clean the water is.
You can even see the bottom.

1465
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:13,030
(Ok Vin goes down first.)

1466
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,797
That must be so much fun.

1467
01:00:14,997 --> 01:00:17,030
Divers would love that view.

1468
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:25,230
(Joon is slowly adjusting underwater.)

1469
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,040
(Ok Vin went deep down
in only a few seconds.)

1470
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,864
- That was fast.
- You can really see the bottom.

1471
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:34,464
She goes down so easily.

1472
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,897
(Aqua Ok Vin feels at home
even deep underwater.)

1473
01:00:36,897 --> 01:00:38,664
Because the water was so clear,

1474
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:40,830
it was stunning.

1475
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:43,264
(Looking for lionfish hiding near coral)

1476
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,930
- You can see everything.
- It must have felt so nice...

1477
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,364
because you could see everything.

1478
01:00:50,497 --> 01:00:55,330
(Take your harpoon!)

1479
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,864
You normally can't catch other fish...

1480
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,730
- wearing a scuba tank, apparently.
- No.

1481
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,397
- Except for lionfish.
- That's right.

1482
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:04,664
They need to be preserved.

1483
01:01:04,664 --> 01:01:06,530
(Joon also comes down
and gets the harpoon.)

1484
01:01:10,497 --> 01:01:11,497
(I'm looking forward to your skills,
Ninja.)

1485
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:13,197
That felt so strange at the time.

1486
01:01:14,764 --> 01:01:18,364
(He's using a harpoon
for the first time in his life.)

1487
01:01:20,997 --> 01:01:23,930
(They start hunting lionfish.)

1488
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,497
- It's as clean as an aquarium.
- Right.

1489
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,997
(They rummage through the coral.)

1490
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:32,930
They look cool already.

1491
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,597
- She found it.
- She must have spotted something.

1492
01:01:45,197 --> 01:01:46,097
What is it?

1493
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:47,664
(Could it be a lionfish?)

1494
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:51,930
(There's something big between the coral.)

1495
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:52,764
There it is.

1496
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,297
Is it a turtle?
It's a turtle.

1497
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,664
(It's a turtle taking a nap.)

1498
01:01:57,664 --> 01:01:58,530
People go there to see them.

1499
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,497
Yes, we dive into the ocean to see them.

1500
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,064
Just watching them makes you feel good.

1501
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:05,930
(A rare sight only in the deep sea)

1502
01:02:06,997 --> 01:02:07,864
It's beautiful.

1503
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,797
- So cute.
- They swim fast too.

1504
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:10,764
I've never seen it taking a nap before.

1505
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:12,264
- Adorable!
- It must be tired.

1506
01:02:12,864 --> 01:02:13,664
Don't touch it.

1507
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:16,064
You'll be arrested
as soon as you hunt that.

1508
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:18,630
As soon as you catch that,

1509
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,597
- they'll arrest you.
- You'll be in handcuffs.

1510
01:02:20,597 --> 01:02:22,130
- Right away.
- "Handcuffs!"

1511
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:27,464
(Their hunt starts on a pleasant note
by spotting a turtle.)

1512
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,730
They must have found one.

1513
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:32,830
What is it?

1514
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,597
(Peter hurriedly gestures to them
to come over.)

1515
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:35,430
What is it?

1516
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,564
(Did they finally find a lionfish?)

1517
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:40,197
I'll never be able to forget that.

1518
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,930
It was the best experience
I've had in my entire life.

1519
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:44,864
What was it?

1520
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:48,597
(Look over there!)

1521
01:02:51,564 --> 01:02:53,397
What is it? Why does it look so...

1522
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:56,897
What is that?

1523
01:02:56,897 --> 01:02:58,097
It's hiding?

1524
01:02:58,097 --> 01:02:59,197
Look how big its eyes are.

1525
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:00,930
- What?
- What is that?
It looks like a ghost.

1526
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,011
Isn't it a stingray?

1527
01:03:03,444 --> 01:03:04,678
- A stingray.
- It's a stingray.

1528
01:03:04,678 --> 01:03:06,811
- Goodness.
- It was gigantic.

1529
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:10,141
Look how big its eyes are.

1530
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:13,074
- It has the eyes of a cartoon character.
- Those are the eyes?

1531
01:03:13,074 --> 01:03:15,074
Are you sure it's not a gill?

1532
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,374
Are the eyes under it?

1533
01:03:16,374 --> 01:03:17,541
Its eyes are in the front,
and the gill is on the back.

1534
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:18,974
- That's the gill, right?
- It is.

1535
01:03:18,974 --> 01:03:20,708
- Oh, that wasn't the eyes.
- It's not.

1536
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,508
- It was a gill.
- You didn't meet eyes with it.

1537
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:23,541
I thought I made eye contact.

1538
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,941
Making eye contact with a stingray was
one of the best experiences in his life,

1539
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:27,841
but they weren't its eyes.

1540
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:28,974
Meeting its gill was...

1541
01:03:28,974 --> 01:03:30,274
- the best experience.
- You met a stingray's gill.

1542
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,641
It was looking at me
like a cartoon character.

1543
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:35,141
- It's obviously...
- I was like, "How lovely!"

1544
01:03:35,141 --> 01:03:36,408
You found out today
that they weren't eyes, right?

1545
01:03:36,408 --> 01:03:37,408
I just found out.
- The gill.
- Bummer.

1546
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,482
At least you found out now.

1547
01:03:43,974 --> 01:03:47,274
(It's as big as a person.)

1548
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:49,674
That's incredible.

1549
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:51,822
(Caribbean whip ray:
A ray representing the Caribbean Sea,)

1550
01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:53,674
(known
for its exceptional camouflage abilities)

1551
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:55,908
- See? It's huge.
- It does look like an eye.

1552
01:03:55,908 --> 01:03:57,541
See? It's enormous.

1553
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:58,874
- It's bigger than me.
- It looks nice.

1554
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:00,141
- It does look like an eye.
- Exactly.

1555
01:04:00,141 --> 01:04:01,041
- It seems docile.
- That's fabulous.
It's so mystical.

1556
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,508
(What are these fish following the ray?)

1557
01:04:06,508 --> 01:04:07,508
What are those?

1558
01:04:09,124 --> 01:04:10,086
(Remora: A sharksucker...)

1559
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,616
(that feeds on parasites and scraps
from larger sharks or rays)

1560
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:13,108
- It's enormous.
- That's so cool.

1561
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:14,108
"Remora."

1562
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:17,208
- It looks amazing.
- I can never forget the encounter.

1563
01:04:17,874 --> 01:04:19,074
(They're back to looking for lionfish.)

1564
01:04:19,074 --> 01:04:20,441
Lionfish are so hard to find.

1565
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:23,241
- The water is so clear, though!
- They were so rare.

1566
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,341
They can hide well, and they're fast.

1567
01:04:27,308 --> 01:04:29,541
(She spotted something?)

1568
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:33,841
(Ok Vin stops by the coral.)

1569
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:38,341
What did she find?

1570
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,408
(Among the colorful coral reefs
and fishes)

1571
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,674
- It's there!
- There it is!

1572
01:04:47,674 --> 01:04:49,241
That was tricky.

1573
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:51,074
- It's so hard to find them.
- It is.

1574
01:04:51,074 --> 01:04:52,674
- It's wearing camouflage.
- It's so hard to tell.

1575
01:04:52,674 --> 01:04:55,241
(I found a lionfish!)

1576
01:04:56,408 --> 01:04:59,074
(She cautiously approaches.)

1577
01:05:00,774 --> 01:05:01,974
- In one go?
- No way.

1578
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:04,308
(Loading the harpoon)

1579
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,774
(It swiftly hid behind the coral.)

1580
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:11,841
- Oh, it's fast.
- So close!

1581
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,874
- It's fast, isn't it?
- It's so fast.

1582
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:16,974
I should have tried it from a distance.

1583
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:18,674
- I got too close to it.
- Right.

1584
01:05:18,674 --> 01:05:19,649
It noticed.

1585
01:05:21,174 --> 01:05:23,141
Why is it so infuriating to watch it run?

1586
01:05:23,608 --> 01:05:24,941
- You can't see it anymore.
- Right.

1587
01:05:25,974 --> 01:05:27,941
It doesn't even run in the same direction.

1588
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:29,541
(Oh, I lost it.)

1589
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:30,641
Oh, no.

1590
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:35,541
(At that moment, Peter speeds up.)

1591
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:36,408
What's happening?

1592
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,941
Peter knows where to find it.

1593
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:43,074
(Will Peter catch it?)

1594
01:05:46,641 --> 01:05:48,241
- He caught it.
- He caught it.

1595
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:50,608
(Their first lionfish)

1596
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:53,674
It's gushing poison right now, isn't it?

1597
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:55,141
It's huge!

1598
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:56,541
It's so big.

1599
01:05:57,608 --> 01:06:00,174
(Peter nailed it!)

1600
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,250
(The diver with 16 years of experience)

1601
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:04,074
That was impressive.

1602
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,008
(Joon gets anxious as Peter's excelling.)

1603
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:08,974
- The Ninja.
- He should catch one too.

1604
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:11,874
(He goes through the coral thoroughly.)

1605
01:06:11,874 --> 01:06:14,408
Even when you rarely see one,
it's too fast to catch.

1606
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,741
What is he going to do?

1607
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,441
He's running out of oxygen.

1608
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:22,741
It was deep, so you lose oxygen faster.

1609
01:06:22,741 --> 01:06:23,713
That's true.

1610
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,108
And you need to leave some
for swimming back up.

1611
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:27,441
- Exactly.
- You need to leave some.

1612
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:30,274
(Things aren't the same as yesterday
when they had abundant food.)

1613
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:33,741
(They don't stop searching.)

1614
01:06:36,674 --> 01:06:37,541
Oh, no.

1615
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:44,208
(Joon spots...)

1616
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,474
- Is it a lionfish?
- Really?

1617
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:46,974
(a lionfish.)

1618
01:06:46,974 --> 01:06:48,008
- I don't see it.
- Me neither.

1619
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,041
- They're too hard to find...
- There it is!

1620
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,541
because they hide so well.

1621
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:56,808
- That's the one.
- Will Joon catch it?

1622
01:06:57,974 --> 01:06:59,041
Please catch it.

1623
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,174
Show us what you've got, Joon.

1624
01:07:00,174 --> 01:07:01,141
- Show us.
- Yes.

1625
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:03,941
(He carefully loads his harpoon.)

1626
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:06,974
You should get longer airtime
than Ok Vin this time.

1627
01:07:06,974 --> 01:07:08,574
- I think he'll catch it.
- Right.

1628
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:10,808
- Oh, no.
- No!

1629
01:07:11,474 --> 01:07:13,774
(But he calmly takes aim again.)

1630
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,508
Fire!

1631
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,308
Okay.

1632
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:19,941
I think he missed it.

1633
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:26,341
- He caught it.
- Did Joon do it?

1634
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:28,274
(He shot it,
but it's not the correct spot.)

1635
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:29,574
Try again.

1636
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,474
(It's a fierce power struggle
between the coral now.)

1637
01:07:32,474 --> 01:07:33,683
You need to hit it properly.

1638
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:36,941
It hasn't completely pierced the fish yet.

1639
01:07:36,941 --> 01:07:39,441
(It puts up a tough fight
even when it's hit by a harpoon.)

1640
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:53,269
(Joon successfully caught a lionfish.)

1641
01:07:53,618 --> 01:07:54,971
- Beach muscles.
- Good job.

1642
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,439
- My muscles did the job.
- Your beach muscles.

1643
01:07:57,439 --> 01:07:59,006
(His beach muscles did the job.)

1644
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,611
(Good job, Ninja.)

1645
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,414
That's a relief.

1646
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,017
It must be so much fun.

1647
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:10,952
- That was the most fun part for me.
- I bet.

1648
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,421
Joon is really cool.

1649
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,790
It's such a rare experience.

1650
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,826
- You're really like the Ninja.
- What is it?

1651
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,996
(And!)

1652
01:08:21,295 --> 01:08:22,662
(A hand signal to go above water)

1653
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:24,098
- Oh, no.
- That's a shame.

1654
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,535
- He has to go up now.
- But he just got the hang of it.

1655
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:28,738
It'd be nice to explore some more.

1656
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:29,905
It's for safety.

1657
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,405
(Going up to replace the air container
and check his condition)

1658
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:33,710
He has to replace it.

1659
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,110
It takes a while to go up too.

1660
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:37,511
- About 15 minutes, right?
- Yes.

1661
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,114
- To go above water?
- Yes.

1662
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:40,483
You can't go all the way up at once.

1663
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,450
Because the water pressure changes.

1664
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,620
(They're disappointed
as they acquired less than yesterday.)

1665
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:50,124
(Checking the lionfish first)

1666
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:51,628
That's a big one.

1667
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,797
One of them is quite large.

1668
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,666
It kind of looks like a rockfish.

1669
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,101
(At a closer look,
the spines are sharper.)

1670
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:01,304
He caught a big one.

1671
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,039
(Did I really catch this?)

1672
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,708
- It's really big.
- It's huge.

1673
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:10,011
(Even the hunter himself is
surprised at how it looks.)

1674
01:09:10,144 --> 01:09:11,481
I respect you.

1675
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,250
(Don't mention it.)

1676
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,653
(Peter's and Joon's)

1677
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,389
Even the small one looked scary.

1678
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,393
One thing I regret is...

1679
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,362
that I couldn't catch
other kinds of fish that I wanted...

1680
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:31,265
- with this equipment on me.
- You're right.

1681
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,134
That was a bummer.

1682
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:35,803
I wish there could've
at least been more lionfish,

1683
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:39,472
- but they were so scarce.
- Right.

1684
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:42,209
- The sea is too clear.
- That was a shame.

1685
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,081
(The first battle against lionfish
ended in disappointment.)

1686
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,849
I guess you can't stay underwater
for too long.

1687
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,553
I used up most of the air
in the air container.

1688
01:09:50,577 --> 01:09:52,755
Let's go, Captain.

1689
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:54,956
Let's go.

1690
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,556
(Setting off to another zone
to catch the lionfish)

1691
01:09:56,557 --> 01:09:57,627
Are they setting off again?

1692
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:01,961
Since they're in the sea,
they might as well go in twice.

1693
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:03,366
You must've used two air containers.

1694
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:04,634
That's a lot.

1695
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,905
(Peter seems restless all of a sudden.)

1696
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,041
What's wrong?

1697
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,411
Is it something about the weather?

1698
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,747
You guys are lucky.

1699
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,881
Whale and dolphins.

1700
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:20,815
- What is it?
- Where?

1701
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:26,221
(A whale, you say?)

1702
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,391
(Stirring)

1703
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,427
The whale.

1704
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,730
(They can see something
above the water in the distance.)

1705
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,433
Let's hurry up.

1706
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:40,602
Hey, it's huge.

1707
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,839
I think it'll come back up soon
to breathe.

1708
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,075
It came up.

1709
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,044
(Your chances of seeing one is
just one percent.)

1710
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:50,045
That's amazing.

1711
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,114
(A once-in-a-lifetime luck)

1712
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,081
See?

1713
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,151
It's so close by.
