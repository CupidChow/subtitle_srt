(When the time is ripe,)

00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,037
(just activate the trap
and catch her in a cage.)

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,039
(When the time comes,)

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,280

like an animal.)

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Help!

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,920
There's a rare beast in the cage.

11
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,879
It must be offered to His Majesty
after the hunt ends.

12
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Take good care of it.

13
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,519
You must never open the red cloth

14
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,879
and shock the beast.

15
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,599
- Yes!
- Yes!

16
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,919
This is a forest for hunting.

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,460
There might be random arrows
flying around.

18
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,240
Follow me.

19
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,879
A few arrows won't hurt me.

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't need you to care about me.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,240
You give me a fragrance pouch,

22
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,090
but you don't let me take care of you?

23
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,120
It's just a fragrance pouch.

24
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,330
Your Lordship need not
be concerned with its importance.

25
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,759
Xi Yan,

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,719
are you all right?

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm getting revenge myself.

28
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,759
Don't go after a running enemy.

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,080
Let's treat your injury first.

30
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,800
Why did you save me today?

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
I didn't mean to save you.

32
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,280
Just now,

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,080
I only did it to avoid the arrow.

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,520
Sure.

35
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,719
Say you regret saving me now
and I'll believe in you.

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,479
Now that it has come to this,
why should I say I regret it?

37
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,319
If you won't say that,

38
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
I'll assume that you care for me.

The Vice Minister of

hunted a pair of
Greater White-fronted Geese.

Prince Duan

51
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,399
hunted a honey badger.

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,360
What is this? It's such a big beast.

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,199
What is this?

54
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Your Majesty.

55
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Apparently,

56
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,040
this is a rare beast hunted today.

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,639
It is sent to be appreciated
by Your Majesty especially.

58
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,079
Good.

59
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,879
Open the cloth.

60
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,920
I want to appreciate it

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
with everyone else.

62
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,319
Yes.

63
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,160
Isn't that Princess Wan'er?

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,319
I've only seen humans and beasts
sleeping together in storybooks.

65
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,959
I didn't expect this
to happen in real life.

66
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,720
She actually has such a fetish?

67
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
I pity Governor Pei.

68
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,000
Ridiculous!

69
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,279
Father,

70
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,199
she knocked me out

71
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,680
and trapped me in a cage!

72
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,759
I, Xi Yan,

73
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,920
greet Your Majesty.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,420
Do you know that harming a princess

75
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,380
carries the same crime
as lying to the emperor?

76
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,990
You should be beheaded
according to the law.

77
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,439
Your Majesty, punishing someone
with just Her Highness' testimony

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
will ruin the authority of Liang's law.

79
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,990
Your Majesty, please investigate this.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,360
This has nothing to do with me.

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,879
I am just a woman.

82
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,560
How could I knock out
a beast and Her Highness

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
and trap them in a cage together?

84
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,560
You...

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,399
You had a helper.

86
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,600
I am just a concubine
in the Governor's Residence.

87
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,000
How could I afford a helper

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,759
to carry out this grave crime with me?

89
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr. Pei,

90
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,800
did the Qilin Guards

91
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,879
find anything?

92
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,160
Governor, I found this in the cage

93
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,279
where the princess
and the beast were trapped.

94
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,350
This is the Fragrance
of the Sacred Realm.

95
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Lighting it can make people
become enamored.

96
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,600
I've cleaned

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,519
every trace.

98
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,820
However, the princess
has a noble status.

99
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,390
Doing this equals lying to the emperor.

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,959
I only want to protect Xi Yan.

101
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,519
Your Majesty, the Qilin Guards
have investigated thoroughly.

102
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,310
They haven't found anything yet.

103
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
According to what you said,

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,879
this is

105
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,319
an unresolved case.

106
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,839
Is the princess

107
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,439
going to be tricked for no reason?

108
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,720
I dare not lie to Your Majesty.

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
The culprit of this case

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,079
is here.

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,399
Speak!

112
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,680
The person who trapped
Her Highness in the cage

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,279
was Governor Pei.

114
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,560
That's impossible.

115
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,160
Governor Pei?

116
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:51,959
You...

117
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,319
Lowly servant!

118
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,240
That's nonsense!

119
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,610
Falsely accusing a superior official
of the imperial court

120
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
is also a crime
that carries capital punishment.

121
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,240
I dare not lie.

122
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
I saw the Qilin Guards

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,360
carry this cage myself.

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,439
Moreover,

125
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,000
the Governor and Her Highness

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,700
had fragrance pouches
that came in pairs.

127
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,319
It was given to Her Highness
by the Governor.

128
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,079
I think

129
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,319
the fragrance pouch

130
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,639
contains a secret.

131
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
This fragrance pouch
helps repel insects and dissolve poison.

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm sure it can help My Lordship
show your skills at the hunting ground.

133
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,000
The hunt is over.

134
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,279
It's time for His Majesty
to reward others.

135
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Governor,

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,639
what reward will you get today?

137
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,559
Your Majesty, the imperial physician
has checked the fragrance pouches.

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,080
Her Highness's fragrance pouch
has a secret fragrance inside it

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,480
that provokes wild beasts
into aggressive attacks.

140
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,879
This fragrance pouch...

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
You gave me

142
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,039
this fragrance pouch!

143
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,650
Your Majesty, please investigate it.

144
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,940
Her Highness
has always seen me as an enemy.

145
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,279
She tried to take my life multiple times.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,180
Why would she put on
a fragrance pouch I made?

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,159
Your Majesty, please seek justice for me.

148
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,960
Yu,

149
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,440
this wretch is even harming you now.

150
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,159
You can't spare her easily.

151
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,320
Mr. Pei,

152
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,759
what else do you have to say?

153
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,879
I have nothing else to say.

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,919
(The Governor's Residence)
Scheming to ruin the Princess's reputation.

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,000
You can no longer lead the Qilin Guards.

156
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:47,631
Return the Qilin Token
to the imperial court.

157
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,560
You have been suspended
to reflect on your mistakes.

158
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,470
The consequences
will be evaluated at a later time.

159
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,879
That's all.

160
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
(Sorry, Pei Yu.)

161
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,320
(No one can stop me
from finding the truth.)

162
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,759
(If all the evidence is pointing
at Prince Duan's Residence,)

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,820
(I have no choice
but to participate in the scheme.)

164
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,187
(The Governor's Residence)

165
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,837
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

166
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,679
Governor, everyone is afraid of you
because you hold military authority.

167
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,600
Now,

168
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
this is an opportunity for them.

169
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,399
Enough.

170
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
Lady Xi Yan is too much.

171
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
She knew you'd never do anything to her.

172
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,919
Thankfully, the Qilin Guards
only obey your command.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,260
Even if you lose the Qilin Token,
it doesn't affect much.

174
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:53,112
(Renowned for Virtue and Brilliance)

175
00:10:53,187 --> 00:11:00,262
(Prince Duan's Residence)

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,120
We are here.

177
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,039
You may get off.

178
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,879
When I was in the Governor's Residence,

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
I did something bad to you, Xiao.

180
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
You must first give

181
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,240
before you take.

182
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,279
If you don't do something,

183
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,759
you can't earn his trust.

184
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,039
Right now, he has been reprimanded
by His Majesty

185
