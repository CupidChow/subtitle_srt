00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,480
It's you.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,199
The sword's edge is chillingly sharp,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,879
and it leaves its sheath silently.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,990
It is indeed a fine sword.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,000
It perfectly suits a hero
like Your Lordship.

00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:50,012
♪Loneliness, how do I cross it?
Whom have I ever failed?♪

7
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,679
You are quite forward.

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,240
Your Lordship's renown

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,399
is known to everyone.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Where the sword points,

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,799
all enemies retreat.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,690
Furthermore, you cherish beauty
and understand intentions,

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,120
a gentleman as pure as jade.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,719
It is my honor

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,519
to serve Your Lordship.

You want to serve me,

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,799
then I must see

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,280
what abilities you possess.

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,700

Last time,
with the Moonlit Neon Dress Dance,

27
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,599
I was not fully satisfied.

28
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,959
Since you wish to serve me today,

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,799
then dance until I've had my fill.

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,700
♪Time rests upon the strings,
waiting for someone to brew a pot of tea.♪

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
Please forgive me, Your Lordship.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,439
My skills have been
neglected for a long time.

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,810
I'm afraid it will be difficult
to obey today.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,000
I will surely practice diligently
another day

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,280
to please Your Lordship.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
(So, these eyes)

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,840
(can be so deceitful.)

=Episode 5=
(I am Shen Changning. I am not dead.)

40
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,840
For a concubine to enter the residence,
the Madam must give her consent.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,199
This is the rule.

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,039
Moreover, you were raised
in the palace since childhood,

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,159
your status is extremely noble.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,919
How can the Governor
act on his own authority?

45
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,479
Your Highness,

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,599
they simply do not regard you

47
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,199
as important at all!

48
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,960
He is doing this on purpose.

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,680
I thought the person
in his heart was dead,

50
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,199
and no other woman
could ever catch his eye.

51
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,840
I never thought

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,199
another dancer, extremely similar

53
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,199
to Shen Changning would appear.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,759
Xi Yan, is it?

55
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,479
Don't think that just because you

56
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,479
bear a slight resemblance to her,

57
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,240
and the Governor
glances at you a few times,

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,079
that I wouldn't dare touch you.

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Qin Feng!

60
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,839
What is going on here?

61
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,170
The serving girls who were dismissed
the day before yesterday.

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,910
Weren't they supposed
to have been sent away?

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,490
The rule of the Governor's Residence is

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,839
to be carried out horizontally,

65
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,390
which is also called dismissal.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,079
Lowly servants like you

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,079
are like ants.

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
How easily you can be killed.

69
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,759
(He is just a dagger wielded
by the Emperor.)

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,639
(His hands are stained with blood
and the souls of the wronged.)

71
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,759
(How could I possibly
rely on such a man?)

72
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,000
(His so-called affection)

73
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,879
(is merely a chess piece
on my path to revenge.)

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,160
Xi Yan, don't think that
just because you received

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,959
a few approving glances
from the Governor

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,920
that you can become arrogant with favor.

77
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,639
If he ceases to shield you,

78
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
as glorious as you are today,

79
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,240
tomorrow

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,199
you will die just as miserably.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,519
You are wrong.

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
I am no man's plaything.

83
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,439
My fate

84
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,959
is only in my own hands.

85
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,319
Life or death

86
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,360
will not be dictated by anyone else.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
Your Lordship, all the serving girls
in the backyard have left.

88
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,439
I have informed them
that this was Xi Yan's intention.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,990
They all resent Xi Yan for vying
for favor and being jealous.

90
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,790
No one suspected

91
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,790
that their identity as spies
had already been exposed.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,959
They even wished to obtain your favor.

93
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,600
However, Xi Yan's background is special.

94
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,880
Why does Your Lordship
still keep her in the Residence?

95
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:14,920
Qin Feng.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,920
Do you still remember

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,519
our days in the gladiator arena?

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,920
Back then,

99
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,257
we lived worse than pigs
and dogs in the arena,

100
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,893
yet we still had to fight wild beasts.

101
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,831
Only by defeating the wild beasts

102
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:36,187
could we qualify to fight people.

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,620
A slight mistake

104
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,306
would lead to certain death.

105
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,519
In those days,

106
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,879
if Your Lordship hadn't led me

107
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,911
and fiercely carved out a path of blood,

108
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:49,752
I'm afraid

109
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,959
I would have died long ago.

110
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,240
Your Lordship means...

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,860
There were hidden schemes
and power struggles in the inner courtyard

112
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,839
and Xi Yan fought her way through them.

113
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,490
Her experience is similar to
what you went through back then.

114
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,959
The danger in the backyard now

115
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,439
is less than
one in ten thousand of the arena.

116
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,639
She has already taken the first step,

117
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,840
which shows she has some ability.

118
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:25,411
If she can truly
make the position of Madam vacant,

119
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,360
I might just look
upon her with new eyes.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,490
Your Lordship, something has happened!

121
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:32,879
Let's go.

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,160
Young Lady.

123
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,040
You're here.

124
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Useless!

125
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,990
You couldn't even manage a trivial thing
like blinding Xi Yan.

126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
You even caused Yu to be angry at me.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,319
Quickly dispose of her.

128
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,399
Go.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,680
Chunyun.

130
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,480
Chunyun.

131
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,800
Save me.

132
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,000
Save me.

133
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,279
After Young Lady saved my life,

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
I found a job

135
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
at this teahouse.

136
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,920
I finally survived.

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,720
You mentioned in your letter

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,879
that you have news
of Shen Yunqi and Lian.

139
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,900
That day, the Princess gave the order,

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
and I had no choice
but to sell them off.

141
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
A few days ago,

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
I found out about

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,839
the bondswoman who sold them that day.

144
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
Where are they now?

145
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
I only found out
about Lian's whereabouts.

146
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:38,866
She...

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,320
She was sold by the bondswoman
to a man named Li Gang.

148
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,654
Li Gang, the former steward
of the Shen Residence?

149
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Where is he?

150
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,600
The Eastern Suburb Residence.

151
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,720
(Shen Residence Steward, Li Gang)

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,519
I'll talk!

153
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,759
I'll talk!

154
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,320
I was in the Shen family

155
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,440
to search for
the Shen family's treasure map.

156
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,720
Treasure map?

157
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,879
It is rumored
that the treasure in the map

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,039
can...

159
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,320
Can make a person richer than a nation.

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,450
Your Lordship,
someone infiltrated Li Gang's Residence.

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
Who?

162
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,840
Xi Yan.

163
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,600
(It's her again.)

164
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,440
Lian!

165
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,500
(Shen Residence maid, Lian)

166
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,290
Li Gang is worse than an animal.

167
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,879
Who are you?

168
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,240
How do you know me?

169
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,120
Come on.

170
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,759
Don't say so much.

171
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:43,525
Follow me.

172
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,175
The Shen family is gone.

173
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,360
The Young Master is missing.

174
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,879
Young Lady is dead too.

175
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,440
I no longer have

176
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
anywhere else to go.

177
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,200
I might as well die.

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,279
Lian.

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,960
Lian,

180
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,720
look at me.

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,799
Look at me.

182
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,159
I am Shen Changning.

183
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,000
I am not dead.

184
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,720
No!

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
How could you be Young Lady?

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
Listen to me.

187
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,639
Lian,

188
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
why don't you sit on the bed?

189
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,480
My body is already soiled.

190
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,519
I don't want to dirty
Young Lady's bed anymore.

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,399
Nonsense.

192
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:57,742
Come.

193
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,000
What is purity,

194
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,120
and what is filth?

195
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,159
Everything lies in the heart,
not the body.

196
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,039
The one who is filthy is Li Gang,
and those wearing human skin

197
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,759
but acting like beasts.

198
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,679
The filthy ones are those
who cannot tell right from wrong,

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,279
who cannot reason,

200
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,639
and throw all the dirt

201
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,960
onto the victims.

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,960
It's alright.

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
It's alright, Lian.

204
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,120
Everything is over.

205
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,840
We still have each other,

206
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,017
don't we?

207
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,080
Young Lady,

208
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,759
it was Lian's incompetence.

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
The Young Master originally

210
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,720
went with me to beg Li Wan'er for help,

211
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,879
but I couldn't protect the Young Master.

212
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,255
When Li Wan'er sold him off,

213
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
she knocked me unconscious.

214
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:57,965
This is not your fault.

215
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,039
You should rest well first.

216
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,799
I will figure out a way
to find my brother.

217
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,519
Young Lady,

218
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:16,840
that day, it was Pei Yu

219
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,120
who personally sent master to prison.

220
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,440
The Shen family's matter
is inseparable from him.

221
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,480
How can Young Lady stay with the enemy?

222
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,799
I have my own plans.

223
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,720
If...

224
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,960
If he knows you sheltered me,

225
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
won't he suspect your identity?

226
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,919
And how did Young Lady

227
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,720
turn into Xi Yan?

228
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,759
Is it because of that past connection?

229
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:49,362
(End of Episode)

230
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,120
You drink it.

231
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,240
Drink it and I'll tell you.

232
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,919
I will make sure her soul
is scattered and her spirit destroyed!
