00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,080
You lowly maid.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,160
Let go of Yu!

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
You've seen it yourself.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,039
It was the Governor who held me.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
As a concubine,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
how dare I struggle?

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,559
Moreover,

8
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,160
serving the Governor

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,079
is my duty.

10
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:23,446
You...

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,679
Yu.

Pei Yu.

Wake up.

17
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,159

Don't regret it.

46
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,319
Your Lordship, control yourself.

47
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,040
I just wanted to check your safety.

48
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,980
Luckily, it's just incense and wine,

49
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,360
not deadly poison.

50
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,959
Otherwise, Miss Xi Yan would
be more worried.

51
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
She's not truly worried.

52
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,959
She's not a weak woman.

53
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,079
She deliberately lowers herself
in front of me,

54
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,480
but she has her own intentions.

55
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,439
Then she's deceiving you, Your Lordship.

56
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,839
She seeks protection.

57
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,000
She found me.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,879
I'm happy.

59
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,930
She can put effort into deceiving me,
rather than other men,

60
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,000
that's enough.

61
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,000
You

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,399
quickly go arrange the prison.

63
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,839
She stole my Qilin Token.

64
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,100
She must have gone to find Li Gang.

65
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,879
Since you intend

66
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,519
to let Miss Xi Yan go,

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,390
why not directly have me
take her to the imperial prison?

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,439
Dozens of lives from the Shen family

69
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,879
are like dozens of shackles

70
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,879
pressing on her.

71
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,439
Unless she personally unties them,

72
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,000
otherwise her whole life

73
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
will not be at peace.

74
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,920
Save me.

75
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,519
No matter who you are,

76
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
please save me.

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,399
I was wronged.

78
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,959
I was wronged.

79
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,279
I can save you.

80
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,839
Tell me.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,240
Who bribed you

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,680
and framed the Shen family?

83
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,000
That person is...

84
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,360
If you want to know who it is,

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,879
it'll cost more.

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,279
Do you have money?

87
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Look.

88
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,959
What is that?

89
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,439
Who is the mysterious person?

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,160
Even if you know, it's useless.

91
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,439
You can't even touch
a single hair of theirs.

92
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,759
You think if you stay silent,
the mysterious person will spare you.

93
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,240
I tell you.

94
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,759
Your wife and daughter are already dead.

95
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,399
Their bodies exposed on the streets,
no burial place.

96
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:05,920
No.

97
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,279
Impossible.

98
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
Your poor daughter

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,079
born mute.

100
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,040
When tortured to death,

101
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,839
she couldn't even cry out in pain.

102
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,160
Dead?

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,519
All dead?

104
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,800
Then these are all mine alone.

105
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,912
Your wife and daughter,
your closest blood,

106
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
and Master Shen's favor

107
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,080
can't compare to this gold and jewels.

108
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,759
How do you know Master Shen
valued me so highly?

109
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,399
You...

110
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,600
Who exactly are you?

111
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,639
Tell me.

112
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,440
Who are you?

113
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,639
If it's not my father,

114
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,919
how could you free yourself
from being a slave?

115
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,080
How could you become
the Shen family steward?

116
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,879
It's you.

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
You are Shen Changning.

118
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
You are Shen Changning.

119
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
Repaying kindness with hatred,

120
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
aren't you afraid my father

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,879
would come back for your life?

122
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,759
Just because his family is wealthy,
does that mean I can only be a servant?

123
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720
I will never be a servant again.

124
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,919
But he's dead.

125
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,320
Dead by my hand.

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,399
What did you say?

127
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
The mysterious person ordered me

128
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,200
to kill them before Pei Yu
arrived at the prison to silence them.

129
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
What richest man of Daliang,
and wealthiest man in the world?

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,559
His blood is still red,

131
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,960
his brains still white.

132
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,600
So it really wasn't Pei Yu.

133
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,840
But his life

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
is truly valuable.

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,559
Killing him earns so much money.

136
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,000
So much money.

137
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,960
You killed my entire family!

138
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,360
Impossible.

139
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,879
Impossible.

140
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,320
My gold...

141
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Where's my gold?

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Is being young mistress so great?

143
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,120
Is having money so great?

144
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,759
I will make you all die.

145
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,900
You murdered your master
and defied heaven.

146
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,840
For wealth, you acted like a beast.

147
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,480
You tortured Lian like an animal.

148
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,399
Even the eighteen layers of hell
cannot hold a degenerate like you.

149
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,120
Let you die a thousand times,

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,399
ten thousand times,

151
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,840
still wouldn't be enough to atone.

152
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,399
Tell me,

153
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,200
who is the mysterious person?

154
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,799
Tell me!

155
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,679
Stop!

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,799
I really don't know who he is!

157
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,120
I've never

158
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
seen his face.

159
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,559
I only saw

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
his hand wearing a red and green ring.

161
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:50,879
I'm rich now!

162
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,200
I've made a fortune!

163
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,519
So much gold.

164
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,679
Gold.

165
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,440
Do you rich people think
you're so great?

166
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,759
Yet you still die by my blade.

167
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,879
I'll never be a servant again.

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
Let's see who dares command me now.

169
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,840
I'll never be a servant again.

170
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,159
Eat it.

171
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,879
Eat it.

172
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,000
Then no one

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,425
can ever take it away.

174
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:28,679
(Dad.)

175
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,990
(Li Gang who betrayed the Shen family)

176
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,000
(and killed you is dead.)

177
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,600
(Died by his own inner demons.)

178
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
(Maybe I)

179
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,639
(will also be devoured
by my vengeful inner demons,)

180
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,639
(but I will never regret it.)

181
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,320
Who are you paying tribute to?

182
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,660
Why would you come here
at midnight, Your Lordship?

183
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,080
Just a few old friends I've known
for years.

184
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,240
They had no names when alive.

185
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,159
So...

186
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,159
Just now, someone died
in the governor's prison.

187
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,159
The manner of death was strange.

188
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,960
Died swallowing stones.

189
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,120
(Li Gang died in the governor's prison.)

190
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,000
((This matter cannot be hidden.)

191
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,100
(Rather than waiting for him
to find evidence,)

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,639
(I should take the initiative
and admit it.)

193
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,320
I secretly borrowed the Qilin Token,

194
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,425
sneaked into the prison
and forced Li Gang to commit suicide.

195
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,840
Li Gang made Lian's life
worse than death,

196
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,399
I really couldn't stand by.

197
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,159
If there was any offense,

198
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,759
I'm willingly accepts punishment.

199
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
Stealing the Qilin Token,

200
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,159
punishing a prisoner
without authorization,

201
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,480
do you realize
what a grave crime it is?

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,240
Does it hurt?

203
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,720
Should I bandage your wound,

204
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,200
or will you bathe me?

205
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,919
You choose.

206
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,562
(Eternal Joy)

207
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,879
(Looking this closely,)

208
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,679
(I can see some sincerity
and gentleness in him.)

209
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,600
You should still pay attention
to your wound, or it may scar.

210
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,850
I've broken the rules
of the Governor's Residence,

211
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
yet you don't punish me.

212
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,750
Instead, you apply medicine for me.

213
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,759
How do you know I'm applying medicine

214
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,799
and not trying to kill you?

215
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,960
The medicine is not poisoned.

216
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,120
I personally applied it for you.

217
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,440
You should repay me somehow.

218
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,350
I won't make it difficult for you.

219
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,200
You just bathe me.

220
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,679
Just now, you said

221
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,799
I could choose one.

222
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,240
A dignified governor

223
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,919
actually breaks his word.

224
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,840
I never claimed

225
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,550
to be a good person.

226
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,600
Even if you're not good,

227
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,048
you still have a pair of eyes, right?

228
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:37,650
My hand is injured.

229
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,037
How could I bathe you?

230
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,879
Exactly.

231
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,039
Then,

232
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,125
let's skip that.

233
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,115
Go straight to the bed.

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,390
Your Lordship, have some restraint.

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,679
Xi Yan.

236
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,830
You are already my honored concubine.

237
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,412
(End of Episode)

238
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,320
If you want to kill

239
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,679
someone stronger than you,

240
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,279
then strike

241
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,080
right here.

242
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,080
Cut off her hand.

243
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,960
Tonight, my goal is to have her jade arm
beneath a thousand pillows.

244
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:24,622
And her crimson lips tasted
by ten thousand.
