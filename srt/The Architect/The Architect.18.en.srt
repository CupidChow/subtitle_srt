3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,680
How are you going to explain yourself
before His Majesty?

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,239
Useless thing.

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,000
When the time comes,

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,600
I'll report everything to His Majesty

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,760
and strip you of your title as heir.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,879
Father,

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,559
It's my fault.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,399
You couldn't speak at all.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,960
What are you doing?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,000
Since I was young,
you've called me stupid,

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,310
said I wasn't fit to be the heir.

15
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,799
You've punished me enough.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,159
This time,

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,399
let me show you

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,719
how to protect

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,039
the glory and wealth
of Prince Duan's Residence.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Look.

21
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,040
He can no longer

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,439
deny anything before His Majesty.

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,000
Wait.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,400
No.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,890
You've been paving the way
to overturn the Shen family's case.

26
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,079
Don't tell me

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
you are...

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
Xiao Huaijin, listen carefully.

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
You will have your father
write a full confession,

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,680
explaining how he plotted to destroy

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
the Shen family.

32
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,840
Otherwise, I'll make sure
the entire Prince Duan's Residence

33
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,439

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,039
You know everything, don't you?

38
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
Prince Duan's crimes

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,039
go far beyond smuggling iron ore.

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,080
If he won't confess,

41
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,319
I'll make him confess.

42
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,680
If no one will judge him,

43
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,759
I will.

44
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,639
Did he confess?

45
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:05,525
He will.

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,900
(The Shen family's case files
handled entirely by Prince Duan.)

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,800
Fabricated from nothing.

48
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,450
Trying to hide the truth from everyone.

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,390
Ingenious, indeed.

50
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,800
They do this because they feel guilty.

51
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,680
You've been following me

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,800
because you're worried I'll slip up?

53
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,599
I'm worried you'll get tired.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
(Today,)

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,479
(I'll get Prince Duan's confession.)

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
(If I fail,)

64

68
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,279
this is bad!

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,800
I just came back from the market.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,780
They said Xiao Huaijin returned
to Prince Duan's Residence.

71
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,200
(How could this happen?)

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,240
(Why?)

73
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,079
(I was so close.)

74
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,800
(Just one step away.)

75
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,519
By edict

76
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,319
of His Majesty,

77
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,279
(Imperial Edict)
"Prince Duan's heir, Xiao Huaijin,

78
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,600
showed great loyalty and righteousness

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,160
by reporting Prince Duan's embezzlement

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,120
and turning in the stolen silver.

81
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,040
I'm most pleased.

82

83

shall inherit the title and be promoted to
Left Vice Minister of Revenue.

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,560

85
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,439
I thank Your Majesty

86
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,600
for your boundless grace.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,279

88
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,759
Please sign it.

I'll be a better Prince Duan

90
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,240

91

With your guide,

99
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,000
the imperial guards found yet another
ten million taels of silver

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,399

101
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,720
