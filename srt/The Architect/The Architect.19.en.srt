1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,399
Why don't you kill him?

2
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,679
You're right.

3
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,480
Taking his life

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,600
would be easy.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,159
But were he to die now,

6
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,439
the best outcome is that

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,079
the Prince Duan's Residence
would merely vanish.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,280
And the Shen family's grievances

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,840
would fade into oblivion

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,000
as they vanish.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
I want him alive.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,359
To let the world see

13
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,320
his hypocrisy and cruelty.

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,119
To watch him fall from the clouds
into the deepest mire.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,560
Let's go home.

16
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,662

=Episode 19=
(Shen Changning is alive,)

18
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:08,712
=Episode 19=
(Xi Yan is Shen Changning)

19
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,520
Miss,

20
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,560
you've not eaten anything for two days.

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,960
Your body cannot sustain this.

22
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,400
I have no appetite.

23
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,840
Miss.

24
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,175
Rumor has it Prince Duan's treasury

25
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:37,742
was emptied without a trace.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
They have no clue at all.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Xiao Huaijin is so mad

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
that he flogged

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
all his servants in a rage.

30
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,400
Miss,

31
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,639
did you ask someone to do that?

32
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,560
I...

33
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,120
Governor.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,919
Xiao Huaijin is the Prince

35
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,080
and holds great power.

36
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,960
I fear

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,199
he may strike against Miss again.

38
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,280
Though we spared him for now,

39
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,759
he shall know no peace.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Even the fiercest beast

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,520
feels dread.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,039
You're right.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,719
Xiao Huaijin

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
has his demons.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Help!

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,319
Help!

47
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,759
Help!

48
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,280
Unfilial son!

49
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,199
Unfilial son!

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Pay with your life!

51
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,280
(Patricide and usurpation.)

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,759
(Heaven will strike you down.)

53
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,839
Beast!

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,319
You are unfit to bear my title!

55
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Kneel and repent!

56
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,680
Why should I?

57
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,959
Why should I?

58
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,240
If you could do it,

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
why can I not?

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,839
You are old.

61
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,937
Why would you not spare me?

62
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,040
I

63
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,879
- shall kill you first!
- Don't come near me.

64
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,720
Don't come near me!

65
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't come near me!

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Your Highness!

67
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,120
Your Highness!

68
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,399
Are you fine?

69
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,040
His guilty conscience

70
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,399
plagues his sleep.

71
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,319
I shall ensure he remains restless.

72
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,920
Chunyun get someone
to send me some words.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I finally know

74
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,920
why we cannot find Yunqi.

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,839
Xiao Huaijin hid him from the start.

76
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,199
He bought Yunqi,

77
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,680
and spreads false news

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,879
to blind us.

79
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,759
Since we released information,

80
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,800
he surely plans a spectacle.

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Once he makes his move,

82
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,639
I shall have the chance to save Yunqi.

Sit.

94
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,560
Recently,

95
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
rumors of hauntings in

96
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,950
the Prince Duan's Residence
are widespread.

97
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,000
It seems

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
the rumors are true.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,680
I worry not for myself,

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,439
but for you, Princess.

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
How so?

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,040
Shen Changning is alive.

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,079
Xi Yan is Shen Changning.

104
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,399
Shen Changning is dead.

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Everyone knows this.

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,800
It seems you have truly gone mad.

107
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,319
I've sent someone to check.

108
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,639
I have found a loose end.

109
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
Young Master of
the Shen family, Shen Yunqi.

110
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
Someone else

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
seeks his whereabouts.

112
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Someone from the Shen family.

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,519
Who else

114
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,759
but Shen Changning

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,279
would care for

116
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,360
that child?

117
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,519
Whether she lives or dies

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,399
is your concern.

119
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,400
What does it has to do with me?

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,439
Your Highness,

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
do you not wish to kill Xi Yan?

122
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,040
(Impossible.)

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,879
(How would Yu knows Shen Changning?)

124
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,399
(I've known Shen Changning since young.)

125
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,439
(Yet, she never mentioned him.)

126
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,720
Yu.

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,000
Do not touch what is mine
without permission.

128
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,919
I remember,

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Mr. Pei were at odds with Lady Xi Yan.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,279
But now,

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
you are together.

132
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
Your Majesty, you may not know.

133
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,759
Xi Yan entered Prince Duan's Residence

134
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
as Governor's concubine.

135
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,559
Served two husbands.

136
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,159
She is popular indeed.

137
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,840
Your Highness, I must disagree.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,159
There was merely

139
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,320
a misunderstanding between us.

140
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,399
Now that it's resolved,

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,039
we are naturally reconciled.

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,600
If the misunderstanding

143
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,159
is cleared, then good.

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,360
Mr. Pei,

145
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,279
Prince Duan,

146
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,919
you are both pillars of the state.

147
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,159
I wish for

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,559
no discord between you.

149
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,879
Governor Pei,

150
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,200
there was misunderstanding

151
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,240
between us.

152
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,759
I was ignorant

153
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,919
of the rules before.

154
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,679
I hope Governor would forgive me.

155
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,519
From this day forth,

156
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,399
our grievances

157
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
are erased.

158
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,519
We shall

159
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,840
serve His Majesty together.

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
Your Highness, you're skilled.

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,080
His Majesty loves these blooms.

162
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,799
Every time he looks at them,

163
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
he'd be so glad.

164
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,840
This harem

165
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
is like these flowers.

166
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,200
Seemingly lush,

167
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,159
but each branch has its thought.

168
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,039
Tangled deeply with
the branch before it.

169
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,559
Yu's actions, though sometimes forced,

170
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,840
are to help me

171
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
stand firm here.

172
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,360
You are siblings.

173
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
You should support one another.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,919
Too bad.

175
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,519
To make the flowers bloom better,

176
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,000
and flourish,

177
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
one must prune ruthlessly.

178
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,919
To keep this one,

179
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
that one must be cut.

180
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,720
I ponder daily

181
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,279
how to manage it all

182
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,440
perfectly?

183
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,759
Your Highness, tea is served.

184
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,559
I get the Royal Kitchen
to bake some seasonal pastries.

185
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Taste it.

186
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,679
Thank you, Your Highness.

187
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,360
Here.

188
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,639
Taste this.

189
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,300
(Do you want to know
where your brother is?)

190
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,679
Why are you here?

191
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Where is Shen Yunqi?

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,639
Xi Yan.

193
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Your hands are cold.

194
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,559
