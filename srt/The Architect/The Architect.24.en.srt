1
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,119
(Father,)

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,879
(your lies made me suffer.)

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,760
(Turns out, what you want)

4
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,199
(is just a useful pawn.)

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,480
(All the glory and splendor you gave me)

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,200
(was actually exchanged with my father,)

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,840
(and the Li Army's sacrifice.)

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,359
(In the eyes of other people,)

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
(this is just a joke and a humiliation.)

10
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,039
(I had no choice back then.)

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,679
(I do now.)

12
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,960
(This time, I choose)

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,399
(to end everything on my own.)

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,890
(At the flower appreciation banquet
that year,)

15
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,159
(the descendants of Wang Sun lied
and said I was a merchant's daughter.)

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
(They laughed at you
for being an orphan.)

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,000
(We promised to be buddies forever.)

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,640
(Now, all that love
has completely drifted away.)

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,079
(Wan'er,)

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
(one's nobility is unrelated
to one's background.)

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
(It's only related to their choices.)

22
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,520
(Promise me.)

23
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,000
(If the next life exists,)

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,039
(don't lose yourself again.)

25
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,812
=The Architect=

26
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,862
=Episode 24=
(Just burn all the traitors of the Shen family)

27
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,360
Xiao Huaijin is extremely sly.

28
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,639
He pinned all the crimes on Prince Duan.

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,159
Even the emperor was lied to.

30
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,560
If we want to punish him,

31
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,719
we need irrefutable evidence.

32
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,620
There'll always be a flaw.

33
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,319
We will surely find a way.

34
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Sister!

35
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,920
Yunqi!

36
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,279
Yunqi!

37
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:33,994
Sister,

38
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Father gave me something.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,639
What...

40
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:40,680
What did you call me?

41
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:42,480
Sister.

42
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,079
You call me Sister?

43
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,439
You call me Sister.

44
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
When I fell asleep that day,

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,560
I heard

46
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,040
everything you said.

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,199
You are my sister.

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
Mother and Father are gone.

49
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,040
Sister,

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
can you not

51
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,959
abandon me anymore?

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,519
I will never

53
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,879
abandon you, Yunqi.

54
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,399
Yunqi,

55
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,560
did you say

56
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,360
Father gave you something?

57
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,680
That day,

58
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,383
Father took me to his study.

59
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,362
(Wang Yanqing, Chen Shouyu)

60
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,959
Yunqi,

61
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
go and play alone.

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,920
I'll come and be with you later.
All right?

63
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,879
Go.

64
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,862
I'm sure Mr. Shen
purposely left this behind.

65
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,439
These people

66
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,959
used to serve Prince Duan.

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,439
They were his accomplices
in selling iron ore.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,300
Father must have found out
about Prince Duan's wrongdoing

69
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,759
and wouldn't work with him.

70
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,690
That was why he was
framed by Prince Duan.

71
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,790
After Father knew the people
of the imperial court had come for him,

72
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,319
he secretly hid this list

73
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
in Yunqi's shirt

74
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,879
only hoping

75
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:55,519
for this list

76
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,959
to prove the Shen family's innocence.

77
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:05,319
With this list,

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,850
we will surely find evidence
that proves Xiao Huaijin's crime.

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Governor, spare me!

80
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,920
I'll admit everything!

81
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't move!

82
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,991
(Snow flies in June.)

83
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,399
(The whole family cries
out of grievance)

84
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,079
(like Dou E, her grievance still haunts)

85
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,171
(All of Shen family's wrongdoings)
(The evil are not punished)

86
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,040
(are facilitated by Prince Duan)
(The evil are not punished)

87
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,850
(Imperial Study)

88
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,160
The Shen family's case has closed.

89
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,038
What's going on with these reports?

90
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,519
Your Majesty, please seek justice for me.

91
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,390
These reports are all false accusations
against Prince Duan's Residence.

92
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,800
Moreover,

93
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,800
since Her Highness' tragedy...

94
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,879
What's with that?

95
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,399
Rumors in the streets

96
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,399
say that she used to harm
the Shen family

97
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
so she was punished.

98
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:35,530
Darn it!

99
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,559
Who dares to speak nonsense?

100
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,490
Arrest and question them!

101
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,833
I don't care about the rumors!

102
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,192
But I received news

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,039
that Xi Yan

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
sneaked into
the princess's bridal chamber

105
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
during her wedding.

106
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,159
What did she do?

107
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,279
She sneaked inside.

108
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,200
No one knows.

109
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,240
Only a servant who passed by

110
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,919
heard their conversation.

111
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,960
She said

112
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
Shen Changning was mentioned.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
What are you trying to say?

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Just tell me.

115
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,080
I dare not

116
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,799
assume before you, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,559
But I'm willing to try

118
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,799
to see

119
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,000
if Xi Yan is Shen Changning.

120
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,080
Your Majesty.

121
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,559
I met the Young Lady
of the Shen family.

122
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,899
She looks completely different
from Lady Xi Yan.

123
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,860
There has been a face-swapping technique
going around in the streets.

124
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,320
If Xi Yan isn't Shen Changning,

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
why would she be so persistent

126
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,039
about the Shen family case?

127
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,159
Her Highness

128
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,279
would not be forced to death.

129
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,900
Will you know immediately

130
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,639
after testing?

131
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,120
I, Xi Yan,

132
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,580
greet Your Majesty.

133
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,357
Shen Changning,

134
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
have you always been thinking

135
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
that the Shen family died

136
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,000
an aggrieved death?

137
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,639
Your Majesty,

138
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,679
there are many rumors in the streets

139
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,540
saying that I am the eldest daughter
of the Shen family, Shen Changning.

140
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
I didn't expect the nonsense

141
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:29,137
to disturb Your Majesty's peace.

142
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,600
I also think

143
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,200
it is ridiculous,

144
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,080
but since you appeared,

145
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,960
you've been causing problems.

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,519
Today, Lord Xiao
has come up with a method

147
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,879
to prove your innocence.

148
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,399
The Shen family's case is closed.

149
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,759
I've also allowed

150
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,120
for the traitors of the Shen family
to be buried.

151
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,759
However, some people have been calling

152
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,559
for the case to be overturned

153
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,907
and is willing

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
to be in cahoots with the traitors.

155
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,039
Since you want to prove
that you are unrelated to them,

156
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,487
just burn

157
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,360
their bodies.

158
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,159
Bring them here.

159
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,639
Your Majesty,

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,600
you govern with benevolence

161
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,490
and your reputation
spreads all over the world.

162
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
The Shen family has committed suicide
to atone for their crimes.

163
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,990
If they can't keep their bodies whole,

164
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm worried that it might ruin
Your Majesty's reputation.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,480
Please reconsider this, Your Majesty.

166
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,080
I don't need you

167
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,279
to interfere with my actions.

168
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:06,960
Xi Yan,

169
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,559
do you not want to burn the bodies

170
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,799
or go against His Majesty's orders?

171
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,960
Why don't

172
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:16,919
His Majesty's guards

173
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,240
help you instead?

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
Don't let His Majesty misunderstand

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,279
your innocence.

176
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll do it myself.

177
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,120
(End of Episode)

178
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Lord Pei,

179
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,919
this item looks familiar.

180
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,399
