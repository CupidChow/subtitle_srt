1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,279
(In my entire life.)

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,720
(The lover was heartless.)

3
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:13,112
(May the Shen family's injustice
be cleared.)

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,080
(My friends was traitorous.)

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,359
(The family gate was slaughtered.)

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,199
(I hate that I trusted
the wrong person.)

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,320
(Hate that I was powerless
to protect my parents.)

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,479
(But I'm not willing.)

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,170
(I'm not willing to be forever trapped
at the bottom of an icy lake.)

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,359
(Not willing that the Shen family
continues to bear this stain.)

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,439
(More unwilling)

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,240
(that the killers
who harmed others roam free.)

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,520
(If there truly is a deity
in this world,)

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,000
(I am willing to offer my soul,)

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,400
(even if I fall to hell
for all eternity.)

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,159
(The Shen clan)

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,320
(also must be granted a chance
to avenge and clear its name.)

18
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:54,400
=The Architect=

19
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,437
=Episode 1=
(I'll forge my hate into a blade)

20
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,599
Matron Li.

21
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,120
How could she have been resurrected?

22
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,480
Your Highness.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,288
(Governor's Residence's Dancer, Xi Yan)
This lowly dancer,

24
00:02:05,312 --> 00:02:06,200
(Governor's Residence's Dancer, Xi Yan)
Xi Yan is alive again?

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
What's going on?

26
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,387
(Daliang Princess, Li Wan'er)

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
Li Wan'er.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,280
I thought I was already dead.

29
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,599
How dare a lowly dancer like you,

30
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,319
Xi Yan address me

31
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,280
by noble title?

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,639
(Lowly dancer?)

33
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,759
(Xi Yan?)

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,000
(Xi Yan?)

35
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,830
(I clearly am Shen Changning,
eldest daughter of the Shen family.)

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,330
(How could I appear here like this?)

37
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,000
Lowly maid, Xi Yan.

38
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,775
(Shen family's legitimate daughter,
Shen Changning)

39
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:44,825
(Prince Duan's eldest son, Xiao Huaijin)

40
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,680
(How did I turn
into Xi Yan's appearance?)

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,639
How dare you climb
into the Governor's bed?

42
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,879
Today I will drown you alive,

43
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,840
only then will my heart's hatred
be solved.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,000
Your struggle is useless.

45
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,159
(Li Wan'er.)

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,240
(After all we called
ourselves sisters once.)

47
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,479
(When the Shen family fell,
you stabbed me in the back.)

48
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,630
(You betrayed me from behind.)

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,180
(Now that we have this second chance.)

50
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,360
(I will not let go peacefully.)

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,680
How dare you!

52
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,759
Help!

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,039
How could I be so blind-sighted
to not see one's true nature?

54
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,439
How could I be deaf to warnings?

55
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,479
How could I be blind in my heart
to distinguish good from evil?

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,000
Under Li Wan'er's human skin,

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,319
what are you really?

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
(Pei Yu.)

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,120
(Your hands are stained
with Shen family's blood.)

60
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,000
(The vendetta of our clans' purge)

61
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,500
(and the hatred of the clan's
eradication are irreconcilable.)

62
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,919
(Daliang Governor, Pei Yu)
(I'll skin you and break your bones)

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,680
(to repay blood with blood)

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,039
(Shen Changning's Father)
(and reborn anew.)

65
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:02,639
(Shen Changning's Mother)

66
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,159
(The lives I take from you)

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,639
(will be my reason to live.)

68
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,360
Lowly maid!

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,319
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,400
Yu, this lowly maid was bullying me.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,399
Disrespectful uprising

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,360
deserves death.

73
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,480
Drag her away.

74
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,439
Governor Pei.

75
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,410
They say the Governor can't tell
loyalty from betrayal,

76
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,399
and cannot tell good from evil.

77
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,639
Seems like that's true.

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,519
I just

79
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,279
saw something dirty
in the princess's hair

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,000
and tried to brush it off for her,

81
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,900
but the princess reacted fiercely.

82
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,390
That's how the misunderstanding happened.

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,480
Lowly maid, you still dare to argue?

84
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,079
Yu.

85
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,399
Such a lowly maid with malicious intent.

86
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,279
If not executed...

87
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:52,959
Your Highness.

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,199
Did you not feel something
crawling in your hair?

89
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,290
If you don't brush it away now,
it will crawl into your clothes.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,839
Grub?

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,360
Your Highness.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,839
Your Highness.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
Didn't expect you still have
a side like this.

94
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,439
You have indeed made me
underestimate you.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,279
I'm just a dancer

96
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,560
trying to survive.

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
You are just a lowly dancer,

98
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,160
how could you possibly know
the princess is afraid of grubs?

99
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,000
I merely saw you disliked the princess

100
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,399
and meant to ease your worries.

101
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,895
You do have some wit about you.

102
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,959
Even if I spare your life today,

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,959
what about tomorrow?

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
Even if I must die tomorrow,

105
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,496
I beg to live today.

106
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,387
(Qingxian Residence)

107
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,160
Then kneel until tomorrow.

108
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,160
Whether you live or die,
it shall depend on your fate.

109
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,700
(Qingxian Residence)

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Tonight will feel endlessly long.

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Xi Yan.

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,839
No matter why I've come
to look like you,

113
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,560
I swear

114
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,040
(I'll live on for the both of us.)

115
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,800
I cannot die yet.

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I still need to avenge myself

117
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,000
and the Shen family.

118
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,720
If Heaven shows no justice,

119
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,920
then I shall be the restless spirit
demanding it.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
If the world before me is unjust,

121
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,680
I shall become the vengeful ghost
from the abyss.

122
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,000
If fairness itself is unjust,

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,759
I'll ask the world.

124
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,879
Letting the good suffer

125
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,120
while the wicked roam free,

126
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,040
what kind of justice is that?

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
If that lowly maid lives,

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,319
my hatred will never fade.

129
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,120
Your Highness, please calm down.

130
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,399
Anger harms the body.

131
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,000
(Nannny, Madam Li)
That lowly maid indeed deserves death.

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,120
But how could she possibly know

133
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,160
that you fear grubs, Your Highness?

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,680
When your father fell in battle,
his body was covered in them.

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Very few are aware of this.

136
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll slap myself.

137
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,360
Yu.

138
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,720
You must punish that maid severely

139
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,480
to win justice for me.

140
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,700
If there's nothing more,

141
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,300
return to the palace early.

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm not going back.

143
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,839
We haven't admired the night pearl

144
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,920
gifted by the Empress Dowager
together yet.

145
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,519
Besides,

146
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,560
I was frightened tonight.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,439
I want to stay in the residence.

148
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,990
Escort Her Highness back to the palace.

149
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,879
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Yu.

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,919
Do not make decisions for me again.

152
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,360
Not when you haven't even
entered my household,

153
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,919
even after you do,

154
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,700
in this Governor's Residence,

155
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
only I

156
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
can decide who lives and who dies.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,120
Yu...

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,120
Your Highness.

159
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,470
So many women in the backyard
trying to seduce the Governor.

160
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,360
Why must you insist
on killing Xi Yan alone?

161
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,279
The eyes.

162
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,159
Your Highness,

163
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,360
what do you mean?

164
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,720
That lowly maid's eyes
and someone else's

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,919
look exactly the same.

166
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,039
You mean...

167
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,679
Shen Changning.

168
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,879
As long as you live,

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,759
my heart will never be at peace.

170
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,519
If you wish to kill me,

171
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,960
let's see if you have the ability.

172
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Li Wan'er.

173
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,720
Sooner or later,
I'll trample you beneath my feet.

174
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,679
Xi Yan.

175
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,000
All you can do is run your mouth.

176
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,840
I am the current imperial princess,

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,519
born of a noble house,

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
and granted my title
by the Emperor himself.

179
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,879
People like you exist only
to kneel and serve me.

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,960
Before me,

181
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,840
I am the law.

182
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,080
I am the rule.

183
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,159
Just like now,

184
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,679

185

Li Wan'er.

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
You

188
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,000
are nothing more than a pampered slave

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,559
kept by those above you.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,279
Aren't you afraid
that doing too much evil

191
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,000
will bring vengeful spirits
to claim your life?

192
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,440
Your Highness.

193
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,759
Are you alright?

194
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,559
You wretch!

195
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,559
Kill her!

196
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,240
Go!

197
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,279
(Maid, Chunyun)
Go now!

198
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,840
- Your Highness.
- Go now!

If you cannot discipline
your own servants,

202
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
then I shall discipline them for you.

203
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,159
From now on, without my permission,

204
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,500
you are forbidden to enter
the Governor's Residence.

205
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,440

She was kicked out for climbing

and now she's won

212

stop pretending.

Please don't be offended, Your Lordship.

220
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,960
I simply did not wish to disturb

your enjoyment of a lady's chamber.

222
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
To protect yourself,

223
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,120
you pretended to be weak,

224
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,480
even harmed yourself.

225
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,480
Your resolve is impressive.

226
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,679
I am low-born.

227
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,559
To survive,

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
I can only resort to small tricks.

229
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,400
I beg the your forgiveness,
Your Lordship.

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,519
I am worth more alive

231
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,600
than dead.

232
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,639
You understand your situation clearly.

233
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,279
I am merely an insignificant pawn.

234
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,720
But if used well,

235
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,159
perhaps

236
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,960
I may become an unexpected asset.

237
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,639
You carried me back
and deliberately let the backyard ladies

238
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,799
see everything.

239
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,537
Is it not because

240
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
you wish to stir internal conflict?

241
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
You seek change.

242
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,679
I seek survival.

243
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,759
If you protect me,

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,919
then I will not fail you.

245
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,720
Then stir up some storms.

246
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,679
Better than doing nothing.

247
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,440
(Xi Yan.)

248
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,080
(Only after reading your diary,)

249
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,919
(I learn that we share the same enemy.)

250
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:05,840
Xi Yan.

251
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,240
The strong possess everything.

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,600
The weak are mere firewood.

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,759
If you wish

254
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,879
to survive in this world of beasts,

255
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,120
you must become like them.

256
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,600
Even if danger lurks at every step,

257
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,559
I will definitely

258
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
avenge you.

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,919
From this moment on,

260
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,879
I am you.

261
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Pei Yu.

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,360
Attack an official of the court

263
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,519
is a crime beyond measure.

264
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,000
You traitor!

265
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,639
I'll fight you to the death!

266
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,759
You twist right and wrong

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,519
and caused over a hundred members
of the Shen family

268
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,720
to die unjustly in prison.

269
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,679
Xiao Huaijin.

270
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,501
Born into the Shen family

271
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,799
means only one fate, death.

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,759
(I was fooled by appearances.)

273
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,639
(Words once sweet)

274
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
(have become poison.)

275
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,639
Li Wan'er.

276
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,039
I wish I could tear your sister
limb from limb.

277
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,879
Make her maid a prostitute,

278
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,720
and condemn him to slavery for life.

279
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
(I treated you like my own sister,)

280
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,720
(but never saw your venomous heart.)

281
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,879
The hypocrite is always arrogant.

282
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,440
The vicious always obsessive.

283
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,480
The indifferent hide
their feelings deepest.

284
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,600
Now I am lowly

285
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
like an ant,

286
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,480
anyone could crush me
beneath their feet.

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,279
You destroyed my family,

288
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,559
yet the chance to clear the
Shen family's name also lies with you.

289
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,240
Your rank is high.

290
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,519
Your power immense.

291
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,559
If I can lure you into my game,

292
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,399
and use you as my shield,

293
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,440
then whether Xiao Huaijin

294
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
or Li Wan'er,

295
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,720
I can confront them all.

296
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,799
I will forge my hatred into a blade

297
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,759
