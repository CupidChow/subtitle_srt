00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,800
This sword is extremely sharp

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,320
yet it can also be gentle.

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,359
You still need more practice.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,760
Although I don't know much
about swordsmanship,

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,079
I know a move

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,320
to repel enemies.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,708
What do you mean?

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,359
Using myself as bait
to lure the enemy into the trap.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Piercing myself
while stabbing the enemy as well.

What about that?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,599
Pei Yu!

16
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,959
Take care of my brother.

17
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,840
Xiao Huaijin,

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
I'll take you down with me!

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,120
No!

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,159
Governor!

21
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,519
Let's go!

22
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,159
Pei Yu.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
I'm fine.

24
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,319
Pei Yu!

25
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
Pei Yu!

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,639
Miss.

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,190
It's all thanks to the Governor
for saving Young Master.

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,400
The physician said Young Master
only suffers from a slight shock.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
He needs to recover slowly.

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,880
What about the Governor?

31
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,080

are seriously wounded.)

Help me send a letter.

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,590
This is the only person

92
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,279
who can keep Xiao Huaijin under control.

00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,720
But Li Wan'er sees you as an enemy.

96
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,680
Even if she gets the herb,
she still won't give it to you.

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,040
Wait for me outside.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,759
Everything Li Wan'er does

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
is to win Pei Yu's heart.

100
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,839
She might not give me the herb

101
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,480
but she won't see Pei Yu die

102
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,399
and do nothing.

103
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,240
If one can exchange
her life for another's,

104
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,439
Li Wan'er will surely do it

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
for Pei Yu.

to save Pei Yu.

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,800
How do you know

110
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,360
I don't want to save Pei Yu?

111
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,759
I don't object

112
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,680
to you killing her.

113
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
But Pei Yu

114
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,079
is a man I love.

115
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,959
If you hurt him today,

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,439
I'll get even with you in another day.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,759
Get lost!

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,240
Pei Yu can sacrifice himself

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,600
just to save you.

120
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm sure you can also give everything

121
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,639
for his sake, right?

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Give me the herb.

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,970
I'll give you my life.

124
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,480
That depends on

125
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,480
whether you are still alive
to get the herb.

126
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,959
How dare you attack me?

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,519
Capture him!

128
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,720
Let Qin Feng go.

129
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,879
I'll stay.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
You can do whatever you want with me.

131
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
Pei Yu's life is in danger.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,780
I'm sure you don't want
anything to happen to him.

133
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
I don't care who you are.

134
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,879
How dare you embarrass me
time after time

135
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,759
and win Pei Yu's heart?

136
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,439
I want you to know

137
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,199

138
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,160
will never win against me.

139
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,600
Something so minor

140
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,399
is not good enough.

Otherwise, how can I
make you lower your guard?

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Li Wan'er,

147
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,399

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,070
