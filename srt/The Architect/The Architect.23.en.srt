1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,119
Your Highness?

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,080
Your Highness?

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,960
Father, it isn't what you think!

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,320
Your Majesty, please allow me
to explain myself!

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:35,920
Your Highness.

6
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,000
Wretch, it was you!

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,880
That's enough!

8
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,100
=The Architect=

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,141
=Episode 23=
(Today will be)

10
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,150
=Episode 23=
(the last best day of your life)

11
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,300
The state of Daliang is
governed with propriety.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,120
How dare you two
do that in front of us?

13
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,239
You two...

14
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you two have no
regard for the palace?

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,400
The royal family is utterly embarrassed
because of you two!

16
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,910
Your Majesty, please
practice wise judgment.

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,359
I didn't do anything.

18
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,040
After I received the decree,

19
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:59,959
I was heading back
to reflect on my action.

20
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,690
But when I passed by
the royal garden...

21
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:10,680
Was it you?

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,439
You ordered your men to knock me out

23
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,879
in order to frame me!

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,000
Prince Duan, if you wish
to malign someone,

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,879
you have to show us some evidence.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,159
You'd better stop pretending!

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,159
Xiao Huaijin!

28
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,719
Say no more.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Father,

30
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,080
although Xiao Huaijin and I

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,240
were lying on the same bed,

32
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,080
we did nothing at all.

33
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm innocent.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
Innocent?

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
All of my subjects
witnessed it themselves.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,439
How dare you say that you're innocent?

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,520
So what?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,919
Do they get to dictate

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
my innocence?

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,719
I'm the princess of Daliang.

41
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,599
If they dare to gossip about me,

42
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,919
Father, you should

43
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,719
rip out their tongues instead.

44
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,360
According to the law of Daliang,

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,560
those who corrupt the royal court

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
will be executed.

47
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,910
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,400
I have a solution

49
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,800
that can protect the
name of the royal family

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,319
and serve Prince Duan

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,840
and Her Highness well.

52
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,360
What is it?

53
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,360
I've heard about this rumor long ago.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,890
It was said that Prince Duan

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
and Her Highness were in love.

56
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,100
Your Majesty, why don't
you grant their wish?

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
Not only can they be together,

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,800
but it can preserve the dignity
of the royal family.

59
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:35,960
No!

60
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,960
Father! I don't want to be married to him!

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,319
Yu, I only want to be married to you!

62
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,759
Shut up!

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,039
Since it has come to this,
you don't get to make the call.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,560
Eunuch Li,

65
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,719
draft a decree now.

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,350
Appoint Xiao Huaijin, Prince Duan,
as the princess's consort.

67
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,680
He shall marry the princess,
Li Wan'er, tomorrow.

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,439
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,800
You wretch.

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,090
Do you think you can
get rid of me like that?

71
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
I was just returning
the present you prepared

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
to you exactly what it was.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,300
What's the matter?

74
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,400
It's okay for you to hurt someone else,

75
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,199
but it's not okay for you

76
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,399
to be hurt, huh?

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
I'll kill you right now!

78
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,480
Stop!

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Yu.

80
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,160
That wretch was
the cause of everything!

81
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,360
I'm innocent!

82
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,000
Your Highness, today's
your wedding day.

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
Please return.

84
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,639
Yu,

85
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,040
you and I knew each
other from a young age.

86
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,639
We were childhood
sweethearts for years.

87
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,319
Do you actually

88
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,120
have no feelings for me?

89
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,199
There's no way to force a relationship.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,879
It has already come to this.

91
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,319
There's no need to make it worse.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,920
Yu!

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Back then,

94
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,439
when you saved me from bandits,

95
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,120
I swore to only marry no one but you.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,759
I can change my ways if I was wrong.

97
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,439
I promise I won't pick on her again!

98
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,680
She can become your concubine,

99
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,680
your co-wife,

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
or anything she likes!

101
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm begging you,

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,920
Yu!

103
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,360
I truly fancy you!

104
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Please don't abandon me!

105
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,120
Yu!

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Your Highness,

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
the auspicious hour is nearing.

108
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,360
Let's return to the palace.

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,160
Nanny!

110
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,759
Your Highness.

111
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,279
Yu is the person I fancy!

112
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,800
Why must I be married to Xiao Huaijin?

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's get up.

114
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,439
No matter what Li Wan'er
has done to me,

115
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,759
she's sincere toward you.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,000
It's merely her selfish
desire to possess.

117
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Not only did we avoid their scheme,

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,500
but they also received
their just deserts.

119
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,839

trouble you anymore.

to see each other off
on their wedding day.

to keep your promise,

Is that so?

168
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,720
Do you truly think

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,159
that no one would know
that you sold Shen Yunqi

170
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,399
and Lian

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
What a shame.

173
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,799
I'm not the only one
who knows about it.

174
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,240
Pei Yu knows about it as well.

175
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,399
So what if he knows?

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,279
So what if he hates me?

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,039
So what if you're still alive?

178
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,320
I will forever
be the noblest princess of Liang

183
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,480
why His Majesty took you
as his goddaughter

184
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,519
and allowed you to act brazenly

185
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,000
without disciplining you?

186
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,840
Of course I know.

187
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,080
It's because my father

188
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,320
died for the sake of the state.

189
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,240
He was the hero of Daliang.

190
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,399
Father caused me to be an orphan.

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,600
And, I was smart and sensible, too.

192
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,759
That's why he doted on me.

193
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,559
Indeed. General Li

194
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,279
was indeed the hero of Daliang.

195
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,399
But His Majesty,

196
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,145
do you think he truly
cherishes and loves you?

197
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,399
(Someone in the Li Army)
I'm sure you can

198
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,639
(is plotting something)
recognize this handwriting.

199
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,360
Isn't this Father's handwriting?

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Back then, the Li Army
was trapped in a valley for six months.

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
They were running out of supplies.

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,240
The casualties were numerous.

203
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,360
Countless people starved to death.

204
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,600
And, reinforcements
were nowhere to be seen.

205
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,900
Our enemy managed to
penetrate their defense.

206
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:31,067
The Li Army suffered heavy casualties.

207
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,000
General Li

208
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,448
fought until his last breath.

209
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,080
Reinforcements were nowhere to be seen

210
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,240
because heavy snow
had blocked the pass!

211
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,720
It was due to a natural disaster!

212
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,639
Is that so?

213
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,559
If so, why did General Li make

214
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,399
such a chilling remark
before his death?

215
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,559
The formidable Li Army,

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,080
were they annihilated by our enemies?

217
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,000
Or did someone plot to do them in?

218
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,600
Someone plotted to do them in?

219
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,360
After the battle of Feiyan Valley,

220
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,159
General Li died on the battlefield.

221
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,279
The Li Army lost more
than half of their men.

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
His Majesty took you
as his goddaughter.

223
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,360
Not only did he comfort the emotions

224
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,360
of the remaining
members of the Li Army,

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
but he also managed to enlist them

226
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,720
into the royal family's
Imperial Guards.

227
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Since then,

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,639
Daliang lacked an iron-blooded army

229
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,559
capable of matching

230
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,039
the prowess of the Imperial Guards,

231
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,000
had one more spoiled and
overbearing princess,

232
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,600
and had

233
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
the most compassionate
emperor in the world.

234
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,000
Nonsense!

235
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Father truly loved me!

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,112
From a young age,

237
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,639
no matter what I did,

238
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,240
no matter if they were right or wrong,

239
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,000
he would never punish me!

240
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,720
He didn't punish you

241
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,159
to show the world

242
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,799
his compassion toward you

243
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,519
and the Li Army!

244
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,840
The bigger the mistake you commit,

245
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,879
the more he's able
to show his compassion.

246
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,840
He knew that I fancied Pei Yu.

247
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,440
Thus, he granted us a marriage!

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,679
Don't you get it yet?

249
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,639
You were always a pawn.

250
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:38,679
In the past,

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,879
you were a testament
to royal benevolence.

252
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,000
After that,

253
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,639
you're the bind that shackles Pei Yu.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,639
Li Wan'er, just look at you.

255
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,159
Look at who you're getting married to!

256
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,080
Now, you're merely the veil

257
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,720
that covers the royal family's shame.

258
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,799
He granted you a new
marriage to Xiao Huaijin

259
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,159
and didn't defend you

260
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,120
because he knew better than anyone else

261
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,639
that you'd committed too many mistakes.

262
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,890
If he tried to defend you again,

263
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,919
he'd only be reviled
by all under heaven

264
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,320
as an incompetent and inept emperor
who nurtures villains!

265
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,360
As for you,

266
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,600
you're doomed to be a sacrificial pawn.

267
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,159
Enjoy your wedding night.

268
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,279
From today onward,

269
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:44,919
you'll realize

270
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,879
that today will be

271
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,399
the last best day of your life.

272
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Where's Her Highness?

273
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Your Highness,

274
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,679
Her Highness has been resting inside.

275
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,120
At least she knows her place.

276
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,662
(End of Episode)

277
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,919
Sister.

278
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,080

that you are unrelated to them,

279
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,390
just burn

280
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,399
