00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,679
But you are the one
who is supposed to drink this wine,

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Pei Yu.

5
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,312
(I can't wait to kill you
to avenge the Shen family)

6
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,319
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,319
I am just a civilian.

8
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:23,000
Without Governor Pei to protect me,

9
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,879
I dare not compete with the princess.

10
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,120
Everything

11
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,359
was ordered by Governor Pei.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,799
I was weak

13
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,359
and could only obey.

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,319
I doted on you usually,

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,680
but you're getting arrogant
because of that.

16
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,480
If Your Lordship treats me heartlessly,
I will do the same to you.

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,280
All of this was because

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,599
you didn't want to marry Wan'er,

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,520
but you couldn't
go against the imperial decree

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
so you sacrificed me.

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,560
Your Majesty,
don't listen to her nonsense.

22
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,519
I think a cup of poison wine isn't enough
to appease Her Highness's anger.

23
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,599
Your Majesty, please allow me

24
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,560
to take her away

25
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,439
and punish her

26
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,879
myself.

27
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,400
Hold it.

28
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,039
Pei Yu,

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,759
I have high hopes for you,

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,280
yet you can't even
manage your family matters.

31
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,879
It seems like

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
you haven't changed your ways

33
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,479
after the flogging last time.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,039
Someone,

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
bring me my Dragon Whip.

36
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,680
Carry out the punishment.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Father.

38
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,439
Stop!

39
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,400
It's all your fault.

40
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,199
Wretch! Jinx!

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
You caused Yu harm.

42
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,360
Get lost!

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Yu,

44
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,280
are you all right?

45
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,680
See?

46
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,879
Other women only hurt you

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,840
and stab you in the back.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,879
I'm the only one who will save you.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm the only one worthy of you.

50
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,960
We are a match made in heaven.

51
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,479
Not bad.

52
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,000
What a good act.

53
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,730
You actually made Pei Yu
get punished in public.

Xi Yan,

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,719
I was right about you.

56
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,660
Young Lord Xiao, congratulations
on coming out of your confinement.

141
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,870
you seized the Shen residence

and annihilated the whole family.

00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,919

in investigating the Shen family case.

All the evidence here

00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,000

Your Lordship keeps
taking care of Lady Xi Yan,

175
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,200
but she turns her back on you quickly.

176
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,110
She actually gave you
such a serious wound.

177
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,679
I don't believe
it was just an act between us.

178
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,559
I'm sure she wants something else.

179
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,759
Why did you...

180
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,679
Are you trying to say

181
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
that I've known that she is using me

182
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,559
and lying to me,

183
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,500
so why am I still indulging her?

184
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm just worried

185
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,799
that Lady Xi Yan

186
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,519
doesn't hold back.

187
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,000
She might

188
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,399
hurt you even deeper in the future.

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,300
She has no one to rely on.

190
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,279
She wants to investigate

191
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,559
the Shen family's case,

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,490
but she has no one to help her

193
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,799
and doesn't know where to start.

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,399
But you've done your best

195
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,799
for the Shen family's case.

196
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
There was solid evidence in the case.

197
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,519
It's not that easy
to right the injustice.

198
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,720
If we want to overturn the case,

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
we must find new evidence

200
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,639
to prove that the Shen family

201
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,799
was wronged.

202
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,440
But the people don't care about that.

203
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,919
They only think

204
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,960
that you've wrongly
killed the Shen family.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Miss.

206
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,639
I heard the Governor
suffered a serious injury.

207
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,120
Qin Feng used a method
to save heavily wounded soldiers

208
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
to stop the Governor's bleeding.

209
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,960
The truth is hidden within.

210
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,080
Everyone thinks

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,559
I wrongly killed the Shen family,

212
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
but no one will expect me

213
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,879
to investigate the case in secret.

214
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,759
Especially Prince Duan's Residence.

215
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
They don't know

216
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,159
that all the clues

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,519
are pointing at him.

218
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,039
Moreover...

219
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,759
Why didn't you tell Lady Xi Yan
and let her misunderstand you instead?

220
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,759
She didn't misunderstand me.

221
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,240
Can I really say
that the Shen family case

222
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,960
has nothing to do with me?

223
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,519
Moreover, I only have clues now

224
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,360
and no evidence.

225
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,480
Why increase her trouble for nothing?

226
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,919
My Lordship.

227
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
In today's autumn hunt,

228
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,365
all of you

229
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,399
must show your true skills

230
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,679
and not slack.

231
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,890
The person who hunts the most animals will be

232
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,840
rewarded handsomely by me.

233
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,840
Long live Your Majesty.

234
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,440
Stand.

235
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,399
Yu,

237
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,600
Father has allowed me

238
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,080
to participate in this hunt

239
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,720
as the Governor's Wife.

240
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,759
This fragrance pouch helps
repel insects and dissolve poison.

241
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sure it can help My Lordship
show your skills at the hunting ground.

242
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,320
Mandarin ducks appear in pairs.

243
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,000
Why is there only one here?

244
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,639
Obviously, the other one is with me.

245
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,039
Then, head to
the hunting ground with me.

246
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,039
Your embroidery looks so ugly

247
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,440
and you want to be together with Yu?

248
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,290
Who do you think you are?

249
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
Your Highness,

250
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,500
everything has been arranged
according to your order.

251
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,337
(End of Episode)

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,679
I've only seen it in books.

253
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,720
