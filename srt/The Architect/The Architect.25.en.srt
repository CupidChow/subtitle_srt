00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,479
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,880
I have something to report.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,159
Speak.

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,399
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,880
the traitors

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
lied to Your Majesty.

7
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,240
Even if their bodies are burned,

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,890
we still can't appease the people's rage.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,479
However, burning the dead bodies
will pollute the air

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,790
and affect Your Majesty's health.

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,190
Your Majesty, please allow me

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,359
to dispose of the bodies
at the mass graves.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
His Majesty is the one

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
chosen by destiny.

15
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,920
There are no phantoms and spirits
that His Majesty can't subdue.

16
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,599
It's just a few bodies.

17
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,590
There's nothing to worry about.

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,840
His Majesty's might is overwhelming.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,439
Everything will be set right.

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,959
Your Majesty,

21
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:22,680
I think the bodies should not
be burned in the open

22
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,239
because it ruins
the image of the capital.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,319
All right.

24
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,799
Lord Pei,

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,120
you're right.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,475
I will

27
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,680
let you deal with

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,159
the bodies of these traitors.

00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,439
I believe

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,280
you won't disappoint me.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,159
I will

32
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,840

and burned them
in the Shen family's place.

Miss,

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,680
I just want

80
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,920
to be with Young Master
until he grows up

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,639

82
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,680

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,879
Li Wan'er's nanny is here.

86
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,279
She wants to meet you.

87
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,399
Greetings, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,240
Rise.

89
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,600
Lord Pei,

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,879
this item looks familiar.

91
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,399
Do you recognise it?

92
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,720
Your Majesty,

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,439
this ring's material
and workmanship are top-notch.

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,879
Moreover, it has the Shen family's mark.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,879
It should belong to the Shen family.

96
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,839
Didn't you burn the bodies of
the traitors of the Shen family?

97
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,959
Why is his ring

98
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,240
still intact?

99
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,480
Most of the Shen family's assets
have been seized.

100
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,720
However, the Shen family was rich

101
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,780
and had a wide influence.

102
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,519
Some of its assets
might be purchased by other people.

103
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:48,279
Please give me some time.

104
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,970
I will surely find all the assets
that belonged to the Shen family.

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,319
All right.

106
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,720
I've always been satisfied
with your work.

107
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,040
However,

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,480
Consort Shu doesn't know
what's appropriate.

109
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,187
I ordered her

110
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,639
to move out of Yanfu Palace.

111
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,839
I assign you

112
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,920
to send her to the cold palace.

113
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,360
Sister.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,480
Sister.

115
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,480
I've caused you trouble.

116
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,700
Do you still remember the straw house
we lived in when we were young?

117
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,480
This place is

118
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,500
so much better compared to before.

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,600
Moreover,

120
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,086
it's quiet here.

121
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,800
There aren't many rumors here.

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,079
I can finally take a break.

123
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,920
Sister,

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,879
with me around,

125
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,000
I will definitely solve this matter.

126
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Consort Pei colluded
with her natal relatives

127
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,839
to interfere in state affairs.

128
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,990
It is in violation
of the ancestral injunctions.

129
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,240
She will be banished
to the cold palace from today onwards.

130
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,120
Yu,

131
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,759
I chose this path myself.

132
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,639
Remember.

133
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,970
The more you care about someone,

134
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,340
the more that person

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,240
will be your weakness.

136
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,279
Sister!

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Wait for me.

138
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,720
Her Highness says

139
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,639
this must be handed to you in person.

140
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:03,712
(For Shen Changning)

141
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,399

It's fine.

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,159
You saved

148
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,159
my life.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm very happy

150
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
to save you.

151
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,399
I'm going to meet

152

Master and Madam.

153
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,559
I will tell them

154
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,600
that you will

155
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440

171

I've investigated it.

172
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:46,279
The assassin

173
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,320
is the emperor's guard.

174
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440

175
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,900
Don't keep it inside.

176
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,679
I won't cry.

177
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm going to avenge Lian.

178
