1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,960
Don't worry.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,050
I've sent the Qilin Guards

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,280
to keep a close watch on
Prince Duan's Residnece last night.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,919
They've had no time or chance

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,800
to move their assets.

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,239
No gold or silver was found.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,560
What's going on?

8
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,880
At your wits' end, huh?

9
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,119
Pei Yu,

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,280
I'd like to see how you deal with me.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,560
Guards,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,640
bring my horse.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm going to the palace right now
to seek His Majesty's audience.

14
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,000
Hold on.

15
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,325
=The Architect=

16
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,437
=Episode 16=
(If you die, it'll only be by my hand!)

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,375
(Ledger)

18
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,439
Pei Yu,

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,280
the Xiao family

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,439
helped the late Emperor

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
ascend the throne.

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,639
Even His Majesty

23
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,159
must give the late Emperor some face.

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,919
You think

25
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,919
you can topple me

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,879
with just this?

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Indeed,

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,439
if it weren't only embezzlement
and lining your own pockets,

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,260
at most you'd face
confiscation of property.

30
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,599
But Prince Duan's Residence

31
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,360
smuggled iron ore

32
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,520
and disrupted state order.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,719
That crime condemns your entire clan.

34
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,150
(Ledger)

35
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,280
This waterway chart

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,990
was stolen from the Shen family,
wasn't it?

37
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,919
You coveted their shipping routes.

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,960
To smuggle iron ore,

39
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,420
you framed the Shen family
for colluding with the enemy,

40
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,599
causing their whole family
to be executed.

41
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,599
(Why does she know)

42
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,919
(the Shen family's case so well?)

43
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,400
(Could it be...)

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
With the witnesses and evidence,

45
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,560
your guilt is confirmed.

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,199
Take Prince Duan and Xiao Huaijin
into custody

47
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,199
and escort them to prison for trial.

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

49
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,879
Let go of me!

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
Let go of me!

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,199
Move.

52
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,080
I can walk on my own.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,680
Let go!

54
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,390
His Majesty wants you to settle
the Canal Guild case within three days,

55
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,260
only then will he consider
overturning the Shen family's case.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,919
Isn't he making things hard for you?

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,520
The Canal Guild is secretly
training their own troop.

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,120
They're as vicious as ever.

59
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,199
This is no different from rebellion.

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,190
They trade on land
and turn into bandits on water.

61
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,759
If they weren't ruthless,

62
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,439
they would've been wiped out long ago.

63
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,390
The Canal Guild
has been a scourge for years

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,959
that I've wanted to get rid of.

65
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,712
Now that I have the imperial order,
I can eliminate them once and for all.

66
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,120
Alright.

67
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,879
I'll bring the Qilin Guards

68
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,759
and wipe them out.

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,120
Eliminating them is easy,

70
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,970
but keeping the grain routes running
is hard.

71
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,199
If the supply line breaks,
the people will panic.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,439
We can only win them over gently.

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,279
Two.

74
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,800
But we only have three days.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,079
Isn't it too difficult?

76
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,399
Any delay will cause trouble.

77
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,759
You head back first.

78
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,560
I have an idea.

79
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,759
The Xiao family said

80
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,759
there would be spies.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,639
And here

82
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,519
I'm catching

83
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,720
a big fish.

84
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,399
Stop struggling.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
The Celestial Cage is
forged from refined metal.

86
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,199
It's made to lock up skilled men
like you.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,759
Well done.

88
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,399
You really caught him.

89
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,079
I can't believe Governor Pei came here.

90
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm flattered.

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,360
But you broke into the Canal Guild

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,759
on your own.

93
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,519
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,079
True.

95
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,079
For the Canal Guild
to defy the imperial court is sheer folly.

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,199
I hope your bones

97
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,480
are as tough as your mouth.

98
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,399
Watch him.

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,800
Lock him up
for three days and three nights.

100
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,800
We'll talk once he's cooled off.

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Yes.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,040
(Pei Yu,)

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,680
(thank you for helping me uncover the truth
behind the Shen family's case.)

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,759
(But Yunqi, where are you?)

105
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,439
Miss.

106
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,120
It's late. You should rest.

107
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,439
Has Governor Pei returned?

108
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
He hasn't come back
since he left this morning.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,839
Maybe something held him up.

110
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,160
Miss,

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,399
are you worried about him?

112
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,399
Nonsense.

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,759
Why would I worry about him?

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,240
Yes.

115
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,519
You're not.

116
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,519
But why have you been stuck on
the same page all day?

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
I...

118
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,319
I'm worried Prince Duan's case

119
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,519
might go wrong again.

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
I have no news about that.

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,160
But I heard the guards
who came back said

122
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,920
the Governor went with Commander Qin
to investigate the Canal Guild.

123
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,120
Canal Guild?

124
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,279
This is bad!

125
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,000
Fire!

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,879
Put the fire out!

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Hurry!

128
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,279
Why are you here?

129
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,319
If I didn't come,

130
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,839
you'd be trapped to death in here.

131
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,800
I have my own way out.

132
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:19,120
Perhaps you'd be killed

133
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,487
before you even escaped.

134
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,000
This is the Celestial Cage.

135
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,399
Seamless and unbreakable.

136
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,159
No force can break it.

137
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,840
You can't break it,

138
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
but that doesn't mean I can't.

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,679
This is the Celestial Cage.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,519
The...

141
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,519
The Shen family searched everywhere
for good craftsmen

142
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,840
to build this mechanism.

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,600
It was meant to capture beasts.

144
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:58,879
I didn't know

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
it could capture humans.

146
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,600
This fire

147
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
seems strange.

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,320
Do you think

149
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,840
someone has come to rescue Pei Yu?

150
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,919
Go check.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,080
They couldn't have gone far.

152
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:14,960
Search!

153
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,879
Search!

154
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,519
I know

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,960
you snuck into the Canal Guild
to investigate the Shen family's case

156
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,360
and purposely ignored me.

157
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,039
I never thought

158
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,720
you'd risk your life to save me.

159
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't flatter yourself.

160
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,440
I just think

161
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,600
that if you die,

162
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,399
it'll only be by my hand.

163
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,039
(Even if you don't trust me,)

164
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,759
(I'm willing to stay in your shadow.)

165
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,919
Kill her!

166
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,799

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,360
So I've alerted them

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,759
when I came to save you?

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,320
It's only a minor threat.

192
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,600
Dealing with them

193
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,039
will just take more time.

194
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't worry.

195
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm not.

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,559
I just don't want things
to get out of control again.

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,790
Once we bring
the Canal Guild under control,

198
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,470
everything will move forward as planned.

199
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,519
How do you plan to do it?

200
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,840
How much do you know about
the Canal Guild?

201
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,759
Whatever the Shen family knew,

202
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,039
I know as well.

203
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,279
Good.

204
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,799
With you here, our plans will fall
perfectly into place.

205
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,087
(End of Episode)

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,039
(May all go smoothly
for the Governor.)

207
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,559
(May everything he seeks come true.)

208
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
Burn

209
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,480
all these charms.

210
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,639
If anything happens to her,

211
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,000
you'll be buried with her.
