You asked me to get some snacks.

69

But inside the snack box,
there's this thing.

70
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,199
It's Young Master's jade pendant.

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Master placed it on him.

72
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,279

73
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,199
(No. 29, East Exit)
Xiao Huaijin is

74
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,720
using Yunqi to trick me.

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm just

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
one step away from finding Yunqi.

77
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,240
Is the Young Master

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,839
really there?

Xiao Huaijin

80
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,519
is likely luring me in.

81
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,780
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

82
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,079
He thinks he is setting a trap.

83
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,680
But he didn't know

84
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm letting him do it.

85
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,279
This is

86
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,360
my chance to find Yunqi.

87
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,240
Miss,

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,279
what do we do now?

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Stay put.

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,120
We watch from the shadows.

91
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
I've tracked him for days.

92
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,199
Every day is the same.

93
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,800
I couldn't find a way

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,720
to confirm

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
which is the real Xiao Huaijin.

96
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,360
Xiao Huaijin is
hollowed out by debauchery.

97
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,240
He is weak inside,

98
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,399
unlike a martial artist.

99
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,560

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,959

101
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,399
That's him.

102
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,439
The real him.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,279
It's too dangerous.

104
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,959
I will go with you.

105
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,360
Xiao Huaijin doesn't know

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I've found him.

107
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,319
I'll scout ahead.

108
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,879
I need you to do
something more important.

109
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,319
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

110
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,240
Be alert.

111
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,399
Be cautious.

112
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,199

115
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,519
(No wonder Pei Yu
couldn't find any leads.)

116
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,079
Stand there.

117
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,199
Put down the basket.

118
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,000
Go in.

119
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Hurry up.

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
Yunqi.

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,159
Yunqi.

122
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,879
Stand back!

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
What do you want?

124
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,039
What do you think?

125
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,720
I advise you not to come closer.

126
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,480
Swords have no eyes.

127
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,559
Let her go.

128
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,480
If you want a fight,

129
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,559
fight me.

130
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,480
Pei Yu.

131
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,000
His Majesty ordered you
to hunt the Shen's fugitive.

132
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,440
Yet here you are sheltering them.

133
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,559
How

134
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,759
should His Majesty punish you?

135
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,799
I see

136
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,159
no Shen's fugitive here.

137
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,879
But you, you are killing the innocents.

138
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,000
Even if I kill you here,

139
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,039
His Majesty won't hold me accountable.

140
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,240
Is that so?

141
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,799
You will have to survive me first.

142
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,480
Release her,

143
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,840
and I will leave your corpse intact.

144
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,279
Intact?

145
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,320
You think you are in a position to negotiate?

146
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,440
Fine.

147
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,639

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,360

00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,600

151
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,080
Fine.

152
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,159
As you wish.

153
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,759

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,159

I'll take you down with me!

158
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,600
