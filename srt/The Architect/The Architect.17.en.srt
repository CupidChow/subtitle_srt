1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,240
How is it?

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,720
Nothing.

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,190
Have you found him?

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,720
No.

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,800
We're really water bandits now.

6
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,600
Stop your foolish trick!

7
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,119
You!

8
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,000
Who are you?

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,280
I'm the Goddess of River you
worship in all four seasons.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,479
Goddess of River?

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,799
The Canal Guild has prayed to the Goddess
of River for nearly a hundred years.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,039
We've never once seen her true form.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
If you claim to be the goddess,
can you prove it?

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,439
Right.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,990
Pretending to be a deity
will get you struck by lightning.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,880
Ignorant.

17
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,119
Slap him.

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,719
She really is the Goddess of River.

19
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,359
I spoke out of turn.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,560
Please forgive me, Goddess!

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,439
If not for your devotion,

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,599
I wouldn't have appeared to warn you.

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,280
You're a deity,

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,799
but...

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,760
Your real name is Zhao Er.

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,840
You were born to a hunter's family.

27
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,239
At seventeen, you were sold
to the Shen family as a guard.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,040
The master

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,640
saw your loyalty and courage,

30
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,480
so he lent you silver

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,159
to help you form the Canal Guild.

32
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,359
Goddess, you needn't say more.

33
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,000
I believe you.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
I believe you!

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,450
- Long live the Goddess of River!
- Long live the Goddess of River!

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Please bless the Canal
with smooth sailing!

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,190
Since you've appeared,

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,710
do you have any instructions for us?

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,359
I give you only one warning.

40
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,480
If you meet Pei Yu again,

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,159
do not oppose him.

42
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,439
Otherwise,

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
disaster will befall upon you.

44
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,519
Pei Yu?

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,439
I know your concern.

46
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,600
You're afraid the imperial court
will drain you of all you have.

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Pei Yu is nothing like the rumors.

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
He will treat you fairly.

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,319
We humbly obey your decree!

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
- We humbly obey your decree!
- We humbly obey your decree!

(My wish is for yours to come true!)

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,730
You added hallucinogenic powder
from Western Region into their drinks

54
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,719
and took back
the Canal Guild effortlessly.

55
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,400
Truly impressive.

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
Once the Xiao family surrenders,

57
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,290
they'll have to pay blood for blood
and give the Shen family justice.

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,039
After that,

59
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,759
do you have any other wishes?

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,479
To clear the Shen family's name.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,319
That's my wish.

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,690
What about you?

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,280
What do you wish for?

Who's that?

98
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,439
You got someone
to impersonate Xiao Huaijin

99
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,360
to lure me here.

100
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,480
So what if I did?

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Did you really think

102
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,240
you could find the evidence

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,000
of him escaping the prison?

104
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,079
The Prince Duan's Residence
is corrupt and treacherous.

105
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,240
The evidence is solid.

106
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,759
Right now,

107
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,160
he's waiting to be executed.

108
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,600
A lowborn concubine like you

109
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,879
thinks you can topple
Prince Duan's Residence?

110
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
Keep dreaming.

111
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,560
Vixen really has no brain.

112
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,079
You claim Prince Duan smuggled iron ore?

113
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,959
I can say he was following
His Majesty's secret orders

114
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,360
to store silver for the treasury.

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,600
He killed the entire Shen family.

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,800
How do you explain
dozens of innocent lives?

117
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,319
Who saw it?

118
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,560
What proof do you have?

119
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,199
Who would dare accuse Prince Duan?

120
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,120
You're powerless

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
and being ridiculous.

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
At worst,

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
Prince Duan and his son will be exiled.

124
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,920
A few years later,

125
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,000
His Majesty will call him back.

126
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,000
But taking your life

127
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,839
is easier than pinching an ant.

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,959
I'd like to see

129
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
who can save you today.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Go.

131
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,160
Kill her.

132
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,759
Yu,

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
don't you like

134
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,919
watching women dance?

135
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
I practiced this dance so hard

136
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,679
that my feet swelled.

137
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,919
Why don't you like it?

138
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,960
What did you do to Xi Yan?

139
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,840
She's dead.

140
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,919
If she were dead,

141
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,440
you wouldn't be scheming this much.

142
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,360
Remember.

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,600
If anything happens to her,
you'll be buried with her.

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,240
I'll be buried with her?

145
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,240
Did you forget, Yu?

146
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,879
When I was little,
my father was murdered.

147
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,039
The enemy wanted me dead too.

148
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,000
You were the one who saved me.

149
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,480
Why?

150
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,679
Why can't you protect me

151
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,799
as you did back then?

152
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,279
I'm warning you.

153
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,080
If you lay a finger on Xi Yan again,

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
hurt her even a little,

155
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,679
and I'll take it back tenfold.

156
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,000
Understand?

157
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Yu!

158
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,360
Your Highness.

159
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,200
Your Highness,

160
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
what happened?

161
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,639
Your Highness.

162
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,159
He wants to kill me for her.

163
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,639
He doesn't care

164
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,320
about me at all.

165
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,879
Your Highness.

166
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,399
Just why?

167
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,120
You have fifteen minutes.

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,639
Don't worry, Father.

169
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,559
I've arranged everything.

170
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Those ministers at court

171
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,679
will all speak for us

172
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,200
in front of His Majesty.

173
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm the non-imperial prince
appointed by the late Emperor.

174
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,200
I've rendered

175
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,399
countless merits.

176
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,039
His Majesty won't punish me.

177
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,879
You don't need to fawn over anyone.

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,759
I was only reminded of

179
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,159
General Li.

180
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,080
They said

181
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
he had too many achievements,

182
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,080
that's why...

183
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,120
But it's nothing serious.

184
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,679
In the end,

185
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,960
we can find a scapegoat.

186
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,879
A scapegoat, is it?

187
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,759
The Prince Duan's Residence
smuggled imperial iron ore.

188
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,840
The evidence is conclusive.

189
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,879
I wonder what gives you the confidence

190
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,500
that you think
you can escape punishment?

191
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:31,840
Lowly maid.

192
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,279
You think a mere iron ore

193
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
can bring me down?

194
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,399
Once I'm out,
you'll be the first I get rid of.

195
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,240
You don't care about
the iron mines case.

196
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,090
Then what about framing Shen Wenyuan

197
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,600
and murdering the Shen family in prison?

198
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,440
You!

199
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,360
You're spouting nonsense!

200
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,399
You think killing them all

201
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,840
can hide your crime?

202
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
Not everyone can sleep soundly

203
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,200
after taking lives like you do.

204
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Your accomplices and those who helped you

205
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,919
have all confessed.

206
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
You brat,

207
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,440
what have you done?

208
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,399
Impossible.

209
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,639
This is impossible!

210
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,440
The way you framed the Shen family

211
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
and killed them,

212
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,879
every detail is written clearly
in this testimony.

213
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,000
If I present it to His Majesty,

214
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,519
you know very well

215
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,480
what will happen.

216
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
So what if you hand it over?

217
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm the prince personally granted my title
by the late Emperor.

218
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,879
If we confront each other
before His Majesty,

219
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,840
who knows how it will end?

220
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,039
True.

221
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:45,879
But what if

222
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,720
you're no longer able to speak?

223
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,840
Xiao Huaijin,

224
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,440
Prince Duan is guilty beyond redemption.

225
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,159
Are you willing to

226
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,480
let the entire Prince Duan's Residence
go down with him?

227
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,100
(End of Episode)

228
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,679
In His Majesty's eyes,

229
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:11,600
the Prince Duan's Residence
has always been this.

230
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,600
(Xiao Huaijin shall inherit the title)

231
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,759
(and be promoted to
Left Vice Minister of Revenue.)

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
(That's all.)

233
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,799
(I thank Your Majesty
for your boundless grace.)

234
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,720
(Do status and power
give you the right to take innocent lives?)

235
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,399
(I will not accept that!)

236
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,930
(If it comes to it,
I'll drag you down with me!)
