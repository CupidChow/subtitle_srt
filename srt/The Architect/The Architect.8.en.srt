Your Lordship.

00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,400
Xi Yan always moves between

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,759
you and Young Lord Xiao,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,230
and her attitude towards
the Shen family matters is ambiguous.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,590
Feigning obedience
while secretly defying.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,480
Highly suspicious.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,679
I believe

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,280
this woman must not be kept any longer.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
She will sooner or later bring disaster.

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,719
When she wakes up,

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,199
interrogate her strictly.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,719
Beauty amidst the colorful clouds.

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,560
Wishing to speak across the distant sky.

14
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,719
Beauty amidst the colorful clouds.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,280
Wishing to speak across the distant sky.

16
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,200
Longing with no way to meet.

17
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,960
Gazing sadly at the cool breeze ahead.

18
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,079
This is a poem I wrote.

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,439
If we can meet again,

20
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,719
we will surely recognize each other
through this secret message.

No matter the cost,

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,799
I want her alive.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,799

I did not die.

Your Lordship.

39
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,560
If I were born into a prestigious family
like Shen Changning,

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,560
would you still be so frivolous with me?

41
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,840
(So you are Shen Changning.)

42
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,039
(Alas, fate is cruel.)

43
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,960
(You saved my life.)

44
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,039
(I, however,
exterminated the entire Shen clan,)

45
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,200
(harming you and your family.)

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280

Awake?

Your Lordship.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,960
This time I acted rashly
out of impatience,

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,680
wanting to investigate the Shen case.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,500
No need to explain.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,319
I understand.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,199
You want to avenge Shen Changning

56
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,680
for the Shen family.

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Why did the you also appear
at the Shen Residence's annex?

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
I am the chief judge for the Shen case.

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,919
After found a new clue,
of course I must investigate to the end.

60
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,280
Just don't know

61
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,759
whether you want to clear the injustice

62
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,199
or covets the Shen family treasure?

63
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,620
Naturally, to clear
the Shen family's name,

64
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,200
and return justice to the Shen family.

65
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,039
Whether you believe it or not.

66
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,759
Regarding the Shen case,

67
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,199
I am always on your side.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,879
Your Lordship, I'll remember

69
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,920
your words today.

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,439
If you find the enemy,

71
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,240
what would you do?

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,319
Wash the hatred with blood.

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,199
Repay injustice with life.

74
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,399
With your skills,

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,079
even if facing the enemy directly,

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,290
it's hard to protect yourself.

77
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,771
I can't always appear in time.

78
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't understand
what you mean by this.

79
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,160

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240

Consort Shu is in trouble.

Let's go.

110
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,399
Your Majesty.

111
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,920
The Empress Dowager fell ill after seeing
some fallen flowers.

112
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:55,959
She believes

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,160
that it alludes to the decline
of Daliang,

114
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,990
and demands severe punishment
for Consort Shu.

Flowers bloom and fall,

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,839
that is the law of nature.

117
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,040
How could one possibly
place the blame on Consort Shu?

118
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,170
Your Majesty need not trouble yourself.

119
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,600
It was I, who failed
to supervise properly.

120
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,500
I am willing to accept punishment.

121
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Majesty.

122
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,200
If my elder sister is at fault,

123
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,890
I am willing to take the punishment
in her stead.

124
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,160
No.

125
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,390
How could I let my younger brother
suffer for me?

126
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
Very well.

127
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,440
For the sake of your sibling bond,
you shall take the thirty lashes

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,200
on behalf of Consort Shu.

129
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,919
Your Majesty.

130
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,320
My beloved.

131
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:43,039
Mr. Pei

132
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,600
comes from the military.

133
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:45,639
His character

134
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,825
is upright and impulsive.

135
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,250
I valued him so highly

136
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,879
that I even granted Wan'er
to him in marriage.

137
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,525
And what did he do?

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,200
He caused Wan'er to fall gravely ill,

139
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,440
disregarding the dignity
of the royal family.

140
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,000
This time, let the two offenses
be punished together,

141
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,799
a light punishment as a warning.

142
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,600
These blows

143
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,559
are not to Pei Governor's body,

144
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
but to his honor.

145
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Yu.

146
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,960
Your suffering in court

147
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,799
is all because of me.

148
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,919
From now on, matters of the harem

149
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
shall be handled by me.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,960
Sister.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,950
Do not blame yourself.

152
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
This act

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,879
was directed at me all along.

154
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,639
Alright, Your Lordship.

155
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,360
Your Lordship.

156
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,279
This is too much.

157
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
You have defended the borders

158
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,399
and accomplished countless feats,

159
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,559
and cleaned up many messes for others.

160
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,840
How can you endure such humiliation?

161
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,039
Receiving my salary,
and worrying for the state.

162
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,240
This is my duty.

163
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,120
Yet I cannot bear

164
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,399
that you carry so much blame.

165
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:19,279
No matter how the world slanders me,

166
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,000
defames me,

167
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,759
it cannot harm me in the slightest.

168
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
To me,

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,879
it is inconsequential.

170
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,360
And the Shen family?

171
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,399
Shen...

172
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
What about Miss Xi Yan?

173
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,700
There's no way you don't care about her.

174
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,600
To seek the truth,

175
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,559
every step is perilous.

176
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,320
What you must first learn

177
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
is the art of hidden weapons.

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
But for a beginner,

179
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,159
shouldn't self-defense come first?

180
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,159
Only by understanding

181
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,100
can one defend against it.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,639
See?

183
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,759
Showing weakness to the enemy
can still lure them in.

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,759
This move

185
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,000
would only fool me.

186
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,639
If it can fool you,

187
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,600
I can win.

188
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,279
Using oneself as bait,

189
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,759
drawing others into the trap,

190
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,960
piercing oneself

191
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
also pierces the enemy.

192
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,200
It's snowing.

193
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,919
In previous years, what did you do
when it snowed?

194
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
Of course, I ate the tangerines
my father gave me.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,250
Every year, my father and I...

196
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
All these are old memories.

197
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,159
It's not interesting to talk about.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,759
Mr. Pei.

199
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,240
The punishment I gave you a few days ago

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,159
was a bit severe.

201
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,679
Today,

202
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,590
I specially arranged a banquet at home.

203
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,279
Speak.

204
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,000
What compensation do you want?

205
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,559
Your Majesty,

206
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,000
the thunder and rain,

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
all are your grace.

208
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
I have recently obtained new clues

209
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,360
and wish to ask Your Majesty

210
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,480
to allow me to re-investigate
an old case.

211
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,960
What clues?

212
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,600
Which old case?

213
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,331
I discovered that the head
of the Shen clan

214
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,740
colluded with foreigners
through secret letters.

215
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,519
Compared with the usual documents,

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,220
the handwriting looks similar,

217
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,080
but it was not written
by the same person.

218
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,879
So do you think the Ministry of Justice
made a mistake,

219
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,559
or

220
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,720
I passed the wrong judgment?

221
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,039
I dare not say.

222
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,559
The Shen family case has long been
sealed by the Ministry of Justice,

223
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,679
and it is a closed case.

224
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,919
Just because a few characters
differ in handwriting,

225
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,720
you recklessly reopen the case?

226
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
Where is the law of the state?

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Where is the dignity of the court?

228
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,200
Wait until you have ironclad evidence,

229
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,519
then submit a memorial to me.

230
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,240
Yu.

231
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,639
His Majesty has already spoken.

232
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,679
You should thank him.

233
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,399
Thank you, Your Majesty.

234
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,600
I,

235
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,559
will do my utmost
and not fail Your Majesty's grace.

236
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,240
I

237
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,600
am a bit tired.

238
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,480
Today,

239
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,840
let's end here.

240
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,399
Yu, you've had too much to drink.

241
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,720
I'll take you back home.

242
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,960
Miss, this was specially prepared for you

243
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,500
before the Governor entered the palace.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,799
Miss,

245
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
I see that the Governor

246
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,960
cares for you in every way.

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,600
Could he really be in love with you?

248
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,080
Do not

249
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,399
be deceived by false affection.

250
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:11,720
A tangerine

251
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
tastes just right when

252
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,960
it's 40 percent sour
and 60 percent sweet.

253
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,080
As for feelings,

254
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,519
just two percent is enough to make reality
and pretense indistinguishable.

255
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,590
Your Lordship, you're back.

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,559
Your Lordship.

257
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Help me.

258
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,279
You lowly maid!

259
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,850
(End of Episode)

260
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,559
She can put effort into deceiving me,
and not other men,

261
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,919
that's enough.
