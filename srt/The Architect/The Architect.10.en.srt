00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,759
Xi Yan.

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,519
You are already my honored consort.

3
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,359
(Why would I dream of such a thing?)

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,960
(The entire Shen clan died unjustly.)

5
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,210
(Not to mention Pei Yu has yet
to clear his name,)

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,679
(even if he were innocent,)

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,600
(if I let affection cloud my mind,)

8
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,280
(it would disgrace the ancestors
of the Shen family.)

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,479
(Shen Changning,)

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
(as long as you are alive,)

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,520
(you must never forget)

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,180
(the blood-deep hatred
of the Shen clan.)

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,240
(Even if you have only one breath left,)

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,520
(you must keep it to avenge
the Shen family's injustice.)

15
00:01:32,412 --> 00:01:34,312
(Shen)

16
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,241
(Were the Shens killed for wealth?)

17
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,346
(Yet valuables were untouched.)

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,275
(Was Prince Duan's Residence involved?)

19
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,959
(Why is there no record
of the mysterious man in the case file?)

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Greetings,

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Your Highness.

22
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,959
Your Highness.

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,359
Insolent!

24
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,560
The Governor's study's

25
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,799
contents are state secrets.

26
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,560
Even I cannot enter without permission.

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,829
What are you to sit here so boldly?

28
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,919
Matron Li.

29
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,479
Yes.

30
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,479
Teach her properly

31
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,879
what rules are.

32
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,400
Your Highness.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,520
She hit me.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,639
- Your Highness cannot enter,
- Your Highness.

35
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,120
doesn't mean I cannot enter.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
This is the Governor's Residence.

37
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
It follows the Governor's rules.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
How dare you

39
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,759
lay a hand on my people?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,639
Seize her.

41
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,400
Yes.

42
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,240
Quickly.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,319
Matron Li,

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,199
cut off her hand.

45
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,280
Stay still.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,199
With no proof,

47
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,680
you punish me with private torture?

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
You treat lives as nothing,

49
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,159
how are you fit to be mistress
of this residence?

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,719
Do you deserve it?

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,919
How dare you rebuke me?

52
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,919
Do you even know what you are?

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
Why haven't you done it yet?

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,890
- Greetings, Your Lordship.
- Greetings, Your Lordship.

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,120
Miss.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,599
I did not know

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,380
the servants in my residence
had begun using your surname.

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,039
Yu.

59
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,520
I only

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,319
helped discipline

61
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,840
one of your concubines.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,759
Discipline a concubine?

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,639
Your Highness has repeatedly

64
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,240
used private punishment in my residence.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,439
Do you take my rules for nothing?

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,719
Yu.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,599
This lowly maid barged into your study.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Should she not be punished?

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
I already granted her permission

70
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,120
to enter freely.

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,279
From today on,

72
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,759
you will move into my room.

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,839
Stay by my side day and night,

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,279
sleep and eat with me,

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,759
go wherever I go,

76
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,920
so others will not misunderstand again.

(My vital point lies here.)

79
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
You seem interested in my study.

80
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,079
This is not my first time here.

81
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,199
The Princess made a fuss over nothing.

82
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,959
If you want something,

83
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,680
you can simply ask.

84
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,800
I may not refuse.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,319
You

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
aren't punishing me for trespassing?

87
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,120
Since I have ordered it,

88
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,360
you may serve me closely from now on.

you may go.

(Though I found no solid evidence,
at least I used this chance)

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,990
(to kill Li Wan'er's influence.)

93
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,680
(I just didn't expect)

94
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,920
(Pei Yu to protect me like this.)

95
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,680
