1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,560
Where is she?

2
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,679
It's you?

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,039
Your Lordship, are you shocked

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,920
that the drug you gave me
wasn't strong enough?

5
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,160
Drug?

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,320
If you intend to help Li Wan'er,

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,039
why did you act before me?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
What's going on?

9
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,119
The servants of the residence told me
that you gave me a box.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,359
I passed out after I opened it.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,560
Then, I was brought here.

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,000
I never asked my servants
to do such a thing.

13
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,075
Regardless of whether you did it or not,

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,240
I've let you have a taste
of your own medicine

15
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:58,079
and knocked out Li Wan'er.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,920
When is the auction going to start?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,079
What's the rush?

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,520
It will begin soon.

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,370
I've been waiting for half a day.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,200
If I didn't wake up in time,

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,879
I would be the one being appraised.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,719
Come back with me.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
I'll give you an explanation.

24
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,625
=The Architect=

25
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:08,680
=Episode 11=
(Come and Take My Life Anytime)

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,479
I'm sure all of you know the rules.

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,639
The highest bidder wins.

28
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,759
(Ugly)
Get your money ready.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
We will begin soon.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,000
The auction begins.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
I bid 2,000 taels!

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
2,000 taels!

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,960
I bid 5,000 taels!

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,680
5,000 taels!

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,800
Any higher bids?

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,599
7,000 taels!

37
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,520
7,000 taels! Any higher bids?

38
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:25,542
8,000 taels!

39
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,879
8,000 taels!

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,919
10,000 taels!

41
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,159
This young master bids 10,000 taels!

42
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,560
Any higher bids?

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,639
12,000 taels!

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
You have good taste, Sir!

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,879
15,000 taels!

46
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,319
20,000 taels!

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Tonight's top courtesan

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
belongs to you, Master Liu.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,390
If you want to leave,

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,690
I will bring you
out of this place safely.

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,400
What do you mean, Your Lordship?

52
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,199
Is someone going to stop me?

53
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,599
Master Liu, you are lucky.

54
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,879
Congratulations, Official Liu.

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,639
Master Liu,

56
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,719
I guarantee it's worth what you paid.

57
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,599
Come.

58
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,319
Raise the curtain

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,439
and let Master Liu appraise the goods.

60
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,039
How dare you!

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
I am the current princess,

62
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,639
and the emperor's foster daughter!

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,199
How dare you treat me rudely!

64
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,280
Seriously?

65
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,159
Princess?

66
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,639
Calm down, Miss.

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
If you serve Master Liu,

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,439
I'm sure your life

69
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,879
will be better than a princess's.

70
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,840
Just follow Master Liu

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,319
and you can enjoy all things in life!

72
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,199
Isn't it better
than your current situation?

73
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,360
Master Liu is rich!

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Yes!

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,599
Exactly!

76
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
I will gouge all your eyes

77
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,919
and cut all your tongues!

78
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,730
She's a feisty one.

79
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,159
How interesting.

80
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,680
I like her.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,680
Pretty,

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,319
I'm coming for you.

83
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,039
What are you doing?

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,639
This...

85
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,759
Who is this?

86
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,959
I said

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,240
I'd gouge all your eyes

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,879
and cut all your tongues!

89
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,879
How can I go back on my word?

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,360
Your Highness!

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,639
Your Highness, please spare me!

92
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Your Highness, spare me!

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,879
If I knew you were the princess,

94
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,519
I'd never do it
no matter how brave I am.

95
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,639
Your Highness, I beg you.

96
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,279
Spare me.

97
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,879
Do it!

98
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,720
Your Highness, spare me!

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,160
You didn't even blink
when you tried to harm me.

100
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,879
Why are you trying to kill others

101
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,250
when you are the one
being viewed and appraised now?

102
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,360
Wretch.

103
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,199
Who do you think you are?

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Not only am I going to kill you today,

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,839
but I want everyone here

106
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,480
to die with you.

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,759
Your Highness, spare me!

108
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,079
You've been humiliated

109
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,680
yet you still don't hold back.

110
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,040
You only want
to take other people's lives.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,637
Not only does the Princess of Daliang

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
not contribute to the kingdom,

113
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,160
but she also wants
the people's blood on her hands.

114
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,600
How dare you call yourself
a member of Daliang's royalty?

115
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,439
Preposterous!

116
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,839
You are just a courtesan in a brothel.

117
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,800
How dare you reprimand me?

118
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,600
Today,

119
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
I will cut off all your tongues!

120
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,720
I want all of you to reincarnate

121
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,000
as mutes.

122
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,800
Li Wan'er.

123
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,079
You can kill us,

124
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,790
but you can't stop the people
from saying what they want.

125
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,279
Even if everyone here is dead,

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,160
your evil deeds today

127
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,120
will be spread around the world.

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,079
Kill them!

129
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,120
Who dares kill her?

130
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,519
Yu.

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,720
Yu.

132
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,079
Don't look at me.

133
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,920
When I'm around,

134
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,600
anyone who acts recklessly

135
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,990
will be punished for the crime
of harming the common people.

136
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,360
Li Wan'er,

137
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
you are no longer

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
the princess I know.

139
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,199
You came back for them.

140
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,240
Aren't you afraid of exposing yourself
before Li Wan'er?

141
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,240
No one knows the feeling

142
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:58,720
of being trampled on

143
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,519
with no right to explain
more than I do.

144
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,040
However,

145
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,279
as the princess,

146
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,950
I'm sure
she won't just give up so easily.

147
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,044
She will probably
complain to the emperor.

148
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,360
Are you worried
that you might get me involved?

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
With you protecting me,

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,040
we will rise

151
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,800
and fall together.

152
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,680
Nanny, harder.

153
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:35,839
Wipe it off.

154
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,279
(Ugly)
Sure.

155
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:38,912
(Ugly)

156
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,120
How dare a lowly courtesan

157
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,759
do such a thing to the princess?

158
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,439
She can't atone for her crime
even if she dies 100 times.

159
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,120
You...

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,040
How dare you

161
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,000
trespass on
the Mistress's room at night?

162
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,839
Your Highness.

163
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,680
The Governor orders me to remove
all of Your Highness' belongings

164
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,319
from the Governor's Residence.

165
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,879
You...

166
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,560
How dare you!

167
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,510
The emperor granted the marriage
between the Governor and me.

168
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,639
I'll see who dares do that!

169
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
Your Highness
received the royal family's grace

170
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,360
yet you can't endure others.

171
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,000
You've tried to harm the women
of this residence multiple times

172
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,782
and caused chaos
at the Governor's Residence.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,900
The Governor asked me
to inform Your Highness

174
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,390
that the residence cannot afford
to handle the princess.

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Move.

176
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

177
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,480
Nanny!

178
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,759
Your Highness.

179
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,000
It's all right.

180
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,240
I...

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,360
I was rude.

182
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,879
I shouldn't argue with the princess.

183
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
With Her Highness' status as a royalty,

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,879
she is the most suitable candidate

185
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,600
to be Your Lordship's wife.

186
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,759
When will you face me
with your true identity?

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,279
I wonder what you mean?

188
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,960
You always seek revenge
and use all possible tricks.

189
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,120
You didn't even care
about the Governor's Residence's Madam.

190
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,679
Why do you pretend to be a concubine

191
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,919
who only flatters me?

192
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Regardless of your identity,

193
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,360
you can tell me

194
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,360
any request you have.

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,293
As long as I can give it to you,
I won't be stingy about it.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,519
Can you give me anything?

197
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,799
Anything.

198
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
Does it include your life?

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
Come and take it anytime.

200
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,440
Your Lordship,
there's no need to flatter me.

201
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,639
One day, you will believe

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
that you won't have to

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
put on a facade
to protect yourself before me.

204
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
One day,

205
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,100
Your Lordship will also understand

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
that there is something

207
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,400
that I can't afford to ask for

208
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:17,840
because I can't take it

209
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,879
and it isn't necessary.

210
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,040
For the sake
of the Governor's Residence,

211
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,190
Your Lordship should think of a way
to resolve this.

If a man
wants to achieve something great,

244

248
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,879
are you feeling reluctant?

She's just a concubine.

253
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,600
Why would I feel reluctant?

254
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,759
Your Lordship.

255
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,680
You got arrogant because I spoiled you
and went against the princess.
