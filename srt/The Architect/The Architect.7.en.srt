1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,612
(Eternal Joy)

00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,375
=The Architect=

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,538
=Episode 7=
(Who is really hiding)

4
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:07,425
=Episode 7=
(beneath her human-skin mask?)

5
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,587
(Eternal Joy)

6
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,760
Your Highness.

7
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,239
Madam recently often feels that the backyard
has too much yin energy,

8
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,800
fearing evil spirits might harm people.

9
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
So she specially invited a Taoist master

10
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,040
to hold a ritual

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,519
to exorcise demons.

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Lordship.

13
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:11,120
Should we stop them
so things don't get out of hand?

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,599
Just watch.

15
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:18,962
Everyone is here.

16
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,162
Please use the talisman
to subdue the demon.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
Miss, be careful.

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,120
This is aimed at you.

19
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,960
Many demons and evil spirits
in the world

20
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,280
are nothing but manifestations
of the human heart.

21
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,660
Heaven and Earth are boundless.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Use the law of the universe.

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,450
Ghosts and monsters.

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
Exterminate evil completely.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,599
Quickly!

26
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,840
Miss.

27
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:01,520
Your Highness.

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,479
This person

29
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,719
is the painted-skin evil spirit
possessed by a yin soul.

30
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,439
If we don't eliminate it quickly,

31
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,680
the household will never have peace.

32
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,000
So it's you after all.

33
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,439
Do you have anything else to say?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Your Highness, do you think
that with just a few martial tricks

35
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,960
and a handful of paper ashes,

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,879
you can accuse me of being possessed?

37
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,240
If not for you,

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,639
how would the talisman have flown here?

39
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,319
Even though you are from a noble family,

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,439
how can you be like a foolish woman

41
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,639
and believing such absurd words?

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,080
You...

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
No matter how sharp-tongued you are,

44
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,462
you cannot escape today.

45
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,599
The evil spirit has revealed itself.

46
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,479
Hurry and exorcise it.

47
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,479
Yes.

48
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,360
Heaven sends mysterious fire.

49
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,520
Burn away the evil.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,520
Quickly!

51
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,400
Your Highness, it's really thundering.

52
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,919
Quickly!

53
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,280
Your Highness.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,560
Your cloak is on fire.

55
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,680
Quick, put out the fire!

56
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,919
Put out the fire!

57
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,399
Someone come!

58
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:18,920
Quick!

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,680
Useless!

60
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:25,662
(Safety notice: White phosphorus
is flammable, do not imitate)

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,360
Miss.

62
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,160
We cannot sit and wait to die.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,480
This is white phosphorus.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,240
Since Li Wan'er wants to cause trouble,

65
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,575
let's add some extra effect for her.

66
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,120
Move quickly.

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,900
The princess has already lain down,

68
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,279
but seems quite frightened.

69
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,600
Daring to play ghost tricks in
the Governor's Residence

70
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,525
is asking for trouble.

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,680
Xi Yan is indeed skilled.

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,480
Everything is done flawlessly.

73
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,319
But this woman is reckless

74
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,319
and secretive,

75
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,480
even Miss Shen's maid, Lian

76
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,439
serves her as master.

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
Truly suspicious.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,279
Your Lordship.

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,759
Are you painting Xi Yan

80
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,905
or Shen Changning?

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,199
You can paint skin and bone,
but not the heart.

82
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
You tell me.

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,800
Does the world really have
the art of returning a soul to a body?

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,959
Go.

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,199
Bring her over.

86
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,000
I want to see

87
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,160
who is really hiding

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,879
beneath her human-skin mask.

89
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,287
Your Lordship.

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,319
Your Lordship, are you there?

91
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,127
(Erotic painting?)

92
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,519
These erotic paintings

93
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,319
are all from

94
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,040
what you saw and learned in the brothel.

95
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Why instinctively avoid it?

96
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,720
(Pei Yu was very restrained
when facing seduction previously.)

97
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,639
(Why so urgent tonight?)

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
(It seems this erotic painting
is a test for me.)

99
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,990
I was originally a dancer
from the Western Regions.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,120
I harmed by villains

101
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,170
and ended up in a brothel.

102
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,560
How can you insult my humble origins?

103
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,600
But weren't you

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,519
always wanting to offer yourself
to me before?

105
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,639
Today I shall grant you that.

I can teach you.

♪How should one bid farewell♪

115
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Your Lordship.

116
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,839
If I were born to a noble family
like Shen Changning,

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,040
would you still treat me
with such frivolity?

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,160
Would you still constantly

119
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,279
despise me for being from a brothel?

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,240
Would you act like Princess Wan'er,

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,199
insulting me in every possible way?

122
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,519
(I must be crazy.)

123
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
(I feel she resembles
Shen Changning more and more.)

124
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,120
Boring.

125
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Shameless.

126
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,039
Using such despicable methods

127
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,799
to deal with me.

128
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,200
If the Shen family still existed,
you wouldn't suffer this injustice.

129
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,039
The world is treacherous.

130
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
Evil runs rampant.

131
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,519
Women are easily treated unfairly.

132
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,440
But as long as I can avenge
the Shen family,

133
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,679
this humiliation

134
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,449
means nothing.

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Miss.

136
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,900
After I was caught
in the Shen Residence,

137
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,080
I bribed the guards

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,159
and entered the prison.

139
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,879
Sir.

140
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,600
I truly didn't expect

141
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
the Shen family to be so stubborn.

142
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,519
They would rather die than confess.

143
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,200
I'll give you only one month.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
If the Shen treasure map isn't found,

145
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,879
I guarantee you'll suffer more
than death.

146
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,480
Later,

147
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,679
I brought the young master

148
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,320
to seek Li Wan'er's help.

149
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,960
Unexpectedly,

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,600
she sold me and the young master.

151
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,360
The one who betrayed the Shen family

152
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:43,906
was Li Gang.

153
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,960
You just said

154
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,360
the mysterious person wore a black robe
and a half mask.

155
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,960
Now that I think about it,

156
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,120
the figure resembles Pei Yu.

157
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,240
Pei Yu was the chief judge
of the Shen case.

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,679
He's the prime suspect.

159
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,240
Even if the mysterious person isn't him,

160
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,840
it's definitely connected to him.

161
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,200
Miss.

162
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,120
What should we do next?

163
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,759
The treasure map, right?

164
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,519
Since they want it,

165
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll give it to them.

166
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,700
(Shen Residence)

167
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,759
They finally can't hide it anymore.

168
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,337
(Shen Residence)

169
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,600
(Shen Residence)

170
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,850
(Keep one's abilities in reserve)

171
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,639
Smoke.

172
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,812
(Wind lifts ornate sleeves)

173
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
(Black robe.)

174
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,320
(Ghost mask.)

175
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,960
(Hiding partially.)

176
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
(I want to see)

177
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,720
(who you really are.)

178
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,000
Using the treasure map to lure me here,

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,679
it must be a remnant of the Shen family.

180
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,360
Tell me.

181
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,879
Where is the Shen family's
treasure hidden?

182
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:42,937
(End of Episode)

183
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,159
Do you want to clear the wrongful case

184
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,600
or covet the Shen family treasure?

185
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,919
If you find the enemy,

186
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,639
what will you do?

187
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,600
Wash the hatred with blood.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,679
Repay the injustice with life.

189
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,360
(If one day I am destined to die,)

190
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,080
