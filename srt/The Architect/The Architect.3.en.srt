1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,418
(Xichun House dancer Xi Yan)

2
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,812
(Months ago, first met in Xichun House)

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Is this pressure all right, My Lord?

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,359
(Back then, Xi Yan didn't know)

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,839
(because of those)

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,679
(eyes so similar to Shen Changning's,)

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
(Pei Yu looked at her one extra time.)

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,280
(And she became Xiao Huaijin's)

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,920
(chess piece against Pei Yu.)

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,600
(She was sent
to the Governor's Residence)

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,799
(and eventually killed
by Li Wan'er's jealousy.)

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,759
You hold your liquor well.

13
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,000
Please return the hand drum
to me, My Lord.

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,200
(I never imagined there could
be eyes so alike in this world.)

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,959
You must come find me again next time.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,719
Yes, of course.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,319
(Pei Yu would take interest in her.)

18
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,599
(A chess piece delivered to my door.)

19
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,319
(I will make full use of her.)

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,159
Once you're in a brothel,
you serve clients.

21
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,519
Who do you think you are? A noble lady?

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,079
Dropping airs like that.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
Pretending to be pure.

24
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,120
Remember this.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,120
Don't dream of escaping Daliang.

26
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,959
You were born to serve men, low as dirt.

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
Xi Yan.

28
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,280
Young Lord Xiao.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Leave her contract behind.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,120
And get out.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,919
- Yes.
- I'll settle accounts with you later.

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,970
Thank you, Young Lord Xiao.

33
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,080
Xi Yan.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,479
I'm sorry I came late.

35
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,840
Why?

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,560
What wrong have I committed?

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,680
It's Pei Yu.

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Because he covets your beauty,

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,500
he has schemed again and again,
trying to force you to yield.

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,960
He failed to harm you before,

41
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,400
so he planned to sell you to a brothel.

42
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,439
I truly hate myself.

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,599
I can only save you for a moment,

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,759
not a lifetime.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,719
Now,

46
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,120
only you can save yourself.

47
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,240
(Xi Yan, I have found the one
who sealed you in the coffin.)

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,080
(It was Pei Yu.)

49
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,639
(I can protect you for a time,)

50
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,479
(not for a lifetime.)

51
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,879
(At this point,)

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,479
(our only option is
to join hands against him.)

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,680
(You'll enter the Governor's Residence,
feed the tiger with your body,)

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
(and act as my informant.)

55
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,380
(I will set things up outside,
waiting for an opening.)

56
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,199
(Just follow my instructions.)

57
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,560
(When all is done,
you will regain freedom)

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,360
(and I will take you into my residence,)

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,280
(making you my consort.)

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,439
I entered the residence days ago,

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,039
but you haven't summoned me.

62
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,319
Winter sits silent.

63
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,479
I'm willing to warm your bed
and please you.

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
I humbly ask for your favor.

65
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:06,978
Get out.

66
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,025
=The Architect=

67
00:04:50,362 --> 00:04:51,241
=Episode 3=
(What hidden thoughts lurk)

68
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,200
=Episode 3=
(beneath your bewitching exterior?)

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
You clearly

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,120
helped Xiao Huaijin frame me.

71
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,839
Why the sudden change of mind?

72
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,839
Did you think that little dance
you performed in my study

73
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,560
could fool me?

74
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm indeed the dancer

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,279
sent by Young Lord Xiao.

76
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,360
But what I affixed

77
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,399
was not a warding curse,

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
but a prayer script.

79
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,079
I had no intention of harming the you.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,879
Beneath this alluring facade of yours,

81
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,319
what thoughts are you hiding?

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,360
You are utterly different from before.

83
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,959
Your Lordship.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,519
I am still Xi Yan.

85
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,639
I simply do not wish

86
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,639
to be trapped in the backyard for life.

87
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
What I did

88
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,879
was to prove my loyalty to you.

89
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,839
I beg for your mercy.

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,240
Fickle and faithless.

91
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,839
Two-faced and treacherous.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,720
What makes you think I

93
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,600
would accept a traitor?

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,800
I helped you escape Xiao Huaijin's plot,

95
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,920
severing my own retreat.

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,480
From now on, other than serving you,

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,319
I have no path left.

98
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,959
No.

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,600
One path remains for you,
the path to death.

100
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,759
I helped you

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,480
turn danger into safety

102
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,240
before everyone's eyes

103
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,639
and rendered great merit.

104
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,079
If I were to die tomorrow,

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
would that not make the world say

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
that you repay kindness with hatred?

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,720
Merit?

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,519
You nearly ruined my plan.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,920
Xiao Huaijin wanted to frame me.

110
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
So I simply let him

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,839
be caught red-handed,
waiting like a hunter for his prey.

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
When we stand before His Majesty,
I will present all the evidence.

113
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,519
Who is guilty,

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
is still far from decided.

115
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,519
But even with evidence,

116
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,000
the moment rumors spread

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
that you cursed His Majesty,

118
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,600
how could you still command fear
across the land?

119
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,920
This strategy

120
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,720
is one of striking the heart,

121
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,639
His Majesty's heart.

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
And

123
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,639
the hearts of the court.

124
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,959
You poisoned Shen Changning,

125
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,839
and you are Xiao Huaijin's spy.

126
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,600
Did you think that by groveling

127
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,160
and debasing yourself,

128
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,800
you could escape death?

129
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,199
I'm only a pawn.

130
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,040
Every move controlled by others.

131
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
But Shen Changning's death

132
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,279
was not my doing.

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,879
This flower is called "Shadow Orchid".

134
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,020
It grows only in the Western Regions.

135
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,200
The poison Miss Shen took

136
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,840
came from this very flower.

137
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,600
And this was found

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,039
in your own bundle.

139
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,759
Anything else you wish to deny?

140
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,679
This flower was indeed brought
by me from the Western Regions.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,240
But it must have been
the Young Lord Xiao who stole it.

142
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,600
Already searching for a scapegoat?

143
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,960
Your Lordship.

144
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,240
This flower is beautiful and alluring.

145
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,919
Even after killing,

146
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,080
it refuses to fade.

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Those poisoned by it

148
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,519
will bear its mark

149
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,240
for days,

150
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,639
and the deeper the poison,

151
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,879
the brighter the bloom.

152
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,159
Anyone who touches it,

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,759
even if unpoisoned,

154
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,759
will still carry its trace.

155
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,799
Young Lord Xiao

156
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,639
had no idea of this.

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,559
I follow you with all my heart.

158
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,000
I beg you

159
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,120
to spare me a path to live.

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,080
I will trust you once for now.

161
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
But you, a lowly maid,

162
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,360
dared trespass into the study.

163
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,799
This must be handled according
to the house rules.

164
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,490
According to the household rules,

165
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,960
trespassing into restricted areas

166
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,990
must be punished with half
a month of confinement.

167
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,159
(Xi Yan.)

168
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
(Have you not realized?)

169
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,480
(Xiao Huaijin sent you to spy
and harm Pei Yu,)

170
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,559
(it's nothing but a complete deception.)

171
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,759
My Lord, forgive me.

172
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,950
What I did today was out
of helplessness,

173
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
but all for your grand plan.

174
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,320
If you dare betray me, then you have

175
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,240
only death awaiting you.

176
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,440
My Lord.

177
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,679
Please listen to me.

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,660
Since entering the Governor's Residence

179
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
he has never spared me a glance.

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
If I do not use drastic means,

181
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,080
I fear that even if I grow old
and die here,

182
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
I will never be able to help you.

183
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,519
So your "drastic means"

184
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,159
ruined my grand plan instead?

185
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,360
Though risky today,

186
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,879
the Governor did not kill me.

187
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,679
He only punished me with confinement.

188
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,840
Does that not prove

189
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,440
I have gained his trust?

190
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,519
Pei Yu is sinister and cunning,

191
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,679
adept at manipulating hearts.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,679
Yan.

193
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,759
I was truly afraid

194
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,399
you had turned against me, so I…

195
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,039
How could I ever blame you?

196
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,120
Pei Yu, driven by selfish desire,

197
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
first buried you alive,

198
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,879
then sold you to a brothel.

199
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
Yan.

200
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,960
You must never

201
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,399
forget who he truly is.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,840
Do not be deceived by him.

203
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,879
And do not forget

204
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,759
there is still someone waiting
to welcome you

205
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,990
into the Prince Duan's Residence
once his plans succeed.

206
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,519
You say you will marry me.

207
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
Is it sincere?

208
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,960
I am sincere.

209
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,000
Heaven and earth can bear witness.

210

(End of Episode)

211
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,759
Xi Yan possesses beauty and talent,

212
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,159
and has captured my favor.

213
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,399
I hereby decree

214
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:24,080
she shall be made a honored concubine
of the residence.

215
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,759
Let this fire

216
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,480
burn all wickedness to ash,

217
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,600
and let the mastermind behind it all

218
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,360
collect the corpses themselves.
