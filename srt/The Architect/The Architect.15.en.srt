1
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,359
Who's there?

2
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,637
=The Architect=

3
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:16,919
=Episode 10=
(What do I have to do)

4
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,675
(for you to choose me?)

5
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on.

6
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,240
Let me give you a kiss.

7
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,380
The wedding banquet is over.

8
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,879
Why are you still here?

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,319
You have your reasons.

10
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,759
I have my plans.

11
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,879
Different paths but same destination,
hence we're bound to meet.

12
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,639
Go.

13
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,759
Light the incense for me.

14
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,639
Yes, My Lord.

15
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,560
I missed you so much.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,599
Beauty.

17
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
My Lord.

18
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,599
Wait for me.

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm coming.

20
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,719
My Lord.

21
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,520
Come on.

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
Xiao Huaijin lives in luxury
and indulgence every day.

23
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,800
However, Prince Duan

24
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
seems almost too clean and simple.

25
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,919
There must be more to it.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,159
This setup

27
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,479
doesn't match his status at all.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,599
He must've arranged it on purpose

29
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,800
as a disguise

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,199
to hide something

31
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,439
more important.

32
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,212
(Ledger)

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Found it.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,919
This is the proof that Prince Duan
smuggled contraband and iron ore.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Finally, I found it.

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,319
You can't leave now.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
If you do,

38
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
you're walking right into his trap.

39
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,120
It's better to wait until they're done.

40
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,000
I want it too, My Lord.

41
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,780
It's the aphrodisiac incense.

42
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,990
We were too focused on finding evidence

43
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,240
and had inhaled it by accident.

44
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,519
Come out.

45
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,240
My Lord,

46
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,920
I was serving Xiao

47
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
with all my heart,

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,639
yet

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
this man abducted me.

50
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,120
Abducted you?

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,420
More like you two have been
seeing each other

52
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,480
behind my son's back.

53
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
Please calm down, My Lord.

54
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm innocent, My Lord.

55
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,390
If we were truly having an affair,

56
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
why would we choose this place?

57
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Governor Pei,

58
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,700
it's late at night,
yet you broke into my private chamber.

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,160
And the two of you dressed like this.

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't you think

61
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,319
you owe me an explanation?

62
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,639
Explanation?

63
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,360
I came to the banquet today

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
because I wanted to take back
my concubine.

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,720
Your son actually dared
to steal my woman.

66
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,600
I didn't strike him down at the banquet

67
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,350
because I still have respect
for the Prince Duan's Residence.

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,879
You!

69
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
Do you want to refuse that courtesy?

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
You have a death wish.

71
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,639
Why?

72
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,319
Want to fight?

73
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,120
And you.

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,800
You betray me.

75
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Do you know the consequence?

76
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,120
Pei Yu,

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
this is Prince Duan's Residence.

78
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,160
No matter how arrogant you are,

79
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,519
what can you possibly do?

80
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,079
Right.

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
Pei Yu,

82
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,519
a word to the wise.

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
Surrender now.

84
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,600
Come to the palace with me

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
and seek His Majesty's audience.

86
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,279
Otherwise,

87
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,480
don't blame me

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,639
for being cruel.

89
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,639
Prince Duan,

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,199
do you intend

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,839
to fight me to the death?

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,120
And what of it?

93
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,600
In today's matter,

94
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,959
no matter how favored you are,

95
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,920
I'm in the right.

96
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,319
If we bring this to His Majesty,

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
are you not afraid for your own life?

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,519
What are you getting at?

99
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:40,879
Let him go.

100
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,800
Yes, My Lord.

101
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll bring the horse here.

102
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,079
I tore out the most important pages

103
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,959
to get the evidence out safely.

104
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,360
They're hidden on you.

105
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,319
Please return them to me.

106
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,040
Why do you always push me away?

107
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,959
I appreciate

108
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,399
your concern,

109
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,519
but I can't accept it.

110
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,279
Please let me go.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What do I have to do

112
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,559
for you to choose me?

113
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,460
If you won't choose me,

114
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,679
I'll choose you.

115
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,240
This is your repayment for me.

116
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,799
(Sorry, Pei Yu.)

117
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,919
(If I weren't carrying)

118
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,840
(this revenge,)

119
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,200
(I would choose you.)

120
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,679
(But right now,

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
(I must walk this path alone.)

122
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,720
(The chance for revenge
won't come twice.)

123
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,200
(I've paid so much)

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,159
(to come this far.)

125
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,120
(I can only move forward.)

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
(There's no turning back.)

127
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,559
(Pei Yu,)

128
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,759
(I can't afford to fail this time.)

129
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,600
Xiao,

130
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:48,919
you're awake.

131
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,960
Why can't I remember anything

132
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,840
about last night?

133
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
You must've drunk too much.

134
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,399
You lost your memory.

135
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,919
Really?

136
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,399
Well, it doesn't matter.

137
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,200
We can

138
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,200
try something new

139
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,159
today.

140
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,679
Xiao, the auspicious hour has arrived.

141
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,200
We have to serve tea to Master.

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,890
If we miss the hour,

143
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,690
I won't get the chance
to pay respect to him.

144
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,240
I'm finally in the mood.

145
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
Don't spoil it.

146
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,799
My Lord!

147
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,879
This is bad!

148
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,690
Someone from the palace came
to arrest us.

149
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,600
Pei Yu,

150
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,159
how dare you

151
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,679
storm into a prince's manor
with armed soldiers?

152
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,600
Do you realize this is treason?

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Guards,

154
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
beat these traitors

155
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
out of my house!

156
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,600
Who dares?

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,559
Qilin Guards

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
act under His Majesty's command.

159
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,360
Anyone who obstructs us

160
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,320
will be killed without mercy.

161
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:32,960
I never imagined the Xiao family,

162
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,120
poor and cautious

163
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,360
for generations,

164
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,759
would be framed

165
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,679
by a despicable scoundrel.

166
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,159
You're still pretending.

167
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Prince Duan's Residence

168
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
has long been corrupt

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
and deceitful,

170
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,679
and selling iron ore to foreign regions,

171
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,279
causing wars and unrest

172
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,440
along the borders.

173
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,890
If one intends to accuse,
there's no way I can defend myself.

174
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,279
What proof do you have?

175
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,879
I can testify.

176
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,440
I can testify for Governor Pei.

177
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,130
Prince Duan's Residence

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,559
has committed crimes
that endanger the nation

179
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,070
by engaging in treasonous dealings
that warrant clan extermination.

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,679
You!

181
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:25,534
Wench!

182
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,519
Nonsense!

183
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,159
The evidence is already in the palace.

184
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,399
Blaming me won't change anything.

185
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,279
Evidence?

186
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
What evidence?

187
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
Whatever you said

188
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,159
was clearly forged by

189
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,440
you and Pei Yu,

190
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,320
a pair of adulterers.

191
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,600
Governor Pei,

192
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,799
you framed a prince.

193
