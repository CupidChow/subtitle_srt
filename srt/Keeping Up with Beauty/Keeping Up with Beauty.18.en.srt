=Episode 18=

14
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,560
What's wrong?

15
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,319
Nothing.

16
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,000
Chenyu, we've arrived.

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,400
What's wrong with your eyes?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,480
My vision's a little blurry.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,879
The doctor said I'll lose my sight soon.

20
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,760
Poisoning?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,640
Yes.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,159
According to the lab report,

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,200
you've been exposed to
a large amount of toxins over time.

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,599
The exposure period exceeds six months.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,519
The most recent instance
was within the past three days.

26
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,480
(Three days?)

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
(Bai Lanxing was already caught.)

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,599
(Then who's been poisoning me?)

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,319
Here, look.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,359
The darker area is where
the damage is occurring.

31
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,359
The toxin has started damaging
your optic nerves.

32
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,879
Your vision
will continue to deteriorate.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,719
It may not take long before...

34
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,840
You mean...

35
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,920
I'll go blind?

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
You need to prepare yourself mentally.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,439
How could this happen, Chenyu?

38
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,879
What did the doctor say?

39
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,760
Can it be cured?

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Shiqi.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,159
You must keep this secret for me.

42
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,439
Don't tell anyone.

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Why?

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,800
There's a lot going on at the company.

45
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,680
If anyone else finds out,

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,680
the board will force me to step down.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,599
Lead the way for me.

48
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,080
Treat me like a normal person.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,120
Got it, Chenyu.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,599
Then I'll hold your arm.

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,400
No need.

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,199
Walk ahead of me.

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Don't let it show.

54
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,319
Mr. Gu.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,759
- Mr. Gu.
- Hello.

56
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,879
Hello?

57
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,599
Third Uncle?

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Gu Chenyu.

59
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,199
Who gave you permission
to return the hotel to Fu Yunyun?

60
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,960
I'll personally cover all the losses

61
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,879
the company suffers.

62
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,479
That one Jiangxing Hotel

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,719
is enough to drain half your fortune.

64
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,960
You've completely
lost your mind over love.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,759
Do you remember how hard we worked

66
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,400
to get Jiangxing Hotel
in the first place?

67
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,000
And now you just give it away?

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Third Uncle.

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,680
It's what we owe the Fu family.

70
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,159
"I, Fu Zhengkang,

71
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,520
would rather die
than hand Jiangxing over to you."

72
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,159
Uncle Fu.

73
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,919
Uncle Fu...

74
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,120
Third Uncle.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,199
Third Uncle.

76
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,599
Maybe let it go.

77
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,719
The board has its eyes on that hotel.

78
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,240
Don't you want to be
the future head of the Gu family?

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,560
Gu Yansheng will return
from overseas soon.

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
And he'll have Bai Lanxing by his side.

81
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,000
If you can't secure Jiangxing

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,399
and hold your position,

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,279
you'll be at a disadvantage
in the Gu family later.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,000
If he's got the ability, let him try.

85
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,160
You're still too young.

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
Chenyu.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,319
You go first.

88
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,759
I'll talk to Fu Zhengkang myself.

89
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,160
Third Uncle.

90
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,740
(Third Uncle
Third Uncle, where did you go?)

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,720
Someone jumped!

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Isn't that Mr. Fu?

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,439
Dad!

94
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,959
Dad, look at me!

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
Someone help me!

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Please, someone help me!

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,199
No photos.

98
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,199
Everyone, please stop taking photos.

99
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
I asked you many times after that.

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,120
You said you only talked
with Uncle Fu for a moment and left.

101
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,600
But if we hadn't done anything wrong,

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
why did you have someone
hack the hotel's surveillance?

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
The video Yunyun received...

104
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,600
You sent it to her, didn't you?

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,279
What really happened back then?

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,360
What actually happened that year?

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,519
Whatever happened,

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,600
I did it all for your own good.

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
Third Uncle.

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,199
Ever since my parents passed away,

111
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
you've been the one guiding me,

112
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,519
supporting and raising me.

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
I've long regarded you as family.

114
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,879
So even though I had doubts,

115
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,759
I never dared to
look deeper over the past year.

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
But today,

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,399
I need a clear answer from you.

118
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
So Uncle Fu's death that year...

119
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,360
Was it really because of you?

120
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
I promised your mother back then

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,160
that I'd make you
the head of the Gu family.

122
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,000
So the things you couldn't do,

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
I did for you.

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,319
The ruthlessness you lacked,

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,160
I carried out instead.

126
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,839
And after that,

127
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,720
didn't you smoothly
acquire Jiangxing Hotel?

128
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,000
Chenyu,

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,680
you're still too young.

130
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,279
Too soft-hearted.

131
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,360
When you reach my age,

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,399
you'll understand.

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,879
I've already fulfilled
Fu Yunyun's last wish.

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,680
So why can't I return?

135
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,000
Miss.

136
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,120
Mr. Gu sent over
the hotel transfer contract.

137
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,199
(Jiangxing Hotel Transfer Contract)

138
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,079
That's wonderful.

139
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,560
Jiangxing is finally back in your hands.

140
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Wait, this...

141
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
You recognise it?

142
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,959
It's the Fu family heirloom.

143
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,160
A jade pendant

144
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
symbolizing each generation's family head.

145
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,959
Mr. Fu always wore it.

146
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,160
Later, didn't you take it
with you to the Gu residence?

147
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,920
The piece on the back of this token
looks very similar to that one.

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,959
I have a photo of it here.
Let me show you.

149
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,079
Alright.

150
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,399
Here it is.

151
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,720
(That's right.)

152
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,919
(There are two halves
of the jade pendant.)

153
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,360
(If I piece them together,
I can go back.)

154
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
Strange.

155
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,559
Where did Fu Yunyun
put the other half of the jade pendant?

156
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,399
What's all this stuff?

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
The room isn't that big.

158
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Where could it be?

159
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Who's there?

160
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,159
Shiqi?

161
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,840
What are you doing here?

162
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,200
Gu Chenyu, what's wrong with your eyes?

163
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,919
Why did you come back?

164
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,879
I came to look for something.

165
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,519
You still haven't answered me.

166
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,679
What's wrong with your eyes?

167
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,039
It's nothing.

168
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,000
I just saw things blurry for a moment.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
Do you think I'm a child?

170
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,679
We're standing this close now.

171
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,759
Fu Yunyun.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
We're already divorced.

173
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,559
Did you come back
just to check on your ex-husband?

174
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,320
You're right.

175
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,360
Whether you live or die
has nothing to do with me.

176
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,200
I shouldn't have cared.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,799
Yunyun.

178
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,720
Shiqi.

179
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,639
Shiqi.

180
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,559
What's wrong with Gu Chenyu's eyes?

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,919
You...

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You already know?

183
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,159
He can't see clearly, can he?

184
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,360
When did it start?

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,080
He was poisoned,
damaging his optic nerves.

186
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,360
It's been several days now.

187
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,879
The doctor said he might go blind.

188
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,799
Yunyun, I've been wanting to tell you.

189
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,080
But my brother wouldn't let me.

190
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,279
He even kept it from Yansheng.

191
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,360
His eyesight has been
worsening rapidly these days.

192
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,480
But he still pretends to be fine
and goes to work every day.

193
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,159
He doesn't say it out loud,

194
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,360
but I know he's really in pain.

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,799
Yunyun, he needs you.

196
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,879
Can't you come back to help him?

197
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,480
Shiqi.

198
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,879
I can't help him.

199
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,480
Yunyun...

201
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,600
Gu Chenyu, can you lend it to me?

202
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,360
It's yours.

203
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,960
Twenty million.

204
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,799
You're just giving it to me?

205
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,600
About what happened with Grandma,
I misunderstood you before.

206
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,960
Take this as an apology.

207
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
I can't take part in your past anymore.

208
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,799
But from now on,

209
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,159
everything you do,

210
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,360
every choice you want to make,

211
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,759
I'll stand by you.

212
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,399
No.

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Nangong Yu, get a grip.

214
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Gu Chenyu is the one
who caused Fu Yunyun's father's death.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
You shouldn't be involved
with him anymore.

216
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,480
He once took a knife for me.

217
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,799
He might have had his own reasons.

218
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,480
Maybe I should ask him myself.

219
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,159
It's for you.
