13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
=Episode 9=

14
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:24,959
Are you alright?

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,879
Did you get hurt?

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,439
I'm fine.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,200
Find your phone
and call the police first.

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,319
Didn't expect you to know
how to fight like that.

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
I had no idea.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,840
There are still many things
you don't know.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,359
Thank you.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
From now on,

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
I'll try to know you better.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,519
No battery.

25
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,799
Mine's dead too.

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,560
We probably can't make it
to the board meeting.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,719
Let's head out first.

28
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe we can still make it.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,319
Watch out!

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
Go to hell!

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,919
Gu Chenyu!

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,400
Gu Chenyu!

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,560
Hang in there.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
We'll get out first.

35
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,680
What time is it now?

36
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,759
Why isn't Gu Chenyu here yet?

37
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,879
How dare he be late
on such an important day.

38
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,479
Unbelievable.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
Does he already think
he'll be the new head of the Gu family?

40
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,919
Uncle.

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
No need to rush.

42
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's wait a bit longer.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,639
No need.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,439
Let's begin.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,199
The old madam woke up last night.

46
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,639
After the doctor's diagnosis,

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,039
her brain suffered irreversible damage.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,439
She's showing signs of dementia

49
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,719
and she'll need long-term care
in hospital.

50
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,599
The Gu family needs a new head.

51
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,919
The head of the Gu family
isn't only the family leader,

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,879
but also the president of Gu Group.

53
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,080
It should be decided
by shareholding ratio.

54
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,439
The old madam once signed a document.

55
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,120
If one day she met with an accident

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,319
and could no longer serve
as the family head,

57
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,520
then her 32 percent share in Gu Group

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,199
would be divided in two,

59
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,439
half to her grandson Gu Yansheng

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,159
and half to Gu Chenyu.

61
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,159
Including this portion,

62
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,719
Gu Chenyu

63
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,639
would hold 35 percent of Gu Group,

64
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,199
making him the largest shareholder.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,639
Gu Yansheng

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,159
would hold 26 percent,

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
becoming the second largest shareholder.

68
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,879
Therefore,

69
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,599
Gu Chenyu

70
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,319
shall be the next...

71
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,879
Wait a moment.

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,039
So,

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,240
the one holding the most shares now

74
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
will become

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,159
the next head of the Gu family?

76
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,639
According to tradition, yes.

77
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,280
After my husband passed away,

78
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,959
I held 10 percent of the group's shares.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
Now I

80
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,040
voluntarily transfer these shares

81
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,240
(Gu Group Share Transfer Agreement)
to my son, Gu Yansheng.

82
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,959
Yansheng now holds
over 36 percent of the company,

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,120
becoming the largest shareholder.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
Gu Yansheng

85
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,680
is more qualified
than Gu Chenyu to be the family head.

86
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Such an important matter,

87
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,240
since Gu Chenyu isn't here,

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,920
why don't we postpone it?

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,480
No need.

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,399
Everyone's time is precious.

91
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,759
It's not easy to call a meeting.

92
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,680
We can't just delay it.

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,639
Gu Chenyu isn't family head yet,

94
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,519
but he already ignores us.

95
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,519
Once he's in power,

96
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,839
he'll be even more arrogant.

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
We better just choose Yansheng.

98
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,000
Agreed.

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,000
Then...

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,399
Thank you for your support, elders.

101
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,120
Let's proceed with the vote.

102
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,680
Shareholders in favour of Gu Yansheng

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,000
becoming the new head of the Gu family,

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,790
please raise your hand.

105
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Gu.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,839
You're awake.

107
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,720
Give me your hand.

108
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,680
Pulse is normal.

109
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,519
No major harm.

110
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,959
Luckily this time
the internal organs weren't pierced,

111
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,759
but you lost too much blood.

112
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,560
Your vital energy is severely depleted
and need to rest.

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,879
However,

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,199
why is your heart racing so fast?

115
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,800
The blanket's too warm.

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,319
Shen,

117
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,600
at the board meeting,

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,839
has Gu Yansheng
already become family head?

119
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,399
Except for Third Uncle
and the two uncles,

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,639
everyone else voted in favour.

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
He bought off so many people,

122
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,519
seems premeditated.

123
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,439
My stepmother,

124
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,319
for the sake of her own son,

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,319
really went to great lengths.

126
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,720
It's a pity those bandits got away.

127
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,759
Now there's no evidence to prove

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,480
these matters are connected
to Bai Lanxing and Gu Yansheng.

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Shen,

130
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,959
thank you for today.

131
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,360
If you hadn't arrived in time,

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,480
things would have been dire.

133
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,680
It wasn't me.

134
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,439
Yunyun.

135
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,920
Flowers suit the beauty.

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,439
Thank you.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,480
Thank...

138
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,360
Thank you.

139
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,480
Stabbed and still so spirited.

140
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,439
Mr. Gu really is tough.

141
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,319
Thank you.

142
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,680
I need to rest.

143
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,759
See the guests out.

144
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,160
You treat

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,279
your lifesaver like this?

146
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,120
He… He saved me?

147
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,199
Gu Chenyu, hold on.

148
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,370
I'll take you to hospital right away.

149
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,639
Anyone here?

150
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,480
Is anyone here?

151
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,320
Yunyun.

152
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:50,919
Come.

153
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,720
Luckily Yunyun
shared her location with me.

154
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,320
I saw her position
moving into a remote area.

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,240
I guessed she was in trouble.

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually, it was quite dangerous.

157
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,320
Thanks for helping out.

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,159
No need to mention it.

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,039
As long as it's to see you,

160
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,440
I'd go through fire and water.

161
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,720
Thirsty.

162
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,080
Gu Chenyu,

163
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,000
you should thank him too.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
He saved your life.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,720
Thank you.

166
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,559
You're welcome.

167
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,240
I was looking for Yunyun.

168
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,240
You just happened to be along the way.

169
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,480
Don't be too moved.

170
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,159
We're family after all.

171
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,639
Helping her is helping me.

172
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,240
Then I won't disturb Mr. Gu's rest.

173
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,039
After all that trouble,

174
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,960
you look worn out.

175
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,039
You should take care
of yourself as you age.

176
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,759
Otherwise,

177
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,519
you'll age faster.

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
I'll walk you out.

179
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Alright.

180
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
Otherwise, you'll age faster.

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,440
Do I...

182
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Do I look worn out?
