=Keeping Up with Beauty=
(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
=Episode 14=

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,359
Gu Chenyu has already
found your daughter.

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,520
She's safe now.

16
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,079
Dad,

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,879
the nurse said the surgery
can start very soon.

18
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,519
I miss you so much.

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,200
When will you come to be with me?

20
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,959
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,799
I shouldn't have trusted Ms. Bai.

22
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,599
My daughter is turning six this year.

23
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:29,000
If the surgery isn't done soon,
it will be too late.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,280
I can't just stand by and watch her die.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,799
I had no choice.

26
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,280
I could only help Ms. Bai
forge the diagnosis.

27
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,719
In fact, that patient wasn't
suffering from food poisoning at all.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,120
He actually died
of late-stage stomach cancer.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,159
I even took money
from the patient's family.

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,959
We all acted out
this whole charade together.

31
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,159
Stop wasting words on him.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,519
He nearly ruined Jiangxing Hotel.

33
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,760
Just call the police.

34
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,719
I beg you.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,159
Let me see my daughter one more time.

36
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,719
She's about to go into surgery.

37
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm worried about her.

38
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,960
She's still so young.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,000
She can't be without her father.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll take you to the police station.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Consider it a voluntary surrender.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
Confess and get leniency.

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,599
Try to get a lighter sentence.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,159
Thank you.

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,719
Thank you.

46
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,159
I was wrong, I was really wrong.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
Madam,

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,960
the child was taken by Gu Chenyu.

49
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,879
The person handling Wang Hao
is also unreachable.

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,080
Things might be exposed.

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Mom,

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,280
I need to ask you something.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
After I finish this drink.

54
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,800
I remember when I first arrived
at the Gu family,

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,960
the first time I saw
this kind of liquor,

56
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,680
I couldn't help touching it.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,719
But Steward Zhao

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,159
slapped me twice hard.

59
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,960
He said it's high-end liquor.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,960
A lowly maid like me
has no right to touch it.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,080
If I damaged it,

62
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,560
I couldn't even repay the loss
with my life.

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,479
At that moment, I swore

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,520
that one day

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,919
everything in the Gu family
would belong to me.

66
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,199
I would touch whatever I wanted.

67
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,560
Mom,

68
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,400
you're drunk.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,599
Even you look down on me?

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Back then, if I hadn't fought to climb into
that short-lived man's bed,

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,879
how would you exist?

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
Everything you have now,

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,319
was fought for

75
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,199
by your mother through sheer effort.

76
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,720
I would rather have nothing.

77
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,439
The Jiangxing Hotel
food poisoning incident

78
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,560
was all your doing, wasn't it?

79
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,399
Don't you want Fu Yunyun?

80
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,600
Once you bring down Gu Chenyu,

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,920
you'll have everything.

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
But you shouldn't have
touched Jiangxing Hotel.

83
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,560
It's what Yunyun cares about most.

84
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,120
Again Yunyun.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,399
Again this Yunyun.

86
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,600
How did I end up
with such a useless son?

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,380
You don't think about how
to become head of the Gu family.

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,000
Your mind is full of this woman.

89
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm telling you now,

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,319
Yunyun probably already
knows everything.

91
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,519
She has found witnesses.

92
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,800
She's about to send me to prison.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,399
Do you understand?

94
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,879
I underestimated her.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,399
I didn't expect

96
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,360
she would team up with Gu Chenyu.

97
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,800
Son,

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
she has already betrayed you.

99
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,079
She chose Gu Chenyu.

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,959
Why are you still so stubborn?

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,920
Now it's your turn to make a choice.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Will you stand by her,

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,079
or help your mother?

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Mom...

105
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,319
Bai Lanxing,

106
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,319
the police are almost here.

107
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,199
You can't run anymore.

108
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,199
Gu Chenyu.

109
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,480
Mom!

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,800
Why do you always ruin my plans?

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
If it weren't for you,

112
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,959
Yansheng would already
be head of the Gu family.

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
You destroyed everything
that belonged to us.

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,160
You…

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
Gu Chenyu!

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,879
Mom!

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,199
Son!

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Son!

119
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,439
Son!

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,360
Mom.

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,519
Don't

122
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,360
keep making

123
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,120
the same mistakes.

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
You're no longer on my side.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,600
What's the point of my effort now?

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Son.

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Mom.

128
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
Mom.

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Yansheng.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,720
Chenyu.

131
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,120
Please spare Mom.

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,319
No matter what she's done wrong,

133
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,279
I will bear it for her.

134
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,199
Shut up!

135
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,319
Bear what?

136
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,600
All of this is my doing.

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,959
I hate you.

138
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,920
I hate the Gu family.

139
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,399
I hate all of you.

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
I hate you to death!

141
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,199
You all deserve to die.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
Take Bai Lanxing away.

143
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,439
Mom.

144
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:07,879
Go!

145
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,639
Son!

146
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,120
Mom!

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,319
Son!

148
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,120
Mom!

149
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,959
Son!

150
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,560
Chenyu.

151
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,079
(VIP room) Are you crazy?

152
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:24,600
Do you know

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,279
if this knife

154
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,279
even slightly misses,

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,319
your life would be over.

156
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,360
How is my mother doing?

157
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,399
- Wang Hao already confessed.
- She…

158
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,560
The police also found
the evidence of Bai Lanxing

159
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,079
colluding with Steward Zhao
on her phone.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Steward Zhao poisoned Grandma

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,959
under her orders.

162
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,839
She committed a crime.

163
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,519
She must face the law.

164
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,920
Did Mom really do all these things?

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,279
I don't believe it.

166
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,319
How could she be this kind of person?

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,319
Everything she did was for me.

168
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,079
She wanted me to become
head of the family so badly.

169
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,199
I was too useless.

170
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,079
Stop blaming yourself.

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,279
She is herself,

172
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,720
and you are you.

173
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,120
No matter what,

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,759
I want to thank you today.

175
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Yansheng.

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,879
Ready, march.

177
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,600
One-one-two-one.

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
One-two-one.

179
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
How about giving this to Chenyu?

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,559
He'll definitely like it.

181
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,720
Grandma,

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,919
Chenyu has grown up now.

183
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,360
What are you talking about?

184
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,919
Don't be fooled by how mature he seems.

185
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,320
Actually,

186
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
he has his hardships.

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
His mother died early,

188
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,519
and his father remarried.

189
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,399
This stepmother

190
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,960
gave him younger siblings.

191
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,559
In this family,

192
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,759
I'm the only one supporting him.

193
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,120
Look at the time.

194
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,279
Shouldn't Chenyu be off school by now?

195
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,559
Go pick him up quickly.

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Grandma, I'm Chenyu.

197
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't you recognize me?

198
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
Aren't you the new housekeeper here?

199
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, right.

200
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,080
On your way,

201
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,600
give my son a call.

202
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,279
Tell him not to work overtime today,

203
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,519
and come back early.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,879
And bring Lanxing,

205
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,720
Yansheng,

206
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,039
and Shiqi back with you.

207
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,720
How long has it been
since this family had a meal together?

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
Today is my grandson's birthday.

209
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,120
Everyone,

210
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,559
make sure we celebrate
properly together.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
Chenyu,

212
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,159
my little grandson.

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Alright.

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,159
I'll listen to you, Grandma.

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,799
My little baby,

216
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,519
my little Chenyu.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Today,

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,200
I'll give you a special
"little man" toy.

219
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,879
Madam, we should go
for the check-up now.

220
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,320
Check-up?

221
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Yes, let's go.

222
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,519
Off to the check-up.

223
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,759
Let's go.

224
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,720
One-two-one.

225
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,799
One-two-one.

226
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,600
Maybe one day, grandma will get better.

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,480
She will remember you.

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,159
Let's go home first.

229
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,039
Do I still have a home?

230
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,679
You still have me.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll be with you all this time.

232
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
I believe Yansheng and Shiqi

233
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
will understand you one day.

234
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Then will you always stay with me?

235
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,840
