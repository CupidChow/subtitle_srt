=Episode 12=

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,840
But,

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,679
Miss,

16
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,759
Gu Chenyu is already
the head of the Gu family.

17
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,280
So many eyes are on him outside.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,760
What exactly is your relationship
with him now?

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,959
You're still staying by his side,

20
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,120
are you trying to...

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,000
Nonsense.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,519
I...

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,640
What kind of relationship
could I have with him?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,359
How could I possibly
have feelings for him?

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,159
Ridiculous.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
I just want to ask,

27
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,519
are you planning to cooperate
with him to run Jiangxing?

28
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,519
Did I not make myself clear?

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,439
Does anyone have any objections
to Director Zhou's proposal?

30
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,680
- No.
- No.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,040
Then no objections.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's implement Director Zhou's plan.

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,640
Today's meeting

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,280
ends here.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,680
Mr. Gu.

36
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,760
Something happened.

37
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,719
Son!

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
Son!

39
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,000
Doctor!

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,280
How is he?

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,840
Doctor!

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,879
Doctor!

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,959
Tell us!

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,159
It was severe liver and kidney failure

45
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,439
caused by acute food poisoning.

46
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,799
We did our best.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Doctor!

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,799
Doctor!

49
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,040
Son!

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,519
Dear reporters,

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,120
Jiangxing Hotel

52
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,240
has serious food safety issues.

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,520
The child only ate one meal

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,919
and was gone.

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,680
He was only sixteen!

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,039
Jiangxing Hotel is extremely heartless!

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,479
Give me back my son!

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,759
Give me back my son!

59
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,719
(Pause operations)

60
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,360
How will you address Jiangxing's
food safety problems?

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,199
Food safety issues

62
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,759
are a top priority in our country.

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,800
How could such a problem occur
in your hotel?

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Why hasn't Mr. Gu Chenyu of the group

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,599
shown up?

66
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,199
Yes.

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,000
Why not show up?

68
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,400
First of all,

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,960
I want to apologize to everyone.

70
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,479
We are still investigating.

71
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,159
Renowned Jiangxing Hotel has
an outbreak of food poisoning.

72
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,080
A minor lost his life as a result.

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,439
The hotel has been temporarily closed.

74
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,879
Gu Group's stock
has dropped significantly.

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,140
The new president, Mr. Gu Chenyu

76
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,800
is being questioned on his
management abilities.

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,319
Facing scrutiny and accountability,

78
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
as for the follow-up...

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,599
Slander.

80
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,439
This is simply slander.

81
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,759
Jiangxing Restaurant
has been open for decades.

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,879
Chef Li was personally recruited back
by Mr. Fu at the time.

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,439
There has never been
a food safety issue!

84
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,360
Clearly someone is framing Jiangxing.

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
I understand, Uncle Wang.

86
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,719
Don't worry.

87
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,120
I will find a way
to prove Jiangxing's innocence.

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,150
I've already sent my assistant
to the hospital to investigate.

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,919
The deceased was cremated
immediately after death.

90
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,400
Previous medical records were deleted.

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,879
Most suspiciously,

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,759
the doctor who issued
the food poisoning diagnosis

93
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,080
is named Wang Hao.

94
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,960
He suddenly resigned yesterday.

95
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,120
It must be him.

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
He was instructed
to falsify the diagnosis.

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
If the diagnosis was indeed forged,

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,960
then that person
has surely already fled.

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,680
Where can we find him?

100
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,039
I know where he is.

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,800
Yunyun.

102
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't trust him.

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,759
This whole thing might have been
set up by him.

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,400
Gu Yansheng, you go out.

105
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,439
You're not welcome here.

106
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,319
I know you hate me right now.

107
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm stubborn.

108
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,199
I'm ruthless.

109
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,680
But I never intended to hurt you.

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
And I would never touch Jiangxing.

111
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,400
I swear

112
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
I really didn't know
about this in advance.

113
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,639
If I had even an inkling beforehand,

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,439
I would have done everything
I could to stop it.

115
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,040
Because I know how important
this hotel is to you.

116
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,480
Yunyun.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,040
We've known each other
since we were ten.

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,759
not even have the slightest
trust left in me?

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,360
(No matter what,)

121
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,240
(he still loves Fu Yunyun deeply.)

122
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,680
Okay.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Yunyun.

124
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,120
Then tell me,

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
where is that doctor?

126
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,959
According to my investigation,

127
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,639
before Wang Hao resigned,

128
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,480
he bought a large supply
of motion sickness medicine.

129
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,600
He has a cousin who works at the dock

130
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,759
who was once imprisoned
for illegal smuggling.

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,000
I suspect he's at the dock now

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,279
and preparing to escape by boat.

133
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,199
Then we'll head to the dock now.

134
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,959
Uncle Wang.

135
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,279
Wait here for our news.

136
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,959
Be careful.

137
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,360
Okay.

138
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,160
Let's go.

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,759
Move!

140
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
I'll handle this.

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll handle it.

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,279
Move, this is my car!

143
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,990
Stop messing around!

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,319
I'll take her to the dock.

145
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,720
Why do you insist on coming along?

146
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
Do you know who I am to her?

147
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,360
Obeying her is my duty.

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,160
Protecting her is my mission.

149
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,319
Right.

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Muyan is right.

151
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,959
I'll go with him.

152
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,480
Yansheng.

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,120
You go back first.

154
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,800
No!

155
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,319
The dock is full of all kinds of people,

156
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,639
you never know who's a bad guy.

157
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,279
How can that pretty boy protect you?

158
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,519
Who are you calling a pretty boy?

159
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
When I was in the army,

160
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,199
your ancestors weren't even born yet.

161
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:57,839
Army?

162
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,120
You?

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,759
Alright.

164
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,279
Everyone get in the car.

165
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Follow my orders.
Those who disobey will be punished.

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,240
Yes.

167
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,480
On the surface,

168
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,199
this incident targets Jiangxing Hotel.

169
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
But actually,

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,079
it's aimed at you.

171
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,079
You just became head of the Gu family,

172
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,759
your foundation is unstable,

173
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,319
This is the easiest time
to be questioned and opposed.

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,480
Since Jiangxing was acquired,

175
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,879
you've been in charge of managing it.

176
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,720
As long as something
goes wrong at Jiangxing,

177
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,240
they will throw the blame on you.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,759
Once your reputation is ruined,

179
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,240
you won't be able to stay
as head of the family.

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,160
Tell me.

181
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
How are you going to solve this?

182
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,040
Find the person behind this

183
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,879
and prove Jiangxing's innocence.

184
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,279
Wrong.

185
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,680
That's the logic of ordinary people.

186
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,720
As the head of the Gu family,

187
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,959
you have to stand higher

188
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
and see further.

189
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,759
Who orchestrated this incident?

190
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,839
Can't you figure it out?

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
Bai Lanxing and Gu Yansheng.

192
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,199
One is your stepmother,

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,439
one is your sibling.

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,279
Even if it's a struggle
for the head position,

195
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
it shouldn't spill into the public.

196
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,519
This time it's already in the news.

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
If you demand the truth,

198
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,600
and expose all the filthy,
dirty secrets within the Gu family,

199
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,439
and make everyone knows,

200
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,199
it would only harm the company
without any benefit.

201
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,480
Then should we just watch
Jiangxing be slandered

202
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,800
and be forced to close?

203
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,480
Think carefully.

204
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,160
Actually,

205
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,079
there's a perfect solution
that satisfies both sides.

206
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,879
That person is Wang Hao.

207
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,920
I've arrived.

208
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,480
There!

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,959
He's getting on the boat!

210
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,799
Still dare to call me a pretty boy?

211
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,279
Don't come over!

212
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,879
Let her go!

213
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:04,799
Don't come over!

214
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,480
Let me go!

215
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,159
If you dare touch her,

216
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,200
you're finished!

217
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
Don't come over!

218
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,840
Let me go!

219
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,279
Let go of me!

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,200
Tell me.

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,399
Did you forge the diagnosis?

222
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,879
What really happened
to the patient at Jiangxing Hotel

223
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,960
who had food poisoning?

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,679
I'm sorry.

225
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,320
Truly sorry.

226
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,279
I only did this
because I had no way out.

227
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,919
They threatened me
with my sick hospitalized daughter.

228
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
If I didn't do as they said,
they would...

229
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,480
They would...

230
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,159
I have a video on my phone!

231
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,279
A video.

232
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,159
Wang Hao.

233
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,159
Do what I told you to do properly.

234
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,120
Look.

235
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,039
What a cute girl.

236
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,399
If something happened to her,

237
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,919
what would you do?

238
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,360
If everything goes well,

239
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,639
she'll be able
to have surgery successfully.

240
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,399
If it doesn't go well...

241
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,840
Who is the person

242
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,519
threatening you with your daughter?

243
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
I can't say.

244
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,399
Can't say.

245
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
I'll tell.

246
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,879
I've seen

247
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,039
that person in the news.

248
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,080
Called...

249
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,159
Called...

250
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,600
Gu Chenyu.

251
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
