(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
=Episode 6=

14
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,799
General.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,040
You are the original Fu Yunyun.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,040
But I am already dead.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
What you see now

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,840
is the consciousness I left
within your body.

19
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you the one
who summoned me to this world?

20
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,719
Bound by life and death,

21
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,239
a promise sealed by fate.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Could it be

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,120
that you are a descendant
of my Nangong family's benefactor?

24
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,120
That's right.

25
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,359
General.

26
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,760
Fu family has reached the brink of ruin.

27
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,120
I want you to fulfill Nangong's promise.

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,639
Please help me.

29
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,639
What do you need me to do?

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,800
A year ago,

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
my father passed away.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
The Gu family acquired all our assets.

33
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,919
I suspect Gu Chenyu murdered my father.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
That's why I married him.

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,680
But I found nothing.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,719
I want you to stay in the Gu family

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,719
and help me complete two things.

38
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,199
First,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,199
find out the truth
behind my father's death.

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,199
Second,

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,759
take back our Fu family's business,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,439
The Jiangxing Hotel.

43
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,840
If I succeed in both tasks,

44
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,599
and fulfill the General's Command promise,

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,479
can I return to being Nangong Yu?

46
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,919
You must help me.

47
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,080
It's my final wish.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
General.

49
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,120
Please.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,240
All right.

51
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,599
I promise you.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,479
Wait.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
(It seems the top priority)

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,319
(is to fulfill Fu Yunyun's final wish.)

55
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,519
Morning.

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,199
Gu Yansheng, are you insane?

57
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,279
You can openly cheat with Zhao Muyan,

58
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,319
why can't you have
an affair with me here?

59
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you want another beating?

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
Want to go out?

61
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,560
If you want to go out,

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,839
give me a kiss.

63
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,480
Gu Yansheng,

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
what on earth goes on
in your head all day?

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,639
You can hold Zhao Muyan's hand,

66
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,199
hug my brother,

67
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,680
but why be so heartless to me?

68
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,759
Kiss me.

69
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,079
Come on.

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,720
Fu Yunyun,

71
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,959
do you even have a heart left?

72
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,879
You used to clearly...

73
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,240
I'm your sister-in-law now.

74
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,879
Why?

75
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
Why is that?

76
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,639
Have you really fallen for my brother?

77
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,399
Impossible.

78
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,439
You could never love him.

79
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,300
(Divorce Agreement)

80
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,319
Sister-in-law,

81
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,240
why were you so anxious just now?

82
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,040
You crushed me.

83
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,959
Shut up.

84
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't talk nonsense.

85
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,519
Brother saw everything.

86
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,800
Why bother denying it?

87
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,199
Fine.

88
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,879
Chenyu.

89
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,199
I was the one who seduced her.

90
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,639
Don't blame her.

91
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,279
After all, she and I once...

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,199
No need to explain.

93
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,439
This is the divorce agreement.

94
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,600
I've signed it.

95
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,399
Fu Yunyun,

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,279
you're free now.

97
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,040
Whether you choose Gu Yansheng

98
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,560
or Zhao Muyan after this,

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
it's up to you.

100
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,120
If the benefactor's family
is ever in trouble,

101
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,959
the descendants of the Nangong clan
will repay their debt of gratitude,

102
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,240
regardless of life or death.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,279
So this General's Command

104
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,240
is not only the command symbol
of the Southern Wind Camp,

105
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,680
but also a promise powerful enough
to defy life and death,

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,959
a vow that transcends time itself.

107
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:40,800
General.

108
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
You must help me.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
This is my final wish.

110
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Gu Chenyu,

111
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,319
I choose you.

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
