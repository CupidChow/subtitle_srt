14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,840
Chenyu.

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,480
Chenyu!

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,079
Look.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
Zhao Muyan met with Yunyun in private!

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
The enemy is already at our doorstep,

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,799
if you don't take action soon,

20
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,400
Yunyun will be taken away
by someone else.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,599
She said she chose me.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,879
That was then, this is now, Chenyu.

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,359
Zhao Muyan is a big celebrity.

24
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:25,079
He's handsome and knows how to talk.

25
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,120
He can win a girl's heart
in a few words.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,359
I'm even his fan.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,480
You want to date him?

28
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,120
No.

29
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,159
Chenyu,

30
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,599
you still have your advantages.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,920
Such as?

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
For example, you're richer than him.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,640
Wealthier than him.

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,719
And more...

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,959
More prosperous than him.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,799
Prosperous.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,480
Are those three any different?

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,879
Anyway,

39
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,920
what I mean is,

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,400
you can't just sit and wait.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,120
You need to show Yunyun
your true feelings.

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,319
True feelings.

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,959
Yes, Mr. Gu.

44
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,879
Flowing water doesn't rush to be first.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,159
It strives to flow endlessly.

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,400
Gu Chenyu.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,759
Why are you standing here?

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,080
I...

49
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,680
I...

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,360
I...

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,759
I'm waiting for you.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,159
Waiting for me?

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Is something wrong?

54
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,800
I'd like to invite you somewhere
tomorrow night.

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,590
(Gu Chenyu)
(I'll wait for you at the art gallery.)

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,599
Be careful, Mr. Gu.

57
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,159
(Fu Yunyun
Personal Oil Painting Exhibition)

58
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
Slow down, watch your step.

59
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,839
If Ms. Fu knew

60
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,600
that you'd collected her old paintings

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
and organized this exhibition for her,

62
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,079
she would be very moved.

63
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,560
Do I look handsome?

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Super handsome.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,720
You came, Yunyun.

66
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,360
I know you've loved painting
since you were a child.

67
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,399
I thought
you might like this exhibition.

68
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go inside.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,279
Gu Chenyu,

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
I didn't come today to see
the exhibition with you.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
I received something.

72
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,600
There are some questions
I want to ask you.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,800
Get out!

74
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,120
Uncle Fu,

75
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,600
the financial situation
of Jiangxing Hotel is already serious.

76
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Please trust me.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,519
Give it to me,

78
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,160
I'll get you the best price

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,360
and help settle your debts.

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,199
Bah!

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
Who needs your fake concern?

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
This was all a trap you planned!

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,319
From start to finish, you just
wanted to seize Jiangxing Hotel!

84
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,199
You misunderstand me.

85
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,480
I'm doing this for your sake.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Our two families
have been close for so many years.

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,519
And I thought
you were always steady and reliable.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,959
I never thought you'd be

89
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,879
such a disappointment.

90
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,800
Uncle Fu, please listen to me...

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,920
Don't push me!

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,000
Even if I die,
I'll never hand Jiangxing over to you!

93
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,040
Uncle Fu!

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
Get out!

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,360
Uncle...

96
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,279
This is the security footage
from the corridor before my father died.

97
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
He met you before his death

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
and had an argument with you.

99
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,560
Why didn't you ever tell me about it?

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
I...

101
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,959
I never told you because...

102
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,199
because I was afraid you'd suspect me.

103
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,959
Afraid you'd think
I had something to do with his death.

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
But Uncle Fu's death wasn't my fault.

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,079
I swear it wasn't.

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,720
I checked the hotel's
surveillance footage from that day.

107
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,560
I found that the footage
had been hacked.

108
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
I couldn't find anything.

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,480
Hacked?

110
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,959
Gu Chenyu.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
My father
couldn't have committed suicide.

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
That morning he said
he'd come home for dinner.

113
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,959
He promised to cook for me.

114
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,480
Tell me, how could
he have killed himself?

115
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,319
You say you didn't kill him.

116
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,399
Then tell me,

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,319
who did?

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
That day...

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
That day, I did have
an argument with Uncle Fu.

120
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,360
I wanted to acquire Jiangxing.

121
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,120
But he...

122
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,279
he refused me.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,879
He even kicked me out.

124
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,160
After that, I never went back.

125
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,160
And then...

126
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,079
Third Uncle.

127
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,199
I...

128
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,120
I...

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,490
Everything is just
too much of a coincidence.

130
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,600
Jiangxing's cash flow broke down,

131
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,959
my father was desperate,

132
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,680
and you still forced him
to sell the hotel.

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,319
I didn't.

134
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,959
Then you conveniently
acquired Jiangxing afterward,

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,519
and became the CEO of Gu Group.

136
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,000
No matter what,

137
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,399
my father's death is connected to you.

138
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,000
Yunyun.

139
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,600
I really bought Jiangxing
out of good intentions.

140
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I never meant
to drive Uncle Fu to his death.

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,759
If you want Jiangxing,

142
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,920
I can return it to you anytime.

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,600
If you still doubt Uncle Fu's death,
I'll help you investigate again...

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,199
No need.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Gu Chenyu.

146
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Let's get a divorce.

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,159
Yunyun.

148
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,600
From now on,

149
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
we're completely done.

150
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
No more ties between us.

151
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
