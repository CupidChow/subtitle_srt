(Hongshi Charity Auction)

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,040
Mr. Gu.

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,600
- May we have a quick interview?
- Please, come in.

17
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,519
Mr. Gu, you rarely attend public events.

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,760
Your appearance today at this auction,
is there a special reason?

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,319
Mr. Gu.

20
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:24,680
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,319
Mr. Gu.

22
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,319
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,239
You were never interested

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
in events like this before.

25
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,000
People's interests can change.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
I may not have cared before,

27
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:56,239
but maybe I do now.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,159
Then I wish you

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
a pleasant time bidding later.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,280
But

31
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,200
if you happen to like
the same thing I do,

32
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,199
I won't hold back just because

33
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,840
you're my brother.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,840
Same here.

35
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,039
Zhao Muyan is here.

36
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,560
Zhao Muyan?

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Look, it's Zhao Muyan's car!

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,120
Why is he here too?

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,759
Muyan's here! Let's go!

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,039
- Muyan!
- Muyan!

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,599
Muyan, can we have a quick interview?

42
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,319
Look over here, please!

43
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,800
Who's that woman with him?

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,479
Mr. Zhao, you've kept
a low profile recently.

45
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
Your high-profile appearance today,

46
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,680
does it mean

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,280
you have a new project coming soon?

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,479
She's so beautiful.

49
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,800
Mr. Zhao, please explain!

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,759
Is she your girlfriend?

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,759
Is she your girlfriend?

52
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,000
How long have you two been together?

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,159
How far have you progressed?

54
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,520
When will you make it public?

55
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,520
Excuse me.

56
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,039
Mr. Zhao.

57
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,960
Mr. Zhao!

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Isn't that Fu Yunyun?

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,680
Hello.

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,039
How did she become his girlfriend?

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,919
Didn't the Fu family go bankrupt?

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,000
How does she even qualify to be here?

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,319
I heard

64
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,800
she's been pestering Gu Chenyu,

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
and she's had something
going on with Gu Yansheng too.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,520
All she wants is to become
the future matron of the Gu family.

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,280
A fallen socialite like her,
how could she dream of that?

68
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,879
She's just chasing after cold hearts.

69
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,599
The Gu family is way out of her reach.

70
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,360
So she switched her target.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,599
Careful.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,039
Thank you, everyone.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,480
Do you know each other?

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,480
No.

75
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
Just two strangers.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,759
Let's grab something to eat.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,439
Sure.

78
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,639
What on earth are you doing?

79
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,160
You said it yourself,

80
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,360
you don't want
our relationship public yet.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,279
I completely agree.

82
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,240
So today, we'll just pretend
we don't know each other.

83
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,439
I won't even glance your way.

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,079
Are you close with that celebrity?

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,199
Sort of.

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,879
We only met recently,

87
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,079
but he seems like a decent guy.

88
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,920
Righteous and kind.

89
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,600
And quick on his feet.

90
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,480
Play all you want,

91
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,240
but don't forget who you are.

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,040
I know.

93
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,959
Don't worry.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
Out here, I'm a single woman.

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Nothing to do with you.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,319
And certainly nothing

97
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,160
that would affect your reputation.

98
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,700
(Command)

99
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,079
Goodbye.

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,279
Yunyun.

101
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,199
What are you looking at?

102
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,439
That.

103
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,000
You want this?

104
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,000
Starting bid, one and a half million.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,920
I can probably manage
around three million.

106
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,160
That should be enough, right?

107
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:57,959
It's fine.

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,399
I'll bid for you.

109
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll cover anything over that.

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,800
No need.

111
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,040
Consider it a loan.

112
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
At worst,

113
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,319
you can pay me back slowly.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,959
(Best if you never pay it back.)

115
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,120
Then I'll count on you.

116
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,439
This item means a lot to me.

117
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,240
I must have it no matter what.

118
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,519
Understood.

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you.

120
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,800
Dear guests,

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
the auction is about to begin.

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,800
Please take your seats.

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,120
(The Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command of Great Liang)
Next, item number twenty-seven.

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,319
A general's command token
from the Great Liang dynasty,

125
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,199
dating back over a thousand years.

126
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Legend has it

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,360
(Command)
belonged to a family of loyal generals,

128
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
each generation sacrificing their lives

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,879
for the nation.

130
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
It carries extraordinary meaning.

131
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,639
Moreover,

132
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,480
it was crafted using a mysterious
material long lost to history.

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,000
Even after a millennium,
it shows no sign of decay.

134
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,639
It holds immense historical
and research value.

135
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,639
Starting bid with

136
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,199
one and a half million.

137
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,680
The bidding begins now.

138
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
One and a half million.

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,000
Bidder 006, one and a half million.

140
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,240
Two million.

141
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,360
Bidder 012, two million.

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,000
Three million.

143
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
Four million.

144
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,839
What's gotten into him?

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Five million.

146
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Six million.

147
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,160
Eight million.

148
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,399
Bidder 006, eight million.

149
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,759
That much?

150
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,480
Ten million.

151
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,040
Ten million.

152
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,920
Bidder 012, ten million.

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,519
From one and a half million
to ten million,

154
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
impressive spending indeed.

155
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,120
Bidder 012, ten million once.

156
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,160
Twelve million.

157
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,199
I can still raise it.

158
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
But I can't afford it.

159
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,519
Impossible.

160
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,920
Ten million, twice.

161
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,639
(Forget it.)

162
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,079
(I'll just go home
and beat up Gu Yansheng,)

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
(and steal the token back.)

164
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,279
Ten million, third...

165
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,160
Twenty million!

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,199
Twenty million!

167
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,519
The Gu family really is loaded.

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,439
Bidder 003, twenty million once.

169
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,040
Twenty million, twice.

170
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,959
Twenty million, third call.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Congratulations to Bidder 003

172
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,480
for winning the Millennium
Gilded General's Command.

173
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,519
It's all right.

174
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,159
I'll think of another way.

175
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,020
(Command)

176
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,440
Next up is item number twenty-eight.

177
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,279
Why did you stop me from bidding?

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Twenty million,

179
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,080
I can do that too.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
You could, but I couldn't pay it back.

181
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,000
Anyway,

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
thank you for today.

183
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,399
A thank you isn't enough.

184
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,759
At least buy me dinner.

185
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,720
How about

186
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,399
we exchange contacts?

187
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,000
Sure.

188
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,200
