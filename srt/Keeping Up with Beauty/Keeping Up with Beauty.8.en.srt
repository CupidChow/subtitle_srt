13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
=Episode 8=

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Gu.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,799
This…

16
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,000
This incident got a bit out of hand.

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,000
But don't worry.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,840
I'll make sure that old man
is dealt with properly.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,680
When I assigned you
to manage Jiangxing Hotel,

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,200
I made myself very clear.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,640
You were to treat
the senior staff with respect.

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,359
I just checked the personnel changes.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,079
You've replaced
quite a few people this year.

24
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,719
No, Mr. Gu,

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,079
there are reasons for that.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,959
For example,

27
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,680
the old man who attacked you earlier,

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,799
he's already over sixty.

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,150
How can he
still work as a security guard?

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,760
Naturally, younger people
are more suitable.

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,400
So you decided to fill the vacancies

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,159
with your own
relatives and friends, right?

33
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,079
Made a nice profit, didn't you?

34
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,450
No, Mr. Gu, not at all.
That's not what happened.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
I only wanted

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
to improve the hotel's
security management.

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,359
Arrange this.

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,000
Ask that security guard if he's willing
to work as a gatekeeper instead.

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,239
It suits his age better.

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,719
Yes, sir.

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
As for you and your relatives,

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
you don't need to come in tomorrow.

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,799
Wait, Mr. Gu,

44
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,879
I was only thinking
of the company's safety.

45
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,410
What about Mr. Liu's position
as vice president?

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,799
Is former Vice President Wang
still around?

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,280
Yes.

48
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,159
Give the position to him.

49
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:03,840
Understood.

50
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,199
This way, please.

51
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,280
Mr. Gu...

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,680
Out.

53
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:19,680
Chenyu,

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,599
does it hurt?

55
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,039
I'm fine.

56
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,199
You should head back with Shen Siming.

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Yunyun,

58
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,280
I'll leave my brother to you.

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,319
You…

60
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,599
You're really not pressing charges
against that guard?

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,919
No one lashes out like that

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,639
unless they've been pushed to the edge.

63
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,199
I heard his grandson has autism.

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,879
He's had a hard life too.

65
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,319
Oh, right.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,159
This is something
I meant to give you today.

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
What is it?

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,599
You and Mr. Fu

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,759
used to stay in the suite
at Jiangxing Hotel.

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,080
This is the room key.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
I've never touched his belongings.

72
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,479
I've kept them safe all this time.

73
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,439
If you ever miss him,

74
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,879
you can come and visit
whenever you like.

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,599
I have things to do.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm heading back to the group first.

77
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,479
See you tonight.

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Is he really a bad person?

79
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,319
Is he just pretending so well,

80
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,560
putting on an act?

81
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,319
Or could what happened back then

82
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,080
have had another truth behind it?

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,919
Gu Chenyu.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,199
Gu Chenyu.

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
Good day, Mr. Gu.

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,279
You are…

87
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,800
Mr. Gu, Secretary Shen
sent me to pick you up.

88
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,040
(Yunyun,)

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
(you still owe me a meal.)

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
(No time like the present.)

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,079
(Where are you now?)

92
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,160
Get in the car.

93
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,879
Go, now.

94
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,360
Get in.

95
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
Go!

96
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,319
Go!

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,839
Yunyun!

98
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,680
Drive!

99
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,519
Just sleep.

100
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,639
My dear little one.

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Grandma?

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
Grandma, you're finally awake!

103
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,680
Grandma.

104
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,759
Grandma.

105
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,720
Who are you?

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,439
Do we know each other?

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,759
Oh, right.

108
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,360
Quick, check the time.

109
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,360
Send someone to pick up Chenyu.

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,920
School might be over by now.

111
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,000
My little Chenyu.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,399
Come quickly.

113
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,839
Grandma will sing you a song.

114
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,879
Just sleep.

115
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,720
My dear little one.

116
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,240
Mummy loves you.

117
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,519
Mummy likes you.

118
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,720
The board meeting is tomorrow.

119
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,879
Since your grandmother fell ill,

120
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,720
who will take over as chairman?

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,000
We'll soon find out.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
How can you still be drinking here?

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,399
Mom.

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm not interested in those things.

125
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,519
Alright, stop drinking.

126
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
It's just a woman.

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,680
Once you become
the head of the Gu family,

128
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,399
you can have whatever you want.

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,199
I'm talking to you, are you listening?

130
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,240
Are you really willing

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
to let Gu Chenyu
keep stepping on you like this?

132
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,079
Yansheng.

133
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,120
Look at me.

134
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,279
Trust me.

135
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,439
As long as you agree,

136
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,160
I promise you,

137
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,399
I'll make sure you
become the family head.

138
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,759
Why isn't he here yet?

139
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Where's Chenyu?

140
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,240
I... I haven't been able to reach him.

141
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,519
Young people these days
really don't understand manners.

142
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,680
The board meeting is about to start

143
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,360
and Gu Chenyu is nowhere to be seen.

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,399
Are we elders supposed to wait for him?

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Uncle.

146
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,959
You're all here.

147
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,199
Good morning,

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,519
everyone.

149
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,120
Four sixes.

150
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,879
Four kings.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
Four twos.

152
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,199
No.

153
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:55,920
Lost again.

154
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
Are you cheating?

155
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
Enough talk, pay up.

156
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,800
Deal again.

157
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,879
Come on, one more round.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,079
Shuffle the cards quickly.

159
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Don't move.

160
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,319
Almost done.

161
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,399
Hurry up.

162
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,720
Play the cards.

163
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,560
Turn a little that way.

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
Are you in or not, hurry.

165
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,079
Two sixes.

166
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,199
Two eights.

167
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,759
Who are you with?

168
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,279
Tag along then.

169
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,199
Why did you come to save me?

170
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,800
It's none of your business.

171
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,079
But I can't just watch you

172
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,120
get taken.

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,559
Aren't you afraid?

174
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,240
Two sixes.

175
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,159
Not afraid.

176
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,840
Beat him.

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,399
(She's putting on a brave face again.)

178
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,679
Can't cover two sixes.

179
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,480
I'll do it.

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,519
(What are a few petty thieves to fear?)

181
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,360
Two tens.

182
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:44,840
Going to call it?

183
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,080
Don't worry.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I will definitely get you out.

185
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,919
No.

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,919
Three fours.

187
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,879
Keep up.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're awake.

189
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,159
Can you untie this rope?

190
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll hold them off.

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,879
You find a chance to run.

192
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,440
Who sent you?

193
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,679
I can pay double what he offered.

194
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,559
Big talk.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
Think being rich makes you great?

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,919
Today we want your life,

197
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,159
not your money.

198
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,279
Four times.

199
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Ten times.

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
Shove him in.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,679
Pour in cement.

202
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,799
Then throw him in the river.

203
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Kill him!

204
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,200
Yunyun!
