14
00:00:59,479 --> 00:00:59,960
They're out!

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,560
Finally out, take photos!

16
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,359
Muyan, is this your girlfriend?

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,000
Quick, take the shot!

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,239
Get an exclusive face shot!

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,079
Excuse us.

20
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,560
Muyan, who is this girl?

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,680
Is she your girlfriend?

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,000
Please give us an interview.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,599
Look this way!

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,480
Say something!

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,959
Muyan, say a few words!

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,319
Please explain.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,040
Didn't you say
you didn't want to be linked with me?

28
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,200
We're leaving.

29
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,000
Suit yourself.

30
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,280
Explain yourself!

31
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,760
So whose girlfriend is she then?

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
- Attack!
- Attack!

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,639
General!

34
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,840
Release!

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,159
I

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
will follow the General

37
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,800
to the end.

38
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,100
(Command)

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
(I've finally found you,)

40
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,439
(General.)

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
If the reporters
get a photo of you today,

42
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,800
it's not on me.

43
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,400
Relax.

44
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,599
Without my permission,

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
no reporter dares write gossip about me.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
Young Master of the Gu family,

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
you really are impressive.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,039
(The general's token is in his hands.)

49
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,599
(Should I knock him out)

50
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,240
(and snatch it?)

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
Do you really want this?

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes.

53
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,279
Why do you want it so much?

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
You went to such lengths,

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,519
even got Zhao Muyan to help you.

56
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
Because it looks a lot like

57
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
something my father left me.

58
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,120
(So she's missing her father.)

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,199
Gu Chenyu,

60
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,279
can you lend it to me?

61
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:45,920
It's yours.

62
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,240
Twenty million,

63
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,360
you're just giving it to me?

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,000
I misunderstood you
about Grandma before.

65
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,600
Consider this an apology.

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,120
Then I'll accept it.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,879
Everything from before,

68
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,399
let's call it even.

69
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:06,920
Fu Yunyun,

70
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,199
let's get a divorce.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
That's sudden.

72
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
We only married because of Grandma.

73
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,120
This marriage

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,959
was forced from the start.

75
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,920
Don't worry.

76
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,360
I'll keep my word,

77
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,519
you'll never have to worry
about money again.

78
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,040
Leave the Gu family after this.

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,639
Live the life you want.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,600
All right.

81
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,240
Gu Chenyu,

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
actually,

83
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,959
you're not a bad person.

84
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,360
Since we've met,

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,399
I'll wish you

86
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,519
all the best.

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,399
May things go your way.

88
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,639
Farewell.

89
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,680
Mr. Gu,

90
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,439
Butler Zhao is dead.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,399
Butler Zhao is dead?

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
He had a sudden heart attack in custody,

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
they couldn't save him.

94
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,000
I told you to look into his family,
what did you find?

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
You were right again.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
His wife took their child

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,279
back to her hometown a month ago.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Opened a shop,

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,639
bought a house,

100
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,360
doesn't look like someone
in debt from gambling.

101
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,759
If anything,

102
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,240
it's like they came into money.

103
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,959
Keep digging.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Be careful.

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,040
Don't let anyone notice.

106
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,480
Got it.

107
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
You be careful too.

108
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,959
No one knows what the people
behind this will do next.

109
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,439
By the way,

110
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,199
prepare a divorce agreement for me.

111
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,480
You're divorcing Miss Fu?

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,360
The Gu family
will only grow more chaotic.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,639
I don't want anyone else
dragged into this.

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,680
Hear my command,

115
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,680
send me back.

116
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,240
Send me back!

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Send me back!

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Back!

119
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,240
Why haven't I gone back yet?

120
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,279
Something's missing...

121
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,560
Something's not right.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,879
Not sincere enough?

123
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,759
Send me back!

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
How can I return?

125
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,300
(Command)

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,720
Where is this place?

127
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,120
