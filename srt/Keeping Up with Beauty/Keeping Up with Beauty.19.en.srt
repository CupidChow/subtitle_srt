=Episode 19=

14
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,799
This is for you.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,079
Thanks.

16
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,120
What's on your mind?

17
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,480
You seem distracted.

18
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,760
Haven't you found that jade pendant?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,560
It's alright.

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,120
You've reclaimed the hotel after all.

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,280
I'll help you look for the jade pendant.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,480
No matter what it takes,

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,519
I'll find it for you.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh, right.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,719
I've got another gift for you.

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
It's my silver spear!

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I found this at the black market.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
I just thought of trying my luck.

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,959
To my surprise, I found it there.

30
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,000
This is considered
a thousand-year-old antique.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I bet it was expensive.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
I can't accept it.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,199
Just take it.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,199
It belongs to you anyway.

35
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,879
Also, don't you think it's all fated?

36
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,350
Even though a millennium has passed,

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,400
some cherished objects
remain reclaimable.

38
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,919
Thank you, then.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,479
Muyan.

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,879
You've done more than enough for me.

41
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,390
In fact, you need not treat me so well.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
Have you forgotten this, General?

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
You saved my life.

44
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Don't let him get away!

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Quick! Give chase!

46
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,000
Over there!

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
Stop right there!

48
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,120
Everyone, get up!

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Hurry up!

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,719
Give chase now!

51
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,220
Stop running!

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:20,850
Stop running!

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,439
Stop right there!

54
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,719
You're a pretty good runner, huh?

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,280
You wanted to report that
to the official, huh?

56
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:30,919
Dream on!

57
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,479
Get rid of him!

58
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,680
Get rid of him!

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,079
Go! Let's go now!

60
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,279
- Let's go.
- Go.

61
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,240
I've dealt with those bullies.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,959
You're no longer a runaway after this.

63
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,399
Go home.

64
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,759
If you have nowhere to be,

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,680
join my army, then.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you so much.

67
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,399
Nice one!

68
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,759
One more time!

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,480
I see.

70
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:52,806
It was you!

71
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,240
General.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Please allow me

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
to treat you well forever.

74
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,360
Just leave such matters to Mr. Shen.

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,920
That won't do.

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,639
It's too personal of a matter.

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,959
The elevator isn't working today.

78
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,980
We have to use the stairs.

79
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,780
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,199
Hi.

81
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:25,920
Slowly.

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,319
Chenyu.

83
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm sorry,

84
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,879
but I forgot the keys.

85
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll take them now. I'll be back soon.

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,439
Wait for me.

87
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,839
Sure.

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

89
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,240
Hi.

91
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,990
You're still here, Mr. Gu.

92
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,800
Bye.

93
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,680
Mr. Gu.

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,120
Do you need any help?

95
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,720
Just get back to work.

96
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes.

97
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,360
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

98
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,639
Mr. Gu!

99
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,959
Are you okay?

100
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
What's this?

101
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,199
Are you okay?

102
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,439
Are you alright, Mr. Gu?

103
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,480
Chenyu!

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you okay, Chenyu?

105
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,720
Chenyu!

106
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,199
Shiqi.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Help me up.

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,920
Mr. Gu.

109
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
It's me, Ruyin.

110
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,480
Can't you see me?

111
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,720
He can't see us?

112
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,079
What's the matter with Mr. Gu?

113
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,320
How did he fell down the stairs?

114
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,879
He can't see us.

115
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,959
Has he gone blind?

116
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,120
Do you want us to get you
an ambulance, Mr. Gu?

117
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,040
(Gu Group recently released
a statement saying)

118
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,680
(that its CEO, Gu Chenyu,
has suspended all work)

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,199
(due to sudden blindness.)

120
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,040
(According to an insider,)

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,190
(Gu Chenyu's vision problems
are very serious.)

122
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,519
(He fell down the stairs in public
and lost consciousness.)

123
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:13,800
Chenyu...

124
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,839
(His current condition remains unknown.)

125
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,560
I didn't want you to hear any of this,

126
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
but I think

127
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,199
since it concerns the company,

128
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,519
you should at least know about it.

129
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,120
But don't worry.

130
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,439
I'll handle
all the public opinion issues.

131
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,399
For now, the most important thing
for you is to rest well

132
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,519
and take care of your eyes.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
I'll head to work now.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,180
If you need anything,
just ask the housekeeper.

135
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
Let me do it.

136
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Are you okay?

137
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
I heard you fell down the stairs.

138
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
Are you here to mock at me?

139
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,159
Yeah.

140
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,080
After years of scheming,

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,879
in the end, you got nothing.

142
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
You should leave.

143
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,000
Are you okay?

144
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
Gu Chenyu.

145
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
Can you stop making me worry?

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I'll stay and help you

147
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
until you get better.

148
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't need your pity.

149
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,039
Gu Chenyu.

150
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I've seen countless people
worse off than you.

151
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,480
Their families have been torn apart.

152
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,279
They are homeless

153
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,519
and physically disabled.

154
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,300
Every one of them
is more miserable than you.

155
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,639
Someone like you

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,879
doesn't deserve my sympathy.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
Then why are you back here?

158
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,919
I...

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Why are you here?

160
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,679
He was stabbed because of me.

161
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,519
He can't see now.

162
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,190
I'd like to stay here
until his recovery.

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,480
