Who let you in?

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,040
Get out.

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,079
I'm warning you.

17
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,280
Your brother's inside.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,079
He's here,

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,719
and that makes you so happy?

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,959
Has my brother ever touched you?

21
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:20,480
Here.

22
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,359
Here...

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,319
Or…

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Enough already.

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Fu Yunyun.

26
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,560
What are you doing?

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm making the bed.

28
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,879
Perfect timing.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
Let my brother see what we're up to.

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,879
Fu Yunyun.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,519
What tricks are you playing now?

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Yunyun.

33
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,680
Don't go, Yunyun.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
I really miss you.

35
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,120
Yunyun.

36
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,319
Good day, Young Madam.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,439
(This world doesn't belong to me.)

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,520
(What must I do
to return to my own world?)

39
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,540
(Hongshi Charity Auction)

40
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,700
(Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command
of Great Liang)

41
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,879
Nangong Yu, listen to my command.

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,319
I am here.

43
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
From tomorrow onward,

44
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,319
(General Nangong)
you shall be the General of the Southern Wind Camp.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,960
This command token,

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,199
I entrust it to you.

47
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:01,919
Yes.

48
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,360
Father.

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,639
Why is half of it missing?

50
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,960
Our Nangong ancestors

51
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,599
were once saved by another family.

52
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,519
Half of this command token's jade

53
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,199
was gifted to our benefactor.

54
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,959
And a pact was made

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,439
that one day,

56
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,319
should the benefactor's family
fall into hardship,

57
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,199
our descendants of the Nangong clan

58
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,519
will repay that debt of gratitude,

59
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,720
even at the cost of their lives.

60
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,879
So this command token

61
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,120
is not only a symbol of command
over the Southern Wind Camp,

62
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,560
but also represents

63
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,360
a promise
that can reverse life and death

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,519
and transcend time itself.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
Reverse life and death…

66
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,439
Transcend time…

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,639
(Command)
Bound by life itself.

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,360
A vow that endures
beyond life and death.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,399
Could it be that I came here

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,800
because of this command token?

71
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,420
(The Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,879

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
Morning.

74
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,519
Did you sleep well last night?

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,480
Fu Yunyun.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
You've grown bold.

77
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,360
What do you mean by that?

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,399
You all passed out last night.

79
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,800
I was worried you'd catch a cold,
so I covered you with a blanket.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,360
Then I should thank you, shouldn't I?

81
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,199
You're welcome.

82
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,199
What exactly are you planning?

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm going to the auction.

84
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,860
(Hongshi Charity Auction)

85
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,680
I saw this on the coffee table,

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,120
an auction catalogue
from the charity event.

87
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
It says that invited guests

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,439
may bring family members along.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
Can you take me with you?

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,680
No.

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,519
Why not?

92
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,199
We're married, aren't we?

93
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,519
Didn't you say so yourself yesterday?

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,439
That doesn't count.

95
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,040
Come on,

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,639
don't be so petty.

97
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,600
There's something there I really need.

98
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,079
Still no.

99
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,240
When you go out, remember your status.

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,759
I'm not ready to make
our relationship public yet.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,959
Fine.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,879
If I can't count on others,
I'll count on myself.

103
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:50,879
All right.

104
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,360
Watch this.

105
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,279
Perfect.

106
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:56,519
Hello.

107
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,680
Please show your invitation.

108
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,560
Thank you, here you go.

109
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,199
This way, please.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,000
Smile, please.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,519
Here you go.

112
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,720
Here, please. Come in.

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Please show your invitation.

114
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,040
(Too many people here.
It's not safe to take risks.)

115
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,439
(It seems I'll need to find
a way to get an invitation.)

116
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,120
Please come in.

117
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,879
Yan.

118
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,199
Where on earth did you go?

119
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
You're a big star.

120
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,959
You can't just wander off alone.

121
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,759
I went to the auction
to buy a few things.

122
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,319
The auction?

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
Isn't that a public event?

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,560
Stop talking nonsense.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Did you find the person I asked you to?

126
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,399
There's no photo.

127
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,720
With just a few vague descriptions,

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

129
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't care what it takes.

130
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
No matter the cost,

131
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,399
keep looking.

132
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,839
Understood.

135
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Who are you?

136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
A fan?

137
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,000
Fan?

138
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680

139
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,000
The edible kind?

140
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,759
Drop the act.

141
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,919
You want a photo or an autograph?

142
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,879
Just say it.

143
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,840
I want that invitation in your pocket.

144
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,720
Name your price.

145
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,639
Sorry,

146
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,799
this invitation

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,759
isn't for sale.

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Then don't blame me for being rude.

My apologies,

sir.

152
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,120
But I must attend

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,879
today's auction.

154
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,639
Name your price.

155
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,970
You should've said so earlier.

156
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,320
There's no need to fight.

157
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,200
And no need for money, either.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,919
We can just

159
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,279
go together.

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
Really?

don't mind being my date.
