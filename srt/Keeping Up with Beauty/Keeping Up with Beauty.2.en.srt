14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,439
Sister-in-law.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,079
Where are you trying to sneak off to?

16
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,000
Sister-in-law?

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,200
Don't move.

18
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,680
My brother's room is right next door.

19
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,519
Do you want me to call him out for you?

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,560
(Are people here truly this shameless?)

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,879
Sister-in-law.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,799
It's been days.

23
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,159
Did you miss me?

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,079
I'm your sister-in-law.

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,000
So what?

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,719
Fu Yunyun,

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,239
you're mine.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,359
When I come back,

29
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,760
I'll tell everyone about us.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,680
We'll never be apart again.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,599
All right.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
Two years will pass quickly.

33
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait for me to return.

34
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:04,799
Come here.

35
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,800
- Second Young Master.
- Second Young Master.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,360
You're looking better by the day, sir.

37
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,199
Yansheng.

38
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,660
Grandmother.

39
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,240
Mother.

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,439
My precious son, you're finally home!

41
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,599
It's been two years.

42
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,199
I've missed you so much!

43
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,479
My little darling.

44
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,599
Come, sit down quickly.

45
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,199
Sit down.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,080
Shiqi.

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,560
Yansheng.

48
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,240
Yunyun.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,240
From now on,

50
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,039
you can't call her Yunyun anymore.

51
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,319
She's already married to your brother.

52
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,599
You should call her Sister-in-law.

53
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,199
I...

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,599
I'm going to the bathroom.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,879
He's home now.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Yansheng will be fine.

57
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,000
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

58
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,280
What happened?

59
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,759
Why did you suddenly marry my brother?

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,439
Why?

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,719
Why?

62
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,599
Gu Yansheng.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,759
I've never liked you.

64
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,360
The one I want to marry
is the head of the Gu family.

65
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,120
You're not worthy.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,319
(Could Fu Yunyun
really have abandoned him so coldly?)

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,120
Who's there?

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,800
Scared already?

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,959
Psycho.

70
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,759
(What does "psycho" mean?)

71
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,800
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,720
Just taking a walk.

73
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
Fortunately, we rescued her in time.

74
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,240
The old lady's condition has stabilized.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,000
However,

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
the toxin has affected her brain.

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
It's likely

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
she'll remain unconscious for a while.

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
How long will that be?

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,199
A few days at least,

81
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,399
maybe a few months.

82
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,000
It depends on her physical condition.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,600
Once she wakes up,
she should recover fully.

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,959
What caused it?

85
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,120
She probably took
a neurotoxic substance by mistake.

86
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,720
Thank you, doctor.

87
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:26,839
You're welcome.

88
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,639
I've examined that pill.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,390
There was indeed
something wrong with it.

90
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,720
I misunderstood you.

91
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,240
That's great.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,279
I'm just glad Grandmother's safe.

93
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,240
What's this?

94
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,480
A handkerchief.

95
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,240
You never used
this sort of thing before.

96
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,439
Just use it.

97
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,240
Shiqi.

98
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,920
In life, cry when you want to cry,
laugh when you want to laugh.

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,720
Don't restrain yourself.

100
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,839
Yunyun,

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,480
you seem different from before.

102
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,160
Well,

103
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,639
if that's all,

104
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,639
I'll take Shiqi back first.

105
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,399
Stop.

106
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,959
Tonight,

107
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,279
I'll come to you.

108
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,480
Let's go.

109
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,160
How long do I have to stay here?

110
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:52,879
Could it be

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,680
that I can never go back?

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,120
Do you need something?

113
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,079
What's the meaning of this?

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,319
We're husband and wife.

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,319
Isn't it natural for me
to come to your room?

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,120
You...

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,639
Don't you dare.

118
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,720
We're not truly husband and wife.

119
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,160
And as far as I know,

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,399
you've never stepped foot
in this room before.

121
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
Fu Yunyun.

122
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,959
You've never
treated me like this before.

123
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,519
You've been acting strange lately.

124
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,959
Almost like you've become
a different person.

125
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,199
You suspected me
of poisoning the old madam,

126
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
did you still expect me
to treat you nicely?

127
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,959
So that's the reason?

128
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
Of course.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,079
You're my husband,

130
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
yet you don't trust me.

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,759
Your actions

132
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,319
are truly disappointing.

133
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Very well then.

134
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,639
I haven't treated you
well enough before.

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
So tonight,

136
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,519
let me make it up to you properly.

137
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
How about

138
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,320
you take a shower first?

139
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,559
All right.

140
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,759
Darn it.

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,799
He's testing me.

142
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,879
Could it be...

143
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,200
he's realised I'm not the real Fu Yunyun?

144
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,559
Forget it.

145
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,919
Of the thirty-six stratagems,

146
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,720
retreat is the best one.

147
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,639
Who let you in?

148
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,639
