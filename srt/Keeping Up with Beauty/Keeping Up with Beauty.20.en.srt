=Episode 20=

14
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:02,880
Yunyun.

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,480
You're divorced.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,150
Why are you going back to the Gu family?

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
Gu Chenyu was poisoned,
and his eyes were injured.

18
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,719
I want to help him.

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,920
His eyes?

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,159
What do they have to do with you?

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,239
You are Nangong Yu, not Fu Yunyun.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,319
Your top priority
is to locate that jade pendant

23
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,439
and return to the past.

24
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,319
He...

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
He was stabbed because of me.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,760
I don't want to owe him anything.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,719
Muyan.

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
Can you give me a little more time?

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,400
Do you think
I'm eager to send you back to the past

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,000
because I want to do so too?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
As long as I'm with you,

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,200
no matter which world it is,

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:48,760
I...

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,359
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm sorry, Muyan.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,159
What's wrong, Mr. Gu?

37
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,439
Why did you fall down the stairs?

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,719
Has Mr. Gu really gone blind?

39
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,759
I thought it was fake.

40
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,759
It turns out to be real.

41
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,120
Let me help you down.

42
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,919
Hold on to me.

43
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,240
Careful.

44
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,879
They should be here soon, right?

45
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,319
Well, maybe we shouldn't
be having this meal.

46
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,160
Yansheng.

47
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,759
Didn't you promise to join this meal?

48
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,850
We're already sitting here.

49
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
Chenyu, Yunyun.

50
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,680
Are you all right?

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
I'm fine.

52
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:53,920
Yansheng.

53
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,639
It's been so long
since our last meal together.

54
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,000
Grandma is in the hospital.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,759
And Mom...

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,399
Careful.

57
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,959
There's only a few of us left
in this family.

58
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Sit down.

59
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,360
Come on.

60
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,839
Yunyun is so good to Chenyu.

61
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,360
She does everything herself.

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,370
They're just inseparable.

63
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,639
You won't be leaving again
now that you're back, right?

64
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,680
I haven't...

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,480
That's enough.

66
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Let's eat.

67
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,240
Then let's dig in.

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,480
This braised beef
is your favorite, Chenyu.

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,079
I specially had them prepare it.

70
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,750
And the shrimp
is your favorite, Yansheng.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,800
Eat up.

72
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,839
Let me do it.

73
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,439
It's okay, I can manage it.

74
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,160
Leave it to me.

75
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,120
I'll do it.

76
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:13,720
Here.

77
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,720
Open your mouth.

78
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,480
It's your favorite braised beef.

79
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,560
Thank you.

80
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Yansheng.

81
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,680
Fu Yunyun's jade pendant...

82
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,759
Where could it be?

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
Could it be that there are

84
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,720
memories I haven't come across

85
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,480
here in this family?

86
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
Let go of me! I didn't do it!

87
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,879
Why don't you all believe me?

88
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,480
Let go of me! I didn't do that!

89
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,160
Let go of me!

90
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,160
What should I do?

91
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,079
It's that jade pendant.

92
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,120
But

93
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,559
what happened after that?

94
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,879
Who are

95
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,639
you?

96
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,600
Someone help me...

97
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,399
Someone...

98
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,919
I must live...

99
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,039
I must live...

100
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,480
Someone

101
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,159
help me...

102
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Help...

103
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,840
If I kill you,

104
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
will...

105
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,159
will Yunyun come back to me?

106
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,799
