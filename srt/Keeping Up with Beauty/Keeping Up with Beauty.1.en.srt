=Keeping Up with Beauty=
(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

13
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,240
A thousand years ago,

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,039
the Great Liang Empire was torn
by internal strife and external threats.

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
Corrupt ministers conspired
with frontier generals,

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,840
plotting a military coup.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,159
When the rebel cavalry
broke through the imperial city,

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,719
only Nangong Yu, commander
of the Southern Wind Camp,

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,680
led his soldiers to defend
the palace gates

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,359
(Nangong Yu, General of Great Liang)
to the death.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,660
(Commander of the Rebel Army)

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,639
General.

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,199
(Command)
All members of the Southern Wind Camp, hear my command!

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,360
Fall back to the palace gates!

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,599
Protect His Majesty with all your might!

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,439
- Yes!
- Yes!

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,240
Release!

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,140
(Command)

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,940
(Command)

30
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,500
=Episode 1=

31
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,680
(Where am I?)

32
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,520
(Why am I still alive?)

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,319
You're awake.

34
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,840
Fu Yunyun.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,479
Don't think that killing yourself
will make me forgive you.

36
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,479
Who are you?

37
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,159
Stop pretending to be crazy.

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,719
Grandmother treated you so well.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,120
Why did you try to harm her?

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,439
(Whose memories are these?)

41
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,759
(Have I been reincarnated,)

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,319
(or has my soul
entered someone else's body?)

43
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,780
(Fu Yunyun.)

44
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,560
Yunyun.

45
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,600
Come here.

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,360
Yunyun.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,879
Don't be afraid.

48
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,959
Your father is gone,

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,319
but we're all still here for you.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,720
Grandmother.

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,759
Would you be willing
to marry our Chenyu?

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,360
From now on,
you'll be a member of the Gu family.

53
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,000
If anything happens, tell Grandmother.

54
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,560
Young Madam.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Please come with me.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,720
Go on.

57
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,279
I'll go now, Grandmother.

58
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,000
Go on.

59
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,120
This is

60
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,439
our kitchen.

61
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,160
Mr. Zhao.

62
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,160
This corridor
leads to the front courtyard.

63
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,680
Go upstairs,

64
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,240
and the first room on the left
is the young master's bedroom.

65
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,959
Young Master.

66
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,600
Young Madam.

67
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,879
I'll help you with your luggage.

68
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Thank you.

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,639
You can have whatever you want,

70
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,839
but I hope
that aside from the Gu family,

71
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,560
no one else will know
about our relationship.

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,439
Conduct yourself wisely.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,120
(Father,)

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
(you won't have died in vain.)

75
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,079
(No matter how the Gu family treats me,)

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,319
(I will find the one who killed you,)

77
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,879
(and make the Gu family
pay the price they deserve.)

78
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,079
Let go of me!

79
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,680
I didn't kill anyone!
Why won't anyone believe me?

80
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,959
Let go of me!

81
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,360
I didn't kill anyone!

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't kill anyone!

83
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,800
The maid saw it with her own eyes!

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
The old madam treated you so well!

85
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,199
How could you do such a thing?

86
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't kill anyone!
I'll go explain everything to them!

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,720
Explain what?

88
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm telling you,

89
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,439
the young master is coming back soon.

90
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,240
You'd better get ready
for prison or worse.

91
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,639
Who are you?

92
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,399
Fu Yunyun.

93
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,120
You harmed Grandmother
and now you want to kill me too?

94
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,800
Take me to the scene.

95
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,759
I'll prove my innocence myself.

96
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,759
Grandmother was perfectly
fine at dinner.

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
She was poisoned late that night.

98
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,260
The surveillance footage shows

99
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,879
you were the only one
who entered her room.

100
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,759
Who's in charge of the surveillance?

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Tell him to come and face me directly.

102
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,519
You still dare to joke
at a time like this?

103
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,759
I'm not joking.

104
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,399
I'll face you myself.

105
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
You're the surveillance?

106
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
What are you talking about?

107
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,040
The old lady
hadn't been sleeping well lately.

108
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,240
I saw the light still on in her room,

109
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,439
so I went to check on her.

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,519
That's when I saw you

111
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,000
feeding her a bowl of calming soup.

112
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,279
Moments later, she was poisoned.

113
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,519
Tell me,

114
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,240
apart from you,

115
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,480
who else could have poisoned her?

116
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,039
Is the soup bowl
from that night still here?

117
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
Can you prove
there was poison in my soup?

118
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,080
You still dare to ask?

119
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,200
Mr. Zhao.

120
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,600
Young Madam washed the bowl
right after feeding the medicine.

121
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,200
(So now there's no evidence left.)

122
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,080
Fu Yunyun,

123
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,000
the police are almost here.

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,039
How will you prove your innocence now?

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
Could she really have done it?

126
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,720
That's impossible.

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,159
(If touching someone)

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
(lets me recall their memories,)

129
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,720
(then…)

130
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,720
Is it bitter?

131
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,279
My granddaughter-in-law
made it so thoughtfully.

132
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,590
No matter how bitter it is,

133
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,639
it still tastes sweet to me.

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,080
Mother,

135
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
you're still not asleep?

136
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,440
Yunyun made me some calming soup.

137
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,519
I just drank it.

138
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,159
After feeding her the medicine,
let Grandmother rest early.

139
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Go on, dear.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,080
Go now.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,799
Good night.

142
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,120
All right.

143
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,679
Grandmother,

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
what's this?

145
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,559
Mr. Zhao brought it over this afternoon.

146
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,080
He said the room was too plain,

147
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
so he placed this here
to brighten it up.

148
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,480
It's quite nice.

149
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,919
Then rest early.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,399
You too, rest early.

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,159
What's wrong?

152
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,399
What is this?

153
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,919
Grandmother has asthma.

154
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,360
That's her asthma medicine.

155
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,440
Yes, Yunyun,

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,200
this medicine

157
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
has always been prepared
for the old madam by Mr. Zhao.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,559
He knows best about it.

159
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:48,840
Yun...

160
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,440
Yunyun...

161
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,679
This is ragweed.

162
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,039
It's highly allergenic.

163
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,360
It can easily trigger asthma.

164
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Mr. Zhao,

165
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,600
why did you place it here?

166
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,039
If the old madam had an asthma attack,

167
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,320
she would have to take
her asthma medicine immediately.

168
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,679
If the medicine was switched for poison…

169
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,600
Young Master.

170
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,720
Young Master.

171
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,799
Don't slander me like that.

172
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,360
I've served the Gu family
for twenty years.

173
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,519
Whether it's poisoned or not,

174
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,200
a test will reveal the truth.

175
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,240
Mr. Zhao,

176
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,879
was this really the medicine
you gave Grandmother?

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,720
I...

178
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,080
I...

179
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,559
Yunyun!

180
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
I didn't want to do it!

181
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,279
I... I owed gambling debts.

182
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,639
The old madam found out,

183
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,600
and she wanted to fire me!

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
Guards! Come quickly!

185
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,600
Hurry!

186
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,679
Let me go!

187
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,879
Let me go!

188
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,720
Let me go!

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,320
Hello?

190
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,840
Brother,

191
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,360
Grandmother's out of danger now.

192
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,600
Good. I understand.

193
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,960
Yansheng said
Grandmother's out of danger.

194
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,120
Really?

195
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,519
Then if that's all,

196
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,080
I'll take my leave.

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,639
Stop.

198
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,080
I just helped you find the culprit.

199
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,240
Until we confirm whether the medicine
is poisoned or not,

200
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,879
you're not allowed
to leave the Gu residence.

201
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,279
The Gu family?

202
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,159
Who cares.

203
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,919
I'll come

204
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,080
and go as I please.

205
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
(My head hurts...)

206
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,159
A bond sealed with life.

207
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,840
A vow of life and death.

208
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,480
(These memories appearing...)

209
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,990
(Could it be they're trying
to tell me something?)

210
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,879
Sister-in-law,

211
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,480
where are you sneaking off to?

212
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,519
