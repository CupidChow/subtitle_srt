14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,039
Why are you still here so late?

15
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,600
Don't worry.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,239
Let's go ask Chenyu
and get it clear now.

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,840
The boss is urging us
to finish the presentation.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Have you heard
about the Jiangxing Hotel incident?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
It seems to be causing
quite a stir recently.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,640
What is the PR department
planning to do?

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,359
I'll tell you.

22
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,120
Mr. Gu

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,519
knows how to handle this matter.

24
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:17,319
What method?

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,640
I heard

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
that Mr. Gu put all the responsibility

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,239
on the head chef.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,640
Claiming he compromised quality
for personal gain.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,730
So he used inferior ingredients.

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,640
Anyway, those were the old staff
from before the hotel was acquired.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,560
They were Fu family's people.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,239
Perfect scapegoats.

33
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,519
Also a chance to clean house.

34
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,040
As expected of Mr. Gu.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Two birds with one stone.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
And he gets off clean.

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,879
Exactly.

38
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm telling you,

39
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,400
I heard

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,120
that this whole thing

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,959
was actually planned by Mr. Gu himself.

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,599
No wonder.

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,319
So this matter…

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,599
Fine.

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,359
Yunyun.

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,000
Gu Chenyu.

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,040
Immediately withdraw your PR draft.

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,239
You don't need to handle
the Jiangxing Hotel incident anymore.

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,800
I will release a statement
clarifying everything within two days.

50
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,199
I will not allow you to slander
any Jiangxing Hotel employee.

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
What PR draft?

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,970
I don't know what
you're talking about, Yunyun.

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,039
Yunyun.

54
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you misunderstand Chenyu?

55
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,439
There are so many people in the company,

56
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,599
let's discuss this at home.

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,570
Whether it's a misunderstanding,
you know best in your heart.

58
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,560
Chenyu,

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,919
this time you really went too far.

60
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,960
How could you treat
Jiangxing Hotel employees like this?

61
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,719
Gu Chenyu,

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,240
don't you have anything to say?

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,599
I didn't release the PR draft.

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,080
Let's go.

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Uncle.

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,639
Why did you make decisions
for me without permission?

67
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,199
I said I didn't agree to let
Jiangxing Hotel employees take the blame.

68
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,120
Sacrificing just one head chef.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Since when have you become
so soft-hearted?

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,240
For the group and for you,

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
this is the best solution.

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,439
Come.

73
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,800
Sit.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,199
I said no, that's final.

75
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Is it because of Fu Yunyun?

76
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,879
Because of my conscience.

77
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,400
Conscience?

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
Did you forget how her father died?

79
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,080
You haven't forgotten.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,800
Fu Yunyun hasn't forgotten either.

81
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,599
She was obviously
Gu Yansheng's girlfriend.

82
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,840
Why did she suddenly marry you?

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
From the beginning,

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,919
she had ulterior motives.

85
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,800
Back then, the old lady liked her,

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
and insisted you marry her.

87
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,759
But now,

88
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,400
the old lady is already incoherent.

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,319
You should divorce her immediately.

90
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,960
Take full control of Jiangxing Hotel.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
No.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,919
What did you say?

93
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
I will not divorce her.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,560
The matter with her father was my fault.

95
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,639
I should atone,

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,800
not continue to hurt her.

97
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:11,879
Gu Chenyu,

98
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,520
you're crazy.

99
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,560
Uncle.

100
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,279
You've always taught me

101
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,240
to put the interests of the group first

102
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
before personal interests.

103
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
To fight with all my might for
the position of head of the family,

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,399
even if it means
using any means necessary.

105
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,800
But this past year, I've been asking myself,

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
what is right

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,639
and what is wrong?

108
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,240
For the sake of profit,

109
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,639
now the Gu family is in disarray.

110
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,720
Grandma was poisoned,

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
and I've also gone
against my conscience.

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,319
Is this really the right thing to do?

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't want to continue like this.

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,319
I will help Yunyun
protect Jiangxing Hotel,

115
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,720
and do what I believe is right.

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,920
Sorry, Uncle.

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Her father's death

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
will always be a thorn between you two.

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
No matter what you do for her,

120
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,959
she will never truly love you.

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
You will regret it sooner or later.

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,360
You…

123
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,560
Madam,

124
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,120
everything is proceeding as you wished.

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Moreover, the doctor
who diagnosed the food poisoning

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,199
died unexpectedly at Jiangxing Hotel.

127
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,000
Brilliant.

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,399
Now,

129
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,560
the public will think

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,279
that Gu Chenyu drove him to his death.

131
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,959
If Fu Yunyun comes out now

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,519
and reveals that her father
was forced to die back then,

133
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,839
together with this,

134
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,199
Gu Chenyu

135
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,680
probably won't recover from this.

136
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
Madam is clever as always.

137
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,199
But what about Wang Hao's daughter?

138
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,639
Of course,

139
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,519
we'll send her to reunite
with her father.

140
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,920
Reunion?

141
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,879
Understood.

142
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,199
Don't worry.

143
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Wang Hao is with us.

144
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,000
We'll have him record a clarification.

145
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,920
The rest will be handled by the police.

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,519
Jiangxing Hotel will surely
be proven innocent.

147
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,120
Oh no.

148
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,000
Could someone be silenced?

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Wang Hao.

150
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,800
Wang Hao!

151
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,759
Go find Wang Huatao
and call the police for an ambulance.

152
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,319
Okay.

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
Wang Hao!

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,079
What did you say?

155
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,079
Speak clearly.

156
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,639
Come out.

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,879
How is my daughter?

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
I followed Mr. Bai's instructions.

159
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,319
You must save my daughter.

160
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,879
You've done well.

161
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,199
See?

162
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,279
Madam said

163
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,600
you'll be reunited with her now.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
Good.

165
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,759
What are you doing?

166
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,720
Let go of me!

167
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Dare to kill someone on my territory?

168
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
I don't know anything.

169
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,720
Doesn't matter.

170
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
Anyway, it's already recorded.

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,600
Gu Chenyu,

172
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,959
we've taken care of it here.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,120
Don't you have anything to say?

174
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
I didn't release the PR draft.

175
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,279
Let's go.

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,360
Yunyun.

177
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
There must be a misunderstanding here.

178
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
Let's talk privately.

179
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,960
What else is there to talk about?

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,159
Yunyun.

181
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:37,679
Let's go.

182
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
Give me a chance to explain.

183
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,919
I swear,

184
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,919
the PR department's orders weren't mine.

185
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,399
I absolutely would never

186
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,360
let anyone from Jiangxing Hotel
take the blame.

187
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,600
I can't trust
what you're saying right now.

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,240
Fine.

189
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,960
I will find out the truth
within two days.

190
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,879
Have you contacted that doctor already?

191
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,960
Why are you asking?

192
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,919
I've checked.

193
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,200
He has a child

194
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,919
with severe congenital heart disease.

195
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
This year is the last chance
for surgery.

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,279
Originally, the child
was in the countryside,

197
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,360
without money for surgery.

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,360
But recently,

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
the case was secretly transferred
to a hospital under Gu Group,

200
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,080
and the surgery fees were paid.

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
You mean to say

202
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,159
that the girl is a hostage?

203
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,799
Think about it.

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,759
If his daughter is in my hands,

205
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,960
would he dare admit to you
that I ordered him to do it?

206
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,039
Oh no.

207
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,600
I locked him in Jiangxing Hotel.

208
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,799
If someone wants him to die
in the hotel,

209
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,490
Jiangxing Hotel will never
be able to clear its name.

210
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,159
Don't panic.

211
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,679
Since they planned this long ago,

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
then we will

213
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,480
