=Episode 15=

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,439
Do I still have a home?

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,920
You still have me.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
I'll stay with you for a while.

17
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,760
I believe Yansheng and Shiqi

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,599
will understand you one day.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,799
Will you stay with me forever?

20
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,239
I...

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,359
Yunyun.

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,719
Yunyun.

23
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,760
Actually, I...

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,400
Mr. Gu.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,280
This financial report needs your...

26
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,799
You two talk first.

27
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll take a call.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,359
Mr. Gu.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,439
Is it too late to apologise now?

30
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,520
Miss Fu.

31
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,960
Although Mr. Gu held a press conference

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,520
to prove our restaurant's innocence,

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,879
our business
has still been greatly affected.

34
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,879
There's no one here.

35
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,639
What turnover

36
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,800
could there be now?

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,759
We can't go on like this.

38
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,599
Uncle Wang,

39
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,599
it'll take time

40
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,520
for customers
to regain trust in Jiangxing.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,400
Don't worry yet.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,759
Let's think of something together.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,759
Can I not worry?

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,560
Yunyun.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,759
Muyan.

46
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,520
Why are you here?

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Congratulations on reopening the hotel.

48
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,520
Thank you.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,039
Also,

50
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,759
I guessed you might need some help.

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Muyan, what are you doing?

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Here.

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,759
Smile.

54
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,520
A selfie.

55
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,400
At my favourite restaurant,
watching the most beautiful view

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,960
with the most important person to me.

57
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,308
(Zhao Muyan: At my favourite restaurant,)

58
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:54,980
(watching the most beautiful view
with the most important person to me.)

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,520
The second party's quotation,
compared with the same quarter last year,

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,759
has decreased by 3.4 percent.

61
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,919
Regarding this,

62
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,400
Mr. Gu, what's your opinion?

63
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,680
Mr. Gu.

64
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,360
Mr. Gu.

65
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,080
Mr. Gu.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,600
Mr. Gu.

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,240
Chenyu.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,279
What did you just say?

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,959
All parties unanimously agree

70
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,079
that within one year
from the signing of this agreement,

71
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,399
except as required by applicable laws

72
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,800
or competent government authorities,

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,399
without prior written consent
from all parties,

74
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,199
no party, employee, consultant,

75
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,600
intermediary, or agent

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,279
shall disclose any information
or documents obtained

77
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,959
that have not been released

78
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,720
or made public in any other form
related to this capital increase.

79
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,120
- Muyan.
- Muyan.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,759
Thank you.

81
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,839
So handsome!

82
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,199
I want a photo too!

83
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,040
Thank you.

84
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,000
Hello.

85
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,600
Can I take a photo with you?

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:09,980
Sure.

87
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,040
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
How was it?

89
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,480
We owe you a lot today.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,360
Don't mention it.

91
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,560
Your matters are my matters.

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,079
I didn't expect
so many people to come today.

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,680
So many.

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,519
Mr. Zhao,

95
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,879
thank you especially for today.

96
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,360
You not only helped promote us for free,

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,800
but also worked here all day.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
Really, thank you.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,399
You're welcome.

100
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,199
Miss Fu, I'll go handle something first.

101
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,360
You two take your time.

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,279
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

103
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
Muyan,

104
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,600
you've already helped me enough.

105
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,360
From now on,
don't see yourself as my subordinate.

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,879
We are equals.

107
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,800
I understand.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
But in my heart,

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,680
you're not just my General.

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,199
You're also
the most important person to me.

111
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,040
Yunyun.

112
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,959
Sit down quickly.

113
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,480
Don't tear your wound open.

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,279
Shiqi made this for you.

115
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,199
She asked me to bring it.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,519
How is she?

117
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,279
She cried for two days

118
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
and much better now.

119
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,720
Eat it while it's hot.

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll head back first.

121
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,360
Can you stay
and eat with me for a while?

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,079
I still have to make things
clear with you.

123
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:47,680
Right now, I...

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
You're my sister-in-law now.

125
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
I know.

126
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:51,879
Don't worry.

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I won't do those childish things again.

128
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,319
That's good.

129
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,399
Shiqi made quite a few dishes.

130
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,800
She said they're all your favorites.

131
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Try them while they're warm.

132
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,279
Yunyun.

133
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,519
Mm?

134
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,879
Those three words,

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,279
I should've said them to you long ago.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,079
All this time,

138
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,759
I was only focused on
hating you and getting revenge.

139
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,600
I never once stood in your place

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
or thought for you.

141
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,600
I never even sat down
to speak calmly with you.

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,639
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,199
It's not too late for you
to understand now.

144
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,199
When my mom got into trouble,

145
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,360
I began to understand a little.

146
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,720
After your father passed away,

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
you must have felt the same way.

148
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,600
You must have been
terrified and helpless.

149
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,600
And I was studying abroad at that time,

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,279
knowing nothing,

151
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,000
unable to help you.

152
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,920
How could I still blame you
for marrying my brother?

153
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,160
You must have
had your reasons back then.

154
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,399
If everything could start over,

155
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,600
I'd never go abroad.

156
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,959
I'd choose to stay by your side

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
and go through all of this with you.

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,120
(If the original Fu Yunyun
could hear what you're saying,)

159
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,320
(she would be very happy.)

160
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
(It's just a pity...)

161
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,840
It's okay.

162
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,000
Fu Yunyun has already forgiven you.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
She also said,

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,799
she wishes you a speedy recovery.

165
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,720
Alright now,

166
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
eat while it's hot.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Does it taste good?

168
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,559
(Yunyun,)

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
