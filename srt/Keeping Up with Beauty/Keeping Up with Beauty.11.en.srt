=Episode 11=

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,880
After all, General isn't the real Fu Yunyun.

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,320
There's no need to stay at the Gu family,

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,719
wasting time with those two brothers.

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,319
It's better to divorce Gu Chenyu early.

18
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,760
- I'll help you find a place to live.
-  Yunyun.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,560
Gu Chenyu.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,079
Why are you here?

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,599
You're a celebrity.

22
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,519
Someone took photos of you
and posted them online.

23
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,640
I'll take you home.

24
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,560
Sorry.

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,000
I…

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,239
It was my oversight.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
It's not your fault.

28
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,480
Next time, you can come directly
to the Gu family to find me.

29
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,200
That way, no one can
secretly take photos of you.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,480
I…

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,280
Sure.

32
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,480
Anyway, today we have
Mr. Gu protecting us.

33
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,359
Let's just finish this meal properly.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,599
Mr. Gu,

35
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,680
you won't be stingy, right?

36
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,079
Sure.

37
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,920
I haven't eaten yet anyway.

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,599
Let's eat.

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm curious.

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,519
When did you guys first meet?

41
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,959
That was a long time ago.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm afraid telling you might scare you.

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,359
Yes.

44
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,000
Muyan is an old friend
I haven't seen for years.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,080
After a long time apart,

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
we had so much to say to each other.

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,919
Mr. Gu,

48
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,560
could you give us some space?

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,439
The wound hurts again?

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
But I haven't eaten yet.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm really hungry.

52
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,560
So,

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,479
what do you want to eat?

54
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,360
I'll help you.

55
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,919
This one.

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,759
Okay.

57
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,479
And this one.

58
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,319
Okay.

59
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,280
Eat slowly, don't choke.

60
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,479
Yunyun.

61
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,400
I've found a solution.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,639
Within three days,

63
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,680
I will become the head of the Gu family.

64
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
What solution?

65
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,240
There are outsiders here.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,159
Let's talk at home.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,479
Then

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
congratulations in advance, Mr. Gu.

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,400
(What are they doing?)

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,599
(Green tea guy.)

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,319
(Cunning dog.)

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,919
I just discharged.

73
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,960
Cannot drink.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,759
What are you thinking?

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,000
You seem distracted.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,360
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land

77
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,399
always brings back memories of the past.

78
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,759
Do you guys

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,439
have a past together?

80
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,560
Yes.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,399
We once fought side by side,

82
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,600
through life and death.

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,879
Those past days

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
are unforgettable for me.

85
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,639
Fighting side by side,
through life and death.

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,879
We also have that.

87
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,879
This time I was kidnapped,

88
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,439
you risked everything to save me.

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
I will always remember this favor.

90
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,879
So you mean

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,839
you took that blow for me

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,959
to repay my debt?

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,759
I…

94
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,360
I didn't think that far at the time.

95
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,079
I just wanted to protect you.

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,399
Yunyun.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,319
I used to think I knew you very well.

98
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,199
But actually,

99
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,800
there are many things I don't know.

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,279
I regret it.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,600
I can't be part of your past anymore.

102
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,199
But from now on, everything you do,

103
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,439
every decision you want to make,

104
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,879
I'm willing to be with you.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,959
I…

106
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,959
I think I'm a little drunk.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
I now own 37% of the group's shares,

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,600
1% more than you,

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,439
still the largest shareholder
of the group.

110
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
(Gu Group Share Transfer Agreement)

111
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,460
(Transferee: Gu Chenyu)

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,879
So,

113
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,360
you've been buying up
these scattered shares all along.

114
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,800
But,

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,279
I am the CEO approved by the board,

116
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,279
my one-year term has already begun.

117
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,800
Chenyu,

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,639
although

119
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,519
you are now the largest shareholder,

120
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
still,

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,199
I might have to trouble you

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
to try and secure next year.

123
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,959
If you resign voluntarily,

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,639
the board will appoint a new CEO.

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560
Why should I resign?

126
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,279
The last time I was kidnapped,

127
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,279
was done by your mother,
Bai Lanxing, right?

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,360
The evidence is all on this drive.

129
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,040
I can give it to the police,

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
or I can give it to you.

131
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,199
If you act voluntarily,

132
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,079
give up the head of the family position,

133
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,399
I can let her go.

134
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,399
Everything would be settled.

135
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,959
You're threatening me.

136
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,160
I've already made it very clear.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,639
The choice is yours.

138
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,559
I won't just give up like that.

139
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,000
A little souvenir.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,720
Miss,

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
the hotel restaurant
has a new menu recently.

142
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
All the dishes you liked
since childhood.

143
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,759
Lamb rolls just flown in
from Inner Mongolia,

144
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,679
and seafood just caught today.

145
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,720
You must try them.

146
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,279
Uncle Wang,

147
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,200
since you returned as vice president,

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,759
the business and atmosphere
at Jiangxing have improved a lot.

149
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,000
Jiangxing is finally back on track.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,080
We also have to thank you, Miss.

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,200
If you want to thank anyone,

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
thank Gu Chenyu.

153
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,399
He drove away Mr. Liu

154
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,519
and returned Jiangxing
to your management,

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,039
and saved the jobs of so many
long-time employees.

156
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,200
Thank him?

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,320
Who knows if he suddenly
had a conscience

158
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
or had ulterior motives?

159
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Uncle Wang,

160
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,679
there's currently no evidence linking

161
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,360
my dad's matter to Gu Chenyu.

162
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,600
Everything is just our speculation.

163
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Maybe we should be a bit less
biased against him.

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,440
But...

165
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,480
Miss.

166
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
You look much healthier now.

167
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,600
Have you adapted to the security work?

168
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,080
Completely adapted.

169
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
Thanks to Mr. Gu
for forgiving my mistakes

170
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,759
and giving me this chance.

171
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,600
Is Mr. Gu's arm better now?

172
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,600
Earlier,

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,879
I misunderstood him.

174
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,600
Miss,

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,080
when you see him,

176
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,200
please apologize on my behalf.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,279
Thank him properly for me.

178
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,279
Mr. Gu

179
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,480
is really a good person.

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,080
Don't worry, Miss.

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,600
From now on,

182
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll work diligently here.

183
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,879
I'll treat Jiangxing as my own home.

184
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,480
Good.

185
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,799
I'll be leaving now.

186
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,039
You go ahead.

187
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,279
Take care of yourself.

188
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,080
Okay.

189
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Miss,

190
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,039
I'm temporarily retracting
my judgment of Gu Chenyu.

191
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:27,679
But,

192
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,679
if he harms Jiangxing,

193
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,519
or harms you,

194
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,480
I will never let him go.

195
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,519
Rest assured.

196
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,440
Also,

197
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,919
I will continue to investigate
my dad's matter.

198
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,279
What you need to do now

199
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,759
is to manage Jiangxing well.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,919
Jiangxing is my dad's lifetime effort.

201
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,639
We

202
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,559
must preserve this prestigious brand.

203
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,200
Okay.

204
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,360
But Miss,

205
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,559
Gu Chenyu is now the head
of the Gu family.

206
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,240
So many eyes are on him outside.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,639
What exactly is your relationship
with him now?
