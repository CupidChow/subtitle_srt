1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,641
Is Yun-ho inside?

3
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,437
JAE-GYEONG GOES
TO YUN-HO'S HOUSE

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,397
Do you remember when we went
to Lee Myeong-guk's house?

5
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,815
Someone threw Molotov cocktails.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,568
-The person who did that was Yun-ho.
-Why would Yun-ho do that?

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,570
Whoever moved Lee Myeong-guk's body
back into the house

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,906
probably told Yun-ho,

9
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,407
"You killed and buried Lee Myeong-guk,

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,826
but I dug him up
and put him back in his house."

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,412
He was at the house
to destroy Lee Myeong-guk's body.

12
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,457
Captain Jang, you stay there
while we go arrest Jung Yun-ho.

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,375
Have the other detectives
gone to get Yun-ho?

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,711
SI-JEONG'S INTERFERENCE
ALLOWS YUN-HO TO ESCAPE

15
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,380
You have to run.
The detectives are on their way there.

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,965
Don't you dare get arrested!

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,093
Yun-jin, what does
this Chinese character mean?

18
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,639
This is it.
Pil is also used in "Pilo-dong."

19
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,099
I think the word for "discuss"
refers to Sang-ui.

20
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,184
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

21
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,102
I checked on my way here.

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,605
KH Pharmaceutical
owns Yeongryun Cold Storage.

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,149
I didn't see anything when we were there.

24
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,027
I already knew most of this,
but there's one strange thing.

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,237
What is it?

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,864
My husband signed up
for a retirement annuity 11 years ago.

27
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,451
I found out an old woman in Boryeong
was receiving the pension payments.

28
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,577
Yun-jin!

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,664
Happy birthday

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,916
To you

31
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,002
Is today your birthday, Ms. Oh?

32
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,671
What's this number?

33
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,965
It's nothing.
I've used it for a long time.

34
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,425
Shall we use this number from now on?

35
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,510
THE PASSWORD THEY'D BEEN USING

36
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,388
WAS YUN-JIN'S BIRTHDAY

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,681
What's this text?

38
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,432
YUN-JIN MEETS WITH TAE-JIN
AFTER FINDING OUT THE PASSWORD

39
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,268
I'll put in the password myself.

40
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,272
If you transfer half of the money
into an account that I designate,

41
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,523
I'll give you the originals

42
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,358
of these photos and recordings.

43
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,529
YUN-JIN ENTERS THE PASSWORD

44
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:39,492
IN EXCHANGE
FOR HALF OF THE MONEY

45
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh Yun-jin!

46
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,790
TAE-JIN BECOMES FURIOUS
AND ATTACKS YUN-JIN

47
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,542
Just die!

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:53,673
RIGHT THEN, JOO-SONG APPEARS
AND SAVES YUN-JIN

49
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,175
The guy is here. Please come right now.

50
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,385
THE HEARING AID STORE OWNER
CONTACTS JAE-GYEONG

51
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,262
HE THEN FOLLOWS
CEO YOON'S SUBORDINATE

52
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,763
TO AN OLD SHOPPING COMPLEX

53
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,141
JAE-GYEONG SEES CHANG-SU
WALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM

54
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,393
Kim Chang-su! What are you doing here?

55
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,103
AS JAE-GYEONG EXPRESSES SURPRISE
AT SEEING CHANG-SU,

56
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,688
THEY HEAR A GUNSHOT

57
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,814
THE TWO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE

58
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,857
Hey.

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,859
JAE-GYEONG RECOGNIZES
THE SECRET ROOM

60
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,152
WHERE HE BECAME ADDICTED

61
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,363
Do you know Park Jun-seo?
Did Park Tae-jin order you?

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,491
Tell me. Did you get me addicted?

63
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,785
I'll return to the station
with CEO Yoon's guy.

64
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,537
If you swear on your life to keep quiet

65
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,414
about seeing me that last time,

66
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,374
I'll have your jail time reduced.

67
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,335
What's wrong with cops these days?

68
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,754
One guy is an addict and the other is--

69
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,339
Shut your mouth!

70
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,886
CHANG-SU DRIVES INTO THE RIVER
IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL GI-SEONG

71
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,388
CHANG-SU DRIVES INTO THE RIVER
IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL GI-SEONG

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,391
-Chang-su!
-This is my fault.

73
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,935
I thought I could escort him back alone.

74
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,187
JAE-GYEONG GROWS SUSPICIOUS

75
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,772
HE EXAMINES THE SCENE

76
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,148
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

77
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,692
Did anyone lower the driver side window?

78
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,736
No, we just pulled the car out.

79
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,780
The window was down
when the car hit the water?

80
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,948
In this weather?

81
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,532
Then did Chang-su…

82
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,674
RECENT CALLS

83
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,929
GONG JIN-UK

84
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,810
Hello?

85
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,561
Doctor, it's me.

86
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
-Did something happen?
-Well…

87
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,357
I killed

88
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,401
CEO Yoon today.

89
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,027
What?

90
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,322
So you won't be able to sell drugs
in the country for the time being.

91
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,366
And you'll have difficulty
finding a replacement

92
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,285
because for now,

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,204
nobody will come forward to sell drugs.

94
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,792
I have connections in China,
so I'll go there.

95
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
So please

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,547
continue to deal with me.

97
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,257
In exchange…

98
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,094
please get me on a ship to China.

99
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:04,887
Mr. Gong Jin-uk.

100
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm not asking for free passage.

101
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,933
I'm sending you two items
through a subway courier.

102
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,312
I trust you'll find those items
worth your while.

103
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,147
That's

104
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,441
all I have right now.

105
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,036
288M 7131

106
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,296
Please leave the goods in the back seat.
The delivery fee is in the envelope.

107
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,422
Yes, sir.

108
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,597
But this is so much.

109
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,384
So they couldn't access the account?

110
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,221
I think so. Tae-jin should be okay, right?

111
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,057
Jeez, I don't know where
I got the guts to do that.

112
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,935
But Yun-jin was in so much danger…

113
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,354
How did you know
that Yun-jin knew the password?

114
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,689
Back at your place,

115
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,233
when Ms. Choi was vomiting
in the bathroom,

116
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,529
Yun-jin unlocked
Ms. Choi's phone with the password.

117
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,532
So that's why Choi Ji-yeon
met up with Park Tae-jin

118
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,700
right after leaving my place

119
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,202
and asked about
Jun-seo and Yun-jin's relationship.

120
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,083
She must be in complete shock.

121
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,251
What did the doctor say?

122
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,504
She might be like this for a while,
so we should keep an eye on her.

123
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,340
-Does she have to get admitted?
-No.

124
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,675
Oh Yun-jin!

125
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,514
Just die!

126
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,778
Sir, shouldn't you go to the hospital?

127
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,491
Please delete

128
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,367
this CCTV footage.

129
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,911
Excuse me?

130
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,872
I said delete everything.

131
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,415
Delete it?

132
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,666
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,261
One, two, three,

134
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,846
four…

135
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,516
Eight.

136
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,075
Open up.

137
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,498
Try chewing.

138
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,458
Does it taste okay?

139
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,920
Good girl.

140
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,054
Here. Open wide.

141
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,100
It's okay.

142
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,186
That was too big, I guess.

143
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,397
It's hard to open your mouth.

144
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,441
I'll have to give you smaller bites then.

145
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,533
I know you're embarrassed,

146
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,702
but I have a lot of questions,
so drop the act.

147
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,913
Get up by the time I count to three,
or else I'll pull out your chair.

148
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,415
One, two…

149
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,125
What is it?

150
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,835
What is it? The restroom?

151
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,378
You want to go to the restroom?

152
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,343
Go ahead.

153
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,098
-Hey, Joo-song.
-Yes?

154
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,558
Next time,

155
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,436
pour some radish kimchi juice in too.

156
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,439
How could you just feed me

157
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,816
plain rice and bland soup?

158
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,735
Yun-jin, are you all right?

159
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,945
Can't you tell?

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,824
I just pulled something in my neck.

161
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,118
Was that all an act then?

162
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,202
Hey!

163
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,539
Do you know how worried I was?

164
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,665
I was embarrassed.

165
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,127
I did it because I was embarrassed.

166
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,211
Sorry.

167
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,797
Joo-song already filled me in.

168
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,051
Tell me about the password.
It's not for a bank account.

169
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,471
I think it's for a Bitcoin account.

170
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,681
Maybe in Thailand?

171
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,183
Did you check the site?

172
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,601
Yes.

173
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,606
Those guys are funny.

174
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,942
The password is eight digits long.

175
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,944
Park Tae-jin set up the first four digits,

176
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,989
and I guess Park Jun-seo
set up the last four digits.

177
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,408
They definitely didn't trust each other.

178
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,828
Does this mean Park Tae-jin
didn't kill Park Jun-seo?

179
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,873
Why would he kill him
without finding out the password?

180
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,583
Park Tae-jin likely thought

181
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,711
he could get the password
from Choi Ji-yeon.

182
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,840
Too bad, though.

183
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,968
There's really no way
to figure out that password.

184
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,012
And there's only one attempt left.

185
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,931
That money

186
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:27,311
might be from the drug business
Park Tae-jin and Park Jun-seo ran.

187
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,607
Yet you were still willing
to make a deal with Park Tae-jin?

188
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,068
I know.

189
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,030
That's why I regret it.

190
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,242
I know you're mad at me,

191
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:45,121
but can you at least let me finish eating
before you scold me?

192
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,877
Thanks. I'm really hungry.

193
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,506
Someone named Doctor keeps coming up
in the lemon pop investigation.

194
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,051
He's the lemon pop manufacturer.
Remember Lee Myeong-guk's work logs?

195
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,930
Lee Myeong-guk
regularly met with Jung Sang-ui

196
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,765
at the Pilo-dong lab and did something.

197
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,394
Are you saying they were making lemon pop?

198
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,355
At first, they probably made
small batches just for Jong-soo.

199
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,440
So…

200
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,026
Lee Myeong-guk made it,
Park Jun-seo delivered it,

201
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,278
and Won Jong-soo took it?

202
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,864
I can follow things up to this point.

203
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,032
But…

204
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,203
Park Tae-jin isn't a part of this picture.
Where did he come from?

205
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,039
The drug was made,
delivered, and consumed.

206
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,958
Where's Park Tae-jin in this picture?

207
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,378
And why did Jun-seo
suddenly go from delivering drugs

208
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,547
to starting a drug business with Tae-jin?

209
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,884
Hey, you're pretty sharp.

210
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,385
Yes, well…

211
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,763
Park Tae-jin had his position to consider,

212
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,475
so he would've made sure
to stay behind the scenes.

213
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,852
He would've used Jun-seo instead.

214
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,687
But Jun-seo felt uneasy,

215
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,648
so he thought knowing
the last four digits of the password

216
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,068
would keep Park Tae-jin in check.

217
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,863
But Jun-seo is dead now.

218
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,157
Jun-seo isn't here anymore,

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,451
so who's delivering Won Jong-soo's drugs,

220
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,873
and who's running the lemon pop business
in Park Tae-jin's place?

221
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,070
You're here.

222
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,697
XINOPAM

223
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,199
Thanks.

224
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,867
Sure.

225
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,306
KEY WORD SEARCH: JANG JAE-GYEONG

226
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,482
What brings you here at this hour?

227
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,987
I have to ask you something.

228
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,457
I met with Oh Yun-jin last night.

229
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,669
Why do you think I met up with her?

230
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,631
I'm not sure.

231
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,257
Did you know?

232
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,844
Did you know Yun-jin

233
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,680
knew the password too?

234
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,519
Was that it?

235
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,897
Was that…

236
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,942
Was that the password?

237
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,847
Tae-jin?

238
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,225
Tae-jin!

239
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,182
JUNG SANG-UI

240
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,312
What is it?

241
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,981
Can you talk right now?

242
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,525
What is it? Tell me.

243
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,404
-Something serious happened.
-Something serious?

244
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,365
Gong Jin-uk used to deal
with someone named CEO Yoon--

245
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,450
You damn idiot!

246
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,994
Why don't you ever listen?

247
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,788
I told you not to call me about this!

248
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,125
You're right. I'm sorry.

249
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,962
Sang-ui.

250
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,507
When will you stop acting like a dimwit?

251
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,844
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

252
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,638
Hey, where should we meet?

253
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,848
Shall I go to you?

254
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,816
Meet me at Myeongeul Garden
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

255
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,986
We had dinner there last month, remember?

256
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,613
Okay, I got it.

257
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,883
IGU GROUP
HAN SEONG-HUN

258
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,552
How did it go?

259
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,474
Are you serious?

260
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,980
Okay. Thanks.

261
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
What is it?

262
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,955
Did they pass the motion?

263
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,709
Igu Group…

264
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,715
pledged 500 billion won.

265
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,968
You scared me.

266
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,804
We did it, you bastard!

267
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,601
We did it.

268
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,354
Once Mayor Joo In-sang
gives us the permit,

269
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,148
this will all be ours, Chi-hyeon.

270
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,400
Of course.

271
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,444
And Joo In-sang won't have
any reason to oppose us now.

272
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,573
Thanks for everything.

273
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,040
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

274
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,460
Really?

275
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,046
That's great.

276
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,175
Congratulations.

277
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,970
Of course, I'll be there.

278
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,472
See you later.

279
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,349
Bye.

280
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,497
Take a seat.

281
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,296
This is unexpected. What brings you here?

282
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,091
I didn't think you'd give
a reference statement.

283
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,801
What?

284
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,308
This is your number, right?

285
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
So?

286
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,191
This is the call record of the pay phone
Jung Yun-ho used two nights ago.

287
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,693
Why did Yun-ho call you?

288
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,695
What do you think?

289
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,197
Park Tae-jin.

290
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,241
I'm asking out of curiosity.

291
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,786
My high school friend
is currently wanted for murder.

292
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,580
He called from a pay phone late at night.

293
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,957
What do you think he said?

294
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,002
Isn't it obvious?

295
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,089
"On what grounds
did I become a murder suspect?"

296
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,591
"Can you help me out?"

297
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,134
So?

298
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,595
I told him to turn himself in.

299
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,847
Wouldn't you have done the same?

300
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,895
If Yun-ho calls you,
let me know right away.

301
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,897
Don't make me find out first
and come back here.

302
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,941
Sure thing.

303
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,025
By the way,

304
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,568
what happened last night?

305
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,862
You nearly killed Yun-jin.

306
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,866
And you already deleted
the PC room footage.

307
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,079
Did you kill Jun-seo?

308
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,965
I'm a prosecutor.

309
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,719
Shocking people into confessions

310
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,223
might work on guys like
Jung Sang-ui or Oh Chi-hyeon,

311
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,350
but you know it won't work on me.

312
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,437
I heard you found out

313
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,814
that we were there that day.

314
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,026
I bet you don't know what to think.

315
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,447
You're sure one of us did that to Jun-seo,

316
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,783
but Jun-seo happened to fall
when we were all in the elevator,

317
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,037
so you don't have
any real proof of murder, right?

318
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,082
You must've had your wheels turning.

319
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,294
But what will you do now?

320
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,422
Jun-seo didn't tell you
the password before he died.

321
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,260
Based on the size
of the lemon pop operation,

322
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,262
I'd say there's at least ten billion won.

323
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,558
What a shame to lose all that.

324
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,351
Right?

325
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,146
Are you Doctor?

326
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,318
Are you the one
who got me involved in this?

327
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,034
Get you involved?

328
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,122
Gosh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

329
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,250
Lemon pop? Doctor? What does that mean?

330
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,753
Of course.

331
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,130
You have to deny knowing that

332
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,674
because there's a chance

333
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,719
I'm recording our conversation right now.

334
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,305
Just to let you know,

335
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,517
I have a feeling

336
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,769
I almost have you.

337
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,940
All I have to do is
reach my hand out and get you.

338
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,654
From now on, be very careful

339
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,114
when making your next move.

340
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,616
Otherwise,

341
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,953
I'll catch you.

342
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,057
KH GROUP CHAIRMAN
WON CHANG-HO

343
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Yes?

344
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,858
Have you heard?

345
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,820
It's 500 billion won.

346
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:11,658
I thought the most they'd pledge
would be maybe 200 or 300 billion won.

347
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,243
But it's 500 billion won.

348
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,079
Doesn't this mean Igu Group
believes in this project?

349
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,331
I just spoke with Chairman Han.

350
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,126
He said he looks forward
to working with us.

351
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,711
Oh, I see.

352
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,756
Now all we need is
Anhyeon Mayor's permission.

353
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,717
When will you meet with Mayor Joo?

354
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,719
We're meeting for lunch tomorrow.

355
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,638
This situation is different
from last time, so I'll bring good news.

356
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,849
-As you should.
-Yes, sir.

357
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,437
What is it, sir?

358
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,566
Are things okay with Tae-jin these days?

359
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,069
Yes, sir. Why do you ask?

360
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,031
Tae-jin said

361
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,117
he wants to take part

362
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:57,370
in the Pilo-dong project as an investor.

363
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,830
Excuse me?

364
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,710
Oh, that.

365
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,172
He mentioned it briefly before.

366
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,717
I think he knows someone with money,
so he's probably referring to them.

367
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,887
I've already confirmed this.

368
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,933
Until when are you going to
rely on Tae-jin?

369
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,646
You should've anticipated this
and taken care of it.

370
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,694
I warned him to stay put in his job,

371
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,697
but he already seemed too eager.

372
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,285
For now, don't let on
that you know about this

373
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,080
and put a tail on him.

374
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,958
Yes, sir.

375
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,337
Should I step out for a minute?

376
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
Yes, thank you. I'm sorry about this.

377
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,679
FRAGRANT EXPRESS DELIVERY

378
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,556
Did you catch all those guys, sir?

379
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,517
Thanks to you, yes.

380
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,604
We unfortunately lost the main leader
but got everyone else.

381
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,981
Oh…

382
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,899
I see.

383
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,696
If you have anything to say,
please go ahead.

384
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,743
-Have you ever stowed away on a ship?
-Yes, when I was young.

385
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,995
-To where?
-China.

386
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,540
-You're in contact the brokers, right?
-I've lost touch with them.

387
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,501
-It's been too long.
-You must know those who are, though.

388
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:29,879
Sir.

389
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,342
People switch jobs often
in this line of work.

390
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,262
All the guys I used to know

391
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,807
are either in prison or dead.

392
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,809
I still need you to look into it.

393
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,112
I should've lived an honest life
from the start.

394
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,115
Trying to start right now

395
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,742
is too hard.

396
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,493
I know.

397
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,463
Jeez, you're a scary guy.

398
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,510
-Yeong-eun!
-Mom?

399
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,429
How did you get here?

400
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,389
I thought the police wouldn't let you out.

401
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,183
I snuck out, of course.

402
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,227
I went to see your dad.

403
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,312
Mom!

404
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,605
He's doing well.

405
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,024
What if you get caught on the way home?

406
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,777
That's why I waited for you to come.

407
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,654
I won't get in trouble
if I go home with my daughter.

408
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,533
Do you see anyone?

409
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,994
No.

410
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,496
Good. Let's go.

411
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,123
What do you want for dinner?

412
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,084
I'm not sure.

413
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,087
Ms. Kang Si-jeong.

414
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,672
Where have you been?

415
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,175
I went to pick up my daughter.

416
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,052
Isn't it obvious?

417
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,598
You'll have to come with us.

418
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,479
-Good work today.
-You too.

419
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,190
Hey, you didn't do much to feel tired.

420
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,775
What do you mean?

421
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,652
-I'm tired from earning my keep today.
-Jeez.

422
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,793
I don't understand it either.

423
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,839
I don't know why Jun-seo
used my birthday as his password.

424
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,467
We briefly dated in high school…

425
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,347
You can't even call it dating
by today's standards.

426
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,020
I wouldn't feel good about this either…

427
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,316
if I were in your shoes, Ms. Choi.

428
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,277
I understand how you feel, but--

429
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,154
You're right. I was offended.

430
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,698
But after I got home,

431
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,994
I realized it was
just an excuse I made for myself.

432
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,582
To be honest,
during our seven years of marriage,

433
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,752
even though Yun-hui was sick

434
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,088
since the day she was born,

435
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,382
I was still happy.

436
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,179
Then Yun-hui died and…

437
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,349
I was lonely.

438
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,812
That's when Tae-jin approached me.

439
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,567
I was tempted for just a second,

440
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,778
but I thought it would pass.

441
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,574
Then it just happened.

442
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,619
Before Jun-seo died…

443
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,333
Did he know about you and Tae-jin?

444
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,462
Yes.

445
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,346
FEBRUARY 13TH, 2024

446
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,545
You're still awake?

447
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,339
You should've gone to bed first.

448
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,017
I'm going to bed.

449
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,102
Ji-yeon.

450
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,607
When did it start?

451
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,193
What?

452
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,612
Did it start…

453
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,116
before Yun-hui died?

454
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,243
Or afterward?

455
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,123
Does it matter?

456
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,712
I'm sorry.

457
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,300
I don't think it's that important.

458
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,912
When was that?

459
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,957
About ten days before my husband died.

460
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,674
Tae-jin came to see me this morning.

461
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,512
When he found out my password
was the same as yours,

462
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,264
he left and never looked back.

463
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,477
After Yun-hui and my husband died,

464
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,272
I was afraid that Tae-jin
would also leave me.

465
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,904
"If I tell him the password,

466
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,448
how will he react?"

467
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,452
"What if he leaves me?"

468
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,665
"How can I live on my own if he does?"

469
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,959
"I see."

470
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,672
"So this is what happens."

471
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,927
"This is what it's supposed to be."

472
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,974
That's what I thought.

473
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,485
Captain.

474
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,203
Kang Si-jeong's most recent call
was made near Inju-dong.

475
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,580
It was made to a burner phone.

476
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,166
Can you trace the number?

477
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,251
Yes, sir.

478
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,461
Should I go in?

479
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,634
No, I'll go.

480
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,859
How's Yun-ho doing?

481
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,407
You were near Inju-dong this morning.

482
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,491
Is that where he is?

483
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,578
Si-jeong.

484
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,415
Yun-ho's dangerous.

485
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,334
We don't know who he'll hurt next.

486
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,754
He has to turn himself in.

487
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,591
Jong-soo, Tae-jin, and Chi-hyeon

488
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,718
have no intention of helping Yun-ho.

489
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,555
You're making a mistake

490
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,848
if you expect them to help.

491
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,064
At this point,
the only one who can save him…

492
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,651
is you.

493
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,623
He didn't even ask.

494
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,377
He didn't ask how
the kids and I were doing…

495
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,548
or if we were scared

496
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,551
or how I found out where he was.

497
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,346
He didn't ask any of that.

498
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,973
All he asked

499
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,310
was whether Chi-hyeon had called

500
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,688
and why I'm just sitting around
doing nothing.

501
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,110
He asked why I stayed at home
instead of going to Jong-soo or Tae-jin.

502
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,529
That's all he said.

503
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,658
I got upset,

504
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,537
so I asked if he cared at all
about me and the kids.

505
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,416
He said Tae-jin and Jong-soo
won't abandon him this time

506
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,584
and told me not to worry.

507
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,548
Idiot.

508
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,678
If they were going to save him,
they wouldn't have let it get this far.

509
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,932
Do you know why Yun-ho went to prison
after killing someone?

510
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,144
It was because of Won Jong-soo.

511
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,480
I went to him so many times

512
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,399
and begged and pleaded

513
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,318
for him to help.

514
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,615
Jun-seo and Chi-hyeon were the only ones
that visited Yun-ho in prison.

515
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,954
Do you think…

516
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,416
you can bring back Yun-ho

517
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,169
safely and in one piece?

518
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,046
Can you promise me that?

519
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,224
He's at Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

520
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,232
Pilo-dong murder suspect, Jung Yun-ho,

521
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,234
is hiding out at Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

522
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,903
We request assistance.

523
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,285
The kids are alone at home, right?

524
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,873
I'll call someone to take you there.

525
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,972
PINE MOTEL

526
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,564
He checked out two hours ago.

527
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
Did you ping his cell phone?

528
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,400
The signal is nearby.

529
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,486
He's probably changing motels.

530
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,695
Send Jung Yun-ho's description

531
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,239
-to the precinct officers.
-Okay.

532
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,658
Let's start canvassing nearby motels.

533
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,743
-Move.
-I'll go this way.

534
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,128
The suspect is in a nearby motel,
so please look thoroughly.

535
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,321
Hello. This is the police.

536
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,324
-We won't go inside.
-Okay.

537
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,410
-We'll be quick.
-Okay.

538
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,039
I'm sorry about this.

539
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,422
A1 MOTEL

540
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,904
Hey, Sang-ui. Come on in.

541
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,239
Sang-ui, you're here.

542
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,700
You're wearing a coat.

543
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,910
It looks great on you.

544
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,832
I wanted to have a drink
with everyone who worked so hard

545
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,293
because I got good news today.

546
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,879
Sang-ui, you must've been
so busy researching,

547
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,714
making drugs,

548
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,550
and now delivering those drugs.

549
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,885
Yes.

550
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,470
Take a seat.

551
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,930
I didn't tell him to sit.

552
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,939
Sang-ui.

553
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,317
Did you meet with Jae-gyeong?

554
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,238
Yes.

555
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,574
I knew it was you.

556
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,535
You told Jae-gyeong

557
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,998
we were all there
on the day Jun-seo died, didn't you?

558
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,708
Right, I just--

559
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,013
It's okay. Good job.

560
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,643
But from now on,
you need to watch what you say.

561
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,648
When Jae-gyeong heard that,
he came to me and acted all mighty.

562
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,776
I'm sorry.

563
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,740
I don't want to be put
in that situation again,

564
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,118
so be more careful from now on.

565
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,870
Especially you.

566
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,498
From now on,

567
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,418
if Jae-gyeong says anything to you,
you need to talk back.

568
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,963
I have your back,
so what's there to worry about?

569
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,714
Right.

570
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,268
Hey, Prosecutor Park. Welcome.

571
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,857
Prosecutor Park Tae-jin,
our hidden power player.

572
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,277
Thanks for the hard work
you put into planning this.

573
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,448
I don't mean to rain on your parade,
but when will you see Mayor Joo?

574
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,491
You really are raining on my parade.

575
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,829
That bastard, Joo In-sang,
is a taboo subject at our house.

576
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,125
I'm meeting him for lunch tomorrow
with Vice President Han.

577
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,086
It'll be different this time.

578
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,171
Of course.

579
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,923
How about a toast?

580
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,511
Here's to the success

581
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,056
of the Pilo-dong project. Cheers!

582
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,933
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

583
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,483
I know I'm bringing us down,

584
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,651
but we need to talk privately.

585
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,240
Sang-ui, step out for a minute.

586
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,325
Okay.

587
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,624
NEW RECORDING

588
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,334
What is it?

589
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,920
I met with Jung Yun-ho yesterday.

590
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,339
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

591
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,885
We met at a quiet spot,
and I gave him some cash.

592
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,763
I told him to lay low
until things blew over.

593
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,308
Jang Jae-gyeong came to see me yesterday.

594
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,522
That jerk's loving this, isn't he?

595
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,941
He came to see me this afternoon.

596
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,277
What did he say to you?

597
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,696
What do you think?

598
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,366
So what about Jung Yun-ho?

599
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,329
The police have already identified
Jung Yun-ho as the murder suspect

600
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,164
of Lee Myeong-guk and the rice mill owner.

601
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,917
They've already secured his car
and CCTV footage as evidence.

602
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,252
The problem is

603
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,629
if the police look into

604
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,799
why he killed Lee Myeong-guk,

605
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,509
where he kept the frozen body,

606
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,636
and why he killed the rice mill owner

607
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,763
and burned the CCTV server,

608
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,349
all of you will end up

609
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:42,893
becoming suspects.

610
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,028
Just get to the point.
What should we do about this?

611
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,489
Jung Yun-ho.

612
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,535
We can't let him be.

613
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,538
What do you mean?

614
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,000
Are you saying we should kill him?

615
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,215
Hey, Park Tae-jin.

616
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,634
Is there any alternative?

617
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,763
I'm exhausted now.

618
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,100
Even if we stick together,
it'll be hard to pull this off.

619
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,186
But all you do is screw up,

620
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,273
and I end up cleaning up the messes.

621
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,443
What more am I supposed to do?

622
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,863
Look, this still isn't right.

623
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:39,575
Why do you think we've come this far?

624
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,702
It was for all of our good, right?

625
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,537
-But to kill Yun-ho--
-Hey.

626
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,372
You have no right to talk.

627
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,834
Why did you kill Lee Myeong-guk?

628
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,462
Hey, that was--

629
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,088
Don't use Jung Yun-ho as an excuse.

630
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,092
You never once told us
that Lee Myeong-guk had threatened you.

631
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,888
You made a mess without thinking,
but we should be understanding

632
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,598
because you did it for us. Is that it?

633
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,433
Oh Chi-hyeon.

634
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,144
Do you know
how many times you've done this?

635
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,692
Did you use this opportunity
to get rid of Lee Myeong-guk

636
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,277
because you did something shady?

637
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,488
What? "Something shady"?

638
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,614
For all we know,

639
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,450
you could've siphoned off
Jong-soo's drugs.

640
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,787
Hey, what are you doing?

641
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,580
What? Say that again.

642
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,748
Hey, Oh Chi-hyeon!

643
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,875
If we put this off,
it'll be the end for us.

644
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,294
If the police find him
before we do, it's over!

645
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,256
-Jong-soo.
-Jong-soo, this isn't right.

646
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,508
What do you mean?

647
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,593
If this continues, it'll be over for us!

648
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,555
Won Jong-soo.

649
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,478
Let's think about it more.

650
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,481
-Jong-soo!
-Stop calling my name!

651
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,899
What do you expect me to do?

652
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,112
Why do you always offer
just one option and tell me to decide?

653
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,656
If you've already decided on an answer
then ask me to decide,

654
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,282
isn't that just an order?

655
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,452
That's the problem with you.

656
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,375
Just wait for now.

657
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,794
And see what the police are up to.

658
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,839
If it really comes down to it,

659
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,465
we'll decide then.

660
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,057
Damn it.

661
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,634
YOU HAVE ONE NEW VOICEMAIL

662
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,721
NO CALLER ID

663
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,266
The police have already identified
Jung Yun-ho

664
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,643
as the murder suspect
of Lee Myeong-guk and the rice mill owner.

665
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,897
If the police look into

666
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,441
why he killed Lee Myeong-guk,

667
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,984
where he kept the frozen body,

668
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,028
and why he killed the rice mill owner

669
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,530
and burned the CCTV server,

670
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,907
all of you will end up

671
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,366
becoming suspects.

672
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,743
Jung Yun-ho.

673
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,244
We can't let him be.

674
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,247
Is there any alternative?

675
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,210
NEW TEXT MESSAGE

676
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,090
Evidence that Park Tae-jin killed Jun-seo

677
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,218
is with the woman
living in Jun-seo's house.

678
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,100
Hello, Oh Su-hyeon speaking.

679
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,186
Is that so? Which direction?

680
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,897
Past Namho-dong and toward New City?

681
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,233
We just caught Jung Yun-ho's phone signal.

682
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,068
He's on the move
from Namho-dong to New City.

683
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,236
We should go, sir.

684
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,684
Hello?

685
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,727
It's me.

686
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,980
Jung Yun-ho, where are you right now?

687
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,440
Were you with Park Tae-jin
when he said he wanted to kill me?

688
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,733
What?

689
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,068
You were with him, right?

690
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,737
Drop the act.
I knew he was talking to you.

691
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,490
How did you know?

692
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,158
Was Jong-soo there too?

693
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,035
Never mind.

694
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,163
Park Tae-jin probably tricked
Jong-soo again.

695
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,790
Hey, Yun-ho…

696
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,625
You bastard.

697
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,377
Are you really my friend?

698
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,672
What kind of friend are you?
It was all Park Tae-jin!

699
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,924
-What?
-You damn idiots,

700
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,509
Park Tae-jin was behind all this!

701
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,263
I caught Park Tae-jin
having an affair with Jun-seo's wife.

702
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,140
That's why he's trying to kill me.

703
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,684
You damn idiots.

704
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:19,313
Park Tae-jin has played you all your life,
yet you still don't know anything.

705
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,607
Hey, Yun-ho. Calm down for a second.

706
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,775
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come and get you.

707
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,278
Why? So you can kill me?

708
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,156
Forget it, you crazy bastard.

709
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,074
Yun-ho.

710
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
I'll prove everything.

711
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,410
Okay?

712
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,538
I'll prove Park Tae-jin killed Jun-seo

713
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,458
even if it means
I have to kill that bitch.

714
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,501
Hey, Jung Yun-ho.

715
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,794
Hey, Oh Chi-hyeon.

716
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,088
Relay the mighty Park Tae-jin
a message for me.

717
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,049
I won't take the fall for this.

718
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,510
We either all go down

719
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,055
or we all make it out alive, okay?

720
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,681
Jung Yun-ho!

721
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,892
Stop calling out my name, damn it.

722
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,160
Yes?

723
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,913
The signal dropped near Oeseong-dong.

724
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,165
I just texted you the location.

725
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,379
Oeseong-dong?

726
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,300
Nine Apartments in Oeseong-dong. Go now!

727
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,864
What brings you here at this hour?

728
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,574
Hello, Ms. Choi.

729
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,413
I have something
to tell you about Jun-seo.

730
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,749
Just a moment.

731
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,587
SENIOR INSPECTOR
JANG JAE-GYEONG

732
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,674
Hello.

733
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,262
Hello.

734
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,642
Come on, people. Move.

735
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,405
What did you want to tell me
about my husband?

736
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,627
Do you miss Jun-seo?

737
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,797
Excuse me?

738
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,927
I miss Jun-seo.

739
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,347
When Si-jeong and I got married,

740
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,809
she became pregnant…

741
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,188
with Yeong-eun.

742
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,066
But I couldn't find a job at the time.

743
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,276
That's when

744
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,197
Jun-seo talked to Jong-soo

745
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,617
and got me a job
as a subcontractor for KH Group.

746
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,248
But one day…

747
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,045
my boss there started saying
bad things about Jong-soo.

748
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,546
I tried to hold back,

749
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,841
I couldn't take it anymore.

750
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,678
So in the heat of the moment, I hit him.

751
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,763
The thing is…

752
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,933
I ended up killing him.

753
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,561
What?

754
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,403
It's getting late now,

755
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,863
so why don't you return later…

756
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,698
When I got out of prison,

757
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,327
it felt like the guys were avoiding me.

758
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,249
But even then, Jun-seo looked after me
and found me a taxi driver job.

759
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,710
Come to think of it,

760
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,046
I think Jun-seo…

761
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,595
was a really good friend to me

762
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,139
unlike the other guys.

763
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,016
I see.

764
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,771
I get what you're saying,

765
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,940
but it's late and--

766
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,358
Why did you do it?

767
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:39,447
Why did you cheat on a kind guy
like Jun-seo with Tae-jin?

768
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,416
You and Tae-jin
killed Jun-seo, didn't you?

769
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,461
No.

770
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,589
Yes, you did.

771
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,758
I was told there was evidence
proving you and Tae-jin

772
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,635
killed Jun-seo.

773
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,345
Where is it?

774
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,808
What are you talking about?

775
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:14,733
Tae-jin's trying to make me take the fall
and wants to kill me. Ji-yeon, I…

776
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,486
I can't let that happen, right?

777
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,742
Give it to me.

778
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,431
-I'm taking the stairs.
-Go.

779
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,618
Ms. Choi.

780
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,745
Ms. Choi!

781
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,041
I'm sorry for intruding.

782
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:31,559
-Why are you calling--
-Tae-jin, what's Jun-seo's door passcode?

783
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,437
-What?
-Tell me right now. Ms. Choi is in danger.

784
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,689
What's the passcode?

785
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,233
It's 9-1-9-1.

786
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,242
Ms. Choi.

787
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,077
Ms. Choi.

788
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,745
Ms. Choi.

789
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,127
She's breathing. Call an ambulance!

790
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,632
I'm at Nine Apartments, Unit 503.
It's an emergency. Come quickly.

791
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,108
Jung Yun-ho ran down
the emergency exit stairs.

792
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,317
Requesting precinct backup.

793
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,639
I don't need this.

794
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,016
I can do it.

795
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,880
Sir, we arrested a guy
on drug possession yesterday.

796
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,508
His name was Lee Jeong-hun.
Do you remember him?

797
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,592
What about him?

798
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,846
He says he bought his drugs
from a guy named Kim Dae-seong.

799
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,389
But Kim Dae-seong

800
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:17,600
was already collared by the Narcotics Unit
and is under investigation.

801
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,311
So should we put in a request
for cooperation--

802
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,396
Hey.

803
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,400
-Bring him here.
-Excuse me?

804
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:28,403
The Narcotics Unit took all of our cases.

805
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,780
We can't just sit back, can we?

806
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,408
We'll look into this Kim Dae-seong guy

807
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,035
and create a new case out of him, got it?

808
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,590
Take it out and use your own teeth.

809
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,927
You're a handful, aren't you?

810
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,058
Here. Eat this too.

811
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,852
Enjoy the food

812
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,520
and eat slowly.

813
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,397
Thank you, sir.

814
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,193
By the way, there was this guy.

815
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,528
I think he was the Narcotics Unit captain.

816
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,198
He was pretty amazing.

817
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,284
Who? Jang Jae-gyeong?

818
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,077
Yes, sir.

819
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,164
Read the room, you idiot.

820
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,541
Hey, just be quiet and eat.

821
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,251
You punk.

822
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,505
What is it? Tell me.

823
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,132
What's so amazing about him?

824
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,512
It's really hard for a normal person

825
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,722
to get injected with that drug

826
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,933
and act so normally
because it's so potent.

827
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,310
What?

828
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:43,978
Drug?

829
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,688
What drug?

830
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,150
When I got arrested,

831
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:53,363
Geun-ho injected a new lemon pop drug
straight into the cop's arm.

832
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,492
It was a test to see
if he was a cop or not.

833
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,161
But he just took the full injection.

834
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,582
Unless you're an addict,
if it's your first time taking it,

835
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,417
almost everyone passes out.

836
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,963
But he just body-slammed me to the ground.

837
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,714
That was nothing short of amazing.

838
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,887
Hey, keep talking.

839
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,235
Any signal?

840
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,779
I think he turned off his phone.

841
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,699
We're searching the area
with the precinct, but…

842
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,243
But why did Jung Yun-ho come here?

843
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,788
Was there a reason
to kill Park Jun-seo's wife?

844
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,541
Do you have any idea?

845
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,502
I don't understand it.
The scene doesn't make sense either.

846
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,756
The house was a mess,
as if he was looking for something.

847
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,301
And if he really wanted to kill her,

848
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,137
he could've done it quickly
like he did with the rice mill owner.

849
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,848
Other than the trauma to her face,
she wasn't injured much.

850
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,642
And he left the knives there.

851
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,813
Do you think he heard the sirens

852
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,815
and took off before he could kill her?

853
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,818
After staging the scene as a burglary?

854
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,904
Which hospital is that ambulance going to?

855
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,490
Anhyeon University Hospital. Why?

856
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,701
I'll stop by the hospital

857
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,246
and check on Ms. Choi
before returning to the station.

858
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,000
Tell me when you find out
Jung Yun-ho's whereabouts.

859
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,084
Yes, sir.

860
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,628
Captain?

861
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,713
Would you like a ride there?

862
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,839
It's okay.

863
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,426
Ms. Oh!

864
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,386
Hello, ma'am.

865
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,139
You're never at home. Why are you so busy?

866
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,558
I have a lot of work these days.

867
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,935
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

868
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:49,520
Here.

869
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,441
-What is it?
-It was in the coat you dropped off.

870
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,525
The black one.

871
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,402
It was in the inner pocket.

872
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,821
ANHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
PARK EUN-YEONG

873
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:04,494
ANHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
PARK EUN-YEONG

874
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,588
-I'm sorry you had to wait.
-No, not at all.

875
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,516
DEAR MR. AND MRS. PARK

876
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,519
Thank you.

877
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,837
Is Ms. Choi Ji-yeon's guardian here?

878
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,881
Yes.

879
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,885
We performed some urgent tests first.

880
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,220
Other than some contusions,

881
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,472
she has a slight concussion.

882
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,141
So nothing life-threatening?

883
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,308
That's right.

884
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,811
But just to be safe,
we're going to run more tests.

885
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,147
A room opened up,
so I'll have her moved there,

886
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,442
-and she should stay here until tomorrow.
-Yes, thank you.

887
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,487
You don't look well, sir. Are you okay?

888
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,531
Your eyes are bloodshot too.

889
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,325
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

890
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,578
Okay.

891
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,429
How is she?

892
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,556
Is it life-threatening--

893
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,060
Was it you?

894
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,480
Did you tell him to kill Ms. Choi?

895
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,023
Have you lost your mind?

896
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,903
What is it that you want?

897
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,155
How many more of us

898
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:07,074
have to die before you'll be satisfied?

899
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,451
What?

900
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,581
You sold drugs with Jun-seo, didn't you?

901
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,043
At Yeongryun Cold Storage.

902
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,504
You sold the drugs
Lee Myeong-guk made there

903
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,422
and killed him when he wasn't obedient.

904
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,216
Then you killed Park Jun-seo.

905
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,718
And then you had Jung Yun-ho
kill the rice mill owner.

906
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:26,803
And as if that wasn't enough,

907
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,139
you tried to kill your mistress too.

908
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,683
How could a person do that?

909
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,811
What the hell are you talking about?

910
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,020
Why me?

911
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,316
Why did you bring me into this?

912
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,651
What?

913
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:43,444
What do you want out of me?

914
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,695
You bastard!

915
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:47,865
Crazy bastard.

916
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,744
How dare you hit me?

917
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,122
What's wrong with you?

918
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,667
What's gotten into you?

919
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,418
Why would I kill Choi Ji-yeon?

920
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,090
Why would I kill Lee Myeong-guk
and Park Jun-seo? What for?

921
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,844
Hey, you've got it all wrong.

922
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,304
You think I had an affair
with Choi Ji-yeon

923
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,931
because of the password?

924
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,767
She doesn't know anything about it.

925
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,812
Hey.

926
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:18,938
Hey!

927
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,274
Look at me.

928
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,277
You said I sold drugs.

929
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,028
Can you prove it?

930
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,533
Can you prove even one of the things
you just said, you bastard?

931
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:32,994
Whatever.

932
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,621
If you put a hand on me one more time

933
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,709
without knowing the facts,

934
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,836
I'll take your badge.

935
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,671
So bring it on.

936
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,715
You pathetic bastard.

937
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,015
You tried to strangle me to death.

938
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,018
You only care about yourself, don't you?

939
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:02,523
Jang Jae-gyeong, are you okay?

940
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,500
He must've gotten into big trouble.

941
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,338
SENIOR CLASS SIX JANG JAE-GYEONG
INVOLUNTARY TRANSFER

942
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,550
SCIENCE ROOM 2

943
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,179
Jang Jae-gyeong refused to side with us,
but we got him transferred.

944
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:35,973
What about Jun-seo?

945
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,392
What should we do?

946
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,686
But Jun-seo…

947
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,648
still sided with us.

948
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,732
Hey.

949
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,110
If my father hadn't threatened
Park Jun-seo's dad

950
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,279
to make him change his mind,

951
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,365
do you think he would've sided with us?

952
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,371
I don't think so.

953
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,707
He never should've hung out
with people like

954
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,001
Jang Jae-gyeong,
Oh Yun-jin, or Heo Joo-song.

955
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,878
The reason why Jang Jae-gyeong knows

956
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,422
what happened at Chae Gyeong-tae's house

957
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,550
is because Park Jun-seo told him.

958
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,095
Park Jun-seo started all this.

959
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:17,264
But still, Jun-seo's the class president--

960
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,433
Cut out the class president crap!

961
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,187
What kind of class president
ruins things like this, Yun-ho?

962
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,690
Let's take him back as a friend.

963
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,484
I think Jun-seo regrets what he did.

964
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,111
He's right, Jong-soo.

965
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,282
Park Tae-jin, what do you think?

966
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,619
Jang Jae-gyeong is gone now,
so let's leave it at that.

967
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,454
Let's not complicate things more.

968
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:43,290
Yes, let's do that.

969
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,006
Fine.

970
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,967
Let's take Jun-seo back.

971
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,345
Is that enough?

972
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,726
Jun-seo and Oh Yun-jin…

973
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,478
are still dating.

974
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,355
What should we do then?

975
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,152
We make him end everything himself.

976
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,741
Come to the Audiophile club room now.

977
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:19,410
I have something
to tell you about Park Jun-seo.

978
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,337
Park Jun-seo!

979
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,884
What are you doing?

980
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,093
Go.

981
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,219
Jun-seo…

982
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,512
I said go!

983
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,972
Damn it!

984
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,725
I said go away!

985
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,020
Don't ever call me again…

986
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,192
or talk to me.

987
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,861
Jun-seo.

988
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,574
Park Jun-seo!

989
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,799
JUNG SANG-UI

990
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,137
I want my share of the money we've earned.

991
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,304
Park Jun-seo!

992
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,764
We need to stop!

993
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,475
Did you really have an affair
with Jun-seo's wife?

994
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,269
Did you really kill Park Jun-seo?

995
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,938
This is Park Tae-jin.

996
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,439
I'm Doctor.

997
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,567
You told Jang Jae-gyeong everything.

998
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,651
It wasn't me.

999
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,611
Don't lie.

1000
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,405
How can a drug-dealing punk

1001
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,950
-plan a future for KH Group?
-Sir.

1002
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,161
-You need to end this.
-Jong-soo.

1003
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,288
Jae-gyeong!

1004
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,581
Jang Jae-gyeong!

1005
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,583
-Wake up.
-The pill…

1006
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,379
What did I do to deserve
becoming an addict?

1007
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:37,673
Stop smiling and answer me!

1008
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:43,679
