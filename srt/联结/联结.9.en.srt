2
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,895
(April 2005)

3
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,095
Hey, Kyung Tae.

4
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,464
Chae Kyung Tae!

5
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,134
Where's the ramyeon?

6
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,635
In the kitchen.

7
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:35,804
Check inside the cabinets.

8
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:37,574
In the cabinets?

9
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:49,184
I can't find it.

10
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,954
Look harder.

11
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,484
Come and take a look. It's not here.

12
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,354
Why can't you find it?

13
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,354
- It's right here.
- Where?

14
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,695
I see. It's here.

15
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,195
Is it that difficult to find?

16
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,295
Here it is.

17
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:08,234
Darn it.

18
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:10,604
Come on.

19
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:13,035
Why did you spill that?

20
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:14,704
It was because of you.

21
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,094
Make sure you clean that up well.

22
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:19,545
It stinks.

23
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:29,425
- Don't add in too much water.
- Don't worry.

24
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:32,755
- No Gyu Min.
- Yes?

25
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,571
- Lend me your lighter.
- My lighter?

26
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,625
Let's see.

27
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,164
Here.

28
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,035
Okay.

29
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:48,104
I need to pee.

30
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,345
It's on.

31
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,085
Darn it.

32
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,630
Is there no electricity?

33
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,285
There's no running water or gas.

34
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:01,755
Would there be electricity?

35
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:03,884
Darn it.

36
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,455
It's quiet today.

37
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:07,895
Is there no protest?

38
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:10,125
They went to talk to Won Jong Soo's dad.

39
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,365
If things go well,
they might get compensated.

40
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:15,804
Hey, Chae Kyung Tae!

41
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,375
- What's this?
- What's what?

42
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,005
What are you staring at?

43
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,244
Darn you.

44
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,074
Won Jong Soo?

45
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,354
Are you insane?

46
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:42,900
Jong Soo, a fire.

47
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,140
Be quiet.

48
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:45,264
Oh Chi Hyun, stand him up.

49
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:50,364
You need to
remember your place, Kyung Tae.

50
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:57,174
(Connection)

51
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:59,514
(Episode 9)

52
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,495
(Tuesday, March 5)

53
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,345
Isn't it your day off?

54
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:33,574
It is.

55
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,685
I'll go to Cheongwoon Temple.

56
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:41,655
Go back to sleep.

57
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:58,305
(Gyeonggi 34A5253)

58
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:13,984
(Gyeonggi 34A5253)

59
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:25,595
Young Eun. Open the door.

60
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,074
Jeong Young Eun!

61
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:40,945
Who is it?

62
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,824
What are you doing here?

63
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:55,995
Is Yoon Ho home?

64
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:57,935
He's out.

65
00:08:58,665 --> 00:08:59,995
Isn't it his day off?

66
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,505
It is.

67
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,341
He went to Cheongwoon Temple to pray.

68
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,375
Cheongwoon Temple.

69
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,050
It's on Mount Injeok.

70
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,851
It's a bit off Route 392 to Hwansung City.

71
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,820
Captain Jang, we'll get Jeong Yoon Ho.

72
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:12,844
You stay there.

73
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:15,260
We'll get you backup from the patrol unit.

74
00:09:15,284 --> 00:09:17,485
Talk to the family
and keep them distracted.

75
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:20,154
Be sure they don't talk to Jeong Yoon Ho.

76
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,555
Can I wait inside?

77
00:09:26,295 --> 00:09:27,295
Okay.

78
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:40,334
Whose car is this?

79
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,074
It's mine.

80
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,305
What about it?

81
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,175
I'm just taking a look.

82
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,870
The compact vehicle in front
has tape over the license plates.

83
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:00,974
It's hard to track it down.

84
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:15,521
Is the car unlocked?

85
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:16,774
I think so?

86
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,995
What's this about?

87
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:15,735
Is someone taking an exam?

88
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,110
What?

89
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,134
You said he went to pray.

90
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:21,704
He goes to pray for this and that
on his days off.

91
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:24,915
Come in.

92
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,274
Goodness.

93
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,985
Your daughter?

94
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,255
Yes. She's in seventh grade.

95
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,295
Time flies, doesn't it?

96
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:44,464
Being a mom reminds me of
when I was in school.

97
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:48,204
Back then, we had so much fun together
whatever we did.

98
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:49,834
Right?

99
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,844
Can I sit down?

100
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:57,745
Yes.

101
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:20,334
Yoon Ho.

102
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,935
Is he in trouble?

103
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:28,274
Was it a traffic accident?

104
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:31,675
Was he drunk?

105
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:35,714
I knew today was his day off.

106
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:40,161
I came by early to take him away...

107
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,255
as quietly as possible.

108
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:44,185
But here we are.

109
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:46,824
Did...

110
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,265
the other detectives go to get him?

111
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:01,675
You know...

112
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,545
he has a record, right?

113
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:05,874
I found out recently.

114
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,114
He didn't...

115
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,484
do the same thing, did he?

116
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:12,984
He can't have.

117
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,925
He promised me he wouldn't do it again.

118
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:19,695
His friends are his everything.

119
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,295
Even now, he went to pray
for Jong Soo's business to do well...

120
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:27,895
and for Tae Jin to become
the public prosecutor general.

121
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:29,504
Gosh.

122
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:32,635
He cares more about his friends
than his own family.

123
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:34,210
The case is still open.

124
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,244
So...

125
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:37,945
do something about it.

126
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:42,015
You're good at what you do.

127
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,754
You can help out a friend.

128
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:51,425
Jae Gyeong.

129
00:13:52,824 --> 00:13:53,824
The case is still open.

130
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:02,635
So what?

131
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,775
Are you saying you'll arrest Yoon Ho?

132
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:14,474
You are.

133
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,614
I'd forgotten that about you.

134
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:19,614
Years ago...

135
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,230
you coaxed kind Jun Seo...

136
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,655
into reporting your classmates
to the police.

137
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:26,895
What?

138
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,724
Are you getting revenge...

139
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:30,864
for getting kicked out of school?

140
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:33,895
- You loser.
- Si Jung.

141
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,805
You came to take Yoon Ho quietly?

142
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,675
Don't be stupid.

143
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:43,704
How dare you pretend
to be considerate when you came...

144
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,945
right at the time
our kid gets ready for school?

145
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,244
You're just a scumbag!

146
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,584
Si Jung.

147
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:56,185
Mom, I'm off to school.

148
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,334
Hey, sweetie.

149
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:14,635
Run away.

150
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:17,104
Get out of there.
Detectives are on the way.

151
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:19,614
Don't come home.

152
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,214
You can't get caught, okay?

153
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,984
Don't ever get caught!

154
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,744
Please take this child to school.

155
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,255
This officer will take you to school.

156
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,385
Let's go.

157
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:02,045
- Search the inside of the house.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,730
Call the forensics team
and tell them to analyze that car.

159
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:05,754
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:14,771
Unit Chief.

161
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,065
Yes, we're almost there.
We're 3km away.

162
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:20,435
Jeong Yoon Ho's wife told him
that you were on the way.

163
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,445
What? What are you saying?

164
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,985
What were you doing
that you couldn't even stop that?

165
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:27,045
Sorry, ma'am.

166
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:29,714
All right.

167
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:37,785
Darn it.

168
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:43,065
What did the chief say?

169
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,765
Did he just say to let it go?

170
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,265
I told you to look closely
at each of the taxis!

171
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,755
A taxi driver turned out to be
the culprit in the end!

172
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,474
This case got passed on
to Jang Jae Gyeong as a whole.

173
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:56,445
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,

174
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,625
and the mill owner's case. All of it.

175
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:01,474
Seriously.

176
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:14,594
Yes, Prosecutor.
Do you have time for a call right now?

177
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:17,224
Didn't we get anything
from the CCTV cameras?

178
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:20,846
We got footage of Jeong Yoon Ho
leaving Cheongwoon Temple.

179
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:22,411
And after that?

180
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,781
He was caught on CCTV cameras again
on Route 887...

181
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,334
toward Hwansung.

182
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:27,995
We haven't located him after that.

183
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:31,545
From now on,
the mill murder case is ours too.

184
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:35,484
As you know, the suspect, Jeong Yoon Ho,
and his wife, Kang Si Jung,

185
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,645
are all Inspector Jang's
high school friends.

186
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,285
I think it'd be best
for Soo Hyun to lead this case.

187
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:41,724
You agree, right?

188
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,224
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:46,425
You can investigate Lemon Mulberry
and back Soo Hyun up.

190
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,695
First, look for places
where he might be hiding out.

191
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,295
Ask the local precincts
for CCTV footage from nearby.

192
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:54,094
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

(Park Jun Seo)

194
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,065
You're doing well.

195
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:27,111
Don't take more than
two pills this time either.

(CCTV Recording)

197
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:14,315
Hey, did you check it out?

198
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,445
Yes, there was a package here,
just like you said.

199
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,385
How many pills are there?

200
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,885
Four. And there's a note.
Should I read it for you?

201
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:23,185
No.

202
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,295
Did you take those pills?

203
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:28,425
Yes.

204
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:30,795
How is it? Does it help?

205
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:32,795
I'm not sure yet.

206
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:34,854
I just took it for the first time.

207
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:37,104
Are you at the police station now?

208
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,035
Yes, I'm on my way out now.

209
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,004
- Where to?
- Why?

210
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:45,275
What will you do if you go into shock
and pass out?

211
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:47,045
How touching.

212
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,921
Someone should stay by your side
until we confirm that those pills help.

213
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,385
So, where are you going?

214
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,364
CEO Won, today at 10 a.m.

215
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,871
And Vice-Chairman Han Sung Hoon
of Yigu Group is planning to visit...

216
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,234
Why is Han Sung Hoon coming here?

217
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:07,970
I believe it's about...

218
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,234
Yigu Group's regular board meeting
in two days.

219
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:11,905
What do you think?

220
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,275
Will Yigu invest in us?

221
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,514
It's hard to be certain
that the board will approve.

222
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,015
Those on the inside predict
it's about 50-50.

223
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,820
I can't believe
I'm so worried about the results...

224
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:25,454
of another company's board meeting.

225
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:28,655
And Park Tae Jin...

226
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,525
Tell him to come for dinner tonight.

(Pilo-dong Development Plan
Development Project Overview)

228
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:41,671
Vice President Han Sung Hoon
of Yigu Electronics is here.

229
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,734
Yes, send him in.

230
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:46,281
We just saw each other
a few days ago.

231
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,781
What did you want to say
that you called me here?

232
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,445
You could've just told me over the phone.

233
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:53,775
Did you just come from home?

234
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,805
Of course.
Where else would I have come from?

235
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:57,495
You know I take a day off every week.

236
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,614
By the way, what is it you want to say?

237
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,925
- Are you out of your mind right now?
- What?

238
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:04,131
The board meeting is in two days,
but you're lounging around at home?

239
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:05,155
Hey.

240
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:08,354
Does anything change
if I go and sit there?

241
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:11,141
If it's going to get passed,
it'll happen whether I'm there or not.

242
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:13,241
And if it isn't going to get passed,
it won't pass whether I'm there or not.

243
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:14,745
- It won't get passed anyway...
- Hey!

244
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:15,935
Darn it.

245
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,004
Hurry up, right this instant.

246
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,534
Get changed and go to the office.

247
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:24,474
Go and do everything you can
until the end.

248
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,921
Meet with the board members
who are for the bioindustrial complex...

249
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,214
and get their word for it.

250
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:31,295
If any punks are against it,
either buy them off or threaten them...

251
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,954
to get this passed by the board. Got it?

252
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:36,284
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

253
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:39,494
- I told you.
- Hey, Sung Hoon. You...

254
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,045
Both of us have to put our lives
on the line for this.

255
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,635
We have to show them this time.

256
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,040
We should show anyone with eyes...

257
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:51,341
that we're the next owners
of these companies.

258
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,905
- Isn't that right?
- That's... Right.

259
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,474
Yes, you're right.

260
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:57,780
Okay, I understand.

261
00:21:57,804 --> 00:21:59,450
Calm down,
and let's grab some lunch first...

262
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:01,474
I have nothing more to say to you.
Just get going.

263
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:04,885
Go. Hurry up,

264
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:08,685
and have lunch
with your company's directors.

265
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,224
Gosh, punk. Why are you
acting like this all of a sudden?

266
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:28,551
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

267
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,480
Jeong Yoon Ho was watching you
from over there?

268
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:33,175
(We press our own oils.)

269
00:22:33,474 --> 00:22:36,714
Yoon Ho didn't get
Jun Seo's call that day.

270
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:39,185
Judging by what he did at the funeral,

271
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,954
he might not even have come here, no?

272
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:42,254
That's what's weird.

273
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:46,024
Even at the funeral, Won Jong Soo,
Park Tae Jin, and Oh Chi Hyun...

274
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:48,301
didn't mention coming to
the construction site...

275
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,571
on the day Jun Seo died
until the very end.

276
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:50,601
Right.

277
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,705
But why did Jeong Yoon Ho,
who didn't even come here,

278
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:55,405
kill a man just to get rid of
that CCTV camera?

279
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:57,865
He wouldn't have even been on it.

280
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:01,535
Did the other guys make him do it?

281
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,075
Maybe they asked him to get rid of it
just in case.

282
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,314
Yoon Ho didn't come prepared
with a weapon.

283
00:23:13,585 --> 00:23:16,346
He found out about that CCTV camera
and committed an unplanned murder.

284
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:19,954
(We press our own oils.)

285
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,405
What about Jeong Yoon Ho?
Did he get caught?

286
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:32,304
He must've run off for now,

287
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,311
but he will get caught soon
if we leave him be.

288
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:36,075
That idiot punk.

289
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:41,094
- Did you try calling him?
- His phone is turned off.

290
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:44,891
Let's wait. He has no one else
to ask for help but us.

291
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:46,591
I'm sure he'll call
once he gets somewhere safe.

292
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,331
He could've called Si Jung!

293
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:49,835
Si Jung is at the police station too.

294
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:51,161
What?

295
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:53,466
They must be questioning her
for helping Yoon Ho get away.

296
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:54,655
Is it Jang Jae Gyeong again?

297
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,135
What will you do now?

298
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,175
We'll have to help him hide.

299
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,204
We don't know what Jang Jae Gyeong has
as of now.

300
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,575
Hey.

301
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,455
I'm just coming from meeting with
Vice President Han of Yigu Electronics.

302
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:15,790
Their board meeting is in two days,

303
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,591
and we're really so close to the end.

304
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:19,631
But if we get tangled up
in Jeong Yoon Ho's case now,

305
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,314
it'll all be over, Tae Jin.

306
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:26,155
It's highly likely
that Yoon Ho will call you.

307
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:27,831
If he calls,

308
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,855
tell him not to get any other ideas
and to lie low.

309
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,665
Got it.

310
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:33,764
What I find odd is...

311
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:36,311
How did Jang Jae Gyeong
pinpoint Jeong Yoon Ho...

312
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:38,304
as the murderer of the mill owner?

313
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,735
Apparently, he suspected the taxi driver
from the beginning.

314
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,304
What if that punk, Jang Jae Gyeong,

315
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:46,004
had a copy of the CCTV footage
from the beginning?

316
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:48,415
Are you sure we weren't on there?

317
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,484
Jae Gyeong already knew.

318
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:54,554
What?

319
00:24:54,984 --> 00:24:56,424
He came to see me yesterday morning.

320
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,895
He already knew
that we were all gathered...

321
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:03,895
at the construction site
the night Jun Seo died.

322
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:05,325
So?

323
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:07,534
What did you say to him?

324
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:09,135
I told him the truth.

325
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,665
We rode the elevator up,

326
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:13,874
and Jun Seo jumped from the ninth floor.

327
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,220
Why did you tell us that just now?

328
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,544
You had an important meeting ahead of you.

329
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:37,964
And did Jang Jae Gyeong believe that?

330
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:40,764
I don't know
what he's thinking on the inside.

331
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:44,165
He asked me if I killed Jun Seo...

332
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,734
and if you ordered me to do it.

333
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:48,304
What?

334
00:25:49,605 --> 00:25:50,675
So what did you say?

335
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:53,345
I told him no,

336
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,214
not as far as I know.

337
00:25:58,314 --> 00:25:59,385
"Not as far as I know?"

338
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:01,814
You two.

339
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:05,524
Why did you go to the construction site
so obediently?

340
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,325
What?

341
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,395
It was nearing midnight.

342
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:14,095
It wasn't like you to come out
just because he called you.

343
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,704
Jong Soo.

344
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:20,474
It wasn't you, was it?

345
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:23,804
Jerk. What are you talking about?

346
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:25,974
Why would I kill Jun Seo?

347
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,145
What about you?

348
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:29,544
Why did you show up that night?

349
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:38,825
I killed Lee Myung Guk.

350
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:49,165
Why?

351
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:50,905
Why would you?

352
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:53,435
Did I ask you to kill him for me?

353
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:54,911
I didn't!

354
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,004
Lee Myung Guk...

355
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:59,415
constantly threatened you through me.

356
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,051
He demanded 100 dollars
for each pill made...

357
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:04,445
with the natural narcotics
he discovered, or...

358
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,305
He threatened to tell the world
about you...

359
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:09,655
and Yigu Group's Vice President Han...

360
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,331
that you two were addicted.

361
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:13,000
(Pilo Station)

362
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,024
Doctor!

363
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:18,365
Get in.

364
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:19,994
Where are you suddenly taking me?

365
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,135
You know, to be honest,

366
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,105
the price you want is too much.

367
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:26,105
Get in first.

368
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,534
We can't discuss it here.

369
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,304
I knew this would happen.

370
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:34,814
I thought you might get suspicious,
so I took a taxi.

371
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:37,714
It's not like I can abduct you
with a taxi.

372
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:39,254
Hurry and get in.

373
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,484
Come on, get in. Go on.

374
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,594
Initially, my plan was to just scare him.

375
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:50,524
Gosh.

376
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:55,665
Punk.

377
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,750
You punk.

378
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:01,774
Hey.

379
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:02,974
Stop.

380
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:20,994
Push.

381
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:45,984
So?

382
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,365
You left Lee Myung Guk's body...

383
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,155
in Youngryun Cold Storage?

384
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:52,970
Yes.

385
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:55,224
(Youngryun Cold Storage)

386
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:57,994
Do you remember our visit
to Lee Myung Guk's place?

387
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,540
I told you that his body was frozen
at first,

388
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:03,135
but was recently buried,

389
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,051
and that someone had dug it back up...

390
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,204
to place it in his house.

391
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:09,804
Don't tell me he was here.

392
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:13,145
Did they leave him frozen
at this place for seven months?

393
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:16,244
The moment we discovered the body,

394
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:18,085
Molotov cocktails were thrown in.

395
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:20,484
And Yoon Ho was the one who threw them.

396
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:21,984
Yoon Ho?

397
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:24,484
Why? Why would he?

398
00:29:25,855 --> 00:29:27,631
Whoever left Lee's body there...

399
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:30,125
must have told Yoon Ho...

400
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:32,964
that the man he killed and buried...

401
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,835
was dug back up and placed at home.

402
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:38,804
Did Yoon Ho kill Lee Myung Guk too?

403
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:43,804
Yoon Ho showed up at that house
to get rid of Lee Myung Guk's body.

404
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,720
So Jeong Yoon Ho killed
the owner of the mill...

405
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,345
and Lee Myung Guk.

406
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,115
But nothing connects them.

407
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:53,661
What if you had the body
of Lee Myung Guk stored...

408
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:55,966
at Youngryun Cold Storage
and was planning to retrieve it?

409
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,885
Which route would you take?

410
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,564
These two streets lead...

411
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:05,895
to a main street.

412
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:07,940
I would probably come from this way...

413
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,665
to avoid security cameras.

414
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:13,605
I'd pass the mill...

415
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:20,314
The security camera.

416
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:25,490
Yoon Ho killed the owner of the mill...

417
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:27,514
and attempted to get rid
of the security footage...

418
00:30:28,014 --> 00:30:29,500
because he thought
he was caught on camera...

419
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:31,425
when he came to the storage...

420
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:35,494
to retrieve the body of Lee Myung Guk.

421
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,325
Also,

422
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:40,564
when Yoon Ho's taxi passed
the street in front of the mill,

423
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:42,234
I doubt...

424
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:44,264
Yoon Ho was alone.

425
00:30:45,165 --> 00:30:47,205
When did you take him out
of Youngryun Cold Storage?

426
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:48,734
Around 1:30 a.m. that day.

427
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:50,204
"That day?"

428
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:51,774
The day Jun Seo died.

429
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:53,875
Jun Seo called and told me...

430
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,784
if I didn't show up by 11:30 p.m.,

431
00:30:56,284 --> 00:30:58,404
the police would go to the storage
the next morning...

432
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,514
to find Lee Myung Guk's body,

433
00:31:01,784 --> 00:31:03,385
and that he'd confess we were behind it.

434
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:08,524
Does that mean Jun Seo had evidence?

435
00:31:08,754 --> 00:31:09,764
He said he did.

436
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:13,064
Yoon Ho killed that mill owner...

437
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:15,964
because he was trying to get rid of...

438
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,945
the security footage we were on.

439
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:20,234
Don't make excuses for him.

440
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,605
Then what about Lee Myung Guk's body?

441
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,845
Who put it back in his home?

442
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,744
That's what I don't know.

443
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,075
Hey.

444
00:31:28,415 --> 00:31:30,115
Don't tell me you don't know.

445
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:33,714
Who else aside from you and Yoon Ho knew
about moving the corpse?

446
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:35,484
No one.

447
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:38,625
Seriously, no one knows about it.

448
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:42,425
Don't say that and try to remember.

449
00:31:42,994 --> 00:31:46,195
Ever since the body was found,
Jae Gyeong has been poking at everything.

450
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,371
You shouldn't have made such a mess
to begin with,

451
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:50,280
or at least cleaned it up well.

452
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:52,875
I'm frustrated too.

453
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:56,921
If it wasn't one of us, who was it?

454
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,244
It means someone...

455
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:01,445
was following you two that day.

456
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:05,244
How else would a buried corpse
return home?

457
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,045
There must be at least two people.

458
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:14,325
What?

459
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,365
Yoon Ho and I struggled to move him.

460
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,195
It's not a one-man job.

461
00:32:26,435 --> 00:32:29,675
(Maintain safety together
for a safe Anhyun)

462
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,165
Looking at the color of your face,
it looks like the drug is working.

463
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:39,855
Should we meet around 7:00 p.m.?

464
00:32:40,284 --> 00:32:42,655
Who do you think killed Park Jun Seo?

465
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,195
For now,

466
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,695
- I think it's Park Tae Jin.
- Why?

467
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,195
He performed
the postmortem screening himself.

468
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,135
He tried hard to stop the autopsy too.

469
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:56,435
He's also having an affair
with Choi Ji Yeon.

470
00:32:57,064 --> 00:33:00,135
Do you think it was Tae Jin
who drugged me too?

471
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:06,214
Park Jun Seo made drug deliveries
for Won Jong Soo.

472
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,591
Despite that, he shared information
about a drug deal with me...

473
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:12,415
with the code 1882 before he was killed.

474
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,855
As soon as I received the information,
I was abducted...

475
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,554
and drugged.

476
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,484
Do you think...

477
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:22,665
Won Jong Soo made Lemon Mulberry
and sold it?

478
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,464
I see.

479
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:28,895
That's possible too.

480
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,405
You're from the Narcotics Unit,

481
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:33,974
and Jong Soo must have known...

482
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,145
that you recently got a special promotion.

483
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:39,474
If he could drug you
and get you out of the picture,

484
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:42,020
it would allow him to get rid of...

485
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,014
a big threat to his drug business.

486
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,014
But,

487
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:49,454
after they drugged me,

488
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:52,284
they could've left me anywhere.

489
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:54,724
But they dragged me to the scene
of a drug deal.

490
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:58,195
It was as if they were setting me up
to catch the culprit. Why?

491
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,064
What if...

492
00:34:01,734 --> 00:34:03,204
someone is using you...

493
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:07,905
to get at Won Jong Soo?

494
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,480
It would keep their hands clean...

495
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:13,321
if they could take advantage of you
with the drug.

496
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,825
They can break up the organization
behind the Lemon Mulberry...

497
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:18,314
and can corner Won Jong Soo...

498
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:22,155
and drive him out.

499
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,224
No way.

500
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:07,734
Hey.

501
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:09,835
I've already started.

502
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:11,835
I'm sorry I'm late.

503
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:14,750
You work for the state.
It's hard to keep time.

504
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:15,774
Take a seat.

505
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,905
Yes, sir.

506
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:21,235
I'm sorry, but I can't drink.

507
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:22,744
I have to go back to work after.

508
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:25,284
Okay.

509
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:28,885
Here.

510
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:34,095
The old lady who used
to run this place died five years ago,

511
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:35,555
but the food tastes the same.

512
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:36,724
Gosh.

513
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:39,895
A person's taste can be the most cunning.

514
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:43,704
I wonder how people who take over
manage to keep the food tasting the same.

515
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,704
- Isn't it impressive?
- It is, yes.

516
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:49,845
Jong Soo.

517
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,714
Do you think
he'll do well if he succeeds me?

518
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:00,314
I can't even ask you a question.

519
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,724
- Eat up.
- I will.

520
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:08,994
I read your business proposal.

521
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:10,794
Thank you.

522
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:12,240
But why does...

523
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:15,865
the asset management company
have so many attachments?

524
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,881
Yigu Group will ask for an opening
to siphon money,

525
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,314
- and Keumhyung too...
- Is that...

526
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:34,185
what you want in return
for designing the business?

527
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,661
To make a secret opening
to siphon money from...

528
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:39,794
behind Jong Soo and my backs?

529
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:47,365
The reason I kept you close
since you were young is...

530
00:36:48,365 --> 00:36:52,204
because I believed you knew
where the line was drawn.

531
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:55,304
You're crossing the line.

532
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,845
I'm confident, Chairman Won.

533
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,014
This project will be a success.

534
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:06,044
Trust me once more.

535
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:09,825
Why are you doing this?

536
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:12,954
Twenty years ago,

537
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:15,195
when Anhyun City was established,

538
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:17,994
my father failed to grab the opportunity.

539
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,165
He sold his cattle one by one...

540
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,946
and lived off of the tiny amount
he got as compensation...

541
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:25,504
before dying as a nobody.

542
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,435
I don't want to be like my father.

543
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:31,375
I will make this opportunity count.

544
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:33,450
I'll use this project...

545
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,714
to go all the way and make Jong Soo
the richest man ever.

546
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:37,984
Let me take part in it.

547
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:42,415
You're just a deputy chief prosecutor.

548
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:44,825
I have many other contacts.

549
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,071
Prosecution office directors, ministers,
supreme court judges, assemblymen.

550
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:50,015
I can get them
to make the impossible possible...

551
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,865
and cover up mistakes.

552
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,740
Would I have let you...

553
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:59,365
stay close to Jong Soo for that long
only to use you to do that?

554
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,490
If you want to keep your promise
of making him the richest man ever,

555
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:09,784
you must remain a prosecutor
instead of joining this project...

556
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:13,954
and continue to do
what you have been doing.

557
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:17,425
Do your job.

558
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:18,685
Chairman.

559
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:21,125
Aren't we in the same boat now?

560
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:26,734
At last...

561
00:38:28,664 --> 00:38:32,305
I see for sure what you were thinking.

562
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,874
You think you can't be replaced.

563
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:40,914
Don't you?

564
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,745
You were there beside me
and Jong Soo for 20 years,

565
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:50,285
and each time I made an important decision
I heard your advice.

566
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:53,055
Do you think...

567
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:55,555
that made you family?

568
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:57,571
Sir, I meant...

569
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:01,635
The moment you give up your duty,
you mean nothing to me.

570
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:06,140
Do not get on my nerves,

571
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:07,205
remain silent,

572
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:13,144
and remain in your position.

573
00:39:18,544 --> 00:39:19,560
Hello.

574
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,254
I ordered an ice cream cake.
It's for Heo Joo Song.

575
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:24,254
Okay. How long do you need to travel?

576
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:25,584
About an hour?

577
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:28,600
Here you go.

578
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:29,995
- Are there candles too?
- Yes.

579
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:31,701
Thank you.

580
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,635
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

581
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:41,374
Hello.

582
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:58,845
Hey, you got here early.

583
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,354
I had something to set up.

584
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:04,555
- What's that?
- It's Yoon Jin's birthday.

585
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,555
We should surprise her.

586
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:14,834
It's frozen so hard
the candle won't go in.

587
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:18,104
Is it cold on your balcony?

588
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,475
Let's hide it there
and bring it out later.

589
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:23,281
I need you to cooperate.
You're in charge of the lighting.

590
00:41:23,305 --> 00:41:24,644
It all depends on you.

591
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,044
- It's Yoon Jin.
- Why is she here so early?

592
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:33,361
Hang on.

593
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:35,591
I'll hide out on the balcony.

594
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:37,155
The balcony. Wait.

595
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:39,555
Give me a while.
Don't open the door yet.

596
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:41,325
Just wait.

597
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:43,495
See you later. Okay?

598
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:49,535
Hey, hi.

599
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:57,445
Hang on.

600
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:03,015
So what? Choi Ji Yeon...

601
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:04,584
No.

602
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:07,214
CW. Is she leaving?

603
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:09,984
Yes, in full makeup too.

604
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,084
What are they up to?

605
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:13,955
Follow her.

606
00:42:15,024 --> 00:42:17,265
Yoon Jin. Can't we stop now?

607
00:42:17,794 --> 00:42:19,964
All I do is follow people to motels.

608
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:24,040
I've been feeling a sense of shame...

609
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:26,135
because I didn't become
a reporter to do this.

610
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,305
Hang on a bit. We're almost there.

611
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:31,705
We need to figure out
the password Park Tae Jin wants.

612
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:33,675
What if she goes right into the motel?

613
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:35,845
Then you can go home.

614
00:42:37,684 --> 00:42:38,684
Hey.

615
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:41,330
We'll make some progress today.

616
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:42,885
That's how things look right now.

617
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:47,294
If Park Tae Jin keeps feeling rushed,

618
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,895
there's a possibility
that she might reveal everything today.

619
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:53,095
It's not like CW
will tell the passcode for all to hear.

620
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:56,040
You don't know what Park Tae Jin's like.

621
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:59,234
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

622
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:01,905
Even if we don't get the password,

623
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:04,980
Tae Jin might say what the account is...

624
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:07,245
and how much is in it.

625
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,584
Stop complaining
and get a recording, okay?

626
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,714
Okay.

627
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,155
Text me when they meet up.

628
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:29,934
What's this weird atmosphere?

629
00:43:30,535 --> 00:43:31,734
Your call ended?

630
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:32,964
Yes.

631
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:34,635
Where were you?

632
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:36,075
I just got here.

633
00:43:36,374 --> 00:43:37,405
As if.

634
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:40,274
I saw your shoes and jacket as I came in.

635
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:43,144
I was on the toilet.
Gosh, my stomach.

636
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:47,955
The toilet? Okay.

637
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:49,814
Did you read Lee Myung Guk's work logs?

638
00:43:50,055 --> 00:43:51,084
- Yes.
- Yes.

639
00:44:07,004 --> 00:44:08,975
Hey, we looked and found nothing.

640
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:12,350
It's just a list of times
and places or names.

641
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:15,115
Yes. Did you find a phone or something?

642
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:19,261
- Yoon Jin.
- Yes?

643
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:20,725
What character do you think this is?

644
00:44:22,515 --> 00:44:24,354
What CEO doesn't know this?

645
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:28,155
It's "pil." It means "at all costs"
or "without fail."

646
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:29,555
It's "pil," right?

647
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:31,995
I thought so,
but the handwriting was dreadful.

648
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:35,695
Hang on.

649
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:38,905
Look at this.

650
00:44:40,834 --> 00:44:41,834
It's here too.

651
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:44,004
Oh, it's the same.

652
00:44:44,705 --> 00:44:46,945
(March 18, 2023, Research lab,
"necessary," "discussion")

653
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:54,214
It's here too.

654
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:56,455
It's at 9 p.m.

655
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:57,754
Did he work overtime?

656
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:01,225
Then, at 7 a.m...

657
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:03,571
or at 9 p.m. "Research lab."

658
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:04,825
"Necessary. Discussion."

659
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:08,695
Does this mean there was something
he needed to discuss?

660
00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:13,064
Jeong Sang Eui.

661
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:14,705
What?

662
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:17,374
I think this is referring
to Jeong Sang Eui.

663
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:19,250
Jeong Sang Eui was...

664
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:21,991
Lee Myung Guk's direct junior researcher
at Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

665
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:23,015
What?

666
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:24,725
Why are you only telling us that now?

667
00:45:24,845 --> 00:45:25,845
I'm telling you now.

668
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:27,854
Didn't you know? I knew that already.

669
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:30,834
Hey, how would I know about
what's going on with Jeong Sang Eui?

670
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,401
Gosh, hang on. So, what's going on?

671
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:36,825
Then, whether it was at 7 a.m. or 9 p.m.,

672
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:40,495
he met with Sang Eui in person
at the research lab no matter what.

673
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,776
Is there a meeting that's not necessary
to meet in person?

674
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:47,274
Hey, could this be...

675
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:49,975
Hang on.

676
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:52,120
(Pilo-dong in Chinese characters)

677
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:53,245
I was right.

678
00:45:53,314 --> 00:45:54,721
The character for "pil"
that means necessary...

679
00:45:54,745 --> 00:45:55,951
is used in the name, "Pilo-dong."

680
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:58,460
- Pilo-dong?
- Research lab. Pilo-dong.

681
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:00,414
Jeong Sang Eui. What's this?

682
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,184
Youngryun Cold Storage.

683
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:04,854
I checked on the way.

684
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,455
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical owns
Youngryun Cold Storage.

685
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:08,931
(Certified copy of real estate register)

686
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:10,401
But there was no office there.

687
00:46:10,425 --> 00:46:12,195
There was nothing there when we went.

688
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:14,770
The search and seizure warrant
will be issued soon.

689
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:15,910
We should go and look through the place.

690
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:18,035
Okay. I'm coming too.

691
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,774
(9 p.m., Research lab,
Pilo-dong, Sang Eui)

692
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:39,725
Is this it?

693
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:40,955
Yes.

694
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:42,655
They left right after that.

695
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:46,365
Yes, I understand.

696
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,071
Then, I'll be going home now.

697
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:49,365
Yes, thank you.

698
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:02,615
Why are they only talking
in the car today?

699
00:47:03,144 --> 00:47:05,620
Go to a motel or something.

700
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:07,314
I'm starving.

701
00:47:17,064 --> 00:47:18,064
What's that?

702
00:47:36,274 --> 00:47:38,615
Let me take this call.

703
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:46,254
The cake will melt.

704
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:49,330
Gosh, you're right.

705
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:51,024
Yes, what happened?

706
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:52,801
They didn't go anywhere today...

707
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:54,164
and were only talking in the car.

708
00:47:54,564 --> 00:47:56,865
But CW just left and is on the move.

709
00:47:57,205 --> 00:47:58,205
Alone?

710
00:47:58,405 --> 00:47:59,405
Yes.

711
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:00,675
Did they perhaps fight?

712
00:48:00,975 --> 00:48:02,874
I wouldn't know.
They only stayed in the car.

713
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:07,874
But the direction she's headed
is the complete opposite of her house.

714
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:09,874
Which direction is it?

715
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:11,714
Oh, hang on.

716
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:13,531
What is it?

717
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,190
She just went into an apartment complex.

718
00:48:15,214 --> 00:48:16,214
Which apartment?

719
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:17,584
Park Tae Jin's apartment?

720
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,984
I'm not sure. I can't see very well.

721
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:22,024
That can't be.

722
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:24,275
Park Tae Jin is married
and even has a kid.

723
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:28,964
Is his house empty today?

724
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:31,464
Gosh.

725
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:34,205
Those two are getting so bold.

726
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:49,031
She's at the entrance
of the apartment now.

727
00:48:49,055 --> 00:48:50,955
What about Park Tae Jin?
Is he not there yet?

728
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,124
No. I'm not sure,
but I don't think he's here yet.

729
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:56,964
- Go in after her.
- But I'll be caught.

730
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,825
Still, you could check
the building and unit number.

731
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:01,564
Hang on.

732
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:03,775
Well, it's not the first floor.

733
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:05,984
How many floors is the whole building?

734
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:07,805
Three floors.

735
00:49:08,604 --> 00:49:09,604
Hang on.

736
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:11,975
She's headed to the second floor.

737
00:49:12,644 --> 00:49:13,644
What?

738
00:49:14,314 --> 00:49:16,044
What's the apartment called?

739
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,184
Taekyung Apartment.

740
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:21,885
Taekyung Apartment,
Building 306, 2nd floor.

741
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:41,434
Hello.

742
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:42,774
Yes, hello.

743
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:43,905
Come in.

744
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,201
(What's going on?)

745
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,225
What's going on?

746
00:50:01,695 --> 00:50:02,725
Hold.

747
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:22,515
(293D3929)

748
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,084
(293D3929)

749
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:34,754
(293D3929)

750
00:50:34,995 --> 00:50:36,794
(293D3929)

751
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:47,025
(Building 306, Unit 202,
Taekyung Apartment)

752
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:49,575
(Taekyung, 306)

753
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:12,695
How did you know to come here?

754
00:51:21,274 --> 00:51:23,135
I was wondering how to deliver this,

755
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:25,374
but then, I heard you had a meeting today.

756
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:32,115
I'm not sure if it'll help.

757
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:35,485
Oh, you must've gotten the results
for the Safe Inheritance One-stop Service.

758
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:38,524
Gosh, you could've told me this
over the phone.

759
00:51:40,084 --> 00:51:42,225
Jun Seo's bank account information,

760
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:44,064
his insurance policies...

761
00:51:44,265 --> 00:51:45,370
His bank account information?

762
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,035
Most of them, I already knew about.

763
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:48,135
But one of them is weird.

764
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:49,595
Which one?

765
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:51,834
Out of the insurance policies below,

766
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:54,975
there was a pension insurance
that Jun Seo got 11 years ago.

767
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:57,345
He had it since before our marriage,

768
00:51:57,675 --> 00:51:59,144
but I had no idea about it.

769
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:02,015
So, I asked the insurance company...

770
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:06,015
and an old lady in her 60s in Boryeong
has been receiving the pension.

771
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:07,491
Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province?

772
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:10,524
Yes, neither Jun Seo nor I have
any connections to that place.

773
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:11,885
So, did you go there?

774
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:13,460
Not yet.

775
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:14,495
What about the address?

776
00:52:15,254 --> 00:52:16,254
Have you found that out?

777
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:19,064
- Yes.
- Then, please tell us the address.

778
00:52:25,164 --> 00:52:26,164
Well,

779
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:28,975
didn't you say you came
in case you could help?

780
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:32,175
Let's go together.

781
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:34,374
All of us.

782
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:36,175
Us?

783
00:52:42,214 --> 00:52:43,214
Jun Seo's case...

784
00:52:44,385 --> 00:52:46,325
is still being investigated by the police.

785
00:52:47,055 --> 00:52:49,431
We haven't gotten the autopsy results
from the NFS yet either.

786
00:52:49,455 --> 00:52:52,270
Anything that might serve as proof
in revealing Jun Seo's cause of death...

787
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,571
should be left to the police...

788
00:52:53,595 --> 00:52:55,564
to investigate, even if you're curious.

789
00:52:55,934 --> 00:52:58,064
If that's why you came,
you made the right decision.

790
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:03,305
I told you this before, Joo Song,

791
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:06,464
but the life insurance money
that my husband left behind...

792
00:53:06,745 --> 00:53:08,075
He left it to the two of you...

793
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,020
because he needed to use it as bait
for you to reveal the truth...

794
00:53:10,044 --> 00:53:11,314
about his wrongful death.

795
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:15,084
"Bait?"

796
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:18,624
Did you just say it was bait?

797
00:53:21,524 --> 00:53:22,524
Where are you going?

798
00:53:23,524 --> 00:53:24,624
You heard her.

799
00:53:24,894 --> 00:53:26,571
She told me this before.

800
00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:28,294
Then, I already know this part.

801
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:30,195
You two can talk amongst yourselves.

802
00:53:36,305 --> 00:53:37,305
So?

803
00:53:37,945 --> 00:53:39,865
If the insurance payout was
five million dollars,

804
00:53:40,144 --> 00:53:41,651
The insurance payment
must have been expensive.

805
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,275
Where do you think that money came from?

806
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:45,785
He probably paid it with our money.

807
00:53:48,714 --> 00:53:50,285
- So?
- So...

808
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:53,644
That five million dollars...

809
00:53:55,624 --> 00:53:57,695
As a matter of fact, it belongs to me.

810
00:53:57,865 --> 00:53:58,865
Hold on.

811
00:54:00,495 --> 00:54:02,341
What kind of nonsense is this?

812
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:03,370
Yoon Jin.

813
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:04,405
Hey.

814
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:06,640
The insurance money belongs
to the recipient.

815
00:54:06,664 --> 00:54:08,135
Who cares who paid for it?

816
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:10,874
Also, if it's yours, it's yours.

817
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:12,905
What do you mean it's a matter of fact?

818
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:15,015
I'm speechless.

819
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:16,914
He didn't give it
to his closest friends...

820
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:19,644
or his sole family member.

821
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:23,955
He left the two of you his insurance money
although he hardly contacted you.

822
00:54:24,184 --> 00:54:25,584
You found that strange too.

823
00:54:27,524 --> 00:54:29,324
Isn't this a matter
of being shameless or not?

824
00:54:29,354 --> 00:54:31,325
- "Shameless?"
- Yoon Jin.

825
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:44,544
Ji Yeon.

826
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,675
Let me talk casually
since I'm a few years older.

827
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:52,144
I can let everything pass,

828
00:54:52,984 --> 00:54:56,584
but it makes me sick
to hear you say the word "shameless."

829
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:00,531
What did you say?

830
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,254
How dare you call me shameless?

831
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:37,440
If you want to keep your promise
of making him the richest man ever,

832
00:55:37,464 --> 00:55:40,664
you must remain a prosecutor
instead of joining this project...

833
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:42,695
and do your job.

834
00:55:47,705 --> 00:55:51,675
The moment you give up your duty,
you mean nothing to me.

835
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:54,451
Do not get on my nerves,

836
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:55,544
remain silent,

837
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:58,245
and remain in your position.

838
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:00,854
I'm afraid...

839
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:04,984
one day I won't even see you...

840
00:56:07,254 --> 00:56:08,595
as a friend of my child.

841
00:56:15,734 --> 00:56:18,064
You're so busy.
Are you sure we can go to Jeju Island?

842
00:56:19,164 --> 00:56:21,035
I already booked the hotel and the flight.

843
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:23,104
Don't worry, I can make it.

844
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:27,104
Doesn't your family say anything?

845
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:29,374
You're always away on weekends.

846
00:56:31,115 --> 00:56:32,144
What?

847
00:56:33,115 --> 00:56:34,515
No.

848
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:45,925
(Park Jun Seo)

849
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:56,874
- Yes, Jun Seo. Why...
- Are you with Ji Yeon?

850
00:57:02,615 --> 00:57:03,714
At 11:30 p.m.,

851
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:06,694
show up at the construction site
by the Pilo-dong three-way intersection.

852
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:10,055
Come around the back alley
where you'll find an open entrance.

853
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:12,825
A construction site?

854
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:14,754
Why at this hour?

855
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,524
Tae Jin, I can't go on any longer.

856
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:22,564
I intend to tell the guys...

857
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:26,205
- what we've been up to.
- Jun Seo.

858
00:57:26,765 --> 00:57:28,934
You said we'd stop
if we reached 500,000 dollars.

859
00:57:30,035 --> 00:57:31,805
But you didn't listen to my request,

860
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:33,745
and I had no choice...

861
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:35,975
but to let my daughter go.

862
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:37,945
On top of that, now...

863
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:40,285
Jun Seo.

864
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:43,684
Not today. Let's talk one-on-one.

865
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:46,104
- You're too emotional right now.
- You're wrong.

866
00:57:46,825 --> 00:57:49,825
My mind's clearer than ever.

867
00:57:51,564 --> 00:57:53,124
I can see everything clearly.

868
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:56,834
I'm scared too,

869
00:57:58,035 --> 00:57:59,035
but...

870
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:03,604
if I can turn anything back,

871
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:06,874
I must do it.

872
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:10,274
- Jun Seo.
- When you get there,

873
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:12,445
you'll learn something new...

874
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:14,684
about the other guys too.

875
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:16,684
See you in a bit.

876
00:58:17,484 --> 00:58:18,484
Park Jun Seo.

877
00:58:56,225 --> 00:58:57,254
Yes?

878
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,664
Hello?

879
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:06,104
Tae Jin. It's me, Yoon Ho.

880
00:59:06,805 --> 00:59:07,934
What? Where are you?

881
00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:11,675
I'm still in Anhyun.

882
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:13,604
Why did you call me?

883
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:15,754
- I'm hanging up.
- I'm calling from a payphone.

884
00:59:16,615 --> 00:59:17,644
Tae Jin,

885
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:20,385
please help me.

886
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:22,885
You can't call me like this.
How can I help you?

887
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,560
I don't have anything else to say.
Don't call me again.

888
00:59:25,584 --> 00:59:26,725
Jun Seo's wife.

889
00:59:28,624 --> 00:59:29,825
Did Jun Seo know about it?

890
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:31,464
That you have...

891
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:33,765
a thing with her?

892
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:36,765
- What did you say?
- I noticed you met her today too.

893
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:39,564
I wonder what Jong Soo will say
when he finds out.

894
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:43,580
He might think you killed Jun Seo...

895
00:59:43,604 --> 00:59:45,004
because of it.

896
00:59:45,144 --> 00:59:46,464
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yes.

897
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:48,975
I'm crazy. So what?

898
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:52,214
You have to help me!

899
00:59:53,015 --> 00:59:54,714
I know you can.

900
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:29,515
I can leave the logs here, right?

901
01:00:30,885 --> 01:00:31,925
I'll get going.

902
01:00:34,524 --> 01:00:35,524
Yoon Jin!

903
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:41,164
<i>Happy birthday</i>

904
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,434
<i>To you</i>

905
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:47,365
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

906
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:52,044
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Yoon Jin
- Happy birthday, dear Yoon Jin</i>

907
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:56,345
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

908
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:03,254
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

909
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:06,031
I didn't know things would turn this way.

910
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:09,854
But still, it's your birthday.
I can't just skip over it.

911
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:12,901
Hey, this is dripping.

912
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:14,934
Just blow them out,

913
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:17,135
make a wish, and eat the cake.

914
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:19,265
Please don't be so angry.

915
01:01:20,564 --> 01:01:21,575
Happy?

916
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:35,354
Is today...

917
01:01:37,414 --> 01:01:38,524
your birthday?

918
01:01:39,955 --> 01:01:40,955
Yes.

919
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:05,544
Ji Yeon! What's the matter?

920
01:02:06,445 --> 01:02:07,544
Are you all right?

921
01:02:10,955 --> 01:02:11,984
Are you okay?

922
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:13,955
Ji Yeon!

923
01:02:14,495 --> 01:02:15,495
Ji Yeon?

924
01:02:17,425 --> 01:02:18,524
Was it what she ate?

925
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:39,221
Please choose your four-digit passcode.

926
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:40,221
(8 years ago)

927
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:41,385
What should we use?

928
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:46,955
(Never share your passcode.)

929
01:02:47,524 --> 01:02:48,624
What is that?

930
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:51,000
It's just the one I've been using
for a long time.

931
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:52,095
- Really?
- Yes.

932
01:02:52,294 --> 01:02:54,464
Should we use that from now on?

933
01:02:55,164 --> 01:02:56,394
- Sure.
- Okay.

934
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:12,484
(March 5, Tuesday)

935
01:03:28,794 --> 01:03:29,834
Are you all right?

936
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:47,385
Gosh.

937
01:03:52,325 --> 01:03:53,325
I'm leaving too.

938
01:03:53,524 --> 01:03:54,524
Already?

939
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:56,375
I blew out the candles, didn't I?

940
01:03:56,825 --> 01:03:58,265
The cake melted too.

941
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:02,595
This man has been tailing Park Tae Jin
and Choi Ji Yeon for the last while.

942
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:05,075
I'm sending pictures to you
because I find him suspicious.

943
01:04:05,934 --> 01:04:07,040
(This man has been tailing Park Tae Jin
and Choi Ji Yeon for the last while.)

944
01:04:07,064 --> 01:04:09,424
(I'm sending pictures to you
because I find him suspicious.)

945
01:04:10,504 --> 01:04:11,575
That's Jeong Yoon Ho.

946
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,155
Jae Gyeong.
This is in front of my house.

947
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:21,584
Jae Gyeong!

948
01:04:24,825 --> 01:04:25,825
What's going on?

949
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:55,655
Jeong Yoon Ho!

950
01:05:01,854 --> 01:05:04,354
(Connection)

951
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,881
(You're doing well.)

952
01:05:18,905 --> 01:05:20,975
(Don't take more than two pills
this time either.)

953
01:05:39,564 --> 01:05:42,464
(Connection)

954
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,310
Once this weekend is over,
that money means nothing to me.

955
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:48,410
- Oh Yoon Jin.
- Whoever opens that box is the owner.

956
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,810
If anyone murdered Jun Seo...

957
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:52,421
and staged it as a suicide,

958
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:53,921
you're the only one I can think of.

959
01:05:53,945 --> 01:05:55,551
No, Gong Jin Wook!

960
01:05:55,575 --> 01:05:56,721
He's the one behind everything.

961
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:59,290
Detective, come and arrest them quietly.

962
01:05:59,314 --> 01:06:00,314
Kim Chang Soo!

963
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:01,555
What are you doing here?

964
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:03,960
What's wrong with detectives these days?

965
01:06:03,984 --> 01:06:05,361
One's a druggie, and...

966
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:06,361
Shut your mouth!

967
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:07,361
Both of them died.

968
01:06:07,385 --> 01:06:09,370
Now, you're the only one left
who took the drug.

969
01:06:09,394 --> 01:06:10,431
It looks like the answer is out.

970
01:06:10,455 --> 01:06:11,770
Did you order them to kill both?

971
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:13,140
- Hey!
- Am I wrong?

972
01:06:13,164 --> 01:06:14,464
I killed Lee Myung Guk,

973
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:16,964
and I killed Park Jun Seo too.
