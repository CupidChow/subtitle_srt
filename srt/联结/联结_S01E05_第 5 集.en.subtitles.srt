1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,393
The people inheriting five billion won
are stated as follows.

3
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,644
There was one more person.

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,063
Lee Myeong-guk?

5
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,273
He was last seen heading down
to a subway station near his office.

6
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,025
-And the name of his company?
-KH Pharmaceutical.

7
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,234
Won Jong-soo is the CEO there.

8
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,779
Is this Ms. Lee Eun-hui's residence?
You're Mr. Lee Myeong-guk's daughter?

9
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,615
What did your father do
at KH Pharmaceutical?

10
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,452
HE BEGINS TO EXHIBIT
SIGNS OF WITHDRAWAL

11
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,370
-Jang Jae-gyeong!
-No hospital.

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,082
YUN-JIN FINDS LEMON POP
AT HIS HOME

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,501
How could you do drugs?

14
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,961
Nobody can know that I'm an addict.

15
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,297
If you're going to Lee Myeong-guk's house,
I'll drive you there.

16
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,924
Who is it? It's Lee Myeong-guk, right?

17
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,258
Was he a member of our club?

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,553
Seven months have passed,
but there's hardly any decomposition.

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,139
He must've been frozen
right after his death and thawed out.

20
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,558
RIGHT THEN, SOMEONE THROWS
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS INTO THE HOUSE

21
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,268
JAE-GYEONG AND YUN-JIN
ESCAPE THE FIRE

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,853
BUT LEE MYEONG-GUK'S BODY
GOES UP IN FLAMES

23
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,105
Why was Lee Myeong-guk's body
at his house?

24
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,067
Rather than Lee Myeong-guk
showing up out of nowhere,

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,486
this could be better for us.

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,654
"Audiophile"?

27
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,030
Park Jun-seo…

28
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,865
Is this Ms. Park Bok-rye's residence?

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,075
That's my mother.

30
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,828
I heard a medication error occurred

31
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,955
while she received treatment
at Woonjong Medical Center.

32
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,581
I don't know anything. Please leave.

33
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,708
FAMILY REJECTS INTERVIEW
SO SHE LEAVES HER BUSINESS CARD

34
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,377
We'll have to approach him differently.

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,838
Why this construction site of all places?

36
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,589
That entrance is blocked now.

37
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,549
What?

38
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,008
Where's that CCTV camera?

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,510
Please pause here.

40
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,469
ON THE CCTV CAMERA

41
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,346
This is the person who copied the footage.

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,807
JUNG YUN-HO WAS WATCHING THEM

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,934
I backed up some files in this.

44
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,478
No, it's okay. I'll be right back.

45
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,938
HE HEADS TO THE RICE CAKE MILL

46
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,106
That was quick.

47
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,402
JAE-GYEONG SOON RETURNS

48
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,112
Sir?

49
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,113
RICE CAKE MILL OWNER
LEAVES CCTV FOOTAGE

50
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,030
Sir.

51
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:36,823
BUT DIES

52
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,616
AND THE CCTV SERVER
GOES UP IN FLAMES

53
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,167
Jeez.

54
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,254
So they think they're old enough

55
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,256
to spend the night out

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,425
at a friend's house?

57
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,680
I'll do a couple of more laps
before I go home.

58
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,557
Okay.

59
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,518
No.

60
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,479
I'll eat at home.

61
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,982
Just make something simple. Got it.

62
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,216
RICE MILL

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,184
TIME IT TOOK TO COMMIT CRIME

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,310
Five minutes.

65
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,939
Six minutes at most.

66
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:38,027
TIME IT TOOK TO COMMIT CRIME:
5 TO 6 MINUTES

67
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,534
Before the sun had set.

68
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,536
If he took the main road

69
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,997
while covered in blood,
someone would've noticed.

70
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,208
Since there were no witnesses,

71
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,835
this means he fled in a car.

72
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,382
I'll go to my car and bring a flash drive.

73
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,225
The suspect knew I'd head back to my car.

74
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,311
Where were they watching me from?

75
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,982
LOCALS DEEP IN DEBT
AFTER LOSING LAND AND HOMES

76
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,902
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT

77
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,741
PILO-DONG CONSTRUCTION SITE

78
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,326
At 12:31 p.m.,

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,203
that alley was under construction.

80
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,789
If he came in,

81
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,041
it had to be through this alley.

82
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,174
UNDER CONSTRUCTION,
RICE MILL, FRUIT STAND

83
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,218
It took about three minutes
from the rice mill to the traffic light.

84
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,555
Not a single car
went into the alley at the time.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,644
While crossing the road,

86
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,773
I didn't see any cars
entering this alley for 30 seconds.

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,608
After buying some apples,

88
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,861
it took about a minute
to get back in view of the rice mill.

89
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,405
4 MINUTES 30 SECONDS

90
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,991
That gave the suspect two minutes at most.

91
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,992
2 MINUTES

92
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:08,910
That's impossible.

93
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,997
In less than two minutes,
he killed a person, burned the server,

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,957
and fled in a car without anyone seeing?

95
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,918
No.

96
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,253
That's just impossible.

97
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,506
In that case…

98
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,135
It had to be there.

99
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,471
The suspect parked in that dead-end alley

100
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,223
and watched me.

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,654
The oil hasn't dried yet.

102
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,822
This car just got here.

103
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,921
Oh, my goodness!

104
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,047
What are you doing?

105
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,423
I'm a police officer.

106
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,426
Do you have a CCTV camera installed here?

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,430
No, I don't. My word…

108
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,015
Are there any houses nearby
with CCTV cameras?

109
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,976
Why do you ask?

110
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,936
Who does this car belong to?

111
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,312
The person across the street.

112
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,398
Was it parked here this afternoon?

113
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,567
They go to work during the day, so no.

114
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,944
I was wondering if a different car

115
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,488
was parked here this afternoon.

116
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,700
Yes, there was one parked here.

117
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,368
-Right here?
-Yes.

118
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,872
I came out to get soybean paste
to make dinner early

119
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,417
when I noticed a car parked in front.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,043
Was anyone inside?

121
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,755
I only caught a glimpse
from where I stood.

122
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,424
I couldn't tell who was inside.

123
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,301
You didn't come out to check?

124
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,179
Or ask why they parked their car
in front of your house?

125
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,347
Oh, it was a taxi.

126
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,224
-A taxi?
-Yes.

127
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,518
I thought my neighbor had called a taxi.

128
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,029
What in the world?

129
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,531
-Oh, my goodness.
-I can't believe it.

130
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,176
If the taxi came this way…

131
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,639
TAXI DIRECTION

132
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,599
Did it make a right turn?

133
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,023
PILO-DONG CONSTRUCTION SITE

134
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,775
It's a one-way street straight ahead.

135
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,444
ONE-WAY STREET

136
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
A CCTV camera?

137
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,784
If it turned right,
it would've been caught on camera.

138
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,582
PILO TOWNHOUSE

139
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,833
In the direction of Pilo-dong.

140
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:08,464
TOWARD PILO-DONG

141
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,975
Over there is the suspect's escape route.

142
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,562
Then the taxi driver must be the culprit
or at least an accomplice.

143
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,232
If we check the crosswalk camera
on the main road leading to Pilo-dong,

144
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,733
we can identify the suspect.

145
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,859
Captain Jang!

146
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
Whose case do you think this is?

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,488
Senior Inspector Yoo…

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,283
We're each assigned cases
based on jurisdiction.

149
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,368
Have some damn respect
for your senior colleagues!

150
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,580
Just because you got promoted
doesn't mean we're on the same level.

151
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,956
Do you really not know?

152
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,584
Or are you just pretending not to know?

153
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,254
This murder case
and the body from Lee Myeong-guk's house

154
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,965
are all related to Park Jun-seo's case.

155
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,718
Park Jun-seo's case
is no longer a suicide case.

156
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,469
That's what I'm saying!

157
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,639
Whether or not
Park Jun-seo's case is a suicide

158
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,934
or whether we should investigate this case
and Lee Myeong-guk's case together

159
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,520
is my decision to make, not yours!

160
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,814
Instead of investigating your drug case,

161
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,109
you're focused on the insurance payout
and messing with mine.

162
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,111
That's why people keep dying!

163
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,571
What will you do about this?

164
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,489
This case is related to drugs.

165
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,743
I can't believe I'm hearing this crap.

166
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,995
Where? Tell me.

167
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,788
Where did you find drugs?

168
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,290
Oh, over there?

169
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,167
Were there drugs in there?

170
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,670
Or was your friend,
Park Jun-seo, an addict?

171
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,340
Of course, you think

172
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,967
Park Jun-seo, Lee Myeong-guk,
and the rice mill owner

173
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,053
are all connected, but you know what?

174
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,640
You were always there at the scenes.

175
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,767
That's the most suspicious part!

176
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,976
Explain yourself.

177
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,730
I said explain yourself, you bastard.

178
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,983
Why you bastard…

179
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,110
Hey!

180
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,659
The shoe size is approximately 260 mm.

181
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,709
Jang Jae-gyeong!

182
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,086
That little bastard.

183
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,463
You can't just come in.
Please put on shoe covers.

184
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,174
Detective Min, get me some shoe covers.

185
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,845
The bastard has no damn respect
for his senior colleague.

186
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,266
That was quick.

187
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,143
Goodness.

188
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,145
How are you doing? What can I get you?

189
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,106
He probably didn't have a weapon on him.

190
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,025
You have good timing.
This is a fresh batch.

191
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,486
When the owner turned
to get some rice cakes,

192
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,531
he grabbed the shears
and stabbed him in the back.

193
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,532
Once.

194
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,371
Twice.

195
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
Three times.

196
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,375
But he still wasn't down completely,

197
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,794
which is why the suspect used the scale.

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,090
Not aiming for vital points
indicates he's inexperienced.

199
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,221
His shoe size is 260 mm,
and he's about 170 cm tall.

200
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,390
But why?

201
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,392
Why did he burn the CCTV server?

202
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,394
What was he trying to erase?

203
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,117
The taxi driver.

204
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,790
ANHYEON TRANSPORT

205
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
DISPATCH LOG

206
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,921
NO GYU-MIN

207
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,889
What are you looking for, Mr. Park?

208
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,807
Oh, nothing.

209
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,644
See you later.

210
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,980
Hey.

211
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,940
Jeez, what took you so long?

212
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,068
Come on, you're lucky
I came here on my day off.

213
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,778
Okay, fine.

214
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,614
So did you check it?

215
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,948
Will you buy me a drink?

216
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,201
Fine, I will. Now tell me.

217
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,244
It was No Gyu-min.

218
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,330
He was the driver of 0233
on February 23rd.

219
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,623
No Gyu-min?

220
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,292
Who's that? Do you know him?

221
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,377
No, not really.

222
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,962
I think he joined after you quit.

223
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,756
I've only said hello a few times.

224
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,926
Tell me his address and phone number.

225
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,469
Okay, hold on.

226
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,472
-Are you ready?
-Go ahead.

227
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,432
It's 010-0847--

228
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,476
What the heck?

229
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,644
Hey!

230
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:32,937
I'm sorry, sir.

231
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,147
Sorry.

232
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,357
You're sorry?

233
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,069
-Hello?
-What is it? What happened?

234
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,239
It's nothing. Some crazy driver almost…

235
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,074
Damn it. Keep going.

236
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,534
Okay.

237
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,128
35A 0233

238
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,423
Yes, it was parked here.

239
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,677
Is the taxi driver
who drove Jun-seo the suspect?

240
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,518
I'm the police officer you saw earlier.

241
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,896
Was it an orange taxi parked
in front of your house this afternoon?

242
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
What? No, it wasn't.

243
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,900
It was silver.

244
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,319
Okay, thank you.

245
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,074
It's a different taxi.

246
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,701
The suspect is a different taxi driver.

247
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,747
Hello, can I ask you a question?

248
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,333
I'm Jang Jae-gyeong
from Anhyeon Police Station.

249
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,418
Oh, okay.

250
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,421
Can you tell me who drove 35A 0233

251
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,381
on February 23rd?

252
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,757
Just a moment, please.

253
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,634
ACCOUNTING MANAGER
YOON MI-JA

254
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,017
It was Mr. No Gyu-min.
May I ask what this is about?

255
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,396
Is this Mr. No Gyu-min working right now?

256
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,940
No, he quit yesterday.

257
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,442
-Yesterday?
-Yes.

258
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,195
-Do you have his number and address?
-Yes.

259
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
-Shall I write it down for you?
-Yes.

260
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,372
Did anyone else come today
to ask the same question?

261
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,416
No.

262
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,963
If someone comes
and asks the same question,

263
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,381
please call me at this number.

264
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,300
Oh, okay.

265
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,680
Thank you. Goodbye.

266
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,656
Is anyone home?

267
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,036
Who is it?

268
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,288
I'm Jang Jae-gyeong
from Anhyeon Police Station.

269
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,998
Does Mr. No Gyu-min reside here?

270
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:02,878
No Gyu-min?

271
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,879
Yes.

272
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,547
He used to live over there. Why?

273
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,762
Did he go somewhere?

274
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,265
He said he was moving two days ago
but was gone when I checked this morning.

275
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,102
Did he get into some trouble?

276
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,604
Did he say where he was going?

277
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,730
No.

278
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,109
He asked me to send
the security deposit to his account.

279
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,449
Did Mr. No Gyu-min
drive a car by any chance?

280
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,744
Goodness, a car?
The security deposit was all he had.

281
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,289
I can give you his number if you want.

282
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,541
No, thank you. I have it.

283
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,753
If he calls about his security deposit,

284
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,339
please give me a call at this number.

285
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,091
Thank you, sir.

286
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,677
He's not in serious trouble, is he?

287
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,262
No.

288
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,593
Why is it so hard to reach you?

289
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,720
What is it? What's going on?

290
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,431
We might've gotten
caught on camera that day.

291
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,475
-The rice mill's CCTV camera.
-What do you mean?

292
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,060
The day Jun-seo died…

293
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,686
At dawn…

294
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,646
In the Pilo-dong alley…

295
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,982
There was a CCTV camera.

296
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,776
What?

297
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,527
So?

298
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,029
What do you mean, "So?"

299
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
I took care of it.

300
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,909
"Took care of it"? What do you mean?

301
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,912
Don't tell me you…

302
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,663
Don't worry.

303
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,584
I handled it. There won't be any trouble.

304
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,090
Where are you right now?

305
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,092
In the CCTV footage,

306
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,095
I saw a taxi driver
dropping off Jun-seo in that alley.

307
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,640
So I came by the driver's house
to see if I could find anything.

308
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,976
But Jae-gyeong beat me to the punch.

309
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,479
Come to Pilo-dong right now.

310
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,981
Don't do anything. Just get here.

311
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
I said don't worry.

312
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,113
It looks like Jae-gyeong wasted a trip.

313
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,949
I think the taxi driver went into hiding.

314
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,659
Want me to search for him?

315
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,868
Hey!

316
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,498
Stop talking crap and get over here now.

317
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,959
Why are you yelling? You startled me.

318
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,962
I got it. I'm on my way.

319
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,922
See you soon.

320
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,934
PARK JUN-SEO

321
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,254
It looks like you need
to take two at a time now.

322
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,174
But don't take them all at once
even if you have a huge craving.

323
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,017
I know it's too late.

324
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,687
But I'm still going to try.

325
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,315
I'll set things right.

326
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,487
How could you do drugs?

327
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,072
Park Jun-seo, Lee Myeong-guk,
and the rice mill owner…

328
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,242
You think they're all connected,
but you know what?

329
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,410
You were always there at the scenes.

330
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,788
That's the most suspicious part!

331
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,253
MISSED CALL:
SENIOR INSPECTOR YOO GYEONG-HWAN

332
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,298
There's been a murder
near Mr. Park Jun-seo's scene of death.

333
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,633
Please call me when you have time.

334
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,637
SENIOR INSPECTOR YOO GYEONG-HWAN

335
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,349
This is Park Tae-jin.

336
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,809
Hello, sir.

337
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,520
Did you read the text I sent you?

338
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,688
What's going on?

339
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,065
We haven't identified a suspect yet,

340
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,400
so we're canvassing the area.

341
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,654
But the crime scene
is located in a quiet alley, so…

342
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,574
So how is that related
to Park Jun-seo's suicide case?

343
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,742
Well…

344
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,662
It happened while Jang Jae-gyeong
was investigating Park Jun-seo's suicide.

345
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,414
He was the first to report it too.

346
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,540
What?

347
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,084
In the alley near the scene
of Park Jun-seo's suicide,

348
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,045
there was a rice mill.

349
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,339
There was a CCTV camera
beneath the awning.

350
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,467
The suspect knew about it,
and in the process of eliminating it,

351
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,968
the murder occurred.

352
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,764
Hello?

353
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,849
Yes, I'm listening.

354
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,560
There was a CCTV camera?

355
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,605
Did you retrieve the server?

356
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,315
Well, the thing is…

357
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,568
The culprit burned the server.

358
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,196
We're sending it over to NFS,

359
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,907
but it basically melted,
so I don't think we'll retrieve anything.

360
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,492
And Jang Jae-gyeong?

361
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,452
He was at the scene but left quickly.

362
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,914
I'm asking if Jang Jae-gyeong
saw the CCTV footage.

363
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,416
Oh, he mentioned the crime happened

364
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,543
when he went out to his car
to grab a flash drive

365
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,295
to make a copy of the server files.

366
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,130
So he didn't see it either.

367
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,723
So what do you want?

368
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,016
Excuse me?

369
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,143
Oh, well…

370
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,229
I think we need to assume

371
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,191
that this incident is
connected to Park Jun-seo's suicide.

372
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,193
I'll consolidate the two cases and--

373
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,694
Look, Senior Inspector Yoo.

374
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,154
Yes?

375
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,199
On what grounds are you connecting
Park Jun-seo's case and the rice mill one?

376
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,786
Are you saying Park Jun-seo was murdered?

377
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,747
No, not necessarily.

378
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,958
A murder occurred in a rice mill.

379
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,502
The suspect got rid of the server
in case they were caught on camera.

380
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,838
Investigate the victim for a motive

381
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,257
or find out if anything went missing.

382
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,466
Okay, sir.

383
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,260
These are separate cases.

384
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,804
Also…

385
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,268
are you going to call or text me
whenever a case comes up

386
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,019
in Anhyeon City?

387
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,272
No, sir. I'm sorry.

388
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,537
Stand up.

389
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,737
Wipe the floor first.

390
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,295
Are you sure no one saw you?

391
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,839
Yes.

392
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,592
Did you remove all fingerprints and hair?

393
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,804
Yes.

394
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,100
I asked if you removed all the hair.

395
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,354
I removed all of it.

396
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,236
You went in there
to get rid of the footage.

397
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,071
Why did you kill a man?

398
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,199
You could've just scared him
and locked him up.

399
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,368
I didn't have enough time.

400
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,624
It felt like Jang Jae-gyeong
was going to return at any moment.

401
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,920
If you keep this up,
and they catch on to you, what then?

402
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,923
Don't you care about
Si-jeong and the others?

403
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,174
Of course, I do.

404
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,261
I'm doing this because I do, not for me.

405
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,471
It's all for Si-jeong, Jong-soo, Tae-jin,

406
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,390
and you.

407
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,853
I'm sacrificing myself
for the sake of all of us.

408
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,896
Am I wrong?

409
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,106
Don't you agree?

410
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,818
Fine.

411
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,155
Did Jae-gyeong see us on the camera?

412
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,740
No.

413
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,617
I don't know.

414
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,160
But…

415
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,912
I don't think he did.

416
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,456
Damn it.

417
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,210
How did Jang Jae-gyeong know
we went by that road?

418
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,880
He even showed up
at Lee Myeong-guk's house.

419
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,676
You really don't know
who put Lee Myeong-guk's body

420
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,637
back at his house?

421
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,222
I told you I don't know.

422
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,412
Here.

423
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,916
He got off here on purpose

424
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,918
to get on the rice mill's camera.

425
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,473
Twenty-five minutes passed
after Jun-seo got out.

426
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,850
Why did that car suddenly stop there?

427
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,977
Did he see the suspect?

428
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,320
INSPECTOR KIM CHANG-SU

429
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,822
NEW MESSAGE

430
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,538
Inspector Kim Chang-su came by.

431
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,164
Did you check the CCTV footage?

432
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,500
I haven't, sir.

433
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,501
I'm sorry, sir.

434
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,388
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR OH SU-HYEON

435
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,142
CAPTAIN, WHERE ARE YOU?
I GOT YOUR MEDICINE!

436
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,518
Black SUV.

437
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,937
Plate number 83P 3234.

438
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,272
Please run the plate.

439
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,899
BLACK SUV, 83P 3234,
PLEASE RUN THE PLATE

440
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,573
ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY

441
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,345
-U-seong.
-Yes?

442
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,222
Let's say

443
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,516
you got married.

444
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,226
I can't afford to get married.

445
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,271
I'm just saying what if.

446
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,315
Let's say you got married,

447
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,276
and your friend
had an affair with your wife,

448
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,986
but you found out about it.

449
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,364
What would you do?

450
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,785
First, I'll have to size up that friend

451
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,245
to see if I can beat him in a fight.

452
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,789
What if you met with him?

453
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,083
Wouldn't a construction site
be a good place for that?

454
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,293
Is that necessary?

455
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,421
But your friend
happens to be a prosecutor.

456
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,590
In that case,
fighting is out of the question.

457
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,092
Right.

458
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,470
You probably tried
to talk it out at first.

459
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,806
But you got angrier
as you thought about it

460
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,183
and felt a bit betrayed.

461
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,768
After that,

462
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,645
things got physical.

463
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,771
Is that necessary?

464
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,148
And since he was already there,

465
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,192
he pushed you off the ninth floor,

466
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,401
and you died.

467
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,696
But because your friend is a prosecutor,

468
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,532
he tried to cover up the incident.

469
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,911
He attended the postmortem himself
and didn't want to do an autopsy.

470
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,123
This makes sense.

471
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,167
Right?

472
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,505
Tell me yes or no!

473
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,049
So…

474
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,678
Did your friend who died
fall from the ninth floor?

475
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,555
Yes.

476
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,974
And his wife and prosecutor friend
had an affair?

477
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,142
Yes.

478
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,565
Something smells fishy.

479
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,609
Right?

480
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,529
But you need evidence.
Did you find anything on them?

481
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,240
What about photos
or recordings of their affair?

482
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,200
Exactly.

483
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,412
This is where you come in.

484
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,830
Me?

485
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,212
-You're here.
-Yes.

486
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,839
Why are you standing? Sit down.

487
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,550
I was going to ask you to come and help me

488
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,760
for tomorrow's board meeting,
but you came on your own.

489
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,805
I reviewed the documents you gave me.

490
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,558
It was hard getting through all this.

491
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,351
How was it?

492
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,396
It was good.

493
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,609
Let's have dinner later
and finish studying at the hideout.

494
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,321
What is it? Did something happen?

495
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,575
Yesterday, there was a murder
at a rice mill near the site

496
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,701
where Jun-seo died.

497
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,369
So?

498
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,830
The rice mill had a CCTV camera.

499
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,457
What?

500
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,208
What was on it?

501
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,629
The server was burned,
so there was nothing to find.

502
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,297
But…

503
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,258
Apparently, Jang Jae-gyeong was there.

504
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,012
What do you mean he was there?

505
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,017
When Jang Jae-gyeong
left the rice mill to copy the server,

506
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,938
someone killed the rice mill owner
and burned the server.

507
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,859
Chi-hyeon.

508
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,945
Do you know anything about this incident?

509
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,072
No.

510
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,408
Are you sure?

511
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,162
I said no.

512
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,455
So what?

513
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,583
What happened?
Just cut to the chase, you bastard!

514
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,713
The police are investigating it

515
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,341
separately from Park Jun-seo's case.

516
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,344
It'll be treated as a robbery homicide.

517
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,554
Don't worry too much.

518
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,224
If I don't have to worry,
why come here and tell me?

519
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,143
Hey.

520
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,604
Guys.

521
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,358
We've waited 20 years.

522
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,068
We're on the verge of success.

523
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,696
If I don't become chairman of KH Group,

524
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,949
we're all done for.

525
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,284
Tomorrow's board meeting
is the first step, but…

526
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,247
If you guys keep this up,

527
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,291
how can I trust you and get work done?

528
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,593
-Are you there?
-Yes.

529
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,513
This woman's husband
was cremated less than a week ago.

530
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,849
You're sure she's going to a motel
with her husband's friend?

531
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,393
Yes, I'm sure.

532
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,523
That woman puts on a lot of makeup
when she meets Prosecutor Park,

533
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,108
so don't confuse her
with the photos I sent you

534
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,276
and keep your eyes open.

535
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,902
Got it.

536
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,070
And…

537
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,198
It's weird to call her
"this woman" or "that woman,"

538
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,367
and we can't use her name in public,

539
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,494
so come up with a nickname, okay?

540
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,329
Okay.

541
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,416
But are you really going to
give me 100 million won?

542
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,709
Hey.

543
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,545
Isn't this more productive
than chasing down exclusives?

544
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,757
Take this opportunity
to get married and buy a house.

545
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,050
Ms. Oh.

546
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,635
These days, you can't do either
with just 100 million won.

547
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,804
Okay, noted.

548
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,057
Call me if anything comes up.

549
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,391
Understood.

550
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,233
PARK BOK-RYE MEDICATION ERROR
AT WOONJONG MEDICAL CENTER

551
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,614
Where's the director's office?

552
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,952
Patient Six, please come to Counter Two.

553
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:40,995
Thank you.

554
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,545
Hello.

555
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,173
Hello. And you are?

556
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,095
I'm Oh Yun-jin
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

557
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,723
I see. What brings you here?

558
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,852
In September of 2023,
a patient named Park Bok-rye

559
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,312
died from medical malpractice.

560
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,730
You remember her, right?

561
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,274
I'm sorry, who?

562
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,485
Ms. Park Bok-rye.

563
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,197
Oh, last September…

564
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,825
no such incident happened.

565
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,118
Sir.

566
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,578
I already know everything.

567
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,374
I did my research before coming here.

568
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,544
I met with the victim
and heard everything.

569
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,255
I was going to go
straight to the director's office,

570
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,008
but I thought I should hear out
the head of administration first.

571
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,638
You can tell me anything you want,

572
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,683
except for "I don't know"
or "No such thing."

573
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,184
I hate those two responses.

574
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,357
Did the son tell you
everything that happened?

575
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:53,901
Yes.

576
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,447
Let's talk somewhere else.

577
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,616
Very well.

578
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,121
Director, you're here.

579
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,581
When is the equipment arriving?

580
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,332
I think next month…

581
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,584
Just a moment, please.

582
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,880
ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY
OH YUN-JIN

583
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,509
It's next month on the 11th.

584
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,013
The construction
won't be finished by then,

585
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,056
so have it arrive
when the construction ends.

586
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,266
Yes. Understood.

587
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,060
And who is this?

588
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,396
She's a reporter--

589
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,523
I'm Oh Yun-jin
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

590
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,611
I remember Ms. Park Bok-rye.

591
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,782
You must have multiple patients
passing away every day.

592
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,162
I guess Park Bok-rye's case was unusual
seeing how you remember her.

593
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,538
Yes.

594
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,081
It was very unusual.

595
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,835
Most families accept it as one's fate,

596
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,296
but Ms. Park Bok-rye's son

597
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,299
blamed the hospital quite a bit.

598
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,054
A patient died due to a medication error.

599
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,307
I guess you don't remember
covering that up.

600
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,686
Medication error?

601
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,064
-Yes.
-Are you saying

602
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
she was given the wrong medication

603
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,110
instead of what
she was originally prescribed?

604
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,696
Are you saying you didn't?

605
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,454
I told you I met with the victim's son.

606
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:33,918
By any chance,
did he mention an injection?

607
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,838
Yes, of course.

608
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,132
What else could it be
other than an injection?

609
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,261
There was an MFDS inspection
last week, right?

610
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:47,139
What were the results
on injection prescriptions?

611
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:51,143
They found no problems with them
in the last two years,

612
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,437
including the injection
given to Ms. Park Bok-rye.

613
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,400
Look.

614
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,236
-Woonjong Medical Center clearly--
-As you know,

615
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,656
some patients or bereaved families

616
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,782
try to slander us.

617
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,867
It's a shame.

618
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,746
From now on, if any interview requests
come in about this case,

619
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,000
make sure to report to me first
before responding.

620
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,127
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,464
If you make an official interview request,

622
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,425
we'll meet again then.

623
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,366
No complaints, right?

624
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,617
Right.

625
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,244
They made a fuss about the lack of supply,

626
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,996
but now they're grateful.

627
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,291
What about Doctor?

628
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,877
I asked around,

629
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,420
but nobody knows anything.

630
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,505
The ones who make drugs

631
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,425
have all been arrested or fled overseas,
so there's no one left.

632
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,552
There's no trace of where

633
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,013
this person suddenly came from.

634
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,183
But please look at this.

635
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686
WANTED FUGITIVE SUSPECT

636
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,104
Doesn't he look familiar?

637
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,822
FLED THE POLICE

638
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,078

639
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,831
Don't worry about it too much.

640
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,875
Right, remember Jeong-eun?

641
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,585
There was a warrant on her too.

642
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,922
She went to baseball games and clubs
for two years before getting caught.

643
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,924
So don't feel too anxious.

644
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,468
Being wanted isn't the issue.

645
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,887
If CEO Yoon finds out about this,

646
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,307
she'll use it as an excuse
to deal with Doctor directly.

647
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,937
And Doctor might
change his mind if he finds out.

648
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,022
Jeez, no way.

649
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,525
Let's be careful for now.

650
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,611
No new customers. Only existing ones.

651
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,239
Okay. Understood.

Who's the distributor?

Yes?

673
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,800
Hey.

674
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,262
Won't people hear us talk in here?

675
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,223
It's okay.

676
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,308
I did some research.

677
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,937
If you get addicted to drugs,
you lose your appetite.

678
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,357
I don't remember ever seeing you eat.

679
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,109
And I didn't want to eat alone,

680
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,694
so I did something out of character.

681
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,488
Eat up.

682
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,657
Jun-seo's death

683
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,700
wasn't a suicide.

684
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,954
Why? Did you find something?

685
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:24,041
Yesterday, there was a murder
at a rice mill near the site

686
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,125
where Jun-seo died.

687
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,086
A murder?

688
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,466
I was at that scene too.

689
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,345
Molotov cocktails were thrown
into Lee Myeong-guk's house.

690
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,266
A murder occurred yesterday
because of the rice mill's CCTV camera.

691
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,308
All of this happened

692
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,603
when I was getting close to something.

693
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,066
Are you saying someone
is interfering in your investigation

694
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,734
of Park Jun-seo's case?

695
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,783
Like when they tried to stop
Jun-seo's autopsy?

696
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,909
And…

697
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,913
this is both a murder case
and a drug case.

698
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,833
See the 1-8-8-2?

699
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,922
In high school, this was an SOS signal
only Jun-seo and I knew.

700
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,142
This was a lemon pop transaction tip.

701
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,687
And you already know
I'm addicted to lemon pop.

702
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,732
It's still being delivered to my place
under Park Jun-seo's name.

703
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,986
-So what you're saying--
-What I'm saying is

704
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,488
the deaths of Park Jun-seo
and Lee Myeong-guk,

705
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,906
yesterday's murder case,

706
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,617
Park Jun-seo's insurance payout,

707
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,993
the handoff tip in this text,

708
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,954
and my drug addiction
have all been part of the same case.

709
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,207
You're acting out of character
and coming here

710
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,543
because you want to know what's going on.

711
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,630
But you can't get involved
just for the insurance payout.

712
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,176
And if you keep accompanying me,
they'll target you too.

713
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,304
So you need to back off right now.

714
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,040
You're not the only one
who got texts like that.

715
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,125
It's too late for me to back off now.

716
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,628
Fine.

717
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,339
I admit that 51% of the reason why

718
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,926
I brought this lunch box
was to get information out of you.

719
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,511
But…

720
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,223
the remaining 49%
was to see if you were okay.

721
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,855
If you have another episode
and collapse like last time,

722
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,817
who will save you
when you can't go to the hospital?

723
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,237
Thanks for your concern,

724
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,115
but I'll just say
what others would in this situation.

725
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,201
Worry about yourself.

726
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,626
Now eat.

727
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,547
Eat up, build up your strength,
and let's discuss how to move forward.

728
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,467
Did you look into this text?

729
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,427
Yes.

730
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,178
Of course, I did.

731
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,598
The victim won't say a word,
and the director is playing dumb.

732
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,350
But there's definitely something.

733
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,477
I'll keep digging.

734
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,398
By the way…

735
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,693
I get that Park Jun-seo mentioned

736
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,154
you, me, and Lee Myeong-guk in his will

737
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,739
to get us to reveal
the truth about his death.

738
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,452
But what's with the drugs?

739
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,372
Why was Park Jun-seo connected to drugs?

740
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,667
If what you say is true,
that means Jun-seo dealt drugs.

741
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,886
Also…

742
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,514
Why did you return
to the station that day?

743
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,561
When Lee Myeong-guk's house burned,

744
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,814
you were so sick, yet you returned here.

745
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,278
There was lemon pop here, right?

746
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,323
You came here for it, didn't you?

747
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,329
Yes.

748
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,082
Did you take it?

749
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,215
Jae-gyeong.

750
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,383
I had no other choice.

751
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,845
I just couldn't…

752
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,184
stop there.

753
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,062
What will you do if it happens again?

754
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,314
Will you take more?

755
00:46:58,941 --> 00:46:59,858
Yes.

756
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,072
HEO JOO-SONG

757
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,493
What do you want?

758
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,496
This is my first time calling you today.

759
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,042
Go ahead.

760
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,212
It's about that company
Jun-seo established.

761
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,588
Audiophile Corporation.

762
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,257
I found out its address.

763
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,093
But it's a rather unexpected place.

764
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,763
I was going to tell Jae-gyeong
but thought I'd ask you first.

765
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,267
I know you don't like
telling Jae-gyeong everything.

766
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,770
What should we do?
Should we go by ourselves?

767
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,522
Hang up for now.

768
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,362
I suddenly got curious
about Jun-seo's company address.

769
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,240
But why Pilo-dong of all places?

770
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,200
It's not even close to Jun-seo's place.

771
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,451
I'm not sure.

772
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,079
So what did Jun-seo tell you
when he visited?

773
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,624
I asked you at the funeral,
but you never answered.

774
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,295
The incident from 20 years ago
and what's happened since then.

775
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,632
He said he'd set things right
this time around.

776
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,842
From 20 years ago?

777
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,552
You mean Chae Gyeong-tae?

778
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,681
Goodness, it looks like
that really weighed on Jun-seo's mind.

779
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,977
Maybe he felt bad this whole time
that you were forced to transfer

780
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,520
because of the incident.

781
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,241
CONGRATULATIONS
ON PILO-DONG DEVELOPMENT

782
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,080
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE APPROVAL
OF THE REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

783
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,003
RESIDENTS DID NOT CONSENT
CALL OFF THE REDEVELOPMENT

784
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,944
Hey, here it is.

785
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,822
-Is this it?
-Yes.

786
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,492
Hey, can you register a corporate address

787
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,662
in an area like this?

788
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,789
Is anyone home?

789
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,753
Is anyone home?

790
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:29,925
Excuse me?

791
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,354
Jeez, that's hot!

792
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,531
Who are you?

793
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,243
We're not bad people. We were wondering--

794
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,953
-I asked who you are.
-Park Jun-seo.

795
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,414
You know Park Jun-seo, right?

796
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:02,708
No.

797
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,001
He's dead.

798
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,423
How do you know him?

799
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,677
When?

800
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,554
A few days ago.

801
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,431
Do you live alone? Any adults around?

802
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,348
What's your name?

803
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:25,856
Jang Jae-gyeong.

804
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,483
How did you know?

805
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,568
Oh Yun-jin.

806
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,111
Goodness.

807
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,158
Follow me.

808
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,419
MIN HYEON-U

809
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,436
What's your name, buddy?

810
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,564
It's Min Hyeon-u, right?

811
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,610
How do you know our names?

812
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,071
He said you'd come.

813
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,072
When?

814
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:17,908
The last time.

815
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,076
When was that? How many days ago?

816
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,119
About

817
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,829
ten days ago.

818
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,290
If a man comes, it's Jang Jae-gyeong.

819
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,958
If a woman comes, it's Oh Yun-jin.

820
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,880
I'm Heo Joo-song. Nice to meet you.

821
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,175
He said the man was a cop.

822
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,595
And the woman was a reporter.

823
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,138
You didn't answer me.

824
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,140
How did you know him?

825
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,893
I saw him around occasionally.

826
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,395
Did he say anything else?

827
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,026
Do you live here alone?

828
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,861
My grandmother is inside.

829
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,076
Hello, ma'am! How are you?

830
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,662
There's a motorcycle outside.

831
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,621
Do you make deliveries?

832
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,414
-Well…
-What deliveries?

833
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,624
Just anything.

834
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,125
Do you deliver drugs too?

835
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,627
What?

836
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,337
No.

837
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,173
They look like regular pills.

838
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,259
And they're yellow.
You never delivered any?

839
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,802
I said I haven't.

840
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,055
Have you heard of Lee Myeong-guk?

841
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,683
No.

842
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,021
Oh, I see.

843
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,232
So you used to run a big pig farm?

844
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,984
I sure did.

845
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,653
This whole area was a pig farm.

846
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,822
Do you see that shopping mall down there?

847
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:39,823
Yes.

848
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,201
That was all one big pig farm.

849
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,370
Our pig farm.

850
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,706
You must've gotten
good compensation for the land.

851
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,332
Hyeon-u's father

852
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,501
sold it too early.

853
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,421
-They tricked us.
-What do you mean?

854
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,757
We had no idea
they were planning a new city.

855
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,675
Oh, dear.

856
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,015
These must be newly harvested chestnuts.

857
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,141
They're delicious.

858
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,435
They're not newly harvested.

859
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,148
Why don't you live elsewhere

860
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,650
instead of on this steep hill?
It must be so hard.

861
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,029
Where else would we go?
This is where we've always lived.

862
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,990
After being forced to move here,

863
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,160
we ran a farm and sold the crops.

864
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,037
But I'm too old now.

865
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,873
The name on the doorplate says

866
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,917
Min Seung-uk.

867
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,960
Was that your husband's name?

868
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,047
That's my son.

869
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,299
Did he step out for a minute?

870
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,638
He's no longer with us.

871
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,309
Goodness, that's enough. It's hard work.

872
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,894
-No, it's okay.
-No, you can stop.

873
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,729
I'm doing it because it's fun.

874
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,731
My goodness.

875
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,151
Are those chestnuts?

876
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,906
Anyway, Mr. Park
hasn't been around for a while.

877
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,576
It's nice how Mr. Park's friends
are also quite good-looking.

878
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,829
-Am I good-looking, ma'am?
-Oh, goodness.

879
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,082
Mr. Park is

880
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,584
a very good person.

881
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,337
He helps us whenever we struggle,

882
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,798
and he's good to Hyeon-u.

883
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:21,549
Oh.

884
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,468
But why didn't he come with you?

885
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,554
-Well…
-The thing is…

886
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,474
-He died.
-What?

887
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,978
I'm a police officer.

888
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,190
At the time of Mr. Park Jun-seo's death,
this was his corporate address.

889
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,942
I came to check it out.

890
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,613
Wait a minute…

891
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,159
What is he saying?

892
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,206
-What do you mean?
-Ma'am, we'll visit again.

893
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,541
What…

894
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,419
Wait a minute…

895
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,088
-Jae-gyeong.
-Hey!

896
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,589
Hey!

897
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,760
Did you have to tell her that right now?

898
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,431
We could've broken the news to her later.

899
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,559
Did you have to announce Jun-seo's death
and leave like that?

900
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,728
When should I have told her then?

901
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,815
She could've heard from Hyeon-u
or heard about it some other way

902
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,775
when she was good and ready.

903
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,903
Things like this don't happen
when you're good and ready.

904
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,573
I came as a police officer,

905
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,742
and that old lady isn't Jun-seo's family.

906
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,036
I also don't have time for this.

907
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,330
I can't waste my time
coming all the way up here for nothing.

908
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,124
You're--

909
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,792
You're right.

910
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,212
Things like this don't happen
when you're good and ready.

911
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,548
I work in insurance,
so I know this better than you.

912
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,343
But what gives you the right
to be so busy, selfish,

913
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,471
and inconsiderate to others?

914
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,931
I'm only saying this now,
but when Chae Gyeong-tae died,

915
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,267
you did the same thing to Jun-seo.

916
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,852
It's not easy to betray a close friend.

917
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,939
If you'd tried even a little bit
to understand Jun-seo…

918
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,274
If you'd given him some time…

919
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:05,320
We wouldn't have split up,
and you wouldn't have had to transfer.

920
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,584
Park Jun-seo, that damn idiot.

921
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,628
"Set things right"? After all this time?

922
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,046
What's the point?

923
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,980
Hey.

924
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,900
Call me if anything happens.

925
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,403
Do you have motorcycle insurance?

926
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,240
-No.
-Get insured.

927
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,825
Always wear a helmet,

928
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,326
don't skip school…

929
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,665
And don't you dare
make your grandmother worry.

930
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,394
Anyway, tell them to sell
when I can still offer a fair price.

931
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:22,230
If my husband gets upset,
he'll offer a lot less.

932
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,231
I understand.

933
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,401
This is it? I wanted extra.

934
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,944
-See you.
-Goodbye.

935
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,756
The three of us
haven't been together in a while.

936
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,926
-Anyone up for an early drink?
-Drop me off over there.

937
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,017
Bye. I'll call you later.

938
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,021
-Jeez.
-What?

939
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:07,442
Hey, I get you were mad,
but you didn't have to bring up Jun-seo!

940
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,361
You know that "20 years ago"
and "Chae Gyeong-tae" set him off.

941
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,155
Then how long do I have to

942
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,657
put up with his selfish
and inconsiderate ways?

943
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,201
Still, though.

944
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,620
He's feeling unwell as it is.

945
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,747
How exactly is he unwell?

946
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,207
He seems fine to me.

947
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,209
I'm the one who hurts all over.

948
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,668
Hey.

949
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,421
Drop me off at a nearby subway station.

950
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,466
What about our early dinner?

951
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,967
The three of us!

952
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:36,638
I wanted the three of us to have dinner.
Why would I have dinner with just you?

953
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,242
Huh?

954
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,288
Is that…

955
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,672
Jang Jae-gyeong showed up
at Fairy's house.

956
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,716
Jang Jae-Gyeong did?

957
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,762
And what does "Fairy" mean?

958
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,612
Excuse me?

959
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,656
This was a while back,

960
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:41,119
but some man came and asked
to see the footage just like you.

961
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,746
He asked if he could make a copy of it.

962
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,582
So I told him to go ahead.

963
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,666
Do you see

964
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,335
the man in any of these pictures?

965
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,420
Hold on.

966
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,798
It's this person.

967
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,258
Oh, that's right.

968
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,011
He's the same one
who got out of the taxi in the footage.

969
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,722
I knew he looked familiar.

970
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,516
This is the person who copied the footage.

971
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:13,901
Hello.

972
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,404
What brings you here?

973
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,865
I'm sorry, but may I come in?

974
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,286
I'm looking for something
related to the investigation.

975
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,831
Come in.

976
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,125
Thank you.

977
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,047
Wear these.

978
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,048
-Thank you.
-Sure.

979
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,719
-Would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.

980
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,311
Do you still have
Jun-seo's desktop, laptop,

981
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,479
or flash drive?

982
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,900
There should be a laptop
and a few flash drives.

983
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,026
Please have a seat.

984
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,484
-Great job.
-Look over here.

985
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,487
-Hey, it's Mom.
-Hi, Mom!

986
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:26,868
Bye, Mom!

987
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,289
There's a lot, right?

988
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,751
My gosh.

989
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,918
Yun-hui, say hi to Mom.

990
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,545
-Hi, Mom!
-Hi, Mom!

991
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,548
Hey, give Dad a peck.

992
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,348
You're eating so well.

993
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,058
What are you looking for?

994
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,770
Nothing in particular.

995
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,897
It seems you're looking for a video.

996
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,607
This won't take long.

997
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,956
Ms. Oh, over here.

998
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,049
-He hasn't come out yet?
-No.

999
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,678
Hey, what did you mean by "Fairy"?

1000
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,180
You know. She's a fairy.

1001
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:31,933
Because she had an…

1002
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,142
Affair?

1003
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,393
Yes.

1004
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,437
-Nice nickname.
-Right?

1005
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,649
Why did he come at this hour, though?

1006
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:40,900
I'm not sure.

1007
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,906
I'm sorry for intruding.

1008
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,034
I'm sorry you didn't find anything.

1009
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,663
Not at all. It was still helpful.

1010
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,207
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1011
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,997
Goodness, Chae Gyeong-tae…

1012
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,419
Gyeong-tae's funeral is tomorrow.

1013
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,379
If you want to attend,

1014
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,382
tell the class president.

1015
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,970
Class President,
bring the list to the teachers' office.

1016
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:53,639
Class President.

1017
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,269
Park Jun-seo!

1018
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,604
Yes, sir.

1019
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,190
Get it together, you fool.

1020
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,950
-You went to Chae Gyeong-tae's that day!
-I said I didn't!

1021
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,244
Park Jun-seo. We're friends.

1022
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,913
Why did you hide it from me?

1023
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,707
You can't focus at all in class,

1024
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,627
and you talk nonsense
even when Yun-jin and I talk to you.

1025
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,255
The fire at Gyeong-tae's house.

1026
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,551
Gyeong-tae died in it,
but it wasn't an accident, was it?

1027
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,595
What happened?

1028
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,971
You saw something, didn't you?

1029
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:35,306
I told you I didn't!

1030
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:36,766
I didn't.

1031
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:39,810
You don't know anything.

1032
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:43,773
Park Jun-seo!

1033
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:48,861
NO GYU-MIN

1034
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:54,033
WON JONG-SOO

1035
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,073
Is Jang Jae-gyeong clueless?

1036
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,157
Damn it!

1037
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,911
I refuse to be a married man's
mistress anymore. Get a divorce.

1038
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,330
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

1039
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,666
Are you telling me
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

1040
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,292
Won Jong-soo. Show them what you've got.

1041
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,671
Jang Jae-gyeong?
He still hasn't returned his firearm.

1042
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,173
What are you doing?
I just asked what you're doing here.

1043
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,050
You're too afraid
to sue the ones who deserve it.

1044
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,011
But you're going to sue me?

1045
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,054
You said you had gone
a week without the pills.

1046
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,139
How did you bear it?

1047
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,932
If they loosen their grip
for just a second,

1048
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,350
you can suddenly breathe again.

1049
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,102
Please welcome CEO Won Jong-soo.

1050
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,228
Sir!

1051
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,938
Jong-soo, get it together. Jong-soo!

1052
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,773
I said no one's allowed in here!

1053
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,192
You know injection's
more effective, right?

1054
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,777
They're sticking a needle
in Captain's arm, right?

1055
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,529
We don't know if it's real or just saline.

1056
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:19,118
