ANHYEON POLICE STATION
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT

3
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,441
-We need to talk.
-Section Chief.

4
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,526
-Ma'am, you can't--
-Come with me.

5
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,861
He's not going anywhere.

6
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,197
Didn't you hear
we have a meeting in ten minutes?

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,281
I did.

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,951
But I have to talk to him before that.
Come with me.

9
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,954
Section Chief Jung,
what do you think you're doing?

10
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,793
Who do you think
you're talking to, you punk?

11
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,461
Don't worry. He won't run.

12
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,923
This is still wrong.
He's a suspect, after all!

13
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,174
Who are you calling a suspect?

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,010
Did you get Captain Jang's hair
with his consent?

15
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,806
Who knows if that's
Captain Jang's hair or yours?

16
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,557
What you did was illegal!

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,601
Come with me.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,730
Seriously?

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,067
What are you, a thug?

20
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,694
Section Chief.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,404
Section Chief.

22
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,451
When did it happen?

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,037
Maybe on the 23rd of last month--

24
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,497
The 23rd?

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,999
That's the day you got promoted
and treated us to BBQ.

26
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,084
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,253
Did something happen after dinner?

28
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,838
I went to the restroom after dinner,

29
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,589
and somebody came from behind me.

30
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,467
I don't remember what happened.

31
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,718
But when I woke up,

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,513
three days had passed, and it was Monday.

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,598
I was at Anhyeon City Station.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,476
So you didn't take it willingly.

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,187
I have, though.

36
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,773
Jang Jae-gyeong, listen to me carefully.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,110
The senior superintendent
wants to interrogate you himself.

38
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:35,071
However you got addicted,
it wasn't your intention.

39
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,031
It doesn't matter that you took
drugs afterward.

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,575
-Section Chief--
-Who else knows?

41
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,411
Chang-su knows.

42
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,830
That's why Chang-su's here.

43
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,792
Chang-su was bought by CEO Yoon.

44
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,795
He admitted it.

45
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
Jang Jae-gyeong.

46
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,017
From this moment on,

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,562
you'll say you were first exposed to drugs
at the Anhyeon Shopping Complex.

48
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,482
You didn't take care of yourself because
you were focused on the investigation.

49
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,942
That positive hair test?

50
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,363
It doesn't explain
when you first got addicted to drugs.

51
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,866
-But ma'am--
-Be quiet.

52
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,201
You're in this mess
because you didn't listen to me.

53
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,331
I'm the leader of a small team,
but one got arrested for murder

54
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,625
and another is in custody
for drug abuse.

Jung Sang-ui.

60
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,979
Where did you get those photos?

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,483
Even if I told you, would you be
brave enough to publish it?

62
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,859
What?

63
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,363
Am I supposed to write an article

64
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,158
no questions asked
if you ask me to write one?

65
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,286
What if I'm not the one asking?

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,997
What if it's Jun-seo?

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,543
Now you know

68
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,298
Jun-seo wanted to get revenge on
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin and the others.

69
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,509
Stopping the bio-industrial complex
and Pilo-dong project

70
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,554
is the way to avenge Jun-seo.

71
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,016
It's what he wanted.
Can't you do that much for a friend?

72
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,477
Hey, Sang-ui.

73
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,731
You have no right to call him your friend.

74
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,900
What you're calling a friendship

75
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,111
isn't actually friendship.

76
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
It's an obsession.

77
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,742
You think Jun-seo

78
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,328
wanted to get revenge
on Won Jong-soo and Park Tae-jin?

79
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,455
Don't be ridiculous.

80
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,292
You're the one who wants revenge.

81
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,421
You just want to believe
that Jun-seo wanted revenge.

82
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm right, so shut up.

83
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,466
No, you shut up!

84
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,970
Where do you get off
talking about friendship

85
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,306
when you drugged a friend to control him?

86
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,100
You know what?

87
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,563
You can't say a word to their face,
so you go behind their back instead.

88
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,232
I've always hated people like you.

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,156
I'm publishing this article
no matter what.

90
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,240
But…

91
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,743
it's not for you or Jun-seo.

92
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,748
Some people with money and power
can get away with anything.

93
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,753
Other people ride on their coattails
to get whatever they can from them.

94
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,674
I can't stand people like that anymore.
That's why I'm writing it.

95
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,802
Do you understand?

96
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,855
You're next.

97
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,483
I'm coming after you.

ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY

99
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,998
What is this article?

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,501
Close the door.

101
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,468
You made a deal, didn't you?

102
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,053
This article's on the front page

103
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,264
in exchange for pulling
the Won Jong-soo drug article.

104
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,724
This article is more interesting
for a lot of reasons.

105
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,060
"Second-generation conglomerate heir
arrested on drug charges."

106
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,812
-That's just boring.
-Sir!

107
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,816
If Anhyeon City and a company
want to coexist, we should help them.

108
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,403
What is it?

109
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,281
Are you speechless because I'm right?

110
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,702
And KH Group is the only conglomerate
based in Anhyeon City.

111
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,662
Our newspaper sales rely on Anhyeon City.

112
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,623
We could go out of business
if we make enemies of KH Group.

113
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,297
This is the original.

114
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,382
It's the tip I got this morning.

115
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,758
I'm going to use this

116
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,429
and everything I've experienced
and investigated

117
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,015
to write an article.

118
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,933
After you see that,

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,228
and if you still have any courage left,
let's publish the article.

120
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,233
If not…

121
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,070
Today will be my last day.

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,660
TEMPORARY EVIDENCE LOCKER

123
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,172
Ma'am, I need to speak with Chang-su.

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,050
Okay. Talk to him.

125
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,139
-I need a word with him.
-No. Please step aside.

126
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,308
Then I'll speak to him in your presence.

127
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,392
Captain Jang.

128
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,477
Why did you do it?

129
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,939
How did CEO Yoon buy you off?

130
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,525
Does that matter now?

131
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,529
One word from me,
and your career will go up in smoke.

132
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,156
Don't mouth off. Why did you do it?

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,659
You know why. Drug addicts.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,120
They take drugs because they like it.

135
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,623
There's no point in catching them.

136
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,376
There will always be more.

137
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,460
So?

138
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,173
So I thought it'd be better
to use someone like CEO Yoon

139
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,510
to stop the spread of drugs
and keep current addicts under control.

140
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,973
Is that why
the lemon pop market is thriving

141
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,642
and why perfectly fine people
are dying from withdrawal?

142
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,394
Is this your idea of control?

143
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,062
How long then?

144
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,106
How long should we keep
doing the same thing?

145
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,776
-Do you think there's an end to this?
-No.

146
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,822
That's how our job is. Didn't you know?

147
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,117
What will happen
if we don't take out today's trash

148
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,077
just because there will be more tomorrow?

149
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,246
It's hard.

150
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,498
It's exhausting, boring, and never-ending.

151
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,375
But…

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,128
that's our job.

153
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,841
You received money
and gave away information.

154
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,470
You betrayed your colleague.

155
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,974
And you killed a person.

156
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,024
Don't ever try to use what you said

157
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,318
as an excuse again.

158
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,947
Because I'm ashamed

159
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,241
that you worked under me.

160
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,287
Shouldn't you be asking for my help?

161
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,291
Shouldn't you be asking me
to speak in your favor?

162
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,585
INVESTIGATION ROOM

163
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,559
Please go in, sir.

164
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,811
Sir.

165
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,442
Take a seat.

166
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,833
An arrest warrant
will be filed for Jong-soo.

167
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,837
He might not be a flight risk,
but he could tamper with evidence.

168
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,465
He also manufactured drugs and took them,

169
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,509
so he'll likely be arrested.

170
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,804
But since he doesn't have
prior convictions

171
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,766
and he took the drugs alone
without distributing them,

172
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,352
it's unlikely he'll serve actual time.

173
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,437
Alone?

174
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,565
What about Chairman Han's second son?

175
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,028
I'm leaving Igu Group alone.

176
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,827
What about the drugs that you distributed?
Somebody has to take the fall for it.

177
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,912
There's someone named Jung Sang-ui.

178
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,373
He's a KH Pharmaceutical researcher,

179
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,166
and he's the one who made the drugs.

180
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,377
This case will be dealt

181
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,046
as if he acted out of personal greed.

182
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,342
So…

183
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,720
What do you want now?

184
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,684
I want to take charge
of both the bio-industrial complex

185
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,519
and Pilo-dong housing site
development project.

186
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,603
In addition,

187
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,107
I want 6% of the KH Group's shares

188
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,609
of the Pilo-dong housing site
development project.

189
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,405
Okay.

190
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,495
Are you done being a prosecutor now?

191
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
Yes, sir.

192
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,792
I'll resign right after I wrap up
Jong-soo's case.

193
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,504
Was this your plan all along?

194
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm not sure, sir.

195
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,679
All I wanted

196
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,140
was to take an easier route than this.

197
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,520
Whatever the route…

198
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,815
you won in the end.

199
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,117
-Jang Jae-gyeong.
-Yes, sir.

200
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,411
Answer yes or no.

201
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,165
Your drug test came out positive.

202
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,918
-Do you accept that?
-Yes.

203
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,674
How did you find out
about Senior Inspector Jang's addiction?

204
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,552
I found out while investigating
Kim Dae-seong who was in custody.

205
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,970
What did he say?

206
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,890
He was present when Captain Jang
was injected with drugs.

207
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,726
He said the dosage was too high

208
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,479
for someone who wasn't
already addicted to it.

209
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,190
So I ran a hair test,
and it came back positive.

210
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,399
That hair sample.

211
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,736
-Are you sure it belongs to Captain Jang?
-Yes.

212
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,696
-Where did you collect it?
-Why are you asking--

213
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,659
"Where did you collect the hair sample?"
"You didn't get his consent."

214
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,869
Save all that talk for the courtroom.

215
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,830
-Kim Chang-su.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,251
You were with Captain Jang
the whole time, right?

217
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,002
Did you know he was doing drugs?

218
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,671
-Chief!
-Be quiet.

219
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,923
He was first exposed to the drugs

220
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,883
while arresting Lee Geun-ho
and Kim Dae-seong.

221
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,968
Be quiet!

222
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,303
He should receive an award if anything!

223
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,098
-Is this the price for risking himself?
-Section Chief Jung!

224
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,309
I knew, sir.

225
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,521
How?

226
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,570
Because I got him addicted.

227
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,992
What?

228
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,327
Kim Chang-su.

229
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,496
Tell him the truth.

230
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
Do you have my phone?

231
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,375
Where's his phone?

232
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,794
-It was confiscated and stored.
-Go get it now.

233
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,382
What are you doing?

234
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,666
Captain?

235
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,254
Captain?

236
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,035
Can you prove that's lemon pop?

237
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,621
That's my desk, sir.

238
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,791
There was one lemon pop pill
in the desk drawer,

239
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,502
but I lost it.

240
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,048
And before this?

241
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,843
It looks like Captain Jang
was already addicted at this point.

242
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,556
Yes, sir. I'd already gotten him addicted.

243
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,268
-What was the reason?
-He suspected my connection with CEO Yoon

244
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,062
and closed in on me,

245
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,773
so I ordered CEO Yoon to get him addicted.

246
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,612
Kim Chang-su.

247
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,572
Look at me.

248
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,075
Look at me!

249
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,994
That's not what happened.

250
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,787
You saw how I gave you the pill.

251
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,960
Why would I lie in this situation?

252
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,338
Senior Inspector Jang did nothing wrong.

253
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,174
All he did was give it his all
as he always has.

254
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,385
Kim Chang-su, stop lying.

255
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,553
Look at me!

256
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,513
-Jae-gyeong!
-Why?

257
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,557
Why?

258
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,183
That's enough!

259
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,691
Everyone except for Captain Jang

260
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
needs to get out.

261
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,989
But sir, this isn't right!

262
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,365
Hey, Kim Chang-su!

263
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,535
Chief, you can't fall for his act!

264
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,037
Be quiet.

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,539
But…

266
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,793
Oh Yun-jin!

267
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,130
Get in here!

268
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,557
You put your neck on the line.

269
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,435
You'll have to watch your back
when this comes out.

270
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,187
Yes, sir.

271
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,647
We'll have to publish this
over the course of a few days.

272
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,940
Are you sure about this?

273
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,987
It took me a while
to gather up the courage.

274
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,989
You can do this, right?

275
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,742
Yes, sir.

276
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,996
Well, we don't have
a lot of subscribers anyway.

277
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,832
If we go out of business, then so be it.

278
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,964
Hey.

279
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,217
What did the chief say?

280
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,678
I got addicted while doing my job,
so he said to get treatment and rest.

281
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,310
-You said you would, right?
-I asked him for more time.

282
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,479
-Hey.
-Just give me three more days.

283
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,273
I'll resolve it by then.

284
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,319
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Forget it.

285
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,530
Captain.

286
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,074
This is the sketch
of Jung Yun-ho's killer.

287
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,578
WANTED FUGITIVE SUSPECT

288
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,471
Are you here to mock me?

289
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,057
Did you want to see how you ruined me?

290
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,767
Hey.

291
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,853
I'm getting out of here in a few days.

292
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,647
And I'm going to kill you
as soon as I get out!

293
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,774
I'm going to tear you limb from limb.

294
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,568
-Do you hear me?
-I'm surprised.

295
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,946
-What?
-I thought

296
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,866
you'd resent your father more than me.

297
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,409
Shut up.

298
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,079
He chose his company over you,
but he's still your father. Is that it?

299
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,583
Let him go.

300
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,508
Ordering someone to kill Yun-ho

301
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,052
is solicitation of murder.

302
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,222
But I won't bring that up…

303
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,893
because I don't want you

304
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,769
to stay in here long.

305
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,354
Now calm down and take a seat.

306
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,451
Even though it's your first offense,
you'll likely serve time.

307
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,077
However…

308
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,623
I'll do my best to get you out quickly.

309
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,875
By the time you get out,

310
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,794
the bio-industrial complex project
will be in full swing.

311
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,379
Jong-soo.

312
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,382
That's when you'll take over.

313
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,676
Not your father.

314
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,429
Are you trying to drive a wedge
between me and my father again?

315
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,643
Do you really love your father?

316
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,605
You still need
your father's influence, right?

317
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,566
That's why you came in here willingly.

318
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,068
It's the same for me.

319
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,945
I'm staying in his shadow

320
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,781
because I still find his influence useful.

321
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,241
If it hadn't been for that,

322
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,286
I'd have already put your father away
with all the evidence I have against him.

323
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,330
-Hey, Park Tae-jin.
-Won Jong-soo.

324
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,668
The bio-industrial complex
and Pilo-dong project.

325
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,003
They should be our feat.

326
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,381
The moment it becomes
Chairman Won's achievement…

327
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,010
You'll never escape his shadow.

328
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,721
Don't you get it?

329
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,017
You've always had a way

330
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,436
with words.

331
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,190
Why are you coming to me with this?

332
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,278
-You don't need me anymore.
-You said it yourself.

333
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,531
You're Won Chang-ho's son.

334
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,741
And you're right.

335
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,996
There's nothing I can do about that.

336
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,164
However,

337
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,750
I'm going to become
the richest person in Korea.

338
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,044
To make that happen,

339
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,047
I need a business partner like you.

340
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
There's no rush, Jong-soo.

341
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,221
They say all you have in prison is time.

342
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,516
Take your time and think about it.

343
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,893
Ask yourself what it is you really want.

344
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,437
And ask yourself

345
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,317
who you really need by your side for that.

346
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,910
How's Jong-soo?

347
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,912
He's fine.

348
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,249
He could use this time
to think things over.

349
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,088
Oh Chi-hyeon.

350
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,304
Don't look so down.

351
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,556
I'm quitting my job next month.

352
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,435
I'm going to devote myself
to this business.

353
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,437
But to do that,

354
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,356
I need someone like you by my side.

355
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,278
If you're still thinking about
what happened at the hideout,

356
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,571
don't worry about it.

357
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,031
It's all water under the bridge.

358
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,702
What about Sang-ui?

359
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,120
There's a warrant out for him.

360
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,498
He'll need to be dealt with

361
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,583
legally or personally.

362
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,212
Let's go.

363
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,931
Hello?

364
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,015
It's me, Sang-ui.

365
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,642
Jung Sang-ui?

366
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,685
Where are you?

367
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,355
I'm in Korea.

368
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,525
You didn't put out
a warrant on me, did you?

369
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,320
Didn't I tell you to go overseas?

370
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,447
Why are you still in Korea?

371
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,366
You put out a warrant then.

372
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,120
I'll leave if you withdraw it.

373
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,706
Hey, I gave you a chance.

374
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,918
I'll reduce your sentence,
so turn yourself in.

375
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,713
Tae-jin.

376
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,924
Can I really turn myself in?

377
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,217
What?

378
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,177
Just because you got rid of my phone

379
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,013
doesn't mean I don't have anything on you.

380
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,100
Remember what you told Jun-seo
at the café in Hwanseong City

381
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,270
when we first started
the lemon pop business?

382
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,316
I listened to it again yesterday
and wondered if you'll be okay after all.

383
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,573
You think that's enough to threaten me?

384
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,994
You'll probably find a way out of it.

385
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,956
But wouldn't it take up your time
and be a hassle?

386
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,005
So what is it that you want?

387
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,673
Let's meet in person.

388
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,675
Let's meet up and settle some matters.

389
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,262
I want something from you, too,
so let's do it in person.

390
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,308
I'll give you all the recordings
that I have when we meet.

391
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,020
Name a place and time.

392
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,229
You decide.

393
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,940
It should be a safe place
with no CCTV cameras.

394
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,995
Are you Reporter Oh Yun-jin?

395
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,830
-Yes.
-I called you earlier.

396
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,833
I used to be a manager
at Mr. Park Jun-seo's real estate company.

397
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,126
My name is Kim Seo-jin.

398
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,173
I'll get going as well.

399
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,259
Yes, I remember you.

400
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,929
We met at Jun-seo's funeral, right?

401
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,430
Yes.

402
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:17,140
What brings you here?

403
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,394
I reached out to Ms. Choi because of this,

404
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,314
but she was in the hospital
and gave me your number instead.

405
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,867
Hello?

406
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,828
-Where are you?
-I'm a little busy.

407
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,414
I figured out why
Jun-seo told everyone to meet him

408
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,292
at the construction site where he died.

409
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,543
What was the reason?

410
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,003
That construction site is where

411
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,714
Chae Gyeong-tae's house
was located before the new city was built.

412
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:17,784
REST IN PEACE

413
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,127
Chi-hyeon.

414
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,903
Please ask Tae-jin to find a way

415
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,990
for me and my children to live.

416
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,704
Tell him I understand.

417
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,001
So please…

418
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,255
tell him to look after us.

419
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,850
Okay.

420
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,673
Oh Chi-hyeon.

421
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,135
You're under arrest
for the murder of Jung Yun-ho.

422
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,651
Si-jeong.

423
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,412
-Read him his rights and take him away.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,658
What's wrong?

425
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,744
Is it the withdrawal again?

426
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,704
I'm okay.

427
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,913
So what's this map?

428
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,998
Right.

429
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,127
ANHYEON CITY

430
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,253
Look at this.

431
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,591
This is the Pilo-dong construction site
where Jun-seo died.

432
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,010
PILO TOWNHOUSE CONSTRUCTION SITE

433
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,721
This location is

434
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,348
Chae Gyeong-tae's house
on the old land registry map.

435
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,104
CHAE GYEONG-TAE

436
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,189
Right?

437
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,491
Jun-seo believed everything started there.

438
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,035
That's why he had everyone go there.

439
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,871
You said the last time
Jun-seo visited you,

440
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,749
he said he'd set things right again.

441
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,087
NO CALLER ID

442
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,840
Hello?

443
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,091
It's me, Sang-ui.

444
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,555
Hello.

445
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:12,936
Mr. Gong Jin-uk.

446
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,773
Are you awake?

447
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,609
I'm Section Chief Jung
from Anhyeon Police Station.

448
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,737
Who arranged your stowaway passage?

449
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,240
Who was it? Tell me.

450
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,576
Doctor.

451
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,664
Doctor arranged it.

452
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,124
Have you ever seen Doctor?

453
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,336
-Yes.
-Who is it?

454
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,507
Park…

455
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,095
Prosecutor Park Tae-jin.

456
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,599
What about the gun?

457
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,977
Where's the gun?

458
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,854
The one you used to kill CEO Yoon.

459
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,815
Doctor…

460
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,609
He has it.

461
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,364
You're here.

462
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,538
Give me your phone.

463
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,186
Oh, the hideout?

464
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,063
I emptied it out.

465
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,232
We're turning 40 soon.

466
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,276
It's pretty childish to have a hideout.

467
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,987
By the way,

468
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,531
you know what this is, right?

469
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,783
It's an audio jammer.

470
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,494
You keep going behind my back,

471
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,163
so I can't trust you.

472
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,250
And hand over what you brought.

473
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,713
-What do you mean?
-You said you had my recordings.

474
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,966
-I don't have anything like that.
-What?

475
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,385
If I had any proof on you,

476
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,305
I would've given it
to Jang Jae-gyeong already.

477
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,142
Seriously…

478
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,770
Hey.

479
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,980
Are you messing with me?

480
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,360
Why haven't you come to your senses?

481
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,320
Why?

482
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,658
Hey.

483
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,284
How dare you think

484
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,287
you can threaten me?

485
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,500
It didn't matter at all

486
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,378
whatever you thought you had on me.

487
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,506
What did you think you could do?

488
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,008
What did you think you could do to me?

489
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,261
You can't do anything to someone like me!

490
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,472
Hey, look at me.

491
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,975
I said not all friends are equal.

492
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,102
Jung Sang-ui.

493
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,271
I'm Park Tae-jin, you bastard.

494
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,190
Damn it.

495
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,070
Did you call me to make a deal?

496
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,240
You couldn't even say
a single word to me.

497
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,035
How dare you think
you can call me up like this?

498
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,286
Park Tae-jin.

499
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,917
What's this?

500
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,794
Is this who you really are?

501
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,045
Hey.

502
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,922
Did you tell him to come too?

503
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,632
Why?

504
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,051
Did you think I might kill you?

505
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,431
I have something to ask you.

506
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,515
Hey.

507
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,101
I guess it's true.

508
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,604
Captain Yoo said you became
a drug addict, but I doubted it.

509
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,440
Hey, he's one of our customers.

510
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,150
I feel like dying right now.

511
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,735
Hey, you can't die.

512
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,112
This is actually for the better.

513
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,864
What do you want to know?

514
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,449
Ask whatever question you have.

515
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,533
But before that,

516
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,618
give me your phone.

517
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,833
Are you okay?

518
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,844
Come on in.

519
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,514
Gosh.

520
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,476
You two are a sight to behold.

521
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,730
One of you is the mastermind
who manufactured and distributed drugs,

522
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,066
while the other
is a drug-addicted detective.

523
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,653
Why are all of my friends
so screwed up like this?

524
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,238
Take a seat.

525
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,747
You said you had a question.
Hurry up and ask.

526
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,042
A team of prosecution investigators
will be here soon.

527
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,754
Ask your questions
before you get taken away.

528
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,714
Jun-seo.

529
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,428
I heard he partnered with you
in the drug business

530
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,016
because he wanted to take
his sick daughter to the US.

531
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,352
-Was that the only reason?
-What?

532
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,395
That's what you wanted to know?

533
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,692
You knew Jong-soo gave Jun-seo

534
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,695
five million won a month
for his daughter's medicine, right?

535
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,364
Yes.

536
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,450
But Jong-soo said
he needed to train Jun-seo

537
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,536
and didn't give him
the money consistently.

538
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,246
Anyway,

539
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,957
the only hope Jun-seo held onto

540
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,001
was that his daughter's medicine
was covered by insurance.

541
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,630
But Jong-soo somehow managed
to stop the coverage.

542
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,134
When I saw that happen,

543
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,761
I approached Jun-seo.

544
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,888
MARCH 2023

545
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,515
Jong-soo's the one responsible.

546
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,059
He stopped

547
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,522
your daughter's medicine
from being covered by insurance.

548
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,816
What?

549
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,236
Park Jun-seo.

550
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,571
Listen to me carefully.

551
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,116
We'll sell drugs for exactly three months.

552
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,826
That'll be enough.

553
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,289
But he said no.

554
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,250
He said Jong-soo was still a friend
and couldn't do that to him.

555
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,295
Friend, my ass.

556
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,839
Anyway,

557
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,258
he suddenly got a call
from the US one day.

558
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,678
They said they could cure his kid
for 500 million won.

559
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,264
So this time,

560
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,434
Jun-seo went to see Jong-soo.

561
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,019
If you lend me 500 million won…

562
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,897
If Yun-hui can regain her health…

563
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,445
I'll do anything you want.

564
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,324
Jong-soo, you know
I don't normally ask you for favors.

565
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,408
Hey.

566
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,952
I told you not to fall for that.

567
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,914
Isn't that a clinical trial drug?

568
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,790
How do you know if it'll work or not?

569
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,337
Fine.

570
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,340
You'll get five million won a month again,
so just wait longer.

571
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,178
If the clinical trial results are good,
it'll be imported to Korea too, right?

572
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,642
Come on. Leave already.

573
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,771
Jun-seo came to see me the next day.

574
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,274
He agreed to sell drugs

575
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,526
until he made 500 million won.

576
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,445
Satisfied?

577
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,496
Sir.

578
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,088
According to a local newspaper
based in Anhyeon City,

579
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,506
Mayor Joo In-sang of Anhyeon City

580
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,467
has been revealed to have engaged
in sexual entertainment

581
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,803
with numerous women
at drinking gatherings.

582
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,764
The mayor's office
has denied all allegations,

583
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,767
but the controversy refuses to subside.

584
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,062
Meanwhile, CEO Won Jong-soo,
the heir of KH Group

585
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,106
and leader of the Pilo-dong
bio-industrial complex

586
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,942
and second Anhyeon New City
development project,

587
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,319
which is the largest development project
in Anhyeon City's history,

588
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,322
has been arrested on charges
of drug manufacturing and the use of drugs

589
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,032
causing much shock to the public.

590
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,159
Mayor Joo In-sang,
who approved the permit…

591
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,912
-Call Park Tae-jin.
-Yes, sir.

592
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,498
Many speculate
the project will face a crisis.

593
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,125
SECRETARY
PARK HYEOK-JAE

594
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,002
SECTION CHIEF
JUNG YEON-JU

595
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,837
Any other questions?

596
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,798
Do you know why

597
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,343
Jun-seo called all of you

598
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,388
to the construction site
that none of you had any connection to?

599
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,808
It's because

600
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,229
that was where
Chae Gyeong-tae's house was located.

601
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,110
Jun-seo wanted to reveal
everyone's secrets

602
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,529
at the place where it all started.

603
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,865
Tae-jin,

604
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,451
you were distributing drugs to others
behind Jong-soo's back.

605
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:52,496
Oh Chi-hyeon and Jung Yun-ho
had killed Lee Myeong-guk

606
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,041
and kept his body
in Yeongryun Cold Storage.

607
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,460
And Won Jong-soo

608
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,880
killed Chae Gyeong-tae 20 years ago.

609
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,050
-What?
-What is it?

610
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,344
You didn't know?

611
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,847
Chae Gyeong-tae didn't die
in an accidental fire.

612
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,018
Jong-soo went back into the house
to find his name tag.

613
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,230
He found Chae Gyeong-tae conscious
and begging for his life…

614
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,275
and killed him.

615
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,784
On February 23rd at 11:30 p.m.,

616
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,995
all of you were called
to the Pilo-dong construction site.

617
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,665
And one of you killed Park Jun-seo.

618
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,834
But why?

619
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,505
To hide the fact
that you killed a friend 20 years ago?

620
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,382
Or maybe

621
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:49,345
to cover up the murder of a researcher
who threatened your friend?

622
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,722
If that wasn't it,

623
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,808
maybe it was to hide the fact

624
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,519
that you'd been selling drugs
behind your friends' backs.

625
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,022
The day Jun-seo died,

626
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,234
someone stopped the elevator
from reaching the ninth floor

627
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,152
and had it go back down
to the first floor.

628
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,905
Someone went over to Jun-seo first
to see if he was alive

629
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,992
and then got everyone
to leave the scene quickly.

630
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,120
Someone did Jun-seo's postmortem

631
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,666
but refused to have an autopsy performed.

632
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,044
It was all the same person.

633
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,551
Park Tae-jin.

634
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,719
Just say it.

635
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,890
You killed Jun-seo, didn't you?

636
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,316
Let me ask you something first.

637
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,820
What proof do you have

638
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,781
Jun-seo didn't commit suicide
but was killed?

639
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,867
His shoes.

640
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,203
-What?
-Jun-seo…

641
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,206
When he fell, he was wearing his shoes.

642
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,958
That's right.

643
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,252
I saw it myself.

644
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,466
I see.

645
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,177
You saw that.

646
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,143
Why did I do that?

647
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,687
Why did I take his shoes
back up to the ninth floor?

648
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,401
You're right.

649
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,987
I killed Jun-seo.

650
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,117
Park Jun-seo…

651
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,662
I killed him.

652
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,045
I didn't intend to kill him that quickly.

653
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,880
Actually, no.

654
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,217
I never had any intention to kill him

655
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,053
because I didn't know
the last four digits of the password.

656
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,764
Then one day all of a sudden,

657
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,308
Jun-seo said he was going to
come clean about everything.

658
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,559
I was so close.

659
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,436
I was so close to earning the money

660
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,688
I needed to invest
in the Pilo-dong project!

661
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,859
He'd been selling drugs without a problem

662
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,695
but then suddenly wanted to
come clean about everything.

663
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,198
Would you have been able
to sit back and do nothing?

664
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,783
Would you have done that?

665
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,581
I still get mad thinking about it.

666
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,628
Anyway,

667
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,548
that night at 11:30 p.m.,

668
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,175
I told him to turn on the light

669
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,469
on the ninth floor
when everyone got to the site.

670
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,346
And I told him to push Park Jun-seo

671
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,683
when the elevator reached
the fourth or fifth floor

672
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,309
to create a solid alibi!

673
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,937
Then I was going to stop the elevator,

674
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,773
make it go down to the first floor,

675
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,733
check his body,

676
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,821
and tell everyone
to leave the scene immediately.

677
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,701
That was…

678
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,371
my perfect plan.

679
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,126
Oh, right.

680
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:11,088
The shoes that were found
on the ninth floor

681
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,632
weren't part of my plan.

682
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,677
Half of the people who jump

683
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,305
keep their shoes on.

684
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,314
-So?
-What do you mean?

685
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,899
-So how did you kill him?
-What?

686
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,278
You couldn't have pushed Jun-seo
if he had still been alive.

687
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,656
He didn't scream when he fell.

688
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,118
Did you knock him out or drug him?

689
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,578
He was given an anesthetic.

690
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,333
It was just enough to go undetected
if there was an autopsy.

691
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,417
Satisfied?

692
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,883
Who did you order to do it?

693
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,763
Who gave Jun-seo an anesthetic

694
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,558
and pushed him off the ninth floor?

695
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,770
Who was it?

696
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,067
I want to know too.

697
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,820
I wonder where he is right now?

698
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,574
Actually, he could already be dead by now.

699
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,243
Jung Yun-ho.

700
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,372
You ordered Jung Yun-ho to do it.

701
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,333
Isn't that why you tried so hard

702
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,960
to get rid of Jung Yun-ho?

703
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,671
Hey.

704
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,006
Think whatever you want.

705
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,259
Thanks to you guys,
I feel pretty relieved.

706
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,221
Over the past couple of weeks,
people asked if I knew who killed him,

707
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,431
but I couldn't say that I did.

708
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,352
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

709
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,645
One last thing.

710
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,231
I have a question too.

711
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,527
You hadn't kept in touch with Jun-seo
for over 20 years, right?

712
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,947
So why are you going
to such lengths for him?

713
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,742
As far as I know, you find friendship
to be a childish notion.

714
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,203
So why are you taking this so far?

715
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,622
Just look at yourself right now.

716
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,833
I thought you were doing well as a cop,

717
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,877
but now you're an addict
with a messed-up mind and body.

718
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,047
Do you think you can still be a cop?

719
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,758
How about this, Jae-gyeong?

720
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,844
Why don't you work with me?

721
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,805
Don't tell me

722
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,474
you're getting revenge
for Jun-seo or something?

723
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,603
You need to know that Park Jun-seo

724
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,773
wasn't the same guy we knew 20 years ago.

725
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,318
Ever since he chose us over you
during the Chae Gyeong-tae incident,

726
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,821
he was living like a pathetic loser.

727
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,073
He had no courage,
no ambition, and no passion.

728
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,827
He leeched off his friends
and delivered drugs.

729
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,371
That was his pathetic life.

730
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,874
Look, you shouldn't sacrifice your health

731
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,543
to get justice for someone

732
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,087
whose life wasn't worth it!

733
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,255
So get it together.

734
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,971
Hey, I helped him look
pretty cool towards the end, right?

735
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,225
-Thanks to me, people called him Doctor.
-Stop it.

736
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,062
He made an unimaginable amount of money
by selling a completely new drug.

737
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,732
I helped him live a good life,

738
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,650
but instead of thanking me,

739
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,236
he pretended to turn over a new leaf.

740
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,739
He wanted to protect our friendship

741
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:25,908
and try to set things right.

742
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,576
Who the hell did he think he was?

743
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,120
He couldn't even hold onto his wife.

744
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,080
So who did he think he was
to set things right?

745
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,165
Who?

746
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,501
And his wife?

747
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,544
What was her name again?

748
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,505
Right, Choi Ji-yeon.

749
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,050
Do you think I did much to seduce her?

750
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,428
All I did was say a few words,

751
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,347
and she just jumped at the chance.

752
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,599
What else was I supposed to do?

753
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,309
I couldn't believe it.

754
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,894
Park Tae-jin!

755
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,361
ONE MONTH LATER

756
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,170
How's your treatment going?

757
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,717
By the way, I heard.

758
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,430
I heard you got demoted
because I shot Park Tae-jin with your gun.

759
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,057
How are you doing?

760
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,977
Still no regrets?

761
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,606
Of course not.
I did it to get revenge for Jun-seo.

762
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,779
I was able to stand by
my friendship with Jun-seo,

763
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:29,948
so I'm at peace.

764
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,909
Twenty years ago,

765
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,037
even in the face
of Chae Gyeong-tae's death,

766
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,665
you guys made a horrifying decision
without thinking twice.

767
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,753
Despite all that,
Jun-seo decided to side with you.

768
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,005
From that point on,

769
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,966
I decided never to believe in friendship.

770
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,261
And I didn't want to make any friends.

771
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,140
Come to think of it,

772
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,645
I tried hard to forget about
what happened back then.

773
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,525
But I guess…

774
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,948
I had just as much difficulty
escaping those memories as Jun-seo did

775
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,534
seeing how I've lived my life.

776
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,082
That's how it was.

777
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,043
And now?

778
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,672
Do you feel free like I do?

779
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,342
I'm not sure.

780
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,888
All of your friends have either died

781
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,890
or gone to prison,

782
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,769
but you say you feel free.

783
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,650
The revenge you wanted to get for Jun-seo…

784
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,570
Maybe Jun-seo didn't want that.

785
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,868
Just like when I reported all of you
to the police 20 years ago,

786
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,995
maybe it wasn't for Jun-seo.

787
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,250
Maybe I was consumed by my own emotions

788
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,377
and did it for myself.

789
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,213
It's not like that for me.

790
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,049
From now on,

791
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:17,806
I'm going to live the life that my friend,
Jun-seo, would've wanted me to.

792
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,685
And I'm going to do it with my friends

793
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,187
who Jun-seo would've kept in touch with
if he were still alive.

794
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,610
Ask yourself this while you're here.

795
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,239
What do you think
your only friend, Jun-seo,

796
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,908
would have wanted

797
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,703
to see in you?

798
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,044
I'll be going now.

799
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,131
Don't come back.

800
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,342
The more I hear what you say,

801
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,847
the more I feel like I did something wrong
to Jun-seo and blame myself

802
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,307
even though there's no reason to.

803
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,106
Oh, right.

804
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,317
About the password…

805
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,238
The four digits
of Park Tae-jin's password…

806
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,658
is 0-6-1-7.

807
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,078
It's Choi Ji-yeon's birthday.

808
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,302
Senior Inspector Jang.

809
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,097
You requested a meeting
with Kim Chang-su tomorrow, right?

810
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,182
Yes.

811
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,767
He's refusing your request again.

812
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,229
Maybe he's still embarrassed
to see you, sir.

813
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,690
Please relay my message.

814
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,486
I won't let him take the blame
for something he didn't do.

815
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,824
Please tell him I've already reported
all the details of the case

816
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,116
and to take care of himself.

817
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:01,993
Yes, sir.

818
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,418
THE LATE PARK JUN-SEO

819
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,467
It's only been 49 days since Jun-seo died,

820
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,719
but so much has happened.

821
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,971
You're right.

822
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,598
I remember seeing

823
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,684
so many people

824
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,936
at the funeral.

825
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,198
When are you moving?

826
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,075
In two weeks.

827
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,912
Please let us know if you need help.

828
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,832
I've hired a moving service.

829
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,960
Still, let us know
if you'd like some help.

830
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,044
I will.

831
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,922
I'll see you again next time.

832
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,194
That's what I'm saying!

833
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,989
If you keep saying it's not true
or you don't know,

834
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,158
then how am I supposed to
write this article?

835
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,746
No, there's no need to meet in person.

836
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,372
Just tell me over the phone.

837
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,666
Why do you keep wanting to see me?

838
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,168
How in the world…

839
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,629
is her voice so loud?

840
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,178
Hey, keep an eye on what you're doing.

841
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,262
Right.

842
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,227
I've been seeing
a lot of your articles these days.

843
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,106
I've always had
a lot of articles published.

844
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,026
What if you get scouted
by a major newspaper and go to Seoul?

845
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:01,404
Hey, do you think life is that easy?

846
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,616
But you'll probably win the Anhyeon City
Reporter of the Year award, right?

847
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,034
Well, as for that…

848
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,870
As long as there's no bribery or coercion…

849
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,292
Did you watch
Mayor Joo's press conference yesterday?

850
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,337
Jeez. Why in the world did he cry?

851
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,172
You'd think he was the victim.

852
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,549
It's all charged.

853
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,802
Already?

854
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,928
CHARGING IS COMPLETE

855
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,263
That was really fast.

856
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,351
What's wrong?

857
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,229
The insurance payout…

858
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,399
There's no way we can get it, right?

859
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,986
Ask me again, and it'll be the 100th time.

860
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,115
I'll never get another chance
to have that much money.

861
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,868
How am I supposed to bring
my daughter back home?

862
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,873
Hey, if you catch Jun-seo's real killer,

863
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,500
wouldn't we still have a chance?

864
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,085
Have you found out anything?

865
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,546
Hi, Su-hyeon. This is a surprise.

866
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,006
What's the occasion?

867
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,800
I guess you don't know anything
since you're on suspension.

868
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,927
So?

869
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,388
Is he in custody?

870
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,267
Okay. I'll be right there.

871
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,852
What is it?

872
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,062
Jun-seo's autopsy results are out.

873
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,939
Take me to the police station.

874
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,399
What?

875
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,109
What are you doing? Start the car.

876
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,160
Oh, hey.

877
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,455
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, I'm much better.

878
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,213
They found his DNA
under Park Jun-seo's fingernail.

879
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,925
And his blood test showed
an anesthetic substance.

880
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,302
TRAUMA, DNA UNDER FINGERNAIL,
ANESTHETIC FOUND

881
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,555
You know who he is, right?
He's Chairman Won's chief secretary.

882
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,432
Yes.

883
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,143
He has a criminal record.

884
00:55:55,977 --> 00:56:01,024
So it was easy to identify him
through DNA profiling.

885
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,235
-But it was too easy.
-What do you mean?

886
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,321
When we went to arrest him,

887
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,491
he came out without resisting,
as if he'd been waiting for us.

888
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,286
He confessed to most of it
within ten minutes of the interrogation.

889
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,790
He says he killed Park Jun-seo
according to Park Tae-jin's plan.

890
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,874
Read this.

891
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,668
He kept detailed records
down to the minute.

892
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,171
7:12 P.M.
TAE-JIN VISITED THE CHAIRMAN

893
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,798
TAE-JIN'S PLAN TO MURDER
JUN-SEO AT 11 P.M.

894
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,063
Chairman Won.

895
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,402
Come and take a seat.

896
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,040
I hear you're the son
of Assemblyman Jang Tae-jeong.

897
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,668
Your chief secretary, Park Hyeok-jae,

898
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,254
has admitted to killing Park Jun-seo.

899
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,342
But no matter how many times I asked,

900
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,469
he said he only conspired
with Park Tae-jin.

901
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,430
He never said
that you ordered him to do it.

902
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,350
However,

903
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,770
the notebook he carried with him
told a different story.

904
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,524
On February 22nd,
the day before Jun-seo died,

905
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,360
Jun-seo came to see you, right?

906
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,244
I'm not recording this conversation.

907
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,204
I'll just turn off my phone.

908
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,714
What did he say to you?

909
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,093
Did he tell you
that your son, Won Jong-soo,

910
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,263
killed Chae Gyeong-tae 20 years ago?

911
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:02,270
There's no need to walk me out.

912
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,939
-Keep up the good work.
-Thank you, sir.

913
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,075
You have ten minutes
to tell me what you want to say.

914
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,660
I have another appointment.

915
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,786
Jong-soo is

916
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,289
manufacturing drugs in the basement

917
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,750
of Yeongryun Cold Storage.

918
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,752
JEOGANG HIGH SCHOOL

919
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,670
The person delivering the drugs to him

920
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,381
is me.

921
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,219
Park Tae-jin is
selling the drugs to others…

922
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,889
and the person selling them…

923
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,059
is also me.

924
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,229
One of the six houses
that blocked the development

925
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,273
of the first Anhyeon New City project
20 years ago had caught on fire.

926
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,528
Chae Gyeong-tae

927
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,322
died in that fire.

928
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,491
But it wasn't an accident.

929
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,036
Jong-soo killed him.

930
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,250
WON JONG-SOO

931
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,003
Everything he said from start to finish

932
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,672
sounded absurd to me.

933
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,260
It was also ridiculous to say
this name tag was proof.

934
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:19,055
You can have hundreds of these made
if you pay for them.

935
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,558
So what did Jun-seo tell you?

936
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,017
All of a sudden,

937
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,064
he asked me to call his friends
and have them pay for their sins

938
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,067
and to help them

939
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,903
protect their friendship.

940
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,074
And he threatened to tell the world
of all their crimes

941
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:42,745
if I didn't do as he said.

942
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,291
There was no reason to stay any longer,

943
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,669
so I left without turning back. That's it.

944
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,713
No, sir.

945
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,218
February 22nd at 7:12 p.m.

946
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,220
Something Jun-seo said
must've bothered you,

947
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,389
given you called Park Tae-jin
to your house.

948
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,017
You had to confirm
whether he was selling drugs.

949
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,184
Am I right?

950
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,482
I heard you're selling drugs.

951
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,026
Is that true?

952
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,778
How did you--

953
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,197
Park Jun-seo paid me a visit.

954
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,034
He said he's selling drugs with you.

955
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,873
Tomorrow night at 11:30 p.m.,

956
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,083
he's going to call Jong-soo
and the rest of you

957
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,253
and have you meet
at the Pilo-dong construction site.

958
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:38,176
He said if I can't convince all of you
to repent your sins

959
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,888
and be tried in a court of law,

960
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:48,936
the whole world would know
everything the next day.

961
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,566
What was his response?

962
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,194
Tae-jin said,

963
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,323
"I'm sorry, sir."

964
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,575
Then suddenly,

965
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,953
he said he'd kill Jun-seo.

966
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,709
He said Jun-seo had to die
to cover up everything.

967
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,629
After that,

968
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,257
he went into great detail about his plan

969
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,802
to stage Jun-seo's death as a suicide.

970
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,013
Do you remember his plan?

971
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,973
How could I possibly remember that?

972
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,934
It wasn't worth paying attention to.

973
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,686
What did you tell him then?

974
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,897
Did you offer to help him?

975
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,322
Of course, I tried to

976
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,076
talk him out of it.

977
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:50,498
I didn't arrange for you to be friends
just to have things end that way.

978
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,629
So, Tae-jin told you of his plans

979
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,881
to get rid of Jun-seo.

980
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,760
Then your chief secretary
wrote those plans here in great detail.

981
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,762
But you tried to stop him.

982
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,560
So are you saying Tae-jin acted alone
and conspired with your secretary

983
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,437
to kill Jun-seo?

984
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:21,320
I should've tried harder to stop him.

985
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,199
When I think about it now,

986
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,410
that part really bothers me.

987
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,078
No.

988
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:33,666
You didn't call Tae-jin here
just to reprimand him for selling drugs.

989
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,376
You called him to handle the situation.

990
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,967
Please forgive me, sir.

991
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:46,220
I swear I'll take care of Jun-seo.

992
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,765
How?

993
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,851
Sir?

994
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,563
How?

995
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,611
Jun-seo…

996
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,157
I'll kill him.

997
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,540
Please tell Jun-seo
you want to see him tomorrow night

998
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,459
at around 11 p.m. at…

999
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,796
the Pilo-dong construction site.

1000
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,591
On the ninth floor.

1001
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,555
FEBRUARY 23RD, 2024

1002
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:36,187
SEEING DANGER
IS THE BEGINNING OF SAFETY

1003
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:52,078
CAUTION
FALL HAZARD

1004
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:58,876
Chairman Won?

1005
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,256
Chairman Won?

1006
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,806
The man waiting for Jun-seo
on the ninth floor

1007
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,141
was your chief secretary.

1008
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:17,061
He was the one
who carried out Tae-jin's plan.

1009
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,197
At 11:30 p.m., when the guys arrived
at the construction site,

1010
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,033
the chief secretary turned on
the ninth-floor light again.

1011
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:32,785
Hey.

1012
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,370
He must be up there.

1013
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,124
Everything went smoothly.

1014
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,711
But that's when something went wrong.

1015
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,968
Tae-jin's original plan involved
a very small amount of anesthetic

1016
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,970
that couldn't be detected
during an autopsy.

1017
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,972
But things didn't go as planned.

1018
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,977
So he had to use
much more anesthetic at the scene

1019
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,105
which explains these autopsy results.

1020
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,942
Shall I continue?

1021
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,485
HIGHLY LIKELY
TO HAVE BEEN ANESTHETIZED

1022
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,695
WITH SEVOFLURANE PRIOR TO FALL

1023
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,335
After the chief secretary
made Jun-seo unconscious again,

1024
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,004
the elevator began
coming up from the first floor,

1025
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,631
so he quickly moved Jun-seo.

1026
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,007
And just as Tae-jin planned,

1027
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,051
when the elevator reached
the fourth and fifth floors,

1028
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,677
he pushed Jun-seo off.

1029
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,395
And as expected, the elevator
went back down to the first floor.

1030
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:47,693
Tae-jin didn't conspire
with the chief secretary.

1031
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,321
It makes no sense
that your secretary of 20 years

1032
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:54,241
would kill someone
on Park Tae-jin's orders, not yours.

1033
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,745
It was you.

1034
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:01,082
You were the one
who ordered Park Jun-seo's murder.

1035
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:02,792
Why would I do that?

1036
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,961
What for?

1037
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,755
Your company was in immediate trouble.

1038
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,008
The only chance of saving it
was through the Pilo-dong project,

1039
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,635
and you couldn't let Jun-seo ruin it.

1040
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,390
And you couldn't let your son,
who was supposed to lead the business,

1041
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,600
get caught up in a 20-year-old murder case

1042
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,811
or get involved in a drug scandal.

1043
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:25,272
And it was unacceptable to think
that your project partner, Park Tae-jin,

1044
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,776
was making and selling drugs
through KH Pharmaceutical.

1045
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:29,860
Am I wrong?

1046
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,990
Are you done talking?

1047
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,533
You ordered him, didn't you?

1048
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,370
I suggest you tell the truth now.

1049
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,624
This is getting tiresome.

1050
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,092
I applaud your effort.

1051
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,596
His shoes were removed
to make it look like a suicide,

1052
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,267
but you still managed
to get my chief secretary

1053
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,144
and Park Tae-jin involved in this case.

1054
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,353
I commend you.

1055
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,439
Be content with that

1056
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,315
and see yourself out.

1057
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:11,360
The shoes that were found
on the ninth floor

1058
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,362
weren't part of my plan.

1059
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,532
Half of the people who jump

1060
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,534
keep their shoes on.

1061
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,163
What did you just say, sir?

1062
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,248
What?

1063
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,459
Who had his shoes removed

1064
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,211
to make it look like a suicide?

1065
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,547
It was Tae-jin, of course.

1066
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,342
It was you, sir.

1067
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,553
What?

1068
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,432
You told him to remove his shoes

1069
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:43,225
and push him over the railing.

1070
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,478
What are you saying?

1071
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,938
I told you Tae-jin
tried to stage it like a suicide.

1072
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,608
No, sir.

1073
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,611
Shoes weren't part of his plan.

1074
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,656
I see.

1075
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,658
You heard Tae-jin's plan

1076
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,994
and thought it lacked something.

1077
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,415
You thought that in suicide by jumping,
people naturally take off their shoes.

1078
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,459
So you ordered your secretary

1079
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:11,337
to remove Jun-seo's shoes
before pushing him off.

1080
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,672
That's not true.

1081
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,757
Yes, it is.

1082
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,009
Your chief secretary
made the same statement.

1083
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,762
When asked why he brought
the shoes back to the ninth floor,

1084
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,472
he said Park Tae-jin told him to.

1085
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:22,640
But Park Tae-jin

1086
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:25,392
knew very well that half of the people
who commit suicide by jumping

1087
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:26,852
do so while wearing shoes.

1088
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,939
Shoes never crossed Park Tae-jin's mind.

1089
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,066
They were only important to you!

1090
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,403
Is there any point
in hiding the truth at this point?

1091
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,365
You spent the last 20 years
planning this for Jong-soo.

1092
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,576
But Jun-seo tried to ruin it,
so you had him killed, right?

1093
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,121
I would've done the same thing.

1094
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,623
Look at the life you've led.

1095
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:50,334
Think of how you saved the company
in times of crisis.

1096
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,795
Who did Park Jun-seo
think he was to show up here

1097
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,214
talking about friendship
and threatening you?

1098
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,216
You couldn't just sit back and watch him.

1099
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,760
So after you heard Tae-jin's plan,
you carried it out.

1100
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,012
You had your chief secretary
kill Park Jun-seo!

1101
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,765
Right? Everything was done
under your orders!

1102
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,600
That's right. It was me!

1103
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,231
That ungrateful Jun-seo
kept causing trouble!

1104
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,358
Twenty years of hard work
was about to go to waste!

1105
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,277
How could I just watch that happen?

1106
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,946
So I called Tae-jin here,

1107
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:22,241
heard his plan, thought it was good,
and had it carried out!

1108
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,367
Was that so wrong?

1109
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,953
If Tae-jin's plan hadn't been good,

1110
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:28,956
I would've killed him
right then and there!

1111
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,877
How dare he go behind my back
and make money by selling drugs?

1112
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,852
If you're done listening, get out.

1113
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,398
You must be disappointed
you can't prove anything,

1114
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,151
but I told you enough,
so be satisfied with that.

1115
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,570
It's enough to talk about
for the rest of your life.

1116
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,323
I heard you had no one by your side, sir.

1117
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,491
It turned out to be true.

1118
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,827
What?

1119
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,914
I heard they do a thorough body search
on the visitors here.

1120
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,875
But there was no one today.

1121
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,884
The absence of your chief secretary
who served you for 20 years

1122
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,136
must be quite noticeable.

1123
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,348
You tricked me.

1124
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,350
Mr. Won Chang-ho.

1125
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,560
You're under arrest

1126
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,564
for solicitation of murder
of Park Jun-seo.

1127
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:49,745
2 WEEKS LATER

1128
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,413
The examination is over,

1129
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,750
and today marks the 50th day
since you quit using drugs.

1130
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,918
Yes.

1131
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,672
The doctor says to return next Wednesday.

1132
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,966
I'll see you next week then.

1133
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:03,926
Thank you.

1134
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,054
As Chairman Won Chang-ho of KH Group

1135
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,640
was arrested on charges
of solicitation of murder,

1136
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,767
KH Group, which had been
experiencing financial struggles,

1137
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,895
applied for a workout
with its creditors today.

1138
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,064
The owner risk of KH Group

1139
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:20,859
triggered by the drug-related arrest
of CEO Won Jong-soo,

1140
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,153
who is the only son
of Chairman Won Chang-ho,

1141
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,531
has eventually resulted
in a workout request.

1142
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,950
It's been reported that the creditors

1143
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,203
have internally discussed focusing more
on bankruptcy than a workout.

1144
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,498
As a result, there are growing concerns

1145
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:37,793
that this will lead to mass unemployment
and financial insolvency.

1146
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,378
Let's hear more
from Reporter Jeon Myeong-eun.

1147
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,369
JANGSU LIFE
INSURANCE PAYOUT INFORMATION

1148
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,996
PLEASE CALL THE NUMBER BELOW

1149
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,373
TO DESIGNATE A BANK
TO RECEIVE THE PAYOUT

1150
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,130
OH YUN-JIN
WHERE ARE YOU?

1151
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,132
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
TEXTED YOU TOO, RIGHT?

1152
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,416
-Have you been going to school?
-Yes.

1153
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,126
Make some friends, okay?

1154
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:03,629
I have lots of friends.

1155
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,672
Really? Are you sure?

1156
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:09,718
I have tons.

1157
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,640
I took a picture with Mr. Jun-seo before.

1158
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,189
Have you visited his columbarium?

1159
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,858
No, I don't know where it is.

1160
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:28,695
I'll give you the address.
Go visit him often and keep him company.

1161
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,864
-It's not far away.
-Okay.

1162
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,699
And if you need any help from an adult,

1163
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,952
don't bother your grandmother
and call me instead.

1164
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:38,080
It's surprisingly reassuring
to bring a cop to school.

1165
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:39,456
Did you know that?

1166
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,251
But Mr. Joo-song came by a few days ago

1167
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,253
and told me to call him in an emergency.

1168
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,131
He said teachers like insurance agents.

1169
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,384
I can see that.

1170
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:52,803
-Hey.
-Jang Jae-gyeong!

1171
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,316
Jeez.

1172
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:09,570
I thought you'd be happy
to get the payout.

1173
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:11,071
What's the matter with you?

1174
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,323
I don't know.

1175
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,786
Even though I got
a huge amount of money all at once,

1176
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,081
I can't shake off this uneasy feeling.

1177
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,294
Are you going back to the station?

1178
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:27,546
No, I'm just going to rest.

1179
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,216
-Do you feel okay?
-I just want to play hooky.

1180
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,095
That's a good idea.

1181
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:38,974
Can I have one of these?

1182
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,476
Sure, go ahead.

1183
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,813
The weather is nice,
but I get sleepy in the afternoon.

1184
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,607
That'll wake you up for sure.

1185
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,739
-This is good.
-Right?

1186
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:58,243
-Hey, why don't you come with us too?
-Where?

1187
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,288
We're going to help
Choi Ji-yeon move today.

1188
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,583
I softened up to her
because of her near-death experience,

1189
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,960
and the next thing I know,
she treats me like I'm her sister.

1190
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,921
I can't stand women like her.

1191
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,048
I'm not her sister.

1192
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:13,008
Okay, let's go.

1193
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,134
Good.

1194
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,429
-Yun-jin?
-What?

1195
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,056
Don't you have something to say?

1196
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,225
Now would be
the perfect time to bring it up.

1197
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:23,977
Oh, right.

1198
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:26,146
What is it?

1199
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:31,151
What are you going
to spend the payout on?

1200
01:15:32,152 --> 01:15:33,153
I'm not sure.

1201
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,073
Maybe on Si-jeong?

1202
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,534
She has to raise the kids
without Yun-ho now.

1203
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,204
I'd like to give some to Si-jeong.

1204
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:44,164
I haven't thought
about what to do with the rest.

1205
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,126
Choi Ji-yeon.

1206
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:51,338
She doesn't have any life skills.

1207
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:54,508
Maybe we can give her
enough money for a fresh start?

1208
01:15:55,759 --> 01:16:00,138
I just wanted to know
if you were interested in helping out.

1209
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:02,140
So?

1210
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,269
Helping her move isn't enough?
You want to share the payout with her too?

1211
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:06,353
What?

1212
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:10,357
I guess you're right.

1213
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,277
We all have different opinions.

1214
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,070
Just forget I said anything.

1215
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,283
It's a nice day.

1216
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,159
It really is.

1217
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:26,248
You guys have a long way to go
to get my sense of humor.

1218
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,333
What?

1219
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,837
I said you guys have a long way to go

1220
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,381
to get my sense of humor.

1221
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:35,674
What the heck?

1222
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,384
Jeez.

1223
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:42,514
You scared me. That wasn't funny at all.

1224
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,434
I got more boxes.

1225
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,187
Okay.

1226
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,732
Here we go.

1227
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,237
Why don't you have more dinnerware?

1228
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,615
Don't you ever cook?

1229
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,533
I broke a lot of them.

1230
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:04,578
Jeez, you're clumsy.

1231
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,625
We received the payout.

1232
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:16,923
I see.

1233
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,594
What's going on?

1234
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:24,097
Didn't you say you deserved that money?

1235
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,934
You told us we were just bait.

1236
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,437
Stop teasing me.

1237
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,233
You'll find some money in your account.

1238
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,613
Jae-gyeong will send you some too.

1239
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:44,201
Excuse me?

1240
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:47,579
Once I got it, it didn't feel right
to keep it all for myself.

1241
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,248
There won't be much left for us anyway

1242
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,794
after paying taxes and such.
We can't give you more.

1243
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:56,797
I can't take that money.
Please don't do this.

1244
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,131
Be quiet.

1245
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,551
When your elder gives you money,
just say thank you and take it.

1246
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,099
Thank you, Yun-jin.

1247
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,605
Cut that out.

1248
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,654
I'm getting used to you
calling my name, though.

1249
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,244
Hand it to me.

1250
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,539
Hey, look at this.

1251
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:32,708
Do you see this?

1252
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,003
Why?

1253
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,297
What is it?

1254
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:42,551
2005 SUMMER VACATION
BEACH IN BUSAN

1255
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,525
Right now, the Audiophile club members

1256
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,777
are here at a beach in Busan.

1257
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,946
The ocean is so pretty.

1258
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:04,406
Excuse me, Mr. Jae-gyeong.

1259
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,867
How are you? I'm Oh Yun-jin.

1260
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,077
What do you want to be when you grow up?

1261
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:11,288
I want to become a cool person.

1262
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,000
Yun-jin, forget being a reporter
and become an actress instead.

1263
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,084
What?

1264
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,545
Hey, Joo-song.
I didn't know you played the guitar.

1265
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,131
The memory of you…

1266
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,215
Sorry.

1267
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,134
What should I say?

1268
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,178
I'm going to become a reporter.

1269
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,472
-A reporter!
-I wasn't ready.

1270
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,098
-A reporter?
-I'm a good singer!

1271
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,391
Hey, Jun-seo!

1272
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,352
Jun-seo, give us a smile.

1273
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,314
-You look so good!
-Really?

1274
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:41,526
Isn't the beach nice?

1275
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,737
Yes.

1276
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,281
It's so great.

1277
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,325
Jun-seo.

1278
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,368
What's your dream?

1279
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,457
My dream?

1280
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,044
I don't know.

1281
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:00,879
I just…

1282
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:04,925
I just like hanging out
with you guys in Audiophile.

1283
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,295
Is it heavy? I'll carry it for you.

1284
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,718
Thanks to Jun-seo,
we made our way back here.

1285
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,222
It's been over 20 years,

1286
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:55,433
but this place hasn't changed one bit.

1287
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,894
-You're right.
-No.

1288
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,439
That hotel wasn't there,
and everything was empty back here.

1289
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,400
But now there's an apartment complex.

1290
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,863
And I think the waves got stronger

1291
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:10,657
as well as the wind.

1292
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,619
And the sand feels softer than before.

1293
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,086
I miss Jun-seo.

1294
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,933
What was that?

1295
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,686
The three of us sighed so hard just now.

1296
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:45,775
What do you think
Jun-seo's last wish might have been?

1297
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,447
Going back to the good old days.

1298
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,366
When we were just friends

1299
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,244
and nothing else.

1300
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,790
That's what friendship is like, right?

1301
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:04,628
If you obsess over it,
you could end up hurting each other.

1302
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,632
If money and greed get in the way,

1303
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:11,927
then it's no longer a friendship.

1304
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,053
Right.

1305
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,555
People could start out as friends

1306
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,933
but then cover up each other's misdeeds.

1307
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,478
It often changes
for the worse like that.

1308
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:24,689
That's not friendship.
What should one call it?

1309
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:28,151
-A connection?
-A connection?

1310
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,862
I see. A connection.

1311
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,281
What about our friendship?

1312
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,617
It won't turn into a connection, right?

1313
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,078
Us?

1314
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,623
Hey, we don't have the power
to become connections.

1315
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:42,916
At worst,

1316
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:45,710
we might talk behind
our friends' backs over drinks.

1317
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:49,130
Jun-seo brought us together again.

1318
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:53,969
So let's make sure
to keep our friendship pure and strong

1319
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,471
and age gracefully together, okay?

1320
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:59,474
Does it have to remain
a friendship and nothing more, though?

1321
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:04,854
Yun-jin, will you let it evolve into love?

1322
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,147
No, I won't.

1323
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,232
Not a chance.

1324
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,068
-Yun-jin…
-Hey!

1325
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:12,237
Cut it out!

1326
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,447
-I was just scratching myself.
-Really?

1327
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,828
What did we do here back then?

1328
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,830
Do you remember anything?

1329
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,748
We started that thing.

1330
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,667
-What thing?
-"Friends' Day."

1331
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,879
-"Friends' Day"?
-You said it first.

1332
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:32,507
"There's Parents' Day and Children's Day,

1333
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,134
but why isn't there Friends' Day?"

1334
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:35,468
I said that?

1335
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,012
-Yes.
-Then what happened?

1336
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,265
Then you just said,
"Let's make today Friends' Day."

1337
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,018
But then you had to transfer,

1338
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,853
so we never got a chance to celebrate it.

1339
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:47,480
Do you remember the date
when we came here?

1340
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,691
There's no way to remember that.

1341
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,943
Right?

1342
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:54,404
-Don't tell me…
-Seriously?

1343
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:56,406
You remember the date?

1344
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,992
To tell you the truth,
the day we came here

1345
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,119
was my mom's birthday.

1346
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:05,665
But I didn't tell her we were coming
to Busan on an overnight trip,

1347
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,792
so I got the beating of my life
when I got home.

1348
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,505
Oh, but Jun-seo remembered.

1349
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:16,259
He came by my office
a few years ago and asked,

1350
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:20,638
"Joo-song, do you remember what today is?"

1351
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,515
So I asked, "Why do you care
about my mom's birthday?"

1352
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,852
Then he said he stopped by
because it was Friends' Day.

1353
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,315
Jun-seo came by to see you

1354
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,859
because it was Friends' Day?

1355
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:34,819
Yes. Why?

1356
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,244
-That's good.
-You can see it, right?

1357
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,329
Okay.

1358
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:47,874
Is there enough battery?
What if it shuts down--

1359
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,085
Hey, just be quiet!

1360
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:07,268
Jae-gyeong.
What's Park Tae-jin's password?

1361
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:09,729
Let's just…

1362
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,189
Just tell me already!

1363
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:16,861
Jeez.

1364
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,034
About the password…

1365
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:26,579
The four digits of Park Tae-jin's password

1366
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,414
is 0-6-1-7.

1367
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,626
It's Choi Ji-yeon's birthday.

1368
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,299
When is Friends' Day?

1369
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,718
-Hey, get it together.
-Right.

1370
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,639
Are you positive your mother's birthday
is Friends' Day?

1371
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,600
Yes, I'm positive.

1372
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:56,276
It's 0-7-2-4.

1373
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,996
You click it. I can't do it.

1374
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,249
Do we really have to do this?

1375
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,209
Just click it.

1376
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,978
-Holy cow!
-Hold on a second!

1377
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,730
You're the most excited one here!

1378
01:26:33,813 --> 01:26:36,482
Hey! Just hold it!

1379
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,444
-No, Yun-jin!
-What are you doing?

1380
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,029
-Hey!
-Give that back right now!

1381
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:43,615
-It's going to shut down!
-Hey!

1382
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,283
Be quiet and give it back!

1383
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,160
-Yun-jin!
-Jang Jae-gyeong!

1384
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,787
-No, don't touch it!
-I said give it back!

1385
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,372
This should be returned to the government!

1386
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,208
Be quiet and give it back!

1387
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:08,259
