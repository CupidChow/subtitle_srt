(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,891
I'll carry your bag.

4
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:19,461
Thank you.

5
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,861
Didn't that feel great?

6
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:25,962
Yes, but it's so illogical.

7
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:27,601
We should've watched "Crying Fist."

8
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,471
It still helped me de-stress.

9
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,592
But you never get stressed.

10
00:00:32,592 --> 00:00:34,551
What did you say?

11
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,392
- Hey, Sang Eui.
- Am I wrong?

12
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:37,571
Did something happen?

13
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,912
Okay, I'll be right there.

14
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:43,711
What is it?

15
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,622
Hey, I'll get going.

16
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,351
Hey! Where are you going?

17
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:53,692
Hey!

18
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:58,332
Jun Seo.

19
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:03,232
Isn't...

20
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,402
Isn't this Kyung Tae's house?

21
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:07,641
Where is he?

22
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,472
- Where's Kyung Tae?
- Wait.

23
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:11,741
Let me go.

24
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:13,612
Where's Kyung Tae?

25
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:15,252
Where is he?

26
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:16,651
You can't go in.

27
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,351
It's already...

28
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:21,692
It's already too late.

29
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:23,991
Move. Kyung Tae!

30
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,362
It was an accident, Jun Seo.
Just an accident.

31
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,142
We must find safety!

32
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:30,642
Let go! Chae Kyung Tae! Hey, Kyung Tae!

33
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:32,131
Let go of me!

34
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:33,832
Chae Kyung Tae!

35
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,672
Chae Kyung Tae!

36
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,302
No... Let go.

37
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:40,691
I said, let go. Hey!

38
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,039
(Connection)

39
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,642
It's me.

40
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,211
Jeong Yoon Ho
was near my apartment just now.

41
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,791
I don't know which road he took,

42
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,681
and I think he's using
public transport other than a taxi.

43
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:20,962
He just used a payphone.

44
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:22,012
Track the number.

45
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:23,512
Hang on.

46
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:30,352
The number is 031-0325-7898.

47
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,292
Yes, thanks.

48
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:43,501
What are these photos?

49
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:46,028
I'll explain.

50
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,172
I'll explain.

51
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,112
I'll explain. Give me my phone.

52
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,112
Talk to me.

53
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,512
I told someone to follow Choi Ji Yeon.

54
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:01,582
That's how I found out
she was seeing Tae Jin.

55
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,151
That's how I got these photos.

56
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,292
Are you insane?

57
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,422
What if Tae Jin were to find out?

58
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:11,258
I told you.
He could be behind all of this.

59
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,561
And Yoon Ho is now a suspected murderer.

60
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:15,022
Don't you get that?

61
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,401
I got it.

62
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:18,501
One verse is enough.

63
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,211
Choi Ji Yeon.

64
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,841
Is your tail still on her?

65
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,482
- Yes.
- Let's go.

66
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:34,052
We're leaving?

67
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,392
(Episode 10)

68
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:59,582
(Kim Woo Sung)

69
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:02,107
Where are you?

70
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:03,181
Put it on speaker.

71
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,302
I'm at Cossack. CW went in on her own.

72
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,352
Follow her inside.

73
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:08,621
I'm about to.

74
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,022
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

75
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,491
- What?
- Can you get a recording?

76
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:15,961
It's okay. We're on our way there.

77
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,812
Yes, I can.

78
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,652
If Park Tae Jin shows up,
tape their conversation.

79
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,272
Don't do anything else. Just wait.

80
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:24,832
Okay.

81
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,772
Where is Cossack?

82
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,251
It's on Hwansung's cafe street.

83
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:29,322
- I'll find it for you.
- Okay.

84
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,512
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

85
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,512
What does CW stand for?

86
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:35,151
What? Oh, that?

87
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,651
It's Choi Ji Yeon's nickname.

88
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:39,182
Why is she CW?

89
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,651
You don't need to know.
Follow this route to the cafe.

90
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,361
- Welcome.
- Hello.

91
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,012
I'll have an iced Americano.

92
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,062
Okay.

93
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:36,742
Woo Sung.

94
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:42,551
- Yoon Jin.
- Hi.

95
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:49,972
Hello. I'm Kim Woo Sung
with Anhyun Economic Daily.

96
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:50,972
Put it on.

97
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:52,022
Okay.

98
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:55,461
Do you have anything?

99
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:56,992
What did Jae Gyeong say?

100
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,161
I want to ask you something first.

101
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:00,961
Oh Yoon Jin.

102
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:03,502
What did she have with Jun Seo?

103
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,372
Did they date?

104
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,312
Did they?

105
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,341
You don't know?

106
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,642
I think they briefly did in high school.

107
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:17,252
Why do you want to know that?

108
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,051
Did something happen earlier?

109
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,522
How did they get together?

110
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,442
Oh Yoon Jin was a transfer.

111
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:25,361
I think she joined
Jun Seo's music-listening club.

112
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,262
What is this about?

113
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:29,692
They dated back then?

114
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,332
How long were they together?

115
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:36,272
I don't know. I barely remember.

116
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,932
They dated for a bit...

117
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,971
before breaking up over something.

118
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:41,642
What something?

119
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,072
Something happened.

120
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:47,341
Jae Gyeong got transferred
and the music club disbanded.

121
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,252
I think that's how they broke up.

122
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:51,582
That's it.

123
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,452
What did they say that you're like this?

124
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:56,622
What about recently?

125
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,461
Did Jun Seo...

126
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,291
mention Oh Yoon Jin before he died?

127
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,492
- Ji Yeon.
- Did he?

128
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,332
Keep your voice down.
What are you doing?

129
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:20,312
You called me over
at this hour to ask me that?

130
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,582
Is this that important?

131
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:23,752
Yes.

132
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,622
It's important.

133
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,421
As far as I know, nothing happened...

134
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,392
between those two.

135
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:36,832
If you keep asking about that,
I have nothing more to tell you.

136
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,301
All three of them seemed to be wary of me,

137
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,372
so I didn't find out anything else.

138
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,251
We'll go to Boryeong together soon.

139
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,942
I'll get something then.

140
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,312
Did they seem clueless...

141
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,481
about Boryeong?

142
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,252
Yes.

143
00:08:00,202 --> 00:08:02,151
Stay close to them if possible.

144
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,741
You're leaving?

145
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,421
My family's waiting at home.

146
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,031
And...

147
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,361
I'd like you to make up your mind
before this weekend.

148
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,671
Once this weekend is over, that money...

149
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:20,642
means nothing to me.

150
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:24,611
Why is that?

151
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,111
Tell me when you've decided.

152
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:39,661
As soon as she left,
she called Tae Jin over...

153
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,331
just to ask him if you dated Jun Seo?

154
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:44,791
I guess so.

155
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,661
I can't figure her out at all.

156
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:52,491
What?

157
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:56,811
You have all the conversations
between Tae Jin and Choi Ji Yeon, right?

158
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,781
Do I? I don't know.

159
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,712
Do we have them?

160
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,231
I kept some...

161
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,722
and deleted others.

162
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,122
What did they talk about mostly?

163
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,551
As if they did much talking.

164
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,262
They went straight to motels.

165
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:16,511
You don't know
because you didn't date much.

166
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,561
Oh Yoon Jin.

167
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:19,401
What?

168
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:23,132
You knew this wasn't the first time
they'd met at this cafe.

169
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:25,171
What did they talk about?

170
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,592
They really didn't talk about much.

171
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,712
They had the typical
cheating couple conversations.

172
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,212
"Get a divorce." "I can't do that."

173
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,411
"Let's leave together." "I don't want to."

174
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,382
- Is that true?
- Yes.

175
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:38,951
What's the money about, then?

176
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,332
Tae Jin said the money...

177
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,151
meant nothing to him
once this weekend was over.

178
00:09:43,672 --> 00:09:44,901
Is that topic new to you?

179
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,022
Yes.

180
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:50,762
Maybe those two invested in a company.

181
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:00,102
Even if we don't get the password,

182
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,851
Tae Jin might say...

183
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:05,372
what the account is and how much is in it.

184
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:14,352
(Anhyeon Police Station)

185
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,951
I checked the CCTV of the area
you mentioned yesterday...

186
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:19,222
and got nothing.

187
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:21,472
He hasn't left Anhyun yet.

188
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,962
He might not leave at all.

189
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:24,892
What about Kang Si Jung's interrogation?

190
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,912
I asked if she knew of
any places for him to hide,

191
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:28,972
but she wouldn't answer.

192
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:30,931
Send her home...

193
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,502
and have people watch the area.

194
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:33,651
Okay.

195
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,242
Did you run the payphone number?

196
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,541
We'll get the results soon.

197
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,742
Hey.

198
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:45,882
Hello, Unit Chief.

199
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,222
Straw.

200
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:51,092
(Written Statement)

201
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:53,821
What does all this say?

202
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,191
It says Lee Geun Ho...

203
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,492
drove the car you asked about.

204
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,412
- Lee Geun Ho?
- Yes.

205
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:02,061
He's a kid from the suburbs
who used to drive girls to bars.

206
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,502
He recently came into a lot of money...

207
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:06,851
and took up swinging a golf club...

208
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,772
as well as spending way more.

209
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:09,967
Is that all?

210
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:12,842
Would that be all?
If you look at the bottom,

211
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,811
you can see Lee Geun Ho's address,

212
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:17,512
"Join-dong 18-49?"

213
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,551
Was anyone hurt in the process?

214
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,141
I'm not sure what you mean by "hurt."

215
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,111
Did anyone end up in the ER?

216
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:30,362
Oh, in the ER?
No one went to the ER.

217
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,862
Most of them were quite cooperative.

218
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:34,462
Good job.

219
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:35,732
Does that mean...

220
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,102
I have nothing to do with the case now?

221
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:39,251
What?

222
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,502
I'm off scot-free?

223
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,171
What?

224
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,342
You have that look again.

225
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,281
(Written Statement)

226
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,722
(Written Statement)

227
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,262
Join-dong, 18-49.

228
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,161
You thought we wouldn't know
if you didn't tell us, didn't you?

229
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,011
We're going to go to this address now.

230
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:09,531
I was wondering if you had anything
you wanted to say to us.

231
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:13,472
- I don't.
- You don't?

232
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,201
- That's right.
- Okay.

233
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,742
Oh, right.
Do you know who is sitting next to you?

234
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,852
He's the actual owner
of the car you used to drive.

235
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,051
This is a connection too.
Why don't you two say hello?

236
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:28,222
Hello.

237
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,051
You only have a famous nickname
and not a famous face, don't you?

238
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:33,321
Introduce yourself.

239
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,752
Darn it... Straw?

240
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,651
Eleven years ago,
this guy alone went to see...

241
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:07,691
An Hyung Sik, the boss of the largest gang
in Western Seoul.

242
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,892
Of course,
his body was thoroughly searched,

243
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:12,031
so he went into the room...

244
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,502
with An Hyung Sik and five of his men
pretty much in the nude.

245
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,331
In that room, just like now,

246
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,242
were six cups of iced Americanos.

247
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,102
When I got the call
and arrived at the scene,

248
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:24,342
the six men who were in that room...

249
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,311
had all died
of ruptured carotid arteries.

250
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,712
This guy was covered in blood
and sitting there...

251
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,202
with no intention of running away.

252
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,122
And in his hand,
there was a single straw.

253
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:41,291
After that, everyone called him Straw.

254
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,732
Come here.

255
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:45,661
Listen carefully.

256
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,712
You have just made the legendary Straw...

257
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:51,431
into the suspect of a mere drug case
on the outskirts of town.

258
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,171
Look at his face.

259
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,512
You've just gotten yourself into
a very awkward spot.

260
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:58,171
Also,

261
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,212
we're going to go to this address now.

262
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:04,062
Everyone will think you gave us
this information.

263
00:14:04,062 --> 00:14:05,311
So, you'll become a traitor too.

264
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,172
If you still insist
that it was a solo act,

265
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,551
we intend to accept that too.

266
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,321
What will you do?

267
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,462
But...

268
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:17,191
What?

269
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,052
Send him over to the prosecution
for grand theft auto...

270
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,922
and violation
of the Narcotics Control Act.

271
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:25,571
Wait!

272
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,541
But it wasn't me.

273
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:30,121
It really wasn't me.

274
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,391
How would a guy like me
do something like this alone?

275
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:35,041
The name of the guy I was with was...

276
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:36,551
- Lee...
- Lee Geun Ho?

277
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:39,821
No! It was Gong Jin Wook!

278
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,252
Gong Jin Wook.

279
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,722
Our big boss' name is Gong Jin Wook.

280
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
He told us to do everything.

281
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:49,392
Is this Gong Jin Wook?

282
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,092
Yes, that's right.

283
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:52,362
Is Gong Jin Wook the Doctor?

284
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,511
No, the Doctor just makes the drugs.

285
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,002
We only distribute it.

286
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,621
Have you seen the Doctor?

287
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,822
No, I'm sure even the big boss
hasn't seen the Doctor either.

288
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:02,242
The Doctor tends to stay hidden.

289
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:03,772
Where does Gong Jin Wook live?

290
00:15:04,462 --> 00:15:07,012
I'm not sure...
No, I really don't know!

291
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,212
Only Geun Ho knows
where the big boss lives.

292
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:10,911
What about CEO Yoon?

293
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,651
You know CEO Yoon, the distributor, right?

294
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:13,921
Yes.

295
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,791
Most of our products get distributed
on the market through CEO Yoon.

296
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:17,951
Where is CEO Yoon?

297
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,831
I'm not sure about that either.

298
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,102
What is it you do know?

299
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:30,481
You didn't even know anything,
yet you didn't cooperate until now...

300
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,772
and kept joking around with us?

301
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,842
But I really don't know anything.

302
00:15:35,222 --> 00:15:36,441
Darn it.

303
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,281
Sorry.

304
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,962
Run a background check on Gong Jin Wook,

305
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,252
- and try to find his location.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,122
But Lee Geun Ho is
probably not home, right?

307
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,501
Look into Gong Jin Wook first,

308
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,092
and if that doesn't work,
let's go to Lee Geun Ho's place.

309
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:50,352
Yes, sir.

310
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,821
- Where are you going?
- I have somewhere to go.

311
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:54,972
Let me know right away
if you locate Gong Jin Wook.

312
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,061
Got it, sir.

313
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:06,401
Check your balance
and choose a transaction.

314
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,842
Thank you for doing business with us.

315
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:17,982
- Yes.
- Jin Wook.

316
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:19,921
Today is collection day.

317
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:23,722
I told you not to worry about that.
Just lie low.

318
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,321
I've always done this.
Why are you so worried?

319
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:29,182
I mean,
if the police really were after us,

320
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:31,331
we would need some money
to hide ourselves.

321
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,851
I'll go and get the money today.

322
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,661
No. Listen to me.

323
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:38,272
If CEO Yoon finds out Dae Sung was caught,
we'll be in trouble too.

324
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:40,602
How would CEO Yoon know that?

325
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,041
And Dae Sung doesn't know anything
besides my address.

326
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,681
Lee Geun Ho. Listen to what I say.

327
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,062
I'll come up with a way.

328
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:51,081
Don't do anything and just lie low.

329
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:53,681
Jin Wook.

330
00:16:56,741 --> 00:16:58,051
Darn it.

331
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:09,101
What did the directors say?

332
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:10,682
So, you should do your job...

333
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,202
and make sure they don't say
anything weird, you punk.

334
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,202
Seriously.

335
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:19,881
You're busy.

336
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,412
Okay, hang up.

337
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:28,121
Who let someone into my room
when I wasn't even here?

338
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,091
What brings you here?
You didn't even call ahead.

339
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,061
Hey, be more amicable.

340
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:43,601
The mood is so scary
that I don't know what to say first.

341
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,222
Do you want some tea?

342
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,341
You heard what I said to Chi Hyun, right?

343
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:53,712
Well...

344
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,381
I heard you knew that we were all there
on the night Jun Seo died.

345
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,152
So what?

346
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,452
Do you need me to confirm the facts too?

347
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:06,462
I looked through Lee Myung Guk's logs,
and there was a lot of interesting stuff.

348
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:09,291
Youngryun Cold Storage.

349
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,462
Lee Myung Guk made pills there
and sold them, right?

350
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,631
And you had
Jun Seo deliver the pills to you.

351
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,341
How many pills do you take?

352
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:23,472
What?

353
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:26,881
Well, I'm just curious.
How many do you take?

354
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:34,022
But what caused the falling out
between you and Lee Myung Guk?

355
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,692
Did Lee Myung Guk ask for
too much money for the pills?

356
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,061
Did you make Yoon Ho do it?
To kill Lee Myung Guk?

357
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,831
What utter nonsense are you spewing?

358
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,152
No.

359
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:51,031
It would've been hard for Yoon Ho
to move a body by himself.

360
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,242
Hey.

361
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,972
You did it with him, didn't you?

362
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:56,712
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

363
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:00,341
Both the guy who made the pills
and the guy who delivered them died.

364
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,851
Now, there's only you left,
the guy who took the pills.

365
00:19:04,432 --> 00:19:05,682
Doesn't that mean we have the answer?

366
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,001
Did you have them both killed?

367
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,291
- Hey!
- Isn't it true?

368
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,121
I didn't!

369
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:14,522
I didn't.

370
00:19:15,472 --> 00:19:19,301
Guys who have nothing in their hands
are always full of talk.

371
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,462
Hey.

372
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,571
If you had something,

373
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:26,571
you wouldn't be sitting here
running your mouth.

374
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,541
Why?

375
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,341
"I killed Lee Myung Guk,"

376
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,811
"and I also killed Park Jun Seo."

377
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,081
Do you want me to say that?

378
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,351
I have no interest in getting confessions.

379
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:48,391
I just came because I was curious
and wanted to see...

380
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:51,492
how flustered you'd get at what I say...

381
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,531
and how anxious you'd be after I leave.

382
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,202
But when I come back,

383
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:03,012
I'll be sure to put handcuffs
on your wrists.

384
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,841
I'm off.

385
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:08,811
Bye.

386
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:50,351
Where have you been?

387
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,121
Nearby.

388
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:56,561
What about the taxi?
Did you take care of it?

389
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,662
I hid it well.

390
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,402
Give me what you have to give me.

391
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,962
You can't call anyone else with this.

392
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:13,541
You can only talk to me on this phone.

393
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:14,682
Got it.

394
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:20,182
Hey, but what proof did
Jang Jae Gyeong have...

395
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,581
to come after me?

396
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,992
- We don't know yet.
- You don't know?

397
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,561
Hey, Tae Jin.
I'm not the only one in a rush, am I?

398
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,131
You should step up to help.

399
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:33,462
What's your plan from now on?

400
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,601
Nothing.

401
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,672
You should come up with one for me.
That's what we always did.

402
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,272
Chi Hyun and I make the moves,
and you use your brain.

403
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:46,041
Gosh.

404
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,412
Shouldn't you be especially thankful
to me?

405
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:55,022
Don't be so cold-hearted, Tae Jin.

406
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:58,551
You were the one who said...

407
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:01,821
whether I did it knowingly or not,

408
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,361
burning the security camera server...

409
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:07,702
allowed what happened that day
to remain under wraps.

410
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:12,352
If anyone murdered Jun Seo...

411
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:13,942
and staged it as a suicide,

412
00:22:15,922 --> 00:22:17,412
you're the only one I can think of.

413
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,641
What?

414
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,712
Jong Soo is softhearted,

415
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,881
though he might be immature.

416
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,571
Chi Hyun might beat people,

417
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,952
but he's not cruel enough
to give someone a disability.

418
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:31,621
But you're different.

419
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:35,922
When it's really necessary, you'll do it.

420
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:38,631
It looked like...

421
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:41,061
it would've been necessary this time.

422
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:46,772
If Jun Seo had found out
about your affair with his wife, that is.

423
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:51,742
Right?

424
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,892
I burned that security footage,

425
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:56,962
and you were probably on it too.

426
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:59,482
Luckily, we weren't caught.
Am I wrong?

427
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:04,121
Yoon Ho.

428
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,351
Yes?

429
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:08,462
You really shouldn't use your head
like you just said.

430
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:10,631
More than that, don't jump to conclusions.

431
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:13,402
Otherwise, you'll kick the bucket sooner.

432
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:15,202
All right.

433
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:16,732
I plan to do just that.

434
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:18,371
I'll keep my mouth shut...

435
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:20,571
and do as you say.

436
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,912
Please look after me.

437
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,061
Yes?

438
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,682
Gong Jin Wook is 34 years old.

439
00:23:45,682 --> 00:23:46,811
He has two criminal records,

440
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:49,002
one for assault
and one for assisting prostitution.

441
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,801
He was arrested while running
an adult establishment.

442
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,202
He must've met Lee Geun Ho there.

443
00:23:54,422 --> 00:23:55,472
I assume so.

444
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:58,791
But how did he ever get in touch
with a drug manufacturer like the Doctor?

445
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,362
It's all about networks in their world,

446
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:01,541
and they're in different lines of work.

447
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,731
You're right.
Kim Dae Sung also said...

448
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,932
that they were new to the job
and didn't have a distribution network.

449
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:08,422
They relied on 70 to 80 percent
of the sales on CEO Yoon.

450
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,591
Where are you right now?

451
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:13,561
I'm on my way to Lee Geun Ho's.

452
00:24:13,972 --> 00:24:15,022
Do you want to meet me there?

453
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:16,891
Okay. What's the address?

454
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,432
Wait.

455
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:20,631
The guy came.

456
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:22,232
Please head over right away.

457
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,932
I checked yesterday...

458
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:25,781
and found this on the tracks.

459
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:29,172
Usually,
people return to adjust the volume.

460
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,272
Chang Soo, now is not a good time.

461
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:34,081
Please check on your own
and report to me if you find anything.

462
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,341
Okay.

463
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:46,561
Can you say something?

464
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:49,462
Can you hear me well?

465
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:51,232
Yes.

466
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:54,402
Hey.

467
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,902
Are you a butcher?

468
00:24:58,051 --> 00:24:59,101
No.

469
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:01,341
- Why do you ask?
- Well,

470
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,371
I smell something I usually do
when I go to a butcher's.

471
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:15,781
Are we finished?

472
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,962
We have to work on the other side.

473
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:22,492
Give it to me.

474
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,121
- Gosh. I'm here.
- Hey.

475
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:54,492
Welcome. You're early.

476
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,762
Yes. I missed you.

477
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,962
Is Mr. Gong Jin Wook doing well?

478
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:01,932
Of course.

479
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:06,641
I'd like to count today's collection.

480
00:26:06,722 --> 00:26:08,772
As you should. Hold on a minute.

481
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,047
What now?

482
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:28,591
Guess where I am.

483
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:31,358
Where?

484
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,662
CEO Yoon's office.

485
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:36,281
Didn't I tell you not to go there?
Why won't you listen?

486
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,472
We need to do what we must.

487
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:42,101
She's completely clueless.

488
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:43,912
She asked how you were doing.

489
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,881
- Geun Ho.
- Please don't worry.

490
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,301
I'll get the money and head over.

491
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,381
Get out of there right now.
Get out now.

492
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:56,281
Come on, brother. It's fine.

493
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:58,351
She went to get the money.

494
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:01,861
Geun Ho.

495
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,091

Here.

497
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:13,502
Should I go over,
or would you like to come here?

498
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,641
CEO Yoon.

499
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,442
Don't you dare lay a finger on Geun Ho
or I'll kill you.

500
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,641
Like I said,

501
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:22,641
should I go over,
or would you like to come here?

502
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:25,551
I'm coming.

503
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:26,781
Okay.

504
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:31,271
I want the burner phone
with the Doctor's contact...

505
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:32,952
in exchange for Geun Ho.

506
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:34,561
Put Geun Ho on the phone.

507
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,462
Well...

508
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:38,262
He won't last long.

509
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,061
You better get here within 30 minutes.

510
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:45,101
Darn it.

511
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,891
Here, try it out.

512
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,242
Gosh. I can hear well.

513
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:21,502
Then it's finished.

514
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:24,041

if there is another issue.

I searched just in case,
but it's not here.

519
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,821
By the way,

520
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,821
did this person ever visit here?

521
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:13,962
No.

522
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,962
All right. Thank you.

Sure.

524
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,692
I told him to take this off
before throwing it out.

525
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,962
He never listens.

00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:24,002

Did you see a man pass by just now?

00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,942
You came right on time.

547
00:32:55,261 --> 00:32:56,381
Sir.

548
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,111
Did you ask the kid
with the hearing aid what his job was?

549
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:00,331
You haven't caught him yet?

550
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:01,731
Do you know what he does?

551
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,281
I didn't ask him that.

What are you doing here?

555
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:34,022
It's that way.

556
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,131
What happened?

557
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,641
Goodness.

558
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,472
Was that a gunshot?

559
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:00,881
- Excuse us.
- Gosh.

560
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,291
Make way.

561
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,982
- It's dangerous. Step back.
- Okay.

562
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:05,412
Step aside.

Who are you?

571
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:09,541
Did you get me addicted?

572
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:12,782
Why?

573
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:14,451
Tell me.

- Did you call paramedics?
- Yes.

00:35:22,711 --> 00:35:23,881
What about Park Tae Jin?

Did he put you up to it?

No, stay with me.

Do you know Park Tae Jin?
Did he make you do it?

581
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,942
Talk to me.

582
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:43,108
Hey. Did you get me addicted?

583
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,451
Tell me. Who was it?

584

Come on.

585
00:36:21,249 --> 00:36:24,098
Yes. I'll tell you
after I schedule a meeting.

586
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,889
We need to figure out
the password Park Tae Jin wants.

587
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:33,728
You don't know what Park Tae Jin's like.

588
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:37,529
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

589
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:39,898
Even if we don't get the password,

590
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,018
Tae Jin might say what the account is...

591
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:45,139
and how much is in it.

592
00:36:59,198 --> 00:37:00,549
- You're back.
- Yes.

away from the office.

00:37:17,689 --> 00:37:18,799

Yes. Take a seat.

Aren't you?

607
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,279
When you said you sold insurance,

608
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:34,818
I wasn't sure you were even capable.

609
00:37:36,238 --> 00:37:38,358
Will you clean up after yourself?

610
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,958

00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,688
Hey. They're gifts for my clients.

612
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:45,029
- They're gifts?
- You can have one.

613
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:46,958
I'll mix one for you.

614
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,739

616
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:56,869
Yes, you actually do.

617
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,058
Why are you here?

618
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:00,108
What?

619
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:03,648
I came to ask you something.

620
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:08,318
Thanks.

621
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:14,728
What do you want to ask?

622
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:17,958
I don't know...

623
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:22,929
how to explain this.

624
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,369
- What if...
- Yoon Jin.

625
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:27,938
Saying "what if..."

626
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:31,529
and asking what I'd do in that situation.

627
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:33,909
Can you stop talking like that?

628
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,708
Is that what I always say?

629
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,648
The passcode.

630
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:47,759
It's your birthday, isn't it?

631
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:49,429
Zero, three, zero, five.

632
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:54,599
Yesterday, Ji Yeon...

633
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:56,819
Her dead husband used...

634
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:59,689
his ex-girlfriend's birthday
as a passcode...

635
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:00,739
and that's why...

636
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,239
she rushed to throw up.

637
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:05,608
And as soon as she met Tae Jin,

638
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,849
she asked him
about you and Jun Seo. Right?

639
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:12,179
How did you figure all that out?

640
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,939
The money must belong to
Tae Jin and Jun Seo,

641
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,648
but Jun Seo is dead.

642
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:19,288
Tae Jin needs to withdraw the money,

643
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,389
but he thinks
only Ji Yeon knows the passcode.

644
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,299
But the passcode is your birthday,

645
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:30,068
and the only two people in the world
who know that are you and Choi Ji Yeon.

646
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:33,139
No, there are three including me now.

647
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,768
How much do you know?

648
00:39:36,118 --> 00:39:37,739
If what I said so far is right,

649
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:39,938
Yoon Jin.

650
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,409
Why did you come to see me?

651
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:51,688
The money.

652
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,498
Can't I have it?

653
00:39:59,308 --> 00:40:00,358
You can't.

654
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:04,239
- Why not?
- You didn't earn it.

655
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,338
Okay.

656
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,108
I didn't earn it.

657
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,148
Do you think Tae Jin did, then?

658
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:23,619
Hey.

659
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:26,688
What do you think that means?

660
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,728
It means it's Jun Seo's money.

661
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,299
To let people like Tae Jin
and Ji Yeon have it...

662
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:35,529
when they stabbed him in the back.

663
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:36,969
Is that right?

664
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:39,498
It's like...

665
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:42,639
I found a treasure chest.

666
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,338
What's inside?

667
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:45,928
It's hard to prove whose it is,

668
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,648
and we don't know
how that money was earned.

669
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:50,918
It just belongs to whoever opens that box.

670
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:54,788
But it just turns out...

671
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,759
that the password to open
that box of treasures...

672
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,829
is my birthday.

673
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,329
Can I still not keep it?

674
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:09,728
If you think that way,
why did you come to me?

675
00:41:10,649 --> 00:41:11,998
What did you want to hear?

676
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,928
(An insurance plan designed just for you!)

677
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:20,038
Yoon Jin.

678
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:22,579
You also think that this isn't right.

679
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:24,669
That was why you came to see me,

680
00:41:24,669 --> 00:41:27,079
and you were hoping that I'd say
that it wasn't true.

681
00:41:34,439 --> 00:41:35,489
No.

682
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:39,458
That I could keep it.

683
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,869
I was hoping to hear
that you'd tell me to keep that money.

684
00:42:11,808 --> 00:42:12,858
Are you okay?

685
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:15,628
Yes.

686
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,199
Wait. One moment.

687
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:29,978
All right.

688
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,818
I found the CCTV files.

689
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:35,188
I'll watch them.

690
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:36,318
Oh, right.

691
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:17,898
So she was already dead when you got here?

692
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,479
And there weren't
any firearms at the scene?

693
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,099
- Is it CEO Yoon?
- Yes.

694
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:23,829
I'll check the identity.

695
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,739
They'll find out soon enough that
the wound is from a .38 caliber bullet.

696
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:30,108
Please let us know as soon as possible
when you get the analysis results.

697
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:31,938
Unit Chief.

698
00:43:32,229 --> 00:43:33,438
Will you take a look at the CCTV footage?

699
00:43:34,058 --> 00:43:36,009
Oh, let's go.

700
00:43:47,408 --> 00:43:49,259
You also think that this isn't right.

701
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:50,678
That was why you came to see me,

702
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:52,998
and you were hoping that I'd say
that it wasn't true.

703
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,068
Ye Eun.

704
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,038
He... Hello?

705
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,309
Ye Eun?

706
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:10,679
- Ye...
- Mom, it's me!

707
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:17,148
Yes, it's Mom.

708
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:20,759
Were you still awake?

709
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,879
It's morning here.

710
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:23,929
Oh,

711
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,299
that's right.

712
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:28,268
Gosh, I always forget.

713
00:44:29,678 --> 00:44:30,799
By the way,

714
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:33,168
how did you call me?

715
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:37,139
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

716
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:40,679
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

717
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:44,818
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mommy</i>

718
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:48,788
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

719
00:44:53,538 --> 00:44:54,659
Thank you.

720
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,759
I'm so happy that my daughter
is wishing me a happy birthday.

721
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,848
Your birthday was yesterday,

722
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:06,139
but I forgot to call you. I'm sorry.

723
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:07,268
Goodness.

724
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:09,438
That's okay.

725
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:17,509
I miss you so much today.

726
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,349
Me too.

727
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:22,038
Mom, I have to go to school now.

728
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:24,188
Oh, okay. Bye.

729
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,688
Ye Eun.

730
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,219
Ye Eun, I love you.

731
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:29,029
I love you too.

732
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:16,139
That guy didn't even have a murder charge.

733
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:20,338
The fact that he suddenly got bold enough
to point a gun at her chest and shoot...

734
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,809
It means he had a glimpse into his future.

735
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,799
In Korea, a nation surrounded by
the sea on three sides,

736
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:26,579
if you shoot and kill someone with a gun,

737
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,349
it means he intends to
stop dealing drugs here.

738
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:31,619
Then, what about the fact
that he shot CEO Yoon?

739
00:46:31,768 --> 00:46:34,788
He must've known CEO Yoon would chase
him down until the end if he didn't.

740
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:36,458
Also,

741
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:38,308
if the Doctor leaves Gong Jin Wook out...

742
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:40,228
and deals directly with CEO Yoon,

743
00:46:40,848 --> 00:46:43,268
it would leave Gong Jin Wook
with no cards to play.

744
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:48,888
He was probably thinking he wouldn't leave
the Doctor any other choices.

745
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:51,538
I've already put him on
the wanted and no-fly lists.

746
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:54,679
He won't have any other choice
but to stow away.

747
00:46:57,198 --> 00:47:00,648
Check to see if Gong Jin Wook has
any ties in China or Southeast Asia.

748
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:02,788
- Yes, ma'am.
- Look into stowaway routes too.

749
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:04,119
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

750
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:08,288
Chang Soo.

751
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:12,128
You still haven't answered my question.

752
00:47:12,908 --> 00:47:13,958
Sir?

753
00:47:14,618 --> 00:47:15,668
How did you get here?

754
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:17,568
You went to Lee Geun Ho's place.

755
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:18,938
Oh, that?

756
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:21,239
Well, I was searching Lee Geun Ho's house,

757
00:47:23,388 --> 00:47:25,179
and I found Gong Jin Wook's address.

758
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:27,338
So, I went to that location,

759
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:30,108
and Gong Jin Wook was just leaving
right then.

760
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:32,018
So I tailed him.

761
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:35,119
You went to Gong Jin Wook's address
by yourself?

762
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:37,188
Not even requesting backup...

763
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:38,389
or making any reports?

764
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:39,759
Yes, sir.

765
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:42,088
I was going to stake out
at the scene and contact you.

766
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:45,128
I was the one who was surprised...

767
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:46,458
to see you here.

768
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,099
Got it.

769
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:57,739
So, Captain...

770
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:01,909
Have you perhaps been taking Etaphen?

771
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:04,549
Yes.

772
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:06,719
Are you all right?

773
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:08,318
So far.

774
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:10,619
That's a relief.

775
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,518
We should catch them soon.

776
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:14,038
I'll gather the evidence,

777
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:16,128
and return to the station first
with CEO Yoon's man outside.

778
00:48:23,178 --> 00:48:24,299
Get back safely.

779
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,369
I'll see you there.

780
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,538
Yes, sir.

781
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:43,619
(Anhyun Shopping Mall)

782
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:48,128
Get in.

783
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:56,919
The scene is busy. Go and help.

784
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:58,049
I'll take him in by myself.

785
00:48:58,049 --> 00:48:59,099
Yes, sir.

786
00:49:00,488 --> 00:49:01,538
Key.

787
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:20,018
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin Wook?

788
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,738
I'm sorry, but could you speak
a little louder?

789
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:25,358
I have bad hearing.

790
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:27,599
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin Wook?

791
00:49:28,018 --> 00:49:30,898
Because she wanted to make direct deals
with the Doctor for Lemon Mulberry...

792
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:33,568
She wanted his burner phone.

793
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:40,579
Was it a trade for Lee Geun Ho?

794
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:43,478
Yes.

795
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:59,299
Where are we going now?

796
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,029
Listen carefully.

797
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:04,799
What?

798
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:09,338
If you keep the fact
that you saw me last time...

799
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:12,639
a secret until you die,

800
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:16,349
I'll let you get out after a short stint.

801
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:17,809
Got it?

802
00:50:18,868 --> 00:50:20,648
By "a short stint,"

803
00:50:20,868 --> 00:50:22,299
how much are you talking?

804
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:24,418
I don't know that, you punk.

805
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:28,029
If anyone asks, just keep your mouth shut.
Got it?

806
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:36,628
Detective.

807
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:38,369
I...

808
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:41,139
did what I did because CEO Yoon made me,

809
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,068
but I've killed quite a few people.

810
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,909
Are you sure you can reduce my sentence?

811
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:48,349
That's probably unlikely.

812
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,579
Why don't you just let me off...

813
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:54,818
on the shoulder over there?

814
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:56,489
Are you out of your mind?

815
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:58,588
Numerous people saw me take you away.

816
00:50:58,868 --> 00:50:59,868
I can't free you.

817
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:02,059
Darn it! What do you want me to do?

818
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:04,489
I know you and CEO Yoon are close.

819
00:51:04,609 --> 00:51:06,199
I saw you accepting money from her.

820
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:09,128
It's not like keeping this a secret
would allow me to get out faster.

821
00:51:09,848 --> 00:51:12,768
Right.
That other detective at the scene...

822
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:14,708
I remembered him.

823
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,938
He's the one I drugged
with Lemon Mulberry.

824
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:19,579
He's a druggie, isn't he?

825
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:21,849
What?

826
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:29,518
What's wrong with detectives these days?

827
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:31,858
One's a druggie,

828
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:34,389
- and...
- Shut your mouth!

829
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,529
I can assure you
I'll live quietly in hiding.

830
00:51:36,908 --> 00:51:38,358
Just let me off at the intersection.

831
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:42,128
If you don't, I have nothing to lose.

832
00:52:11,979 --> 00:52:13,259

833
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:15,768

842
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,089
What is this text about?

843
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:27,859
It's just as it says.

844
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:32,160
Do you even know
what password you're talking about?

845
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,630
No, I don't.

846
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:38,331
You're trying to feel me out.

847
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,300
I guess
you could keep asking Ji Yeon instead.

848
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,441
Let me ask you one thing.

849
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,380
The money.

850
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,180
Where did it come from?

851
00:54:54,101 --> 00:54:55,380
Why do you want to know?

852
00:54:58,201 --> 00:54:59,921
Of course, I want to know...

853
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,260
since I'll be taking half of it.

854
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,990
I don't want to get in trouble later.

855
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:10,001
Answer me.

856
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,700
Where did it come from?

857
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,601
Is it dirty money?

858
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,800
If that's the case...

859
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,211
If that's the case,
are you going to keep the password...

860
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,280
a secret from me
as an act of social justice?

861
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,880
I know you don't care
where the money is from.

862
00:55:33,871 --> 00:55:36,191
I've seen many likes of you
while working as a prosecutor.

in the beginning."

At the same time,
you still do whatever you want.

866

00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,070
You chose this place.

You booked the whole place
to transfer money online,

869
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:58,311
but you demanded me to tell you
where the money came from.

Yoon Jin. I'll say this as a friend.

871
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,121

Don't you agree?

873
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,540
So, enough of the nonsense,

874
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,630
and tell me the password.

906
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:51,081
but it was useless.

907
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,780
I was trying to keep
the steering wheel steady,

908
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,621
but this was where I ended up.

909
00:59:57,371 --> 00:59:58,851
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

910
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,071
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine.

911
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,691
I'm glad you're not any worse.

912
01:00:02,841 --> 01:00:04,791
It was a close call.

913
01:00:05,071 --> 01:00:06,440
We have to transfer him now.

914
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,440
- Okay.
- Sure.

915
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,831
Chang Soo, take care.

916
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,200
I'll visit you at the hospital later.

917
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,001
- Soo Hyun, take care of him.
- Okay.

918
01:00:14,621 --> 01:00:15,671
Gosh.

919
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,570
That was unexpected.

920
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,641
Someone died from a gunshot,

921
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,960
and while transferring a related suspect,

922
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,110
he also died.

923
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,280
I'm scared of what tomorrow will bring.

924
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,021
The police commissioner will be
on the chief of police's case.

925
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,891
And the chief of police will want
to kill me.

926
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,570
What is it?

927
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:53,811
- Nothing.
- Just say it.

928
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:56,280
You think something is suspicious.

929
01:00:56,891 --> 01:00:57,941
What is it?

930
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,921
Ko Gi Sung attacked him
from behind the passenger's seat.

931
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,320
From this street,

932
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,777
the car swerved right...

933
01:01:05,801 --> 01:01:07,490
and went off-road in a straight line.

934
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,291
What?

935
01:01:09,341 --> 01:01:10,590
Didn't Chang Soo say this?

936
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:14,030
He said Ko Gi Sung kicked him,

937
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,401
so he blocked with his arm.

938
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,480
Doing that would make his body turn left.

939
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,530
Which means,
the steering wheel would also turn left.

940
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,771
But, the steering wheel turned right.

941
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:25,171
Well...

942
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,581
If the steering wheel had turned left,

943
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,380
he would've crossed the centerline
to run into that.

944
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,610
Maybe he subconsciously turned...

945
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:38,151
the steering wheel to the right.

946
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:40,921
While doing that,

947
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:44,191
he turned it too much
without realizing it.

948
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:46,490
I think it could happen.

949
01:01:46,741 --> 01:01:47,791
I guess so.

950
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,160
Let's go.

951
01:02:08,701 --> 01:02:10,251
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

952
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,050
How did the driver Kim Chang Soo escape?

953
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,360
When we got here,
he was already on the shore.

954
01:02:17,911 --> 01:02:20,440
Did anyone touch the window
by the driver's seat?

955
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,360
No, we just got it out of the water.

956
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:24,961
But it's automatic.

957
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,901
It wouldn't have opened underwater...

958
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,630
since the engine would shut down.

959
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,171
I see.

960
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:32,541
Wait...

961
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:34,811
Does that mean he went in the water
with the window open?

962
01:02:36,431 --> 01:02:37,481
In this weather?

963
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,450
Did Chang Soo...

964
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:51,983
(Connection)

965
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:30,030
(Connection)

966
01:03:30,188 --> 01:03:32,299
Now that Jun Seo is dead,

967
01:03:32,299 --> 01:03:34,709
who's running the Lemon Mulberry business?

968
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,668
- Good job.
- Thanks.

969
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:37,768
Sang Eui.

970
01:03:37,768 --> 01:03:40,438
I told you not to discuss such matters
on the phone. Didn't I?

971
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:41,488
Are you the Doctor?

972
01:03:41,538 --> 01:03:44,038
- Sang Eui, did you meet with Jae Gyeong?
- Yes.

973
01:03:44,038 --> 01:03:45,088
I knew it.

974
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:48,579
This won't do.

975
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:49,928
Do you really want to kill him?

976
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:51,179
Do you have a better idea?

977
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:53,819
Park Tae Jin is behind it all, you fools!

978
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:55,119
I won't die without a bang.

979
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,288
I'll drag you all down with me.

980
01:03:56,288 --> 01:03:58,319
Did you kill Jun Seo with Tae Jin?

981
01:03:58,319 --> 01:03:59,468
What do you mean?

982
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,058
You must be confused.

983
01:04:02,058 --> 01:04:05,358
You believe
one of us definitely killed Jun Seo,

984
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:07,998
but you don't have the evidence.
Right?

985
01:04:07,998 --> 01:04:09,199
You put a lot of work into it.

986
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:10,268
Too bad.

987
01:04:10,268 --> 01:04:13,069
My hunch tells me I'm almost there.

988
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:14,119
I just have to reach out...

989
01:04:14,538 --> 01:04:15,758
and you'll be done.

990
01:04:20,308 --> 01:04:22,198
