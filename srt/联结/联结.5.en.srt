(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:11,780
He indicated the legatee
of his company's full shares

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,334
and the beneficiary of
the five million dollars.

5
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,358
There is one more name
we all know, Lee Myung Guk.

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,329
He was last seen entering
the subway station by his office.

7
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,039
- Where did he work at?
- Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals.

8
00:00:20,064 --> 00:00:21,380
Won Jong Soo's the CEO.

9
00:00:21,404 --> 00:00:22,691
Does Lee Eun Hee live here?

10
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:23,825
Mr. Lee Myung Guk's daughter.

11
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,514
What did your father do at
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals?

12
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:30,437
(Narcomaniac symptoms appear.)

13
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,247
Jang Jae Gyeong.

14
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:32,303
You can't take me to a hospital.

15
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:33,123
(Heading home with
the help of Yoon Jin.)

16
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:33,718
(Park Jun Seo)

17
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,191
(Yoon Jin found the
Lemon Mulberry.)

18
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,592
How could you do drugs?

19
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,948
You can't tell anyone
that I'm addicted.

20
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:42,337
If you're going to go to Lee Myung
Guk's house, I'll give you a ride.

21
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:43,083
Who is that?

22
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,266
Was Lee Myung Guk
a senior in our club?

23
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,551
It has been seven months, but
the body hardly decomposed.

24
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:51,172
This means he was frozen after
death and was only defrosted recently.

25
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:53,409
(That's the time the Molotov bomb
thrown into the house.)

26
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,248
(Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin
escaped from the fire.)

27
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:57,311
(Lee Myung Guk's body
was destroyed by the fire.)

28
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:59,080
Why was Lee Myung Guk's
body found at his home?

29
00:00:59,104 --> 00:00:59,532
(Jong Soo is nevrous
and calls Tae Jin.)

30
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:04,588
This can be much cleaner than having
him suddenly show up without notice.

31
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:05,682
Audiophile?

32
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:06,990
Park Jun Seo...

33
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:08,867
Is this where Park
Bok Rye lives?

34
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:10,104
That's my mother.

35
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:12,788
When she was being treated
at Woonjong Medical Center,

36
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:14,967
I heard there was an
accident with her medication.

37
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,625
I don't know about
that. Go away.

38
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:17,387
(The bereaved family
refused to be covered.)

39
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,680
(They returned empty-handed.)

40
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,446
We should change tactics.

41
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,570
Why was it this
construction site?

42
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:22,913
(Investigating the
construction site.)

43
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:24,587
That's blocked now.

44
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,543
(Mill and Rice Cakes)

45
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:26,975
Where is that camera?

46
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:27,622
(Spotting the CCTV...)

47
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:28,459
One second.

48
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,315
(CCTV footage)

49
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,546
It was this man. The man
who got a copy of the video.

50
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,784
(Jeong Yoon Ho was
watching at that time.)

51
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,984
There is some footage on
here that I had backed up.

52
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:36,875
No, it's fine.

53
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,237
I'll be right back.

54
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,912
(Yoon Ho heads in the mill.)

55
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,254
Hey, are you already back?

56
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,388
(Jae Gyeong
returns a little late.)

57
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,552
Sir.

58
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,017
(The mill owner provided Jae Gyeong 
a copy of the CCTV footage.)

59
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,380
(The mill owner dies.)

60
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,115
Sir.

61
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:49,779
(The mill owner dies.)

62
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:51,570
(And the CCTV server
was destroyed in the fire...)

63
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,181
Gosh.

64
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,063
Does he think he's all grown up now?

65
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,133
He thinks it's actually okay...

66
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,363
for him to sleep over at a friend's house.

67
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,502
I'll head home after a couple more rounds.

68
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:15,403
Yes.

69
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:18,412
No.

70
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,212
I'll eat at home.

71
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:23,983
Just set something simple. Okay.

72
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:27,313
(Connection)

73
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:30,213
(Episode 5)

74
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:33,943
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

75
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,110
(Time spent on committing the crime)

76
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,181
Five minutes.

77
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,620
(5-6 minutes to commit the crime)

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,950
At most, six minutes.

79
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,821
(5-6 minutes to commit the crime)

80
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,601
It was still bright out.

81
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,661
If they had walked through
the main street,

82
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,900
people would have noticed
since they were covered in blood.

83
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,145
(Who is the Pilo-dong redevelopment for?)

84
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,101
But there are no witnesses.

85
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,670
I'm certain they escaped in a vehicle.

86
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,240
Let me go and grab
a flash drive from my car.

87
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,050
(We press our own oils.)

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,150
The culprit knew I would head back
to my car.

89
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,291
Where were they watching from?

90
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,691
(Modeun Hardware Store)

91
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,960
(Residents who lose properties
go into debt)

92
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,800
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

93
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,971
(Pilo-dong site, Mill)

94
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:39,640
It was 12:31 p.m.

95
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,411
Construction work
was going on in that alley.

96
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,281
If he came in...

97
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
this was the only way.

98
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,480
(Construction in progress)

99
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,281
(Modeun Hardware Store)

100
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,121
(Construction in progress)

101
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,990
It was a three-minute walk
from the mill to the crosswalk.

102
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,490
Not a single car drove into the alley.

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,871
It took me about 30 seconds
to cross the road...

104
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:09,700
and that's how long I stopped looking.

105
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,601
I bought some apples...

106
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:15,210
and set my eyes back on the mill
about a minute later.

107
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,371
(5-6 minutes to commit crime,
4 minutes 30 seconds)

108
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,941
That means the culprit
had two minutes at most.

109
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,281
(2 minutes at most)

110
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,281
It's impossible.

111
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,180
To kill a man, burn the server,
and drive away unnoticed...

112
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,920
in under two minutes?

113
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,791
No.

114
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,990
It's utterly impossible.

115
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,221
(Residents who lose properties
go into debt)

116
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,531
Then...

117
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,631
(No to redevelopment)

118
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
That's it.

119
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,430
The culprit parked at that dead end...

120
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,131
and watched me.

121
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,501
(Residents who lose properties
go into debt)

122
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,721
The oil is still wet.

123
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:58,881
This car just parked here.

124
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
My gosh!

125
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,931
Who are you?

126
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
I'm a detective.

127
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:20,441
Do you have cameras at home?

128
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,470
No. My goodness.

129
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,040
Are there any CCTV cameras around here?

130
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,210
Why do you ask?

131
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,981
Who owns this car?

132
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,381
The people opposite here.

133
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:33,450
Was it here during the day?

134
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,551
No, because they drive to work.

135
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,450
I'd like to know if another car...

136
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,460
was parked here during the day.

137
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:43,790
There was another car here.

138
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,160
- Right here?
- Yes.

139
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:48,900
I came out to get some doenjang
to make an early dinner.

140
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,941
A car was parked right outside the gate.

141
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,900
Did you see someone inside?

142
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,470
I only get a glimpse from inside my home.

143
00:06:57,741 --> 00:06:59,410
I don't know if anyone was inside.

144
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:01,011
You didn't come outside?

145
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,181
You could've wanted to ask
why they parked here.

146
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,381
Oh, it was a taxi.

147
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:07,950
- A taxi?
- Yes.

148
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,321
I thought my neighbor had called for one.

149
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,191
(Welcome to Chukbok Mill)

150
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,801
He was such a nice guy.

151
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,571
- What a disaster.
- Poor guy.

152
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,801
Oh, dear.

153
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,881
(Who is the Pilo-dong redevelopment for?)

154
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,090
If the taxi came this way...

155
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,691
(Taxi route)

156
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,590
Did the taxi make a right turn?

158
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,700

(CCTV)

162
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,511

if he had turned right.

163

(Pilo-dong site, Mill)

164
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,691
To Pilo-dong.

(To Pilo-dong)

166
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,840
That's the culprit's escape route.

167
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:34,040
The taxi driver is the culprit...

168
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,840
or at least an accomplice.

169
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:39,140
If we check the cameras on the main street
that heads to Pilo-dong,

170
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,441
we can identify the culprit.

171
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:41,751
Captain Jang.

172
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,311
Whose case do you think this is?

173
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:45,681
Inspector Yoo's.

174
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,251
It has a jurisdiction
and a detective in charge.

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,350
Don't you give a crap about seniority now?

176
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,621
Do you think
the special promotion made you my equal?

177
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:57,660
Do you really not know
or know and are pretending not to?

178
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,931
This murder. The body
found in Lee Myung Guk's home.

179
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,371
They're all connected
to Park Jun Seo's case.

180
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm telling you, Park Jun Seo's case
is no longer a suicide case.

181
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,410
Exactly, you punk.

182
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,741
Whether Park Jun Seo's case
is a suicide case or not.

183
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,850
Whether we'll link this case
to Lee's and investigate at once.

184
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,381
That's for me to decide, not you!

185
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,751
Instead of focusing on your drug case,

186
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,751
you dug around mine...

187
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,090
because you wanted the insurance money.

188
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,921
That's why another man ended up dead.

189
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:26,460
How will you pay for it?

190
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,491
This case is drug-related.

191
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,861
I can't believe what I'm hearing now.

192
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,761
Well? Where?

193
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:35,501
Where are the drugs?

194
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,030
Oh, over there?

195
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,770
Did you find drugs in there?

196
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Or...

197
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,710
Park Jun Seo, that friend of yours...
Was he a druggie?

198
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,241
You might think...

199
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,910
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,
and the mill owner too...

200
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,150
had something
to do with drugs, but I think...

201
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,981
You were always there...

202
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,590
and that's what I think
is the weirdest thing!

203
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:56,821
Explain that.

204
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,621
Explain it, you moron.

205
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,830
How dare you?

206
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,030
Hey!

207
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,501
Shoes are a size eight.

208
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:21,481
Jang Jae Gyeong!

209
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:22,981
How dare you...

210
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,381
You can't come in without shoe covers.

211
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,881
Detective Min.

212
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,221
Get me some shoe covers.

213
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,761
You think nothing of your seniors.

214
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:37,131
Are you already back?

215
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,761
Goodness.

216
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,131
Hello. What can I get you?

217
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,131
He wouldn't have brought a weapon.

218
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,070
What great timing.
I just made a new batch.

219
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,471
When the man turned away
to get some rice cakes,

220
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,211
the killer stabbed him in the back
with scissors for the plastic wrap.

221
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,481
Once.

222
00:10:57,251 --> 00:10:58,251
Twice.

223
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,050
Thrice.

224
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,290
That wasn't enough still.

225
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,820
That's why he used the scales.

226
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,320
He didn't aim for the vital points.

227
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,030
So he wasn't that experienced.

228
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,231
A shoe size eight,

229
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,170
about 170cm tall.

230
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:16,831
But why?

231
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,341
Why did he burn the CCTV server?

232
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
To delete what?

233
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,621
The taxi driver.

234
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,761
(Anhyun Taxis, Drivers wanted)

235
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:43,761
(Schedules)

236
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,870
(0229 An Jong Chan, 0233 No Gyu Min)

237
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,570
Zero, two, three, three.

238
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,511
Mr. Park.

239
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:57,981
Do you need something?

240
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,780
Not at all.

241
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,511
- Take care.
- Bye.

242
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,050
Hello.

243
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,951
What took you so long?

244
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:11,121
You should be relieved
I was here on my day off.

245
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:12,591
Okay.

246
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,491
So, did you take a look?

247
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,930
Will you buy me a drink?

248
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,201
Fine, I will. Tell me already.

249
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,131
It was No Gyu Min.

250
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,371
The guy who drove 0233 on February 23.

251
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,631
No Gyu Min?

252
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:26,201
Who's that? Do you know him?

253
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,871
No, not well.

254
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,971
He joined after you quit.

255
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:31,741
I only said hi a few times.

256
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,650
Give me his number and address.

257
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,481
Hang on.

258
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,251
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

259
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,690
It's 010-0847...

260
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,091
My gosh.

261
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:44,861
Hey!

262
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:45,961
Sorry.

263
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,991
- My bad.
- What the...

264
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,101
- Hello?
- Why? What just happened?

265
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,170
Never mind.
Some psycho almost plowed into me.

266
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,930
Darn it. Give me the number.

267
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,601
Okay.

268
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,481
There was another car here.

269
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,650
Was Jun Seo's taxi driver the culprit?

270
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm the detective you talked to earlier.

271
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:28,871
Was the taxi parked
outside your home orange?

272
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:30,831
What? No, it wasn't.

273
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,800
It was silver.

274
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Okay, thanks.

275
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,611
It's a different taxi.

276
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,550
The culprit is another taxi driver.

277
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,680
Hello. Can I ask you something?

278
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,121
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

279
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,251
Hello.

280
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,390
February 23, licence plate 35A0233.

281
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,390
Could you tell me the driver
who was driving at the time?

282
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,831
Just a moment.

283
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,600
(Yoon Mi Ja, Chief of Accounting)

284
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,701
It was No Gyu Min.

285
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,270
What's this about?

286
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,810
The No Gyu Min you just mentioned.

287
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,540
Is he at work right now?

288
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,981
No. He quit yesterday.

289
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:14,341
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

290
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:16,881
Do you have his number and address?

291
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,150
Yes.

292
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,020
- Shall I write it down for you?
- Yes, please.

293
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,331
Did anyone ask the same question today?

294
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,290
No.

295
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,570
If anyone comes to ask the same thing,

296
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,371
please call this number right away.

297
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,601
Okay.

298
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,471
Thank you. Have a good day.

299
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,721
(Sohyun-ro 133)

300
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:01,761
Is anyone home?

301
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Who's there?

302
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,170
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

303
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,800
Is there a Mr. No Gyu Min here?

304
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,310
- No Gyu Min?
- Yes.

305
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,511
It's the guy who used to live there.
Why?

306
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,780
Did he go somewhere?

307
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,020
He said he was suddenly leaving
the other day,

308
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,390
and when I looked this morning,
he was gone.

309
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,951
By the way,
did he get into some kind of trouble?

310
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,491
Didn't he say where he was going
or anything?

311
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:34,761
No.

312
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:38,261
He said to wire him the deposit
once the room gets rented out.

313
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:45,300
Was there perhaps a car
that Mr. No used to drive?

314
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,611
It seemed like the deposit was
his entire fortune. He didn't have a car.

315
00:15:50,111 --> 00:15:51,680
Should I give you
his phone number, at least?

316
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,511
No, I have his number.

317
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,011
Then,

318
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,481
if he calls about his deposit,

319
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
please call me at this number.

320
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:02,020
Thank you.

321
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,721
He hasn't gotten himself
into big trouble, has he?

322
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,390
No.

323
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:42,491
Darn it.

324
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,361
Why is it so hard to reach you?

325
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,501
Why? What's up?

326
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,170
Hey, I think we were filmed.

327
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,201
- On the CCTV camera at the mill.
- What do you mean?

328
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,940
On the day Jun Seo died.

329
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,611
Early in the morning.
In the alley at Pilo-dong.

330
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,011
There was a CCTV camera there.

331
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,711
What?

332
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,780
- So?
- What do you think?

333
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,451
I took care of it.

334
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,751
"Took care of it?" Took care of what?

335
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
You didn't...

336
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:14,461
Don't worry.

337
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:19,160
I took good care of it
so it wouldn't cause any trouble.

338
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:24,070
Where are you right now?

339
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,201
Oh, when I watched the CCTV footage,

340
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:29,111
a taxi driver dropped Jun Seo off
in that alley.

341
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:30,711
So, I came to the taxi driver's house.

342
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,540
I was trying to see
if I could get anything, but...

343
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,751
Jae Gyeong got here before us.

344
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,320
Come to Pilo-dong right this instant.

345
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,020
Don't do anything else,
and just come right away.

346
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,790
I told you not to worry.

347
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:47,190
I think Jae Gyeong didn't get
any leads either.

348
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:49,761
The taxi driver seems to have disappeared.

349
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,660
So, shall I try looking for him?

350
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,701
Hey!

351
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,930
Stop uttering nonsense
and just come if I tell you to.

352
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,940
Why are you yelling? You startled me.

353
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,770
Okay. I'll be right there.

354
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,910
Should I bring some beer...

355
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,820
(Park Jun Seo)

356
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:45,050
You'll probably need to take two pills
at a time now.

357
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,951
Don't take them all at once
just because you feel the urge.

358
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,040
I know I'm late.

359
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:41,911
However,

360
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,711
I'm going to keep trying.

361
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:46,211
I'll put everything back in order.

362
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,350
How could you do drugs?

363
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,120
Park Jun Seo, Lee Myung Guk,
and the mill owner too...

364
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,620
had something
to do with drugs, but I think...

365
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,350
You were always there...

366
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,761
and that's what I think
is the weirdest thing!

367
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,370
(Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan)

368
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,310
A murder case occurred near
the site of Park Jun Seo's death.

369
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,580
Please call when you have the time.

370
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,620
(Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan)

371
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,520
- This is Park Tae Jin.
- Hello, Prosecutor Park.

372
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,360
You saw the text I sent you, right?

373
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,691
Yes, what was that about?

374
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:09,830
We haven't specified a suspect yet.

375
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,461
We're investigating the surrounding area.

376
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,431
But the area near the crime scene
is a very quiet alley.

377
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,431
So, what does that have to do with
Park Jun Seo's suicide?

378
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,171
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong was...

379
00:21:21,171 --> 00:21:23,370
investigating Park Jun Seo's suicide
when this happened.

380
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,411
Jang Jae Gyeong is also the person
who reported the case.

381
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,141
- Pardon?
- There was a mill...

382
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,751
in the alley to the site
where Park Jun Seo died.

383
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,320
There was a CCTV camera
underneath the tarp.

384
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:36,421
The suspect must've found out,
and I think this incident occurred...

385
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,921
in the process of
getting rid of the footage.

386
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:41,491
Hello?

387
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:43,761
Yes, I'm listening.

388
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,360
There was a CCTV camera?

389
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,471
Have you gotten access to the server?

390
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,201
Well, that is...

391
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,401
The suspect burned down the whole server.

392
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,141
We will send it to NFS.

393
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,241
But it has practically melted,

394
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,011
so it might be hard to get anything.

395
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:01,681
What about Jang Jae Gyeong?

396
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,481
He went somewhere in a hurry
from the site.

397
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,721
I mean, did Jang Jae Gyeong see
that CCTV footage?

398
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,290
He had gone to grab...

399
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,491
a USB flash drive
from his car to get a copy of the server.

400
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:12,820
That's when the murder occurred.

401
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,161
So, he must not have seen it either.

402
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,600
So, what is it you want to do?

403
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Pardon?

404
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:30,141
So, this case...

405
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,040
will have to be considered connected
to Park Jun Seo's suicide.

406
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:36,211
I will have to combine the two cases,
and...

407
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,110
- Look here, Inspector Yoo.
- Yes?

408
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,820
Based on what evidence
will you connect...

409
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,290
Park Jun Seo's suicide
and the murder case at the mill?

410
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:45,761
Then, are you saying
Park Jun Seo was murdered?

411
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,630
No, I don't mean that, but...

412
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,991
A murder occurred at the mill,

413
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:53,431
and the suspect destroyed the CCTV
in case his face was caught on camera.

414
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,800
As for the motive, you can look into
those close to the victim...

415
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,701
or see if anything has disappeared.

416
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,270
Oh, right.

417
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,270
Treat this as a separate case.

418
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:03,641
Also,

419
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,251
Inspector Yoo.
Will you call and text me...

420
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,080
every time there is a new case
in Anhyun City?

421
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,080
No, sir. I'm sorry.

422
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:28,530
Get up.

423
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:01,701
Wipe the floor first.

424
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,211
Are you sure no one saw you?

425
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,580
Yes.

426
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,550
Did you get rid of
your fingerprints and hair?

427
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,661
Yes.

428
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,030
Did you get rid of your hair too?

429
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,300
Chi Hyun, I got rid of everything.

430
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:42,971
If you went in there
to get rid of the CCTV footage,

431
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:44,141
why did you kill someone?

432
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,211
All you had to do was scare him
and lock him up.

433
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,151
There was no time.

434
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,780
I had a feeling Jae Gyeong...

435
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,520
would barge in at any moment.

436
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,991
You can't keep causing trouble
or you'll be tracked down.

437
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,991
You should think of your wife
and your kids.

438
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:04,231
I do.

439
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:07,231
I do this because I do.
I didn't do it for myself.

440
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:09,300
I did it for Si Jung, Jong Soo, Tae Jin,

441
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
and you.

442
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm taking the bullet
so all of our lives can work out.

443
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Right?

444
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,141
Am I wrong?

445
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,151
Did Jae Gyeong see us in the footage?

446
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
No.

447
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
I don't know.

448
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,090
But...

449
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
I have a feeling he didn't.

450
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,130
But...

451
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,060
how did he know
we passed that road that night?

452
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,931
Also, how did he show up
at Lee Myung Guk's place?

453
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Are you sure you have no idea...

454
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,711
who put Lee Myung Guk's body back?

455
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,141
I told you. I don't know.

456
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Here...

457
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:45,130
(February 23, 2024, 10:56 p.m.)

458
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,330
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

459
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,880
He got out here on purpose...

460
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,810
so he would be captured on camera.

461
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,161
This is 25 minutes after he got off.

462
00:27:16,461 --> 00:27:18,691
Why did this car suddenly stop here?

463
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,661
Did they see the culprit?

464
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,741
(Lieutenant Kim Chang Soo)

465
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,011
(New Message)

466
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,451
Lieutenant Kim Chang Soo was here.

467
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,080
Did you look through the CCTV footage?

468
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,090
I didn't either.

469
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:44,451
Sorry, sir.

470
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:56,300
(Sergeant Oh Soo Hyun)

471
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,070
(Captain, where are you?
I bought the medication for you.)

472
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,370
Black SUV.

473
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,540
83P3234.

474
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,241
Run a vehicle check.

475
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:07,780
(Black SUV, 83P3234. Run a vehicle check.)

476
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,411
Woo Sung.

477
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:37,511
Yes?

478
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:39,141
Let's say...

479
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,441
you're married.

480
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,481
I can't afford to get married.

481
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,251
Let's just suppose.

482
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,151
You're married,

483
00:28:48,421 --> 00:28:51,221
and your wife cheats on you
with your friend.

484
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:52,691
If you find out,

485
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,330
what would you do?

486
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,731
First, I'll have to see
what my friend is like.

487
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:02,300
Is he someone I can beat in a fight?

488
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,501
If you were to meet with him,

489
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,171
wouldn't a construction site be good?

490
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,441
Of all places?

491
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:11,471
And that friend happens to be
a prosecutor.

492
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,340
Then I shouldn't fight him.

493
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,451
Right.

494
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,850
You would probably try
to talk it out at first.

495
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,820
But you'll grow more angry over time.

496
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:23,020
You'd feel a sense of loss too.

497
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,651
And that's why...

498
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,721
it could develop into a fistfight.

499
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:27,721
Is that necessary?

500
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,790
After that,

501
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:32,030
he somehow pushes you off
the ninth floor...

502
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,401
and you die.

503
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,370
Since he's a prosecutor,

504
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,501
he tries to cover up the case.

505
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,901
He performs
the postmortem screening himself...

506
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,911
and tries to skip the autopsy.

507
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,110
Don't you think...

508
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,110
this story makes sense?

509
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:53,550
Does it or not?

510
00:29:54,981 --> 00:29:55,991
Well...

511
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,691
That friend of yours who died...
Did he fall from the ninth floor?

512
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
- Yes.
- And that friend's wife...

513
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,931
and his prosecutor friend
are having an affair?

514
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:06,401
Yes.

515
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,770
It smells fishy.

516
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:14,641
Doesn't it?

517
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,441
But you need evidence.
Did you find anything?

518
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,310
Do you have any pictures
of their affair or any recordings?

519
00:30:21,141 --> 00:30:22,141
Right.

520
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,481
That's what you need to work on from now.

521
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,050
Me?

522
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,120
- You're here.
- Yes.

523
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Why are you standing? Sit down.

524
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,560
The board meeting is tomorrow,

525
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,761
so I was about to invite you as our tutor,
but you came on your own.

526
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:42,001
(KH Pharmaceutical)

527
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,731
I reviewed the documents you sent.

528
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,770
It was hard going through
such a thick book after so long.

529
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,570
What did you think?

530
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:51,471
Good.

531
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,340
Let's have dinner later,

532
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,711
then head over to my hideout
to finish reviewing it.

533
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,421
What is it? Did something happen?

534
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,620
Yesterday, someone was murdered
at the mill in front...

535
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,721
of the construction site Jun Seo died.

536
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,721
And?

537
00:31:07,191 --> 00:31:08,891
It seems that mill had a security camera.

538
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,630
What?

539

540
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,300

541
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:15,661
Nothing could be salvaged.

542
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,401
But,

543
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,270

544
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,040
What do you mean he was there?

545
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,981
He left to get a copy of the server,

546
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:31,810
someone murdered the mill owner...

547
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:33,020
and burned the server down.

No.

551

Are you sure?

552
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,130
I told you. I don't know.

553
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,530
So what? What happened?

554
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,540
Just get right to the point.

555
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:58,711
The police are investigating.

556
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,280
It will be investigated as...

557
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:04,380
a homicide by a robber
unrelated to Jun Seo's case.

558
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,520
Don't worry too much.

559
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,251
If we don't have to worry about it,
why tell us?

560
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,050
Hey.

561
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520

- Hey. Did you arrive?
- Yes.

By the way, her husband was cremated
less than a week ago.

she'll have full makeup on.

I sent you,

576

All right.

Also...

579
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,110
It's awkward to call her this woman
and that woman.

580
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,080
We also shouldn't say her name in public.

581
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,511
Come up with a nickname for her, will you?

582
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,350
All right.

583
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,320
You promise to give me
the 100,000 dollars, right?

584
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,790
Hey.
Don't you think this is more productive...

585
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,491
than trying to land an exclusive?

to get married and buy a house too.

don't you know 100,000 dollars
is not enough to do either?

Okay. Fine.

someone named Park Bok Rye died...

from a medical accident.

Sir,

612
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,560
I already know everything.

613
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:39,300
Do you think I came here
without doing some basic research?

614
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,471
I talked to the victim's family already.

615
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:45,211
I thought of going
straight to the hospital director,

616
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,141
but came here first
to give you a chance to talk.

You can say whatever you want,

618
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:56,620
but it better not be
"I don't know" or "that never happened."

619
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,120
I hate those phrases the most.

620

as fate or the inevitable,

but Ms. Park's son...

644
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,261
blamed the hospital and staff quite a lot.

a mistaken prescription.

646
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,300

"A mistaken prescription?"

648

- Yes.
- Do you mean...

649
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:28,681
instead of what should've been prescribed,

650
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:31,210
the patient was given something else?

651
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:33,721
Are you saying I'm wrong?

00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,296
(The mill murder, CCTV)

721
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:40,637
(Lee Myung Guk, Audiophile,
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical)

722
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:43,077
(Me, Park Jun Seo,
1882, Lemon Mulberry tip-off)

723
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:52,546
Captain.

724
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,347
Yes?

725
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:07,626
Won't they hear what we say in here?

726
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,097
It's fine.

727
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,836
I did some research.

728
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,506
Taking the drug messes with your appetite.

729
00:41:16,206 --> 00:41:18,977
I don't remember seeing you eat at all.

730
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,776
I didn't feel like eating alone,

731
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:23,276
so I tried something new.

732
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:25,416
Eat up.

733
00:41:26,247 --> 00:41:27,287
Jun Seo.

734
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,416
It wasn't suicide.

735
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,657
What? Why? You found something?

736
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,526
There was a murder yesterday...

737
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,856
at a mill next to the site
Jun Seo died at.

738
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:39,796
A murder?

739
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:45,066
Yet again, I was at the scene.

740
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:48,967
The Molotov cocktail that flew into
Lee Myung Guk's home.

741
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,577
Yesterday's murder that happened
because of the CCTV footage.

742
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:53,977
All that happened...

743
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:57,077
the moment I tried to reach something.

744
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,546
Are you saying
someone's intentionally sabotaging...

745
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,356
your investigation into Jun Seo's death?

746
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:10,456
Just like how someone
tried to prevent the autopsy?

747
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:11,796
And...

748
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:15,727
the case is a murder case
as well as a drug case.

749
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,137
The 1882 here.

750
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,506
It's an SOS code only Jun Seo
and I knew in high school.

751
00:42:24,506 --> 00:42:26,037
(010-0325-1533,
1:35 a.m., Saturday, February 24)

752
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:30,977
(010-0325-1533, Woonjong Medical Center's
medication error on Park Bok Rye)

753
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:35,517
The text was a tip-off
of a Lemon Mulberry delivery.

754
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,117
And as you know, I'm now an addict.

755
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:42,427
I still get deliveries at home
in Jun Seo's name.

756
00:42:44,827 --> 00:42:46,566
- So you mean...
- I mean...

757
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,767
Jun Seo and Lee Myung Guk's death,

758
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:52,137
yesterday's murder,
Jun Seo's insurance money that you want,

759
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,037
the details in this text,
and my addiction.

760
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:56,606
They're all one big case.

761
00:42:57,736 --> 00:42:59,776
The reason you are doing stuff
you normally wouldn't do to be here...

762
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,177
You're here to find out what's going on.

763
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:05,276
You shouldn't get involved in this case
just because of the insurance money.

764
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,787
They'll see you as a target
if you keep going around with me.

765
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,586
That's why you need to back out now.

766
00:43:35,006 --> 00:43:36,046
(Deceased September 11, 2023,
Park Bok Rye drug administration accident)

767
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:38,247
(February 26, 7:30 a.m., Train 6203,
Door 3-4, Jeonghoon Station, From Doctor)

768
00:43:38,546 --> 00:43:40,217
You're not the only one
who has gotten those texts.

769
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,686
It's already too late for me
to get off of this train too.

770
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,887
Fine.

771
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:48,086
As you said, I brought this boxed meal...

772
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:51,427
I admit that 51 percent of my intention
was to get information out of you.

773
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,097
But still,

774
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:56,967
49 percent of my intention was to see
if you were doing okay.

775
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:04,477
I mean, what if you collapse again
after a seizure like last time?

776
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,477
You can't even go to the hospital.
Who will save you then?

777
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,847
I'm grateful you're worried about me,

778
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:13,787
but let me say something that others
often say in situations like this.

779
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,686
Take care of your own self.

780
00:44:24,356 --> 00:44:25,356
Eat.

781
00:44:26,427 --> 00:44:27,427
Eat up and find your strength...

782
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:29,227
so we can talk about
what to do from now on.

783
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:32,936
Have you checked what it says
in this text message?

784
00:44:33,336 --> 00:44:34,336
Yes.

785
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:35,767
I have.

786
00:44:36,336 --> 00:44:37,876
The victim refuses to say anything.

787
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,106
The hospital director is acting
like he knows nothing.

788
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,947
But I'm sure there's something there.

789
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:43,247
I'm going to keep digging into this.

790
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:46,847
By the way,

791
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:50,517
I get that Park Jun Seo mentioned...

792
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:52,887
you, me, and Lee Myung Guk's names...

793
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:55,327
in his will so that we'd reveal the truth
about his death.

794
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,126
But seriously, what's up with the drugs?

795
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,767
Why would Park Jun Seo have
anything to do with drugs?

796
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:06,137
If what you say is true,
it means Jun Seo was dealing drugs.

797
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:16,477
And you...

798
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,287
Why did you go back
to the police station last time?

799
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:25,157
The day
Lee Myung Guk's house caught on fire.

800
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:28,327
You were practically dying,
but you came back here.

801
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:33,967
There was
a Lemon Mulberry pill here, right?

802
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:36,936
You came back here to take that pill,
didn't you?

803
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:42,936
Yes.

804
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,577
Did you take it?

805
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:53,787
Jae Gyeong.

806
00:45:54,686 --> 00:45:55,986
There was no other way.

807
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,456
I just couldn't stop...

808
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:04,557
then and there.

809
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:07,827
What will you do
if that situation happens again?

810
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:09,896
Will you take it again?

811
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:12,597
Yes.

812
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,677
(Heo Joo Song)

813
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,146
What?

814
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,177
I just called you for the first time.

815
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:29,756
Speak.

816
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:32,816
About that company that Jun Seo founded...

817
00:46:32,816 --> 00:46:34,157
Audiophile, Incorporated.

818
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:35,887
I found the address for that company.

819
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:38,697
But how should I say this?
It seems rather odd.

820
00:46:39,126 --> 00:46:40,796
I was going to tell Jae Gyeong about this,

821
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:42,497
but I wanted to ask you about it first.

822
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:46,066
You don't like opening up
all the information to Jae Gyeong.

823
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:49,436
What should we do?
Should we just check it out ourselves?

824
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,177
Let's hang up for now.

825
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,612
I was suddenly curious
about the address...

826
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,652
of the company that Jun Seo had founded.

827
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:00,353
But why is it Pilo-dong all of a sudden?

828
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:02,323
It's not close to Jun Seo's house.

829
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,522
I know.

830
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,393
Hey, what did Jun Seo say
when he came to see you?

831
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,663
You didn't tell me
when I asked you at the funeral.

832
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:11,803
What happened 20 years ago,

833
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:13,473
and things that have changed since then...

834
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:18,002
He said he would put
everything back in order.

835
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,303
By 20 years ago,

836
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:20,772
did he mean Chae Kyung Tae?

837
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,882
Goodness, Jun Seo must've had that
on his mind all these years.

838
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:29,312
I guess he still felt bad that you were
forced to transfer schools...

839
00:47:29,312 --> 00:47:30,823
because of that incident, right?

840
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,533
(We welcome the development of Pilo-dong.)

841
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:49,232
(Congratulations on the redevelopment,
and we wish you success.)

842
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,243
(Pilo-dong's architectural designs passed!
Public redevelopment confirmed!)

843
00:47:59,513 --> 00:48:02,853
(Cancel the redevelopment that
the residents did not approve of!)

844
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:07,223
(Who is this redevelopment for?
Cancel authorization for the project!)

845
00:48:17,902 --> 00:48:20,232
Hey, found it.

846
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:23,073
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

847
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:24,573
Hey.

848
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,042
Is it okay...

849
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,612
for a company to have its address
listed in a place like this?

850
00:48:30,112 --> 00:48:31,112
Is anyone here?

851
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,083
Is anyone here?

852
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:42,292
Excuse me.

853
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:54,933
Gosh, that's hot!

854
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:04,913
Who are you?

855
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,853
We're not bad people.

856
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:09,522
- Do you perhaps...
- So, who are you?

857
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:10,522
Park Jun Seo.

858
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,583
You know Park Jun Seo, don't you?

859
00:49:14,553 --> 00:49:15,553
No.

860
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:17,323
He's dead.

861
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:21,632
How do you know each other?

862
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,272
When?

863
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
A few days ago.

864
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:29,373
Are you alone?
Are there any adults around?

865
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:30,942
What's your name?

866
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:38,283
Jang Jae Gyeong.

867
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:40,853
How do you know that?

868
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:42,053
Oh Yoon Jin.

869
00:49:42,553 --> 00:49:43,553
Oh, my.

870
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:48,692
Come with me.

871
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,672
(Min Hyun Woo)

872
00:50:15,152 --> 00:50:16,623
What's your name, buddy?

873
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:18,522
Min Hyun Woo.

874
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:20,252
Right?

875
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:23,993
By the way, how do you know our names?

876
00:50:25,993 --> 00:50:27,092
He said you'd come.

877
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:28,433
When?

878
00:50:29,433 --> 00:50:30,433
Last time.

879
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:32,232
Last time, when? How many days ago?

880
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:33,502
About...

881
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:35,203
ten days ago?

882
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,603
If a guy shows up, it's Jang Jae Gyeong.

883
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:39,203
If a woman shows up, it's Oh Yoon Jin.

884
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,212
I'm Heo Joo Song. Nice to meet you.

885
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:47,453
You're a cop.

886
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,823
And you're a reporter.

887
00:50:51,283 --> 00:50:52,453
You still haven't told us.

888
00:50:53,493 --> 00:50:54,493
How do you know each other?

889
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:57,022
We just met in passing.

890
00:50:58,393 --> 00:50:59,732
Didn't he tell you anything else?

891
00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:05,402
Are you here alone?

892
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:07,132
My grandma is inside.

893
00:51:09,703 --> 00:51:10,703
What?

894
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:12,373
Grandma.

895
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,573
Hello.

896
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:15,672
There was a motorcycle outside.

897
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:17,513
- Do you do deliveries?
- Yes.

898
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:19,812
- What do you deliver?
- Just anything.

899
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:21,553
Do you deliver drugs too?

900
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,953
What?

901
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:24,652
No.

902
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:28,223
They just look like regular pills.
Yellow ones.

903
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:29,553
Haven't you ever delivered those before?

904
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:30,893
I said I haven't.

905
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,192
Have you heard of someone
called Lee Myung Guk?

906
00:51:36,062 --> 00:51:37,062
No.

907
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:42,132
Oh, I see.

908
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:44,603
Then, you must've had a huge pig farm.

909
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:46,103
Of course.

910
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,942
This whole area used to be a pig farm.

911
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:51,112
You see that commercial building
down there, right?

912
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:52,112
Yes.

913
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:55,453
That whole spot used to be a pig farm.

914
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,583
Our pig farm.

915
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,053
You must've made some money
for land compensation.

916
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:01,652
Hyun Woo's dad...

917
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:03,893
sold it too early.

918
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:06,163
He was tricked.

919
00:52:06,163 --> 00:52:07,163
Why?

920
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:10,062
We had no idea they were building
a new town.

921
00:52:10,062 --> 00:52:11,062
Goodness.

922
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:17,373
These are newly harvested chestnuts,
aren't they?

923
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:18,442
They're tasty.

924
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,413
They're not newly harvested.

925
00:52:23,842 --> 00:52:25,442
By the way, you could live somewhere else.

926
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,083
Why did you come somewhere
with so many hills? It must be hard.

927
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,612
Where else would we go?

928
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,252
This is where we used to live.

929
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,692
After being pushed out to live here,

930
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,223
I used to farm produce to sell them.

931
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,263
I'm too old now.

932
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:44,002
I noticed the name Min Seung Wook
on your gate.

933
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,163
Is that your husband's name?

934
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,333
No, my son's.

935
00:52:49,942 --> 00:52:51,342
Is he out?

936
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:56,542
I don't know why he rushed to leave.

937
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,652
That's enough. It's too tiring.

938
00:53:01,652 --> 00:53:03,252
- I'm okay.
- You should stop.

939
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:04,853
I'm having fun. I enjoy it.

940
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:06,953
Gosh.

941
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,192
Are those chestnuts?

942
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:15,132
Anyway,
Mr. Park hasn't been here in a while.

943
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:18,862
His friends are just as handsome.

944
00:53:19,632 --> 00:53:21,933
- Am I handsome?
- Gosh.

945
00:53:23,172 --> 00:53:24,303
Mr. Park...

946
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:26,842
is a good man.

947
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:29,573
He always helps us when we're in need.

948
00:53:30,243 --> 00:53:32,013
He's good to Hyun Woo too.

949
00:53:32,783 --> 00:53:33,783
Gosh.

950
00:53:34,183 --> 00:53:35,712
Why didn't he come with you?

951
00:53:37,522 --> 00:53:39,022
- Well...
- Well...

952
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:41,522
- He passed away.
- What?

953
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:45,292
I'm a detective.

954
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:49,393
This is the address of his company
he left behind.

955
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:51,333
I came to confirm it.

956
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:55,772
Wait. Hold on...

957
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:00,413
What is he talking about?

958
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:02,172
Let's go.

959
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:05,482
- What is he talking about?
- I'll visit again.

960
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,853
What?

961
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:09,712
Hold on a minute.

962
00:54:11,283 --> 00:54:12,353
- Jae Gyeong.
- Hey!

963
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:13,993
Hey!

964
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:18,092
Did you have to say that now?

965
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,292
She can find out about it later.

966
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:23,562
Are you rubbing it in or something?

967
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:25,263
Does it make you happy
to tell her that way?

968
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,033
Then when should I tell her?

969
00:54:27,103 --> 00:54:28,632
She can hear it from him,

970
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,073
or it might come up later
and she hears about it.

971
00:54:31,243 --> 00:54:33,143
You should look at the situation
and do it when she's ready.

972
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:34,873
No problem in this world waits
for the right time...

973
00:54:34,873 --> 00:54:36,272
or for people to be ready.

974
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:38,612
I'm here as a detective.

975
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:41,053
Also, she's not Jun Seo's family.

976
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:43,053
I don't have the time right now.

977
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,882
I can't waste time
without gaining anything...

978
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,692
after coming up all the way here.

979
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:48,292
Fine.

980
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:52,192
You're right.
Nothing waits for the right time...

981
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:53,592
or for people to be ready.

982
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:55,933
I work in insurance.
I know that better than you.

983
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:59,732
But how are you always so busy?
You always have to have it your way,

984
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:01,203
and you don't consider everyone else.

985
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,103
Sorry to bring this up,
but you did this when Chae Kyung Tae died.

986
00:55:04,303 --> 00:55:06,303
You did the same thing to Jun Seo.

987
00:55:06,643 --> 00:55:08,413
It's not easy to betray a close friend.

988
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,982
Why were you so inconsiderate
of Jun Seo's situation?

989
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:13,882
If you had given him some time,

990
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:17,623
we would have never parted,
and you wouldn't have transferred schools.

991
00:55:29,862 --> 00:55:31,263
Park Jun Seo, that fool.

992
00:55:32,103 --> 00:55:34,033
What is he trying to put back in order?

993
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,232
It's meaningless.

994
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:53,522
Hey.

995
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,092
Call me if anything happens.

996
00:55:57,462 --> 00:55:59,562
Do you have a motorcycle insurance?

997
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:02,433
- No.
- Make sure you get one.

998
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,533
Always wear a helmet,
and don't skip school.

999
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:10,672
I'll kill you
if you make your grandma worry.

1000
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,823
Anyway, tell them to sell it
while I'm offering a proper price.

1001
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:34,132
If things don't go his way,
my husband will low-ball the land price.

1002
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:35,663
All right.

1003
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:38,803
You should give me one more.

1004
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,203
- I'll get going.
- Bye.

1005
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:00,993
It has been long
since the three of us got together.

1006
00:57:01,623 --> 00:57:04,163
- How about some drinks?
- Drop me off over there.

1007
00:57:10,132 --> 00:57:11,462
Bye. I'll call you.

1008
00:57:13,803 --> 00:57:15,303
- Gosh.
- What?

1009
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:18,272
Hey. I know you were mad,

1010
00:57:18,573 --> 00:57:19,873
but why did you bring up Jun Seo?

1011
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:21,342
Don't you know it pushes his buttons...

1012
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:22,743
when we bring up Chae Kyung Tae
from 20 years ago?

1013
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:25,342
He's so inconsiderate,
and he always does things his way.

1014
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,053
How much longer do we have to stand it?

1015
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:28,413
Even so.

1016
00:57:29,152 --> 00:57:30,823
On top of that, he's not well.

1017
00:57:31,183 --> 00:57:33,123
What's wrong with him?

1018
00:57:33,123 --> 00:57:34,123
He looks fine to me.

1019
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,353
I'm the one who's aching everywhere.

1020
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:38,422
Hey.

1021
00:57:38,962 --> 00:57:40,732
Drop me off at the nearest subway station.

1022
00:57:42,232 --> 00:57:43,803
I thought you wanted to have dinner.

1023
00:57:43,902 --> 00:57:45,203
I meant the three of us together.

1024
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,172
I was suggesting we eat together.

1025
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,002
Why would I have dinner with you?

1026
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:09,922
What?

1027
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:14,493
What?

1028
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,803
(Oeseong Station)

1029
00:58:21,172 --> 00:58:22,772
Jang Jae Gyeong showed up
at CW's place.

1030
00:58:24,803 --> 00:58:25,942
Jang Jae Gyeong?

1031
00:58:28,473 --> 00:58:29,672
What is "CW?"

1032
00:58:45,962 --> 00:58:46,962
What?

1033
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:48,993
It was a long time ago,

1034
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,962
but some guy came...

1035
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:53,473
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

1036
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:55,732
He asked if he could get a copy.

1037
00:58:56,172 --> 00:58:57,842
So, I told him to go ahead.

1038
00:58:58,143 --> 00:58:59,143
Here.

1039
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:01,973
Is that man in this photo?

1040
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:03,013
Hang on.

1041
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,112
It was this guy.

1042
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:07,652
Oh, right.

1043
00:59:07,652 --> 00:59:10,252
This was the man who got out of
the taxi in the CCTV footage too, right?

1044
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:12,982
I knew I had seen him somewhere before.

1045
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:15,623
It was this man.
The man who got a copy of the video.

1046
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:26,263
Hello.

1047
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:28,803
What brings you here?

1048
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,103
If it's okay, may I come in?

1049
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,672
I need to look for something
as a part of the investigation.

1050
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:39,342
Come in.

1051
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:41,612
Please excuse me.

1052
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,623
Thank you.

1053
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:52,092
- Would you like some tea?
- No, I'm okay.

1054
00:59:57,703 --> 01:00:00,132
Is there a computer, a laptop,

1055
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:01,873
or a flash drive he used to use?

1056
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:05,743
There is a laptop
and a couple of flash drives.

1057
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:07,373
Please wait a moment.

1058
01:01:06,203 --> 01:01:08,833
(Park Jun Seo)

1059
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,792
- Good job.
- Look over here.

1060
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:32,663
- Mom.
- Mom.

1061
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:33,833
Mom!

1062
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:39,632
Hi, Mom.

1063
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,333
There are so many, right?

1064
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:46,873
Yes, these are scissors.

1065
01:01:47,112 --> 01:01:48,342
Yoon Hee, say hi to Mom.

1066
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,812
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Mom.

1067
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:53,083
Give me a kiss.

1068
01:01:54,183 --> 01:01:55,212
Yes!

1069
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:01,393
You're eating so well.

1070
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:03,453
What are you looking for?

1071
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:05,893
It's nothing special.

1072
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,192
It looks like you're searching
for a video.

1073
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:09,962
It won't take long.

1074
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,042
Yoon Jin, over here.

1075
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:34,993
- Is he still in there?
- Yes.

1076
01:02:37,562 --> 01:02:38,562
By the way,

1077
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:40,062
what is "CW?"

1078
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,433
"C" is for cheating...

1079
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:44,263
because she is a cheating...

1080
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:46,333
- Woman?
- Yes.

1081
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,433
- Nice nickname.
- Thanks.

1082
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,002
I wonder why he came here at this hour.

1083
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,073
I'm not sure.

1084
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,112
Thank you for your time.

1085
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,353
I guess you couldn't find
what you were looking for.

1086
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,623
No, it was helpful.

1087
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:08,223
- Bye.
- Bye.

1088
01:03:40,823 --> 01:03:43,422
(Connection)

1089
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:48,163
Chae Kyung Tae, that punk.

1090
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:51,263
His funeral...

1091
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:53,502
is tomorrow.

1092
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,632
If you want to attend it,

1093
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,772
let the class president know.

1094
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:03,312
Class president, put together
a list of names and bring it to me.

1095
01:04:05,143 --> 01:04:06,143
Class president.

1096
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:10,422
Park Jun Seo!

1097
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:11,953
Yes.

1098
01:04:12,422 --> 01:04:15,393
Gosh. You punk...

1099
01:04:18,123 --> 01:04:19,922
(No Gyu Min)

1100
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:23,493
I know it's true. You went
to Kyung Tae's that day!

1101
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:24,902
I told you I didn't!

1102
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:27,533
Jun Seo, we're friends.

1103
01:04:27,533 --> 01:04:29,203
Why are you hiding it from me?

1104
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:31,643
You can't focus in class.

1105
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,913
Whenever Yoon Jin and I talk to you,
you're out of it and talk in gibberish.

1106
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,413
Kyung Tae's place caught on fire...

1107
01:04:40,482 --> 01:04:42,783
and he died,
but it wasn't an accident, was it?

1108
01:04:44,152 --> 01:04:45,152
What happened?

1109
01:04:45,323 --> 01:04:46,453
Who was there? What did you see?

1110
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:47,453
I don't know!

1111
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,092
I told you, no.

1112
01:04:50,922 --> 01:04:52,022
What do you know?

1113
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,062
Park Jun Seo!

1114
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,962
(No Gyu Min)

1115
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:06,303
(Won Jong Soo)

1116
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:44,312
(Connection)

1117
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:46,342
Did Jang Jae Gyeong not catch on?

1118
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,453
Darn it.

1119
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:50,353
I don't want to be an adulterer
who fools around with married men.

1120
01:05:50,353 --> 01:05:51,353
Let's get a divorce.

1121
01:05:51,353 --> 01:05:53,482
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

1122
01:05:53,723 --> 01:05:55,993
Are you telling me
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

1123
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:57,592
Won Jong Soo,
show us what you've got.

1124
01:05:57,592 --> 01:05:58,592
Jang Jae Gyeong?

1125
01:05:58,592 --> 01:06:00,962
That punk hasn't returned his gun.

1126
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:01,962
What are you doing?

1127
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,493
I said, what are you doing?

1128
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,333
I know you don't dare touch
the people you should sue.

1129
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,172
Who are you threatening to sue?

1130
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:09,373
You said you haven't had the drug
in a week.

1131
01:06:09,373 --> 01:06:10,502
How did you hold out?

1132
01:06:10,502 --> 01:06:12,303
If you relax your throat for a second,

1133
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:13,643
you get a surge of air.

1134
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:15,573
We'll call CEO Won Jong Soo up.

1135
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:16,612
Vice-Chairman!

1136
01:06:16,612 --> 01:06:18,212
Jong Soo, wake up. Jong Soo!

1137
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:19,942
I told you, don't let anyone in!

1138
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:22,683
You know a needle works faster, don't you?

1139
01:06:22,683 --> 01:06:24,252
Are they sticking a needle
in Captain Jang's arm?

1140
01:06:24,252 --> 01:06:25,882
We don't know if it's a drug
or a saline solution.

1141
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,263
