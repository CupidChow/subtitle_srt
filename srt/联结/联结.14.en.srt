3
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,548
- Let's talk for a minute.
- Unit Chief.

4
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:08,368
- Ma'am, if you act like this...
- Outside.

5
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:09,993
Where do you think you're going?

6
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:12,188
Didn't you hear that we're gathering
in ten minutes?

7
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,328
I heard.

8
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:15,817
I have something to talk to him about
before then.

9
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:17,133
Outside.

10
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:19,144
Unit Chief Jeong,
what do you think you're doing?

11
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:20,168
You barge in...

12
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:24,428
You're several years my junior.
How dare you speak casually to me?

13
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,608
We won't run away. Don't worry.

14
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:28,753
Still, this isn't right!

15
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,054
He's a suspect!

16
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,278
Who are you calling a suspect?

17
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:34,277
Did you collect his hair with his consent?

18
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:37,748
Who knows if that was
Jang Jae Gyeong's hair or yours?

19
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:39,417
What you did was illegal.

20
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:41,587
Outside.

21
00:01:44,457 --> 00:01:45,688
My gosh!

22
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,097
Are you a thug?

23
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:51,858
Unit Chief.

24
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:53,498
Unit Chief.

25
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,338
Since when?

26
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,067
The 23rd of last month or...

27
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,207
The 23rd?

28
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,254
That was the day you bought us beef
for your promotion.

29
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:06,284
Yes.

30
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,323
Did something happen
after the team dinner that night?

31
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,877
I went to the restroom afterward,

32
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:11,737
and someone jumped me from behind.

33
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,287
I lost my memory after that,

34
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:18,058
but when I opened my eyes,

35
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,688
I was inside Anhyun City Hall Station.

36
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,498
Then, you didn't take them yourself.

37
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,367
There were times when I did.

38
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,737
Jang Jae Gyeong. Listen carefully.

39
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,207
The Chief of Police wants to
interrogate you himself.

40
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:35,028
Anyway, the process of
how you got addicted wasn't your own will.

41
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,207
It doesn't matter that you took
the pills later on.

42
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,918
- Unit Chief.
- Who else knows about this?

43
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,248
Chang Soo knows.

44
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:43,978
That's why they called Chang Soo.

45
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:47,987
Chang Soo had been bought out
by CEO Yoon.

46
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:50,888
He admitted it himself.

47
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:01,897
Jang Jae Gyeong.

48
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,467
From now on,
you were first exposed to drugs...

49
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:07,767
at Anhyun Shopping Mall.

50
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,413
You were so busy focusing
on the investigation...

51
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:11,653
that you didn't have the time
to take care of your own health.

52
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,077
A positive result on the hair test?

53
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:17,478
That can't explain
when you first got hooked on drugs.

54
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,587
- No, ma'am, that's not...
- Be quiet.

55
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:20,894
You got into this mess...

56
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,678
because you didn't listen
to your unit chief.

57
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,294
I don't even have that many on my unit,

58
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,027
but one is in custody for murder...

59
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:28,698
and another one is in custody
for a drug offense.

Jun Seo...

75
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,454
wanted to get revenge on Won Jong Soo,
Park Tae Jin, and those jerks.

76

getting revenge for Jun Seo.

Can't you do that much for him?

Hey, Sang Eui.

81

You don't have the right to utter
the word, "friend."

83

That's not friendship.

84
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,768
It's obsession.

Jun Seo...

86
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,108
wanted to get revenge on
Won Jong Soo and Park Tae Jin?

Don't make me laugh.

88
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:33,918
You're the one who wants to get revenge.

89
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:38,458
You just wanted to believe
that Jun Seo would've wanted that.

90
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,803
That's not true, so shut it.

91

You shut it!

92
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,627
You fed drugs to a friend
and controlled him.

93
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:48,458
What right do you have to talk about
friends and friendship?

94
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:51,137
You know,

95
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,584
I always hated people...

96
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:55,437
who couldn't say a word upfront...

97
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:58,337
but tried to mess people up
behind their backs like you.

98
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:04,848

People with money and power...

102
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:13,728
can do anything and get away with it.

103
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,204
Then there are parasites
who sponge off them...

the crumbs off the floor.

00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:39,708
Why did you do it?

145
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,108
How did you end up working
with CEO Yoon?

146
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,377
Is that important?

147
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:49,793
One word from me,
and your career will go down the drain.

148
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:52,324
Enough fooling around and tell me.
Why did you do it?

149
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,648
You know what druggies are like.

150
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,858
They buy drugs because they love it.

151
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,887
There's no point running around
to catch such people.

152
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,458
No matter how many we catch,
there will be more.

153
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:04,898
So?

154
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:06,867
I thought...

155
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,244
it would be better
to have someone like CEO Yoon...

156
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:12,708
to help manage the existing druggies
to stop it from spreading.

157
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:16,807
Is that why there's an overflow
of Lemon Mulberry on the market...

158
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,648
and people are dying
from withdrawal symptoms?

159
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:21,624
Do you call this good management?

160
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,817
How much longer?

161
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,148
How much longer
should we do the same thing?

162
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,793
Do you think there's an end to this work?

163
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,817
No.

164
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,628
Didn't you know
that was the nature of our job?

165
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:37,104

because there will be more tomorrow,

166
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:38,158
what will happen?

167
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:39,868
It's tough.

168
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,668
It's tiring and boring.
There's no end to it.

169
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,067
However,

170
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:47,307
that's our job.

171
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:51,937
You passed information for money.

172
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:56,418
You betrayed your colleague...

173
00:09:58,817 --> 00:09:59,888
and killed someone.

174
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,988
Don't you dare call that an excuse...

175
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,357
ever again.

176
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:15,028
Because it embarrasses me to know...

177
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,197
you once worked under me.

178
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,307
Shouldn't you be pleading?

179
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,413
You should be pleading with me
to put in a good word for you!

180
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:27,577
(Interrogation Room)

181
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:43,658
Go ahead.

182
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:45,498
Chairman.

183
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:51,398
Sit down.

184
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:07,988
An arrest warrant will be issued
for Jong Soo.

185
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,258
There's no concern about him escaping,

186
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,994
but there's a concern
about him destroying evidence.

187
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,388
He produced and used drugs,

188
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,658
so he'll likely be arrested.

189
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,827
However,
he doesn't have any criminal records.

190
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:23,837
Also, the fact he only used it by himself
will be taken into account.

191
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,538
I presume he won't be sentenced.

192
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,508
"By himself?"

193
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,737
What about the second son
of Yigu Group's Chairman Han?

194
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,148
Yigu Group will remain untouched.

195
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,364
What will you do about the drug you sold?

196
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,068
Someone has to take responsibility for it.

197
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:44,817
There's a guy named Jeong Sang Eui.

198
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:47,467
He's a researcher
at Keumhyung Pharmaceutical...

199
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,057
who actually makes the drug.

200
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,258
We'll conclude...

201
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,197
that he did it out of selfish greed.

202
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,467
Now,

203
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:01,807
tell me what you want.

204
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,677
I want to be in complete charge...

205
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:06,783
of the upcoming
bioindustrial complex development...

206
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,177
as well as the Pilo-dong Development Plan.

207
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:12,717
Also, please give me...

208
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,757
six percent of Keumhyung's share
of the Pilo-dong development.

209
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:19,357
All right.

210
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,158
Now,

211
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:26,628
will you quit being a prosecutor?

212
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:27,868
Yes.

213
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:29,898
I plan to resign...

214
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,297
right after wrapping up Jong Soo's case.

215
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,567
Was this your plan all along?

216
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:40,707
I'm not sure.

217
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,118
Well,

218
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,317
I had planned for something easier.

219
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:51,388
No matter what it was,

220
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:54,488
you won.

221
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:03,798
Jang Jae Gyeong.

222
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:05,437
Yes?

223
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,268
Your answers can only be yes or no.

224
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:11,107
Your drug test came out positive.

225
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:12,977
Do you admit to this?

226
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:14,347
Yes.

227
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:17,878
What about you?

228
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:20,964
How did you find out he was on drugs?

229
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:22,734
I found out
while interrogating Kim Dae Sung...

230
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:23,857
who was under arrest.

231
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,087
What did he say?

232
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:28,057
That he was on-site when Captain Jang
was administered the drug.

233
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,747
He said the amount was too much
for anyone to handle...

234
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:33,427
unless Captain Jang was already
a drug user.

235
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:36,443
We proceeded with a hair test,
and the result was positive.

236
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,467
Are you sure...

237
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:39,908
that hair is Captain Jang's?

238
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,984
- Yes.
- Where did you get it?

239
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:44,984
- Why are you...
- Don't ask where he got it...

240
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,477
or say that they didn't get his approval.
Take those questions to court.

241
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,817
- Kim Chang Soo.
- Yes.

242
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,817
You worked alongside Captain Jang, right?

243
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,094
Did you know he was using drugs?

244
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,764
- Sir!
- Be quiet.

245
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,333
He was first exposed to the drug
while arresting Lee Geun Ho...

246
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:03,073
and Kim Dae Sung.

247
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,203
Be quiet.

248
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:06,504
If anything, he should be given an award.

249
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,073
Is this what he gets
for not sparing himself at work?

250
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,097
Unit Chief Jeong!

251
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:11,898
I knew about it.

252
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:15,768
How?

253
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,778
Because I drugged him.

254
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:27,988
What?

255
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,357
Kim Chang Soo.

256
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,658
Tell them the truth.

257
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:34,727
You have my phone, don't you?

258
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:36,498
Where is his phone?

259
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:38,073
We've been holding it
after confiscating it.

260
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,097
Go get it.

261
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:43,538
What are you trying to do?

262
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:17,738
Captain.

263
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,337
Captain.

264
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,937
Can you prove that that is Lemon Mulberry?

265
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,607
That's my desk.

266
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,798
There was one Lemon Mulberry pill
in my desk drawer at the time,

267
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:01,248
but it went missing.

268
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:05,618
And before that?

269
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:09,817
From that situation,
Captain Jang already looks addicted.

270
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:14,687
Yes, I had already gotten him addicted.

271
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:16,258
For what reason?

272
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:18,303
He suspected my relationship
with CEO Yoon...

273
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:19,668
and was closing in on me.

274
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,898
So, I had CEO Yoon
get him hooked on drugs.

275
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:28,238
Kim Chang Soo.

276
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:30,577
Look at me.

277
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,177
Look at me.

278
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,048
You didn't do that.

279
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,717
You saw me feeding you that pill.

280
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,087
Why would I lie in my current situation?

281
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:46,288
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong isn't guilty
of anything.

282
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,687
As he has done so far,

283
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,634
all he did was work hard
without playing it safe.

284
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,197
Kim Chang Soo, that's not true.

285
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,703
Look at me!

286
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,498
- Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong!
- No!

287
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,197
Why?

288
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:58,197
That's enough!

289
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,538
Everyone except Captain Jang,

290
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,548
get out.

291
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,748
Chief, this isn't right! This is...

292
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:13,488
Hey, Kim Chang Soo!

293
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:16,634
No, you can't fall for this, Chief!

294
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,018
Be quiet.

295
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,673
Oh Yoon Jin!

296
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:26,597
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

297
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,128
Get in here.

298
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:31,067
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

299
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,367
You've bet your life on this.

300
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,477
If this goes to print,
you'll have to watch your back.

301
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:43,524
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,548
We'll have to split this up
over a few days, right?

303
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,888
Are you sure about this?

304
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:51,857
It took me a while to find
the courage in my guts.

305
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,128
You can pull this off, right?

306
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,057
Yes, sir.

307
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,897
Whatever. This paper doesn't
even sell that well anyway.

308
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:03,798
Let's make a little more noise.

309
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:11,008
Oh, hey.

310
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,048
What did the chief say?

311
00:18:13,377 --> 00:18:15,484
He said this was an accidental addiction
while I was on the job...

312
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,068
and that I should get treated and rest.

313
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,218
You said you'd do that, right?

314
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,988
I asked him for some more time.

315
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,417
- Hey.
- Just give me three more days.

316
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:27,947
I'll take care of things by then.

317
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,857
I'm sorry in many ways.

318
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,458
Forget it.

319
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:34,627
Captain.

320
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,527
Here's the composite sketch
of Jeong Yoon Ho's murderer.

321
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,637
(Wanted, suspect on the run)

322
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,117
Did you come to mock me?

323
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:01,988
Did you come to see
how far I've fallen?

324
00:19:02,827 --> 00:19:03,827
Hey.

325
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,868
I'm going to get out of here
within a few days.

326
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:08,367
When I get out,
I'm going to kill you first, you jerk!

327
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,987
I'm going to rip you to shreds
from now on, so beware.

328
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,538
- Got it?
- How unexpected of you.

329
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,807
- What?
- I thought...

330
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:18,907
you'd resent your father more than me.

331
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,508
Shut your mouth.

332
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,347
He abandoned you and chose the company,

333
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,238
but he's still your father. Is that it?

334
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:27,788
Let him go.

335
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,428
You gave orders to kill Yoon Ho.

336
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,097
Inciting a murder.

337
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,067
I plan on keeping that quiet.

338
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,867
I don't want you to be here...

339
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:47,768
for a long time either.

340
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,358
Calm down, and have a seat first.

341
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:02,488
This is your first offense,
but you will get jail time.

342
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:04,188
But...

343
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:07,258
I'll get you out as soon as possible.

344
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,698
By the time you get out,

345
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:12,798
the bioindustrial complex construction
will be on its way.

346
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,428
Jong Soo.

347
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:17,298
You should take charge of it
starting then.

348
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,768
Not your father, Chairman Won Chang Ho.

349
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:22,888
You punk, are you trying to drive a wedge
between me and my father again?

350
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,748
Hey, do you really love your father?

351
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,577
You still need your father's protection,

352
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,694
which is why you came in here
so obediently.

353
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:35,817
The same goes for me.

354
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,837
Chairman Won Chang Ho's protection...

355
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,863
Well, it's still pretty useful,
so I'm still staying within that range.

356
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:42,087
If not for that,

357
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,234
do you think I didn't have enough
evidence or recordings...

358
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:46,303
to send your father to jail?

359
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,198
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- Won Jong Soo.

360
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:52,798
The bioindustrial complex,
the Pilo-dong development.

361
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:55,143
This has to be a success
that you and I brought about.

362
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,487
The moment it becomes
the success of Chairman Won Chang Ho,

363
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:01,948
you will live the rest of your life
under your father's shadow.

364
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:04,617
Can't you see?

365
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:08,887
Seriously, you...

366
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,497
sure have a way with words.

367
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,087
Why are you doing this to me now?

368
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,228
- You don't need me anymore.
- You said it yourself.

369
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,468
You're Won Chang Ho's son.

370
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:24,667
Yes, that's right.

371
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,038
Well, that's not something I can help.

372
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:33,708
Instead, I'm going to become
the richest man in Korea.

373
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:36,147
In order to do that,

374
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,077
I need a business partner like you.

375
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,518
There's no rush, Jong Soo.

376
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,188
They say all you have is time in here.

377
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,327
Think it over nice and slow.

378
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:51,758
What it is that you really want.

379
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:53,528
And...

380
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,238
who you truly need by your side
to achieve that.

381
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:08,948
How is Jong Soo?

382
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:10,817
He's doing fine.

383
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:14,218
It wouldn't be so bad for him to take
this chance to think things over.

384
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:20,157
Oh Chi Hyun.

385
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,028
Brighten up, will you?

386
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,687
I'm leaving the prosecution next month.

387
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:33,407
I'm going to focus solely on business
from now on.

388
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:35,438
To do so,

389
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:37,978
I need a friend like you by my side.

390
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:43,078
If this is because of what happened
at the hideout last time,

391
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:45,548
don't worry. I've forgotten all about it.

392
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,788
What will happen to Sang Eui?

393
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:52,337
He's on the wanted list for now.

394
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:54,397
We'll have to take care of him,

395
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,698
whether it's legally or personally.

396
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:00,198
Let's go.

397
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:06,268
(Incoming call)

398
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,778
- Yes?
- It's me, Sang Eui.

399
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,008
Jeong Sang Eui?

400
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:15,907
Where are you right now?

401
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,248
I'm in Korea.

402
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:21,417
I'm not wanted or anything like that,
am I?

403
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:25,218
You... Didn't I tell you to go
and stay somewhere abroad?

404
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,727
What are you doing,
staying in Korea until now?

405
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:29,607
So you have put me on the wanted list.

406
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,268
Then take me off of it. I'll leave now.

407
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:36,567
Hey, I clearly gave you a chance.

408
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:39,938
I won't let you go away for long.
So turn yourself in.

409
00:23:42,738 --> 00:23:43,738
Tae Jin.

410
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,077
Can I really turn myself in?

411
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,353
What?

412
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:49,417
You don't really think
that I don't have anything...

413
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:52,018
just because you got rid of my cell phone,
do you?

414
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,788
When we first started
the Lemon Mulberry business,

415
00:23:55,188 --> 00:23:56,994
you said some things
at the cafe in Hwansung...

416
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,258
where we met Jun Seo.

417
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,357
I listened to it again yesterday.
Will you be okay?

418
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:09,667
Do you think you can threaten me
with that much?

419
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,867
Well, I'm sure a guy like you
will get away with it in the end.

420
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:18,108
But still, wouldn't it take some time?
And it'll cause you some trouble.

421
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,018
So? What is it that you want?

422
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:26,417
Let's meet up first.

423
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:29,247
Let's meet up and sort out
everything that needs sorting out.

424
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:32,188
There's something I want from you too,
so let's talk face to face.

425
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:36,428
I'll give you back all the recordings
I have when we meet.

426
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:40,067
Tell me where and when.

427
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:41,528
You decide.

428
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,067
Somewhere we can't record sound
with no CCTV cameras.

429
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:54,147
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

430
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,108
You're reporter Oh Yoon Jin, right?

431
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:58,817
- Yes.
- I'm...

432
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:01,994
General Manager Kim Seo Jin.
I called you before.

433
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,258
I worked with CEO Park Jun Seo
at the real estate agency.

434
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:08,157
I'll be going now too.

435
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,357
Oh, yes. I remember.

436
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:14,067
We met at Jun Seo's cemetery once, right?

437
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,268
- Yes.
- But what brings you here?

438
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,407
This... I called Ji Yeon,

439
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,577
but she said she was at the hospital.
She gave me your number.

440
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:35,917
Hello?

441
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:38,817
- Hey, where are you?
- I'm a bit busy right now.

442
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:41,387
Hey, the construction site
where Jun Seo died...

443
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:44,357
I just found out why Jun Seo
asked everyone to meet him there.

444
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:45,704
What was the reason?

445
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,043
That construction site was...

446
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,373
where Chae Kyung Tae's house
used to be...

447
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:49,827
before the new town was built.

448
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:16,458
(Our deepest condolences)

449
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:27,307
Chi Hyun.

450
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,057
Tell Tae Jin...

451
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,158
that he has to figure out a way...

452
00:26:55,028 --> 00:26:56,998
for me and my kids to make ends meet.

453
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,567
Tell him I understand everything,

454
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:08,008
so he has to...

455
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:12,048
take care of us.

456
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:23,597
I will.

457
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:41,178
(Our deepest condolences)

458
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:55,827
Oh Chi Hyun.

459
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:59,198
You're under arrest
for the murder of Jeong Yoon Ho.

460
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:14,708
Si Jung.

461
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,458
- Tell him his rights and take him.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:03,728
What's the matter?

463
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,978
Did the withdrawal symptoms come back?

464
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,397
No, I'm fine.

465
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,004
What were you saying about the map?

466
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,028
Oh, right.

467
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:14,208
(Anhyun)

468
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,407
Look at this.

469
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,684
This is where Jun Seo died.
The construction site in Pilo-dong.

470
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:21,308
(Construction Site for Pilo Town Houses)

471
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:24,847
And this is...

472
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:27,827
exactly where Chae Kyung Tae's house was,
according to this old map.

473
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,194
(Chae Kyung Tae, Pilo-dong)

474
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:34,204
Right?

(Chae Kyung Tae, Pilo-dong)

476
00:29:41,897 --> 00:29:44,438
Jun Seo must've thought
that was where everything began.

477
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,208
That's why
he made everyone come to that spot.

478
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,038
You told me Jun Seo said this
the last time you saw him.

479
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,388
"It's late, but I'll make everything
go back to where it should be."

(No Caller ID)

481
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:00,688
Hello?

482
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:01,988
It's me, Sang Eui.

483
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:07,327
Hello, ma'am.

484
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:13,028
Mr. Gong Jin Wook.

485
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,468
You woke up.

486
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,698
I am Jeong Yeon Ju,
Chief of Anhyeon Police's Narcotics Unit.

487
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,807
Who arranged things for you to stow away?

488
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,208
Who was it?

489
00:30:24,577 --> 00:30:25,577
Tell me.

490
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,577
The Doctor.

491
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,617
The Doctor arranged it for me.

492
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:35,197
Have you seen the Doctor?
Do you know who he is?

493
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,288
Yes.

494
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:38,458
Who is he?

496
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:47,067
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

497
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:51,468
Then what about the gun?

498
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,768
Where is the gun?

499
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,008
The gun that killed CEO Yoon.

500
00:30:57,907 --> 00:30:58,907
The Doctor...

501
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:01,147
has it.

502
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:06,548
There you are.

503
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:13,688
Hand over your phone.

504
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:37,347
Oh, this space.

505
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:39,117
I've emptied it out.

506
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:41,248
I'm turning 40 soon.

507
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,577
Isn't it childish to hang out in a hideout
at this age?

508
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:45,857
Oh, and...

509
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,557
Look. You know what this is, right?

510
00:31:48,788 --> 00:31:50,627
It's an audio recording blocker.

511
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:53,298
You're always busy doing funny things
behind my back,

512
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:55,127
so I can't trust you.

513
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:57,637
Now,

514
00:31:58,498 --> 00:31:59,498
hand it over.

515
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:02,438
- What?
- The recording.

516
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:03,938
I know you have it.

517
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,907
- There's no such thing.
- What?

518
00:32:07,178 --> 00:32:09,377
If I'd had the evidence to take you down,

519
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:13,108
don't you think I would've handed it over
to Jang Jae Gyeong long ago?

520
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:16,188
Well...

521
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:18,288
Hey.

522
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,387
Are you kidding me right now?

523
00:32:21,087 --> 00:32:25,557
You haven't changed one bit.
Get it together!

524
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,268
You hear me?

525
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,698
Hey.

526
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,268
How dare you...

527
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:36,538
try to blackmail me? How dare you!

528
00:32:38,738 --> 00:32:40,623
Hey, I don't care what you have on me.

529
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:43,107
Never did. You moron.

530
00:32:43,448 --> 00:32:46,218
What are you going to do? Tell me.

531
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:48,387
What can you even do?

532
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:52,288
A nobody like you can't do anything to me!

533
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:54,357
Hey, look at me.

534
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,857
I told you
that not all friends were the same.

535
00:32:58,097 --> 00:32:59,097
Jeong Sang Eui.

536
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,367
I am Park Tae Jin, you moron.

537
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:04,238
Darn you.

538
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:09,167
Hey, you called me
and came here to cut a deal with me?

539
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,238
You couldn't even come up to me
to talk to me in the past.

540
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:16,123
How dare you call me
and try to pull this on me?

541
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:17,147
Park Tae Jin.

542
00:33:21,587 --> 00:33:22,587
What is this?

543
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,917
So, this is you at your lowest low?

544
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:26,258
Hey.

545
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:27,758
You called him here too?

546
00:33:28,728 --> 00:33:29,728
Why?

547
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:31,998
Were you afraid I'd kill you?

548
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,573
I came to ask you something.

549
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,597
Hey.

550
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:39,938
The rumor must be true.

551
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,514
Captain Yoo Kyung Hwan told me
you were now a druggie,

552
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:43,538
but I didn't believe him.

553
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,577
Hey, he's our customer.

554
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:47,353
I'm really struggling
and feel like I'm dying.

555
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:48,548
Hey, don't die.

556
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:51,117
All right. This is actually good.

557
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,817
What do you want to know?

558
00:33:53,018 --> 00:33:54,694
If you're curious about something,
ask away.

559
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:55,718
But before that,

560
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:57,387
hand over your phone.

561
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:03,998
Hey, are you all right?

562
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:14,738
Come on in.

563
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:18,577
Hey.

564
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,178
You two are such clowns.

565
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:22,548
One of you...

566
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:25,954
manufactured and distributed drugs,

567
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,338
and the other one is a police detective
who's now a druggie.

568
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:32,758
Goodness.
Why are my friends all such clowns?

569
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:34,157
Hey, sit down.

570
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,517
You said you wanted to ask me something.
You'd better hurry.

571
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,974
In a few minutes,
the investigators from the prosecution...

572
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,167
will raid this place.

573
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,768
Ask away before you guys get arrested.

574
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:52,137
Jun Seo.

575
00:34:54,907 --> 00:34:57,377
He joined hands with you
and decided to deal drugs...

576
00:34:59,248 --> 00:35:02,088
because he wanted to take his daughter
to the US to treat her condition.

577
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:04,187
- Is that all?
- Hey.

578
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:06,388
You were curious about that?

579
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:11,804
You knew that Jong Soo gave...

580
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:14,043
Jun Seo 5,000 dollars to help him pay
for his daughter's medicine,

581
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,227
right?

582
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:16,804
Yes.

583
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:19,267
Jong Soo said he wanted to show Jun Seo
who the boss was.

584
00:35:19,537 --> 00:35:21,368
So he teased Jun Seo with the money.

585
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,308
That's why...

586
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:26,054
the only hope for Jun Seo
who had to deal with Jong Soo...

587
00:35:26,078 --> 00:35:28,918
was that his daughter's medicine
would be covered by national insurance.

588
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:32,548
But Jong Soo used his influence
and got in Jun Seo's way.

589
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:36,287
After watching everything,

590
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:38,457
I went to Jun Seo.

591
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,004
(March, 2023)

592
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:42,328
Jong Soo got in the way of that.

593
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,127
Jong Soo...

594
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:48,128
stopped your daughter's medicine
from getting covered...

595
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:49,567
by national insurance.

596
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:51,798
What?

597
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:54,968
Park Jun Seo.

598
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:56,607
Listen carefully.

599
00:35:57,977 --> 00:36:00,008
Let's sell this drug
only for three months.

600
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:01,848
That will be enough.

601
00:36:04,948 --> 00:36:05,977
But he said no.

602
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,817
He said Jong Soo was still a friend
despite everything he did.

603
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:11,228
How ridiculous it was
to call him a friend.

604
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:12,817
Gosh.

605
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:14,558
Anyway, that was that.

606
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,247
Then he got a message from the US
out of the blue.

607
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,667
They said they could fix his daughter
if he paid them 500,000 dollars.

608
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,028
So this time,

609
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:26,167
Jun Seo went to Jong Soo first.

610
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:27,968
Lend me 500,000 dollars.

611
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,537
If Yoon Hee can regain her health,

612
00:36:35,207 --> 00:36:36,848
I'll do anything you say.

613
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:38,578
Jong Soo.

614
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:41,448
I rarely ask you for help. You know that.

615
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:42,618
Hey.

616
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:44,988
I'm telling you. They're fooling you.

617
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:48,103
You said the drug was going through
a clinical trial anyway.

618
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:49,727
How do you know it will be effective?

619
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:53,957
Okay.

620
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:56,767
I'll start giving you 5,000 dollars again.
Just wait.

621
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,444
If the clinical trials go well
and the drug is verified,

622
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,908
Korea will import it too. Right?

623
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:07,607
Come on. Move.

624
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:11,747
Jun Seo came to me the next day.

625
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:15,217
He said he would deal drugs...

626
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:17,488
until he saved up 500,000 dollars.

627
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:19,558
Happy now?

628
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:28,528
Sir.

629
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:30,738
Yes.

630
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:35,214
According to
an exclusive investigative report...

631
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:36,937
by a local newspaper agency
in Anhyun,

632
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,583
Joo In Sang, the Mayor of Anhyun,

633
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:41,524
had an inappropriate drinking party
with several women...

634
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,707
and was entertained
by them sexually.

635
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:46,718
Mayor Joo denied the accusation
and claimed to be innocent.

636
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,317
But the scandal continues
to be in the limelight.

637
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:51,464
Meanwhile, the construction...

638
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,163
of the bioindustrial complex
in Pilo-dong is named...

639
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,134
the biggest development project
in the history of the city.

640
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:57,698
The CEO of Keumhyung Group's son,
Won Jong Soo, is the man...

641
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,404
leading the development project
of the second new city in Anhyun.

642
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,904
He was arrested by the police...

643
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,274
for manufacturing
and administrating narcotics.

644
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,138
His arrest came as a great shock
to the public.

645
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,243
Mayor Joo In Sang approved
of his development project...

646
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,767
Hey, call Park Tae Jin.

647
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:10,043
- Yes, sir.
- The aforementioned business...

648
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,107
is on the brink of collapse.

649
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:14,284
(Secretary Park Chul Jae)

650
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:16,048
(Jeong Yeon Ju)

651
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:17,678
Any other questions?

652
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:20,787
Do you know why...

653
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:24,158
Jun Seo called you guys to come...

654
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:27,657
to the construction site in Pilo-dong,
a place of complete irrelevance?

655
00:38:29,627 --> 00:38:30,758
Because...

656
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:35,098
that exact spot was
where Chae Kyung Tae's house used to be.

657
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,968
Jun Seo was going
to reveal each of our secrets...

658
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,768
at a place
where our ill-fated relationship began.

659
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:45,837
Tae Jin.

660
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,784
You were secretly selling the drugs
to outsiders behind Jong Soo's back.

661
00:38:48,808 --> 00:38:52,517
Back then, after Oh Chi Hyun
and Jeong Yoon Ho killed Lee Myung Guk,

662
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:54,988
they stored his body
in Youngryun Cold Storage.

663
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:57,587
Jong Soo...

664
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:00,928
killed Chae Kyung Tae 20 years ago.

665
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:03,988
- What?
- What?

666
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:06,058
You didn't know?

667
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:09,627
Chae Kyung Tae didn't burn to death
in the accident.

668
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:14,107
Jong Soo's name tag fell off,
so he went back in there to find it.

669
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:18,008
Chae Kyung Tae woke up
and begged to be spared, but Jong Soo...

670
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:21,448
murdered him.

671
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,747
At 11:30 p.m. on February 23,

672
00:39:30,488 --> 00:39:33,088
you were called to meet him
at the construction site in Pilo-dong.

673
00:39:33,687 --> 00:39:36,488
And one of you killed Park Jun Seo.

674
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,058
Why?

675
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:42,298
In case the fact that he killed his friend
20 years ago would be revealed?

676
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:44,127
Or...

677
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,837
to cover up the fact that
he murdered the researcher...

678
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,238
who blackmailed his friend?

679
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:51,578
If that wasn't it,

680
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:53,638
was it to hide the fact that...

681
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:56,417
you manufactured and sold the drugs
behind your friends' backs?

682
00:39:58,718 --> 00:40:00,017
On the day of Jun Seo's death,

683
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:03,147
someone stopped the elevator
heading to the ninth floor...

684
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:04,948
and made it go down to the first floor.

685
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:07,928
The same person encouraged everyone...

686
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:11,627
to leave the scene quickly
after confirming Jun Seo's death.

687
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,517
A postmortem screening was conducted
on Jun Seo's body,

688
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:18,468
but this person got in the way
of the autopsy to the end.

689
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:21,767
It was all done by one person.

690
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:28,548
Park Tae Jin.

691
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:30,578
Tell me the truth now.

692
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:34,687
You killed Jun Seo, didn't you?

693
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:44,368
Let me ask you one thing before that.

694
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:47,757
You're claiming it wasn't suicide.

695
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,207
What evidence do you have
for your claim that he was murdered?

696
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:52,937
His shoes.

697
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,738
- What?
- When Jun Seo...

698
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:59,107
fell initially, he had his shoes on.

699
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:00,977
Right.

700
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,207
I saw his shoes clearly.

701
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,417
I see.

702
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,058
You saw his shoes.

703
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:19,227
That was so unnecessary.

704
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:21,667
Why were they put back
on the ninth floor?

705
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:27,468
You're right.

706
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:30,037
I killed Jun Seo.

707
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:35,107
Park Jun Seo...

708
00:41:37,678 --> 00:41:38,678
I killed him.

709
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:46,087
Actually, I wasn't going
to rush into killing him like that.

710
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:49,727
No.
Killing him wasn't part of the plan...

711
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:54,098
because I didn't know the last digits
of the password.

712
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:56,428
Then one day,

713
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:58,997
Jun Seo threatened to reveal everything.

714
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:00,643
I was so close.

715
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,513
I was almost done
saving up enough money...

716
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,308
to invest in the Pilo-dong project.

717
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:08,747
He had shamelessly been dealing drugs
all this time.

718
00:42:08,948 --> 00:42:11,094
But all of a sudden,
he said he would come clean.

719
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:12,094
Hey.

720
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:14,518
If you were me, would you have
let him do whatever he wanted?

721
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,017
Would you have let him?

722
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:22,887
Thinking about it now
still gets me worked up.

723
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:27,227
So...

724
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,328
that day at 11:30 p.m.,

725
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:33,574
when the rest of them came
to the construction site,

726
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,598
I told him to turn on the light
on the ninth floor,

727
00:42:35,738 --> 00:42:38,837
and around the time the elevator reached
the 4th... No, the 5th floor,

728
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:40,683
I told him to push Park Jun Seo.

729
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:42,408
That way, my alibi would be ironclad.

730
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:44,377
By then,

731
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:46,393
I would have stopped the elevator...

732
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:47,864
and set it to the 1st floor,
not the 9th floor.

733
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:49,688
That's where
we would have checked the body...

734
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:51,887
and tried to leave the scene...

735
00:42:52,618 --> 00:42:53,857
as fast as possible.

736
00:42:57,587 --> 00:42:58,627
That was...

737
00:43:00,598 --> 00:43:02,328
my perfect plan.

738
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:11,178
The shoes you found on the ninth floor.

739
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:13,477
That wasn't part of my plan.

740
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,477
Half of the people
who jump off buildings...

741
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:18,877
keep their shoes on.

742
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:28,158
- Go on.
- What do you mean?

743
00:43:28,727 --> 00:43:30,627
- How did you kill him?
- What?

744
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:34,058
You didn't push him off
when he was still alive.

745
00:43:35,468 --> 00:43:37,598
He didn't even scream when he fell.

746
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:41,138
Was he not awake?
Or did you drug him?

747
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:42,607
I used anesthetics.

748
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:46,778
Just enough, so it wouldn't be traced
even from an autopsy.

749
00:43:47,778 --> 00:43:48,808
Satisfied now?

750
00:43:54,488 --> 00:43:55,647
Who was it?

751
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:00,818
The one who drugged Park Jun Seo
with the anesthetics...

752
00:44:02,187 --> 00:44:04,388
and pushed him off nine stories.

753
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:07,397
Who was it?

754
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:13,067
Even I'm curious...

755
00:44:15,308 --> 00:44:16,738
about where he could be now.

756
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,508
No. Maybe, he's already dead.

757
00:44:21,848 --> 00:44:22,848
Jeong Yoon Ho.

758
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:26,497
You got Jeong Yoon Ho to do it, right?

759
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:29,087
That's why...

760
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,718
you were determined to get rid of him.

761
00:44:32,618 --> 00:44:33,658
Hey.

762
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:35,917
I'll leave it up to you to think about.

763
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:38,727
Anyway, it feels great to confide in you.

764
00:44:39,497 --> 00:44:42,298
You kept asking me if I had killed
Jun Seo for the past two weeks.

765
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:44,358
I couldn't exactly tell you that I did.

766
00:44:47,397 --> 00:44:48,468
Jang Jae Gyeong.

767
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,767
For the last time,

768
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:52,408
let me ask you one more thing.

769
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:56,678
Didn't you say you lost contact
with Jun Seo for 20 years?

770
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:59,578
So why are you going this far?

771
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,194
As far as I know,

772
00:45:02,218 --> 00:45:03,824
you find friendships childish.

773
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,234
I'm asking why you're going this far.

774
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:08,388
Just look at yourself.

775
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:10,904
You were doing well as a detective,

776
00:45:10,928 --> 00:45:13,957
but now you're addicted to drugs.
You're a mess inside and out.

777
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:17,567
How could you continue your job like this?

778
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,738
Think this through, Jae Gyeong.

779
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,397
How about we take the opportunity
to work together?

780
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:24,837
Don't tell me...

781
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:27,408
you're doing this to avenge Jun Seo.

782
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:30,348
Come on.

783
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:34,587
He was not the Park Jun Seo you knew
from 20 years ago.

784
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:38,433
He chose us over you
during Chae Kyung Tae's case.

785
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:40,933
He was always lousy since then.

786
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:43,563
He was a coward,
had no ambition, and he was listless!

787
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:46,873
He sponged off of his friends
and lived as a drug delivery man.

788
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:49,444
He had a pathetic life!

789
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:51,837
There's no use
in sacrificing yourself for him.

790
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:57,183
His life was not worth it
for you to clear his name!

791
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:58,278
Wake up.

792
00:46:02,908 --> 00:46:03,908
But,

793
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,078
didn't he have a pretty cool ending?

794
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:09,048
Thanks to me,
people even called him the Doctor.

795
00:46:09,388 --> 00:46:10,388
Enough.

796
00:46:10,488 --> 00:46:12,734
I helped him make big bucks...

797
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:14,017
with a new drug.

798
00:46:15,328 --> 00:46:16,727
I gave him a good life,

799
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:18,674
but that ungrateful jerk acted like...

800
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:21,373
he was suddenly a new man.

801
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:23,873
What? He wants to test our friendship?

802
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:25,638
Does he want to turn things back?

803
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:27,337
Who is he to decide?

804
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:30,183
He can't even keep his wife under control.

805
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:32,738
How dare he decide to turn things back?

806
00:46:33,808 --> 00:46:35,278
Hey. Also, his wife...

807
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:38,048
That woman...

808
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:39,448
Right, Choi Ji Yeon.

809
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:43,017
It didn't take much to seduce her.

810
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:48,258
I just started a few conversations,
and she was at me.

811
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:50,558
What did I do?

812
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,404
I'm speechless.

813
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:53,428
Park Tae Jin!

814
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:44,348
(One month later)

815
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:02,328
Is the treatment going well?

816
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:06,598
Right. I heard.

817
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:11,508
I shot Park Tae Jin with your gun
so you were demoted.

818
00:48:13,008 --> 00:48:14,008
How are you?

819
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:17,078
Do you still not have any regrets?

820
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:18,824
Of course I don't have any regrets.

821
00:48:18,848 --> 00:48:20,618
I avenged them for Jun Seo.

822
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:27,718
I was able to stay loyal to Jun Seo.

823
00:48:28,857 --> 00:48:29,957
My heart is at ease.

824
00:48:31,598 --> 00:48:32,727
Twenty years ago,

825
00:48:33,397 --> 00:48:35,127
none of you wavered...

826
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:38,537
in front of Chae Kyung Tae's death
and made a terrifying decision.

827
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,707
Despite that, Jun Seo took your side.

828
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:44,778
While watching him,

829
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:47,908
I decided not to believe in friendship.

830
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,448
I didn't want to make friends anymore.

831
00:48:53,948 --> 00:48:55,087
Now that I think about it,

832
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:57,287
I tried hard...

833
00:48:57,948 --> 00:48:59,587
to turn away from what happened then.

834
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,497
But just like Jun Seo,

835
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,937
I wasn't free from the haunting memories
of that time.

836
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:14,397
Just look at how I lived.

837
00:49:18,178 --> 00:49:20,008
Yes, that was what happened.

838
00:49:22,078 --> 00:49:23,078
What about now?

839
00:49:24,977 --> 00:49:26,678
Are you free like I am now?

840
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:30,348
I don't know.

841
00:49:32,988 --> 00:49:34,828
Your friends either died...

842
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:36,787
or were arrested.

843
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:40,727
Yet you say you're free.

844
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:46,667
You claim you took revenge for Jun Seo.

845
00:49:48,138 --> 00:49:50,537
But perhaps he never wanted one.

846
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:56,707
Just like when I reported you
to the police 20 years ago,

847
00:49:57,607 --> 00:49:58,977
I didn't do it for Jun Seo.

848
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:02,988
I was overwhelmed with my emotions...

849
00:50:03,388 --> 00:50:05,457
and reported you for my sake.

850
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:07,957
I'm not like that.

851
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:10,988
From now on,

852
00:50:12,658 --> 00:50:14,868
I'll try to live the way...

853
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:17,767
my friend Jun Seo wanted...

854
00:50:19,138 --> 00:50:21,508
with the remaining friends...

855
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,167
he would've wanted to look after
if he had been alive.

856
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:30,588
You should give it some thought in there.

857
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:34,218
What kind of person...

858
00:50:35,517 --> 00:50:36,957
did your one and only friend want...

859
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:39,787
to see in you?

860
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:47,897
I'll get going.

861
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:51,028
Don't visit me again.

862
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:54,397
Listening to you...

863
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:58,913
makes me feel guilty
as if I did something wrong to Jun Seo.

864
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:00,337
There's no reason to feel this way.

865
00:51:07,048 --> 00:51:08,048
Right.

866
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:10,388
That password...

867
00:51:12,817 --> 00:51:15,227
The four-digit password
Park Tae Jin couldn't figure out...

868
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:18,598
was 0-6-1-7.

869
00:51:20,558 --> 00:51:21,897
It's Choi Ji Yeon's birthdate.

870
00:51:36,178 --> 00:51:37,308
Lieutenant Jang.

871
00:51:38,578 --> 00:51:40,877
You requested
to meet Kim Chang Soo tomorrow, right?

872
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,218
Yes.

873
00:51:42,287 --> 00:51:43,917
He declined the request again.

874
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,187
He must be embarrassed to see you.

875
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:50,727
Would you pass on this message?

876
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:54,497
Tell him I won't let him get punished
for something he didn't do...

877
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:58,567
and that the particulars of the case
have been reported already.

878
00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:00,397
Also, tell him to take care of himself.

879
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:01,968
I will.

880
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:10,408
(Late Park Jun Seo)

881
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,647
It has been only 49 days since he left,

882
00:52:18,147 --> 00:52:19,817
yet so much has happened.

883
00:52:20,058 --> 00:52:21,058
You're right.

884
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:23,687
There were...

885
00:52:24,528 --> 00:52:25,627
so many people...

886
00:52:26,598 --> 00:52:27,957
at his funeral.

887
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:40,238
When are you moving?

888
00:52:40,937 --> 00:52:41,948
In two weeks.

889
00:52:43,808 --> 00:52:46,017
Let me know if you need my help.

890
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:49,068
I'll hire movers who will pack for me.

891
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:52,087
You should still let us know
if it's too much to do alone.

892
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:53,187
I will.

893
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,957
All right. See you another time.

894
00:52:56,428 --> 00:52:57,428
Bye.

895
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:18,207
Exactly.

896
00:53:19,017 --> 00:53:21,123
If you keep on being ambiguous,

897
00:53:21,147 --> 00:53:23,187
how can I write the story?

898
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:29,488
Why do you want to meet?
Just tell me over the phone.

899
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:31,798
You always try to resolve it in person.

900
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,198
How is her voice...

901
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,727
so loud?

902
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:43,138
Hey. Pay attention.

903
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:44,267
Okay.

904
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:50,747
Hey. You've been printing
lots of articles lately.

905
00:53:53,017 --> 00:53:55,147
I printed a lot before too.

906
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:57,263
What if you get scouted
by the main paper...

907
00:53:57,287 --> 00:53:58,393
and go to Seoul at this rate?

908
00:53:58,417 --> 00:54:01,417
Hey, do you think this world
is such an easy place?

909
00:54:01,618 --> 00:54:03,703
Hey, still.
Don't you think you'll receive...

910
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:04,833
Anhyun's Reporter of the Year Award?

911
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:07,074
Well, as long as I don't have to take
any illegal requests...

912
00:54:07,098 --> 00:54:08,828
or cave to external pressures.

913
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:14,274
Hey, did you see Mayor Joo In Sang's
press conference yesterday?

914
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,308
Goodness.

915
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:17,067
Why was that guy crying?

916
00:54:17,308 --> 00:54:19,238
Someone might think he was the victim.

917
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,008
It's finished.

918
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:23,647
Already?

919
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:25,078
(Battery charge complete)

920
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:26,917
Gosh, that was so quick.

921
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:31,388
Why?

922
00:54:32,587 --> 00:54:34,058
No, about the insurance money.

923
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:37,388
It's really gone, right?

924
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:41,178
If you say that 1 more time,
it'll be the 100th time.

925
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:45,067
Would I ever get the chance
to get my hands on such money again?

926
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:48,738
How am I going to bring my daughter back?

927
00:54:50,738 --> 00:54:53,913
Hey, if we really catch the culprit
who killed Jun Seo,

928
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:55,408
don't we still have a shot?

929
00:54:55,647 --> 00:54:57,078
Haven't you found out anything?

930
00:54:58,008 --> 00:54:59,408
Hey, Soo Hyun. What's the occasion?

931
00:54:59,517 --> 00:55:01,054
You even called your senior
who's taking time off from work.

932
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:02,393
I'm sure you didn't find out anything...

933
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:04,457
while you were waiting to be assigned
to a new post.

934
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:05,618
So?

935
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:08,517
Have you arrested him already?

936
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,298
All right. I'll be right there.

937
00:55:13,158 --> 00:55:14,198
What is it?

938
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:16,188
Jun Seo's autopsy results are out.

939
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:18,008
Please take me to the police station.

940
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:19,397
Okay. What?

941
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:21,478
What are you doing?
Get the engine running.

942
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:29,877
Oh, you're here.

943
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:33,517
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I'm doing a lot better.

944
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,988
That man's DNA was found
underneath Park Jun Seo's fingernails.

945
00:55:43,828 --> 00:55:45,774
And they found an anesthetic
in his blood.

946
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:47,873
(Other person's skin cells found
underneath right index fingernail)

947
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:49,028
You know who he is, right?

948
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:50,698
Chairman Won Chang Ho's secretary.

949
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:52,397
Yes.

950
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:55,098
He had a prior conviction.

951
00:55:56,238 --> 00:55:58,937
Thanks to that,
the DNA comparison was done quickly.

952
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:01,078
So, we made the arrest pretty easily.

953
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,078
But it's way too easy.

954
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:04,578
What do you mean by that?

955
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:06,353
We went to arrest him,

956
00:56:06,377 --> 00:56:09,647
and he followed us out
as if he had been waiting for us.

957
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:13,417
And he just confessed to most parts
within ten minutes of the interrogation.

958
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:16,904
He said that he killed Park Jun Seo
according to Park Tae Jin's plans.

959
00:56:16,928 --> 00:56:17,957
Look at this.

960
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:20,457
It's written in detail by time.

961
00:56:21,928 --> 00:56:23,203
(February 22, 3 p.m., Jeogang High
Chairman event attendance)

962
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:25,988
(3:30 p.m., Jun Seo visits Jeogang High,
Speaks with Chairman briefly)

963
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:40,317
Chairman.

964
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:46,317
Yes, come in and have a seat.

965
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,037
So, you're
Assemblyman Jang Tae Jung's son?

966
00:56:59,497 --> 00:57:01,537
Your secretary, Mr. Park Hyuk Jae.

967
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:04,418
He has confessed to murdering
Park Jun Seo.

968
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,078
But no matter how much we ask him,

969
00:57:09,448 --> 00:57:11,408
he only says that
he conspired with Park Tae Jin.

970
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:14,218
He didn't say that you made him do it.

971
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:19,594
But the notebook that Mr. Park Hyuk Jae
always carried around...

972
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:20,957
said something else.

973
00:57:22,388 --> 00:57:24,428
On February 22,
the day before Jun Seo died,

974
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:27,328
Jun Seo came to see you, didn't he?

975
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:36,167
I am not recording this conversation.

976
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:38,308
I will turn my phone off entirely.

977
00:57:46,448 --> 00:57:47,808
What did he say when he came here?

978
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,888
Did he perhaps say that your son,
Won Jong Soo,

979
00:57:52,988 --> 00:57:55,287
killed Chae Kyung Tae 20 years ago?

980
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:02,098
Yes. You can go inside.

981
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:03,774
Study hard.

982
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:04,798
Thank you.

983
00:58:14,138 --> 00:58:16,223
If you have something to say,
let's finish this within ten minutes.

984
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:17,607
I have my next schedule to get to.

985
00:58:17,848 --> 00:58:18,848
Jong Soo...

986
00:58:19,618 --> 00:58:21,118
is making drugs...

987
00:58:22,587 --> 00:58:23,893
in the basement
of Youngryun Cold Storage.

988
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,964
(Jeogang High School)

989
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:27,948
The person who delivers those drugs
to Jong Soo...

990
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:30,258
is me.

991
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:34,158
Park Tae Jin is selling those drugs
to the outside,

992
00:58:36,468 --> 00:58:38,028
and the person who sells those drugs...

993
00:58:39,968 --> 00:58:40,968
is also me.

994
00:58:41,937 --> 00:58:44,243
Twenty years ago, there were
six houses that got in the way...

995
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:47,238
of the first Anhyun new town development.
One of them burned down.

996
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:51,308
Due to that accident,

997
00:58:52,817 --> 00:58:54,278
Chae Kyung Tae burned to death.

998
00:58:55,147 --> 00:58:56,317
It wasn't an accident.

999
00:58:58,787 --> 00:58:59,917
Jong Soo killed him.

1000
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:05,328
(Won Jong Soo)

1001
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:08,667
From start to finish,

1002
00:59:09,368 --> 00:59:10,528
it was all baffling.

1003
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:14,967
It was laughable that he showed me
this name tag as if it was evidence.

1004
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:19,107
Even now, you could have hundreds
of those made if you just pay for it.

1005
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:21,607
So, what did Jun Seo say?

1006
00:59:21,877 --> 00:59:22,977
Out of nowhere,

1007
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:28,377
he told me to gather the boys
and have them pay for their crimes.

1008
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:30,948
And he asked me to help them...

1009
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:33,957
protect their friendship.

1010
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:38,127
Then, if I didn't do as he said,

1011
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:42,567
he even threatened me that he'd reveal
the boys' crimes to the world.

1012
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:46,198
There was no need for me to stay there.

1013
00:59:46,968 --> 00:59:48,984
I didn't turn back and just left.

1014
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:50,908
- That was all.
- No.

1015
00:59:53,707 --> 00:59:56,977
February 22, 7:12 p.m.

1016
00:59:57,308 --> 00:59:59,293
What Jun Seo said must've weighed on you.

1017
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:00,797
You called Park Tae Jin to the house.

1018
01:00:01,448 --> 01:00:04,118
You must've had to check
that he was selling drugs.

1019
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:05,317
Isn't that right?

1020
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:08,517
You.

1021
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:11,287
I hear you're selling drugs.

1022
01:00:11,888 --> 01:00:12,957
Is that true?

1023
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:16,004
How did you...

1024
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:17,868
Park Jun Seo stopped by.

1025
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:21,037
He said he was selling drugs with you.

1026
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:29,147
Tomorrow night at 11:30 p.m.,
he says he will gather you, Jong Soo,

1027
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:32,348
and everyone else
at the Pilo-dong construction site.

1028
01:00:34,178 --> 01:00:37,817
Until then,
if I don't persuade you guys...

1029
01:00:38,317 --> 01:00:41,988
to repent your sins
and have you face the law,

1030
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:44,328
he says...

1031
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,897
the whole world will know the next day.

1032
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:53,537
So, what did he say?

1033
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:56,138
Tae Jin said,

1034
01:00:57,437 --> 01:01:00,207
"I'm sorry," and then,

1035
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:02,607
out of nowhere,

1036
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:05,948
he said he'd kill Jun Seo.

1037
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:11,618
He said he had to kill Jun Seo for
all of this to get swept under the rug.

1038
01:01:13,787 --> 01:01:14,787
Then,

1039
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:17,687
he explained in full detail...

1040
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,997
how he would disguise it as a suicide.

1041
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:24,028
Do you remember that plan?

1042
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:25,698
How could I remember all of that?

1043
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:27,937
It was nothing to pay attention to.

1044
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:29,638
So, what did you say?

1045
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:32,808
Did you say you'd help him?

1046
01:01:40,317 --> 01:01:41,317
Of course,

1047
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:45,488
I told him he couldn't do that.

1048
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,534
Do you think
I brought you boys together as friends...

1049
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:50,528
to see something like that happen?

1050
01:01:53,897 --> 01:01:56,328
Then, Tae Jin told you his plans...

1051
01:01:56,727 --> 01:01:58,567
to get rid of Jun Seo,

1052
01:01:58,997 --> 01:02:02,337
and your secretary wrote down
every detail of that plan in here.

1053
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:04,667
But you told him not to do so.

1054
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:09,024
Then, do you mean Tae Jin made the call...

1055
01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:12,377
to scheme with your secretary
and kill Jun Seo?

1056
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,457
I should've tried harder to
convince him not to do it.

1057
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:25,127
Thinking about it now,

1058
01:02:26,198 --> 01:02:27,598
that's what weighs on my mind.

1059
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:29,198
No.

1060
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,074
I'm sure you didn't call Park Tae Jin...

1061
01:02:31,098 --> 01:02:33,743
simply to tell him off for selling drugs.

1062
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,567
You called him
to take care of this situation.

1063
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:42,707
I've committed a grave sin.

1064
01:02:43,508 --> 01:02:46,178
I will be sure to take care of Jun Seo.

1065
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:48,377
How?

1066
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:51,687
Sir?

1067
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:55,627
How?

1068
01:03:00,727 --> 01:03:01,758
I will...

1069
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:05,997
kill Jun Seo.

1070
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:14,207
Tomorrow night, you should tell Jun Seo
to meet you first.

1071
01:03:14,678 --> 01:03:16,377
Around 11 p.m. And the location...

1072
01:03:18,448 --> 01:03:19,728
The Pilo-dong construction site.

1073
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:23,287
On the ninth floor.

1074
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:29,488
(Friday, February 22)

1075
01:03:33,798 --> 01:03:36,127
(Seeing danger is
the first step to safety.)

1076
01:03:36,368 --> 01:03:37,368
(Danger! High voltage)

1077
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:51,747
(Caution, Fall Hazard)

1078
01:03:57,848 --> 01:03:58,848
Chairman Won.

1079
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:03,258
Chairman Won.

1080
01:04:08,758 --> 01:04:11,638
The man who was waiting for Jun Seo
on the ninth floor of the building...

1081
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,837
was none other than your secretary.

1082
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:17,107
He was the one selected
to execute Tae Jin's plan.

1083
01:04:25,408 --> 01:04:28,278
At 11:30 p.m.,
the boys arrived at the construction site,

1084
01:04:28,517 --> 01:04:29,594
and your secretary...

1085
01:04:29,618 --> 01:04:31,418
turned on the lights again
on the ninth floor.

1086
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:33,087
What?

1087
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:34,464
He must be up there.

1088
01:04:34,488 --> 01:04:36,258
(Caution, Fall Hazard)

1089
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:38,158
Everything was going smoothly...

1090
01:04:39,198 --> 01:04:41,727
until a problem arose.

1091
01:04:45,868 --> 01:04:46,968
Tae Jin probably said...

1092
01:04:47,238 --> 01:04:50,667
to use an amount so minute
that it wouldn't be found in an autopsy.

1093
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:52,977
But they couldn't stick to the plan.

1094
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:58,048
So, they had to use way more anesthetic
than originally planned,

1095
01:04:59,448 --> 01:05:01,247
which is why the autopsy report says this.

1096
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:05,393
Shall I keep going?

1097
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:08,217
(It is highly likely that he was
under the influence of Sevoflurane...)

1098
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:22,098
Your secretary managed
to knock Jun Seo out again.

1099
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:25,013
When the elevator came up
from the first floor,

1100
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:26,477
he moved Jun Seo in a hurry.

1101
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:28,328
Then according to Tae Jin's plan,

1102
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:30,154
when the elevator was passing
the 4th or 5th floor,

1103
01:05:30,178 --> 01:05:31,778
he pushed Jun Seo off the edge.

1104
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:41,587
Then the elevator went back down
to the first floor as planned.

1105
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:47,698
Tae Jin didn't cook up this plan
with your secretary.

1106
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:50,504
Your secretary,
who's worked for you for 20 years,

1107
01:05:50,528 --> 01:05:51,643
would never listen to Park Tae Jin...

1108
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,397
and kill someone
unless you ordered him to do it.

1109
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:57,337
It was you, wasn't it?

1110
01:05:58,238 --> 01:06:00,977
You ordered him to kill Park Jun Seo,
didn't you?

1111
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:02,607
Why would I do that?

1112
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:05,223
What for?

1113
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:07,278
Your company was facing a crisis.

1114
01:06:07,848 --> 01:06:10,063
The Pilo-dong Project was
the only chance you had...

1115
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:11,163
at overcoming the crisis,

1116
01:06:11,187 --> 01:06:13,267
so you couldn't afford to lose it
because of Jun Seo.

1117
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:16,787
Your son, Won Jong Soo,
who was going to lead that project,

1118
01:06:17,457 --> 01:06:19,674
could not get roped
into the 20-year-old murder case...

1119
01:06:19,698 --> 01:06:21,828
or a drug scandal.

1120
01:06:22,627 --> 01:06:24,143
Also,
it'd be utterly absurd if Park Tae Jin...

1121
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,304
who had been working with you two...

1122
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:28,567
was manufacturing and selling drugs
through Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

1123
01:06:28,937 --> 01:06:29,937
Am I wrong?

1124
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:34,214
Did you say everything you wanted to say?

1125
01:06:34,238 --> 01:06:35,718
You ordered him to do it, didn't you?

1126
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:39,377
Tell me the truth.

1127
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:43,647
I'm getting tired.

1128
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:53,258
Hey, well done.

1129
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:57,598
We even made sure to take off his shoes
to stage it as a suicide.

1130
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:01,098
You got my secretary...

1131
01:07:01,397 --> 01:07:02,667
and Park Tae Jin too.

1132
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:04,167
I'm impressed.

1133
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:06,408
Now, be satisfied
with your achievements...

1134
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:08,207
and get going already.

1135
01:07:09,348 --> 01:07:11,048
The shoes you found on the ninth floor.

1136
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,147
That wasn't part of my plan.

1137
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,348
Half of the people
who jump off buildings...

1138
01:07:17,587 --> 01:07:18,718
keep their shoes on.

1139
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:22,218
What did you say just now?

1140
01:07:23,058 --> 01:07:24,058
What?

1141
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:26,478
You said,
"We made sure to take off his shoes..."

1142
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:29,098
"to stage it as a suicide."
Whose idea was it?

1143
01:07:29,468 --> 01:07:31,497
Tae Jin's. Who else?

1144
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:35,238
So, it was you.

1145
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:37,337
What?

1146
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:41,183
You told your secretary
to remove his shoes...

1147
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:43,348
and push him over the railings.

1148
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:45,654
What are you saying?

1149
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:48,147
It was Tae Jin's idea.
To stage it as a suicide.

1150
01:07:49,618 --> 01:07:50,618
No.

1151
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:53,718
Removing the shoes
wasn't part of his plan.

1152
01:07:56,428 --> 01:07:57,428
I see.

1153
01:07:57,928 --> 01:07:59,703
You heard Tae Jin's plan...

1154
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:02,028
and thought it was missing something.

1155
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:04,344
People assume
those who jump to their deaths...

1156
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:06,397
take off their shoes before they jump.

1157
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:08,537
So you told your secretary...

1158
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:11,729
to make sure to remove his shoes
before pushing him over the railings.

1159
01:08:12,607 --> 01:08:13,607
No.

1160
01:08:13,837 --> 01:08:17,183
Yes, you did.
Your secretary said the same thing too.

1161
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:19,824
When he was asked why he brought
the shoes back up to the ninth floor,

1162
01:08:19,848 --> 01:08:21,723
he said Park Tae Jin told him to do so.

1163
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:25,464
But Park Tae Jin knows full well
that half of the people...

1164
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:26,964
who jump to their death
keep their shoes on.

1165
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:30,004
The shoes weren't even important
to Park Tae Jin.

1166
01:08:30,028 --> 01:08:31,787
But they were important to you.

1167
01:08:33,997 --> 01:08:36,267
You don't need to lie anymore, do you?

1168
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:39,444
You had been working on the plan
for 20 years for Jong Soo,

1169
01:08:39,468 --> 01:08:42,707
but Jun Seo was about to ruin it all,
so you killed him.

1170
01:08:43,267 --> 01:08:45,167
Yes, I would've done the same thing.

1171
01:08:45,837 --> 01:08:47,714
What have you been through
to get to where you are now?

1172
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:50,384
What did you do to save your company
in every crisis?

1173
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:52,853
Who did Jun Seo think he was?
How dare he suddenly show up...

1174
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,254
and blackmail you,
using his friendship as an excuse?

1175
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:57,424
Of course,
you couldn't just sit back and watch.

1176
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:59,964
So, you acted on it
when you heard Tae Jin's plan.

1177
01:08:59,988 --> 01:09:02,234
You ordered your secretary
to kill Park Jun Seo.

1178
01:09:02,258 --> 01:09:04,933
Right? The order all came from you.

1179
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:06,627
Yes, it was me!

1180
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:12,303
That ingrate, Jun Seo, was acting up.

1181
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:14,513
My 20 years of hard work
were about to go down the drain.

1182
01:09:14,537 --> 01:09:16,297
I couldn't just sit back
and watch it happen!

1183
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:19,084
I called Tae Jin here...

1184
01:09:19,108 --> 01:09:20,553
and heard his plan.
I thought it was a good idea,

1185
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,353
so I executed the plan.

1186
01:09:22,377 --> 01:09:23,508
Why? What's wrong with that?

1187
01:09:24,308 --> 01:09:26,093
Had I not been satisfied
with Tae Jin's plan,

1188
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:29,053
I would've killed that punk
on the spot too!

1189
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:30,893
How dare he collect kickbacks
behind my back?

1190
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,037
Through selling drugs at that.
He was like my servant.

1191
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:49,537
You heard everything, so leave.

1192
01:09:52,508 --> 01:09:54,748
I bet you're disappointed
that you can't prove any of it,

1193
01:09:54,777 --> 01:09:57,324
but just be satisfied with the fact
that you got that much out of me.

1194
01:09:57,348 --> 01:09:59,348
You can talk about it
every time you drink.

1195
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:02,277
You said you had no one around you.

1196
01:10:03,447 --> 01:10:04,617
It really is true.

1197
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:06,417
What?

1198
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:10,027
I heard you had to get thoroughly searched
to enter here.

1199
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:12,928
But today, there was no one.

1200
01:10:18,568 --> 01:10:21,898
You must be really feeling the absence
of your secretary...

1201
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:24,268
who took care of you for 20 years.

1202
01:10:25,737 --> 01:10:27,337
Hey, this is cheating.

1203
01:10:28,178 --> 01:10:29,178
Mr. Won Chang Ho.

1204
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:31,478
You are...

1205
01:10:32,648 --> 01:10:35,318
under arrest for ordering the murder
of Park Jun Seo.

1206
01:10:48,697 --> 01:10:49,843
(2 weeks later)

1207
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:51,398
The examination is done.

1208
01:10:52,027 --> 01:10:54,568
It's been 50 days since you quit drugs.

1209
01:10:54,798 --> 01:10:55,798
Yes.

1210
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:59,407
The doctor said
to come back next Wednesday.

1211
01:10:59,808 --> 01:11:01,978
I'll see you next week.

1212
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,008
Thank you.

1213
01:11:05,447 --> 01:11:07,093
Following the arrest of...

1214
01:11:07,117 --> 01:11:09,723
Chairman Won Chang Ho
for instigation of murder,

1215
01:11:09,747 --> 01:11:11,864
Keumhyung Group requested a workout
earlier today...

1216
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:14,994
in the midst of their financial crisis.

1217
01:11:15,018 --> 01:11:17,164
Keumhyung Group's so-called "owner risk"
started...

1218
01:11:17,188 --> 01:11:21,003
when CEO Won Jong Soo
who is Chairman Won Chang Ho's only son...

1219
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,274
was arrested on drug charges,

1220
01:11:23,298 --> 01:11:25,544
and it has now resulted
in this workout request.

1221
01:11:25,568 --> 01:11:29,383
The creditors are reviewing the request...

1222
01:11:29,407 --> 01:11:31,444
while leaning toward bankruptcy.

1223
01:11:31,468 --> 01:11:34,553
Many are concerned that this could lead...

1224
01:11:34,577 --> 01:11:37,824
to a state of large-scale unemployment
or financial insolvency.

1225
01:11:37,848 --> 01:11:39,417
Reporter Jung Myung Eun has more.

1226
01:12:08,308 --> 01:12:12,423
(Notice of Insurance Payout)

1227
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:16,287
(Hello, Mr. Jang Jae Gyeong.
You will receive your insurance payout.)

1228
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,358
(Oh Yoon Jin)

1229
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:26,098
(Where are you? You got the text
from the insurance company too, right?)

1230
01:12:51,987 --> 01:12:53,287
(Bankbook)

1231
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:59,058
- Are you going to school diligently?
- Yes.

1232
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:01,098
You should make some friends.

1233
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:03,728
I have a lot of friends.

1234
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:05,827
Do you? Are you sure?

1235
01:13:08,398 --> 01:13:09,537
I have a lot.

1236
01:13:12,907 --> 01:13:14,577
I even have a picture with Mr. Park.

1237
01:13:20,518 --> 01:13:22,277
Have you been to his columbarium?

1238
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:24,888
No.
How can I when I don't know where it is?

1239
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:26,463
I'll give you the address.

1240
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:28,794
You should visit him from time to time
so he doesn't get bored.

1241
01:13:28,818 --> 01:13:30,787
- It's not too far.
- Okay.

1242
01:13:31,228 --> 01:13:32,803
Also,
if you ever need an adult for something,

1243
01:13:32,827 --> 01:13:34,898
don't bother your grandma and call me.

1244
01:13:35,497 --> 01:13:38,204
You'll probably feel confident
if you take a police officer to school.

1245
01:13:38,228 --> 01:13:39,668
- I bet you didn't know that.
- What?

1246
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:42,343
But Mr. Heo also came a few days ago...

1247
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:44,167
and told me to call him
if I was ever in need.

1248
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:47,178
He says an insurance guy
has his ways with teachers.

1249
01:13:48,938 --> 01:13:49,978
That's also true.

1250
01:13:50,548 --> 01:13:52,707
- Hey.
- Jang Jae Gyeong!

1251
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,428
Gosh.

1252
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:09,673
I thought you'd be happy
to get the insurance money.

1253
01:14:09,697 --> 01:14:10,798
Why are you sighing?

1254
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,237
I don't know.

1255
01:14:14,938 --> 01:14:17,638
I got a seven-digit number stamped
on my bank account at once.

1256
01:14:19,108 --> 01:14:21,308
I don't know why
it feels so uncomfortable.

1257
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:25,407
Hey.
Do you have to go back to the station?

1258
01:14:25,648 --> 01:14:27,678
No, I'm going to take a break.

1259
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:29,587
Are you sick?

1260
01:14:30,148 --> 01:14:31,287
I'm going to play hooky.

1261
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:34,987
Sure. Good idea.

1262
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:38,928
Can I have this?

1263
01:14:39,527 --> 01:14:40,558
Sure, have it.

1264
01:14:42,298 --> 01:14:44,667
It's nice out,
so I'm so sleepy this afternoon.

1265
01:14:44,968 --> 01:14:46,798
This will really wake you up.

1266
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:53,638
- It tastes good.
- Doesn't it?

1267
01:14:54,608 --> 01:14:55,638
Hey,

1268
01:14:55,877 --> 01:14:58,077
- why don't you join us?
- For what?

1269
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:01,218
We decided to go help Ji Yeon
with packing her stuff.

1270
01:15:02,048 --> 01:15:04,463
She nearly died so I acted nice to her,

1271
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:07,018
and she really latched onto me.

1272
01:15:07,318 --> 01:15:08,758
I loathe people like that.

1273
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:10,787
Why is she treating me
like her big sister?

1274
01:15:12,027 --> 01:15:13,127
Sure, I'll join.

1275
01:15:13,558 --> 01:15:14,558
Okay.

1276
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:17,298
- Yoon Jin.
- Yes?

1277
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:19,143
Why don't you bring up
what you were going to earlier?

1278
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,237
Now seems like a good time.

1279
01:15:25,638 --> 01:15:26,707
What is it?

1280
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:31,148
Do you have a place
to spend the insurance money?

1281
01:15:32,207 --> 01:15:33,218
I'm not sure.

1282
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:35,617
Maybe Si Jung?

1283
01:15:36,277 --> 01:15:38,487
She has to raise the kids without Yoon Ho.

1284
01:15:40,518 --> 01:15:42,318
I'm thinking of giving some to Si Jung.

1285
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:44,457
I haven't thought about the rest.

1286
01:15:46,758 --> 01:15:47,798
Choi Ji Yeon.

1287
01:15:49,197 --> 01:15:50,997
She has zero survival skills.

1288
01:15:51,428 --> 01:15:54,497
I don't mean a lot of money.
Maybe just enough for a fresh start.

1289
01:15:55,837 --> 01:15:59,907
If you're interested,
we should do it together.

1290
01:16:01,508 --> 01:16:02,484
What do you think?

1291
01:16:02,508 --> 01:16:04,124
Isn't helping her with the move enough?

1292
01:16:04,148 --> 01:16:05,423
Do you want to give her
insurance money too?

1293
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:06,478
What?

1294
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:10,018
Well... Right.

1295
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:13,157
Sure. We can have different opinions.

1296
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:14,818
Just forget what I said.

1297
01:16:18,127 --> 01:16:19,188
What a nice day.

1298
01:16:19,898 --> 01:16:21,058
Yes, it's nice.

1299
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:26,228
You have a long way to go
before you pick up my humor.

1300
01:16:27,768 --> 01:16:28,768
What?

1301
01:16:29,568 --> 01:16:31,707
You have a long way to go...

1302
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:34,537
before you pick up my humor.

1303
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:35,608
What is this?

1304
01:16:36,447 --> 01:16:37,478
Come on.

1305
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:42,518
That wasn't funny. You startled me.

1306
01:16:44,348 --> 01:16:45,388
Here's a box.

1307
01:16:48,258 --> 01:16:49,258
Okay.

1308
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:51,758
Let's go.

1309
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:57,098
You have very few dishes.

1310
01:16:58,127 --> 01:16:59,468
Did you not eat at home much?

1311
01:17:00,337 --> 01:17:01,497
I broke a lot of them.

1312
01:17:02,098 --> 01:17:03,138
Gosh.

1313
01:17:03,737 --> 01:17:04,768
Good for you.

1314
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,867
The insurance money came out.

1315
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:16,987
Okay.

1316
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:20,617
What is this?

1317
01:17:21,518 --> 01:17:24,487
Didn't you say the money belonged to you?

1318
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:28,027
You told us we were bait.

1319
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:30,468
Stop that.

1320
01:17:33,697 --> 01:17:35,367
You'll see some money in your account.

1321
01:17:37,568 --> 01:17:39,568
Jae Gyeong said he'd send you some too.

1322
01:17:43,707 --> 01:17:45,553
- What?
- Once I got the money,

1323
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,497
it didn't feel right
to just accept it as my own.

1324
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:50,294
We had to pay taxes...

1325
01:17:50,318 --> 01:17:52,864
and other incidentals,
so we weren't left with much.

1326
01:17:52,888 --> 01:17:54,164
We can't afford to give you more.

1327
01:17:54,188 --> 01:17:56,827
I can't accept that money.
Please don't do that.

1328
01:17:56,987 --> 01:17:58,058
Be quiet.

1329
01:17:59,058 --> 01:18:01,938
When someone older gives you something,
just say thank you and accept it.

1330
01:18:05,968 --> 01:18:07,167
Thank you, Big Sister.

1331
01:18:11,407 --> 01:18:13,438
You won't stop calling me that, will you?

1332
01:18:17,848 --> 01:18:20,648
But I'm starting to warm up to it now.

1333
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:27,358
Hand it to me.

1334
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:30,428
Hey. Look at this.

1335
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:32,587
I found this.

1336
01:18:36,197 --> 01:18:37,197
What?

1337
01:18:38,197 --> 01:18:39,228
What is it?

1338
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:42,598
(2005 Summer, Beach in Busan)

1339
01:18:55,518 --> 01:19:00,157
Right now, members of Audiophile
are at a beach in Busan.

1340
01:19:00,957 --> 01:19:02,917
The ocean looks so beautiful.

1341
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:04,388
Hey, Jae Gyeong.

1342
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:06,957
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon Jin.

1343
01:19:07,098 --> 01:19:08,957
What do you want to become, Jae Gyeong?

1344
01:19:09,157 --> 01:19:11,167
I want to become a cool person.

1345
01:19:12,468 --> 01:19:13,444
- Yoon Jin.
- Yes?

1346
01:19:13,468 --> 01:19:15,367
You should become a star, not a reporter.

1347
01:19:16,608 --> 01:19:18,568
Joo Song. What is this?
Do you play the guitar?

1348
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:21,077
<i>The memories of you</i>

1349
01:19:21,438 --> 01:19:22,438
No.

1350
01:19:22,978 --> 01:19:24,207
What should I say?

1351
01:19:24,877 --> 01:19:26,117
I'm going to become a reporter.

1352
01:19:27,218 --> 01:19:28,593
- A reporter.
- How will you become one?

1353
01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:30,018
- A reporter?
- She's already good.

1354
01:19:30,218 --> 01:19:31,318
Hey, Jun Seo!

1355
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:34,358
Come on, Jun Seo. Smile.

1356
01:19:35,487 --> 01:19:37,487
Hey, you look really good on camera.

1357
01:19:40,398 --> 01:19:41,718
Isn't it nice to come to a beach?

1358
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:43,768
It's nice.

1359
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:46,268
It's so nice.

1360
01:19:47,398 --> 01:19:48,398
Jun Seo.

1361
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,367
What's your dream?

1362
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:55,407
My dream?

1363
01:19:58,008 --> 01:19:59,008
Just...

1364
01:19:59,848 --> 01:20:00,888
I just love hanging out...

1365
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:04,747
with you guys at Audiophile.

1366
01:20:40,657 --> 01:20:42,177
Isn't it heavy? I'll carry it for you.

1367
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:44,558
Thank you.

1368
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:48,657
We got to come back here
thanks to Jun Seo.

1369
01:20:50,697 --> 01:20:54,697
It has been more than 20 years,
but this place looks the same.

1370
01:20:55,098 --> 01:20:56,707
- Doesn't it?
- You're right.

1371
01:20:57,138 --> 01:20:58,138
That's not true.

1372
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:01,484
That hotel wasn't there,
and nothing was behind here.

1373
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:03,508
There's an apartment
and a few other new things.

1374
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:07,447
Also, the waves got stronger.

1375
01:21:08,117 --> 01:21:10,218
The wind is stronger too.

1376
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:14,617
The sand feels a bit softer too.

1377
01:21:22,098 --> 01:21:23,228
I miss Jun Seo.

1378
01:21:35,508 --> 01:21:36,537
What was that?

1379
01:21:37,048 --> 01:21:39,508
All of us sighed together.
It almost blew the ground away.

1380
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:45,587
What do you think Jun Seo wanted
at the end?

1381
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:50,388
To go back to the good old days.

1382
01:21:51,957 --> 01:21:53,258
When our friendship...

1383
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:56,228
was genuine.

1384
01:21:59,167 --> 01:22:00,487
That's how it is with friendship.

1385
01:22:01,197 --> 01:22:04,468
If you get obsessed,
you can hurt each other.

1386
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:08,438
When money and greed get involved,

1387
01:22:08,678 --> 01:22:11,848
it's no longer friendship.

1388
01:22:12,277 --> 01:22:15,077
Yes. Even if you start as friends,

1389
01:22:15,678 --> 01:22:18,278
you might start helping each other
and getting each other's backs.

1390
01:22:18,947 --> 01:22:21,117
It's common for friendships to go sour.

1391
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:24,627
But that's not friendship.
What can you call that?

1392
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:27,928
- A connection?
- "Connection?"

1393
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,527
Right.

1394
01:22:30,167 --> 01:22:31,268
Connection.

1395
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,167
How about our friendship?

1396
01:22:34,068 --> 01:22:36,428
I don't have to worry
about it becoming a connection, right?

1397
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:38,068
Us?

1398
01:22:38,337 --> 01:22:41,138
What power do we have
to turn it into a connection?

1399
01:22:41,638 --> 01:22:45,877
The best we can do
is talk behind our friends' backs.

1400
01:22:47,018 --> 01:22:49,148
Hey. Anyway,

1401
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:53,994
let's protect this pure friendship
Jun Seo brought back together.

1402
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:56,558
Let's promise to age graciously.

1403
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:59,457
Must our friendship remain pure?

1404
01:23:01,027 --> 01:23:04,944
Yoon Jin.
Can't we turn that friendship into love?

1405
01:23:04,968 --> 01:23:06,228
No. We can't.

1406
01:23:06,428 --> 01:23:07,438
We can't.

1407
01:23:08,237 --> 01:23:12,343
- Yoon Jin.
- Hey! Don't!

1408
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:13,837
- I'm just itchy.
- Are you itchy?

1409
01:23:17,947 --> 01:23:19,707
What did we do here back then?

1410
01:23:20,178 --> 01:23:21,617
Do you remember anything?

1411
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:23,617
We came up with something.

1412
01:23:23,787 --> 01:23:25,718
- What?
- Friendship Day.

1413
01:23:27,858 --> 01:23:29,933
- "Friendship Day?"
- You were the one who started it.

1414
01:23:29,957 --> 01:23:32,563
There's a holiday for parents
and children,

1415
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:34,433
but there are none for friends.

1416
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:35,534
Did I say that?

1417
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:36,997
- Yes.
- And?

1418
01:23:37,197 --> 01:23:40,367
You said we should make today
Friendship Day, so we did.

1419
01:23:40,697 --> 01:23:43,244
But you transferred schools,

1420
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,044
so we never got to celebrate it.

1421
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:47,713
What date was that?
When did we come here?

1422
01:23:47,737 --> 01:23:49,737
That's impossible to remember.

1423
01:23:50,678 --> 01:23:51,678
Right?

1424
01:23:52,678 --> 01:23:54,654
- What? No way.
- What is this?

1425
01:23:54,678 --> 01:23:56,593
No way. Do you really remember?

1426
01:23:56,617 --> 01:23:59,048
Actually, we came here...

1427
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:01,258
on my mom's birthday.

1428
01:24:02,657 --> 01:24:05,787
I went on an overnight trip with you guys
to Busan without telling her,

1429
01:24:05,928 --> 01:24:07,928
so she beat me up when I got home.

1430
01:24:10,197 --> 01:24:12,704
Right. Jun Seo remembered it.

1431
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:16,367
He visited me at the office during lunch
a few years back.

1432
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:20,638
"Joo Song, do you know what today is?"

1433
01:24:20,907 --> 01:24:22,584
So I said,
"Why do you remember my mom's birthday?"

1434
01:24:22,608 --> 01:24:24,024
He said no,

1435
01:24:24,048 --> 01:24:25,947
he came because it was Friendship Day.

1436
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:30,287
He came to see you...

1437
01:24:31,388 --> 01:24:32,848
on Friendship Day?

1438
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:34,688
Yes. Why?

1439
01:24:42,098 --> 01:24:43,303
- Just like that.
- Can you see it?

1440
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:45,003
Okay.

1441
01:24:45,027 --> 01:24:46,874
You're almost out of battery.

1442
01:24:46,898 --> 01:24:48,044
What if you run out in the middle?

1443
01:24:48,068 --> 01:24:50,037
- You can't charge it...
- Wait! Be quiet.

1444
01:25:04,747 --> 01:25:05,747
Jae Gyeong.

1445
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,258
What's Park Tae Jin's password?

1446
01:25:08,888 --> 01:25:09,888
Come on.

1447
01:25:09,957 --> 01:25:11,327
Hurry up!

1448
01:25:15,728 --> 01:25:16,728
Gosh.

1449
01:25:21,837 --> 01:25:23,068
That password...

1450
01:25:24,138 --> 01:25:26,458
The four-digit password
Park Tae Jin couldn't figure out...

1451
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:28,377
was 0-6-1-7.

1452
01:25:30,277 --> 01:25:31,608
It's Choi Ji Yeon's birthdate.

1453
01:25:37,018 --> 01:25:38,087
When's Friendship Day?

1454
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:39,848
- Hey! Wake up.
- What?

1455
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:41,117
Okay.

1456
01:25:41,388 --> 01:25:42,587
Is your mom's birthday...

1457
01:25:43,058 --> 01:25:44,787
really Friendship Day? Are you sure?

1458
01:25:46,527 --> 01:25:47,598
Yes, I'm sure.

1459
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:56,098
July 24.

1460
01:26:05,648 --> 01:26:08,048
You press it. I can't do it.

1461
01:26:08,848 --> 01:26:11,148
Hey, but do we have to do this?

1462
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:12,987
Just press it in one go.

1463
01:26:29,537 --> 01:26:32,114
No! These are the proceeds of a crime!

1464
01:26:32,138 --> 01:26:33,813
Then why do you look so happy?

1465
01:26:33,837 --> 01:26:36,484
No! Hand me the laptop.

1466
01:26:36,508 --> 01:26:39,553
- No, Yoon Jin. We must fight it.
- Fight what?

1467
01:26:39,577 --> 01:26:41,154
- Hey.
- Hand it over! Jang Jae Gyeong!

1468
01:26:41,178 --> 01:26:43,694
The battery is about to die.

1469
01:26:43,718 --> 01:26:45,194
Be quiet and hand it over!

1470
01:26:45,218 --> 01:26:47,294
- Yoon Jin!
- Jang Jae Gyeong!

1471
01:26:47,318 --> 01:26:48,664
No, don't touch it.

1472
01:26:48,688 --> 01:26:49,963
Hurry up and hand it over.

1473
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:51,334
This needs to be returned
to the national treasury.

1474
01:26:51,358 --> 01:26:53,258
- Hey!
- Be quiet and let go.

1475
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:09,808

1476
01:27:44,947 --> 01:27:47,747
