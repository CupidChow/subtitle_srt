80

81

82
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,290

00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,691
There's no one here by that name.

186
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,800
- What's going on?
- It's correct.

187
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,711
Wait. Please excuse me.

00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,081
There's a private elevator, right?

193

Yes. Please get it ready.

194
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,060
We're heading in.

195

You...

196
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,510
What are you doing here?

197
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,851
Shall we go?

198
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,081
What is this? What do you want?

199
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:49,991
Hey. Let go of me.

200
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,060
Excuse me. Please call the police.

201
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,060
What do you think you're doing?

202
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,300
Where are you taking me?

203
00:18:58,731 --> 00:18:59,707

Hey.

206
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,001
This is kidnapping.

207
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,111
Hey!

- Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

221
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,211
It's so nice to meet you again.

222

You don't have an accent anymore.

223

(Jang Jae Gyeong,
Could I call you back later?)

227
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,030
Why did you change your name?

228
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,630
Before my mother passed away,

229
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
she changed it
and told me to stop going to prison.

230
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,130
It was her dying wish.

231
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,847
Did the shaman say
you'd stop going to prison...

232
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:45,417
- if you changed your name to Dae Chill?
- Yes.

233
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,800
What? How did you know...

234
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
How did you open this place
as soon as you got out?

235
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,711
I started it
with my mother's insurance money.

236
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,150
Are you the car owner?

237
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,797
Where is this right now?

238
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,050
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

239
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,540
There were drugs in your car.

240
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,951
That really wasn't me.

241
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,567
You know I never touch drugs.

242
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,560
I know. I thought it was strange.

243
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,001
But it's still true
that there were drugs in your car.

244
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,236
Park Jin Hwan, that punk!

245
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,530
Park Jin Hwan? Who is that?

246
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:16,876
He's a friend from my hometown.

247
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,847
He said that if I got him a rental car
under my name...

248
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:21,040
he'd rent it out
and make 3,000 dollars a month for me.

249
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,547
That's illegal.
Did you really fall for that?

250
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:26,386
Someone out there
had the guts to con Straw?

251
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,341
Sir. I mean, sirs.

252
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,910
I swear it wasn't me.

253

My secretary...
She's a secretarial studies major...

255
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,837
whom I hired publicly.

256
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,390
Okay, I get that,
but that's the current situation.

257
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,506
I need you to ask around and figure out...

258
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,010
- who actually drove your car.
- What?

259
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,731
You need to prove your innocence.

260
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,341
I changed my name to avoid this.

261
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,810
Then...

262
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:02,010
can I go hard like I used to?

263
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,351
You'd have to, right?

264
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:06,420
But don't hurt anyone.

265
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,251
Well, okay.

266
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,650
I'll be in touch.

- What are you doing?

274

- Stop him.

- Yoon Jin!
- You can't go in.

Why would that Chi Hyun punk abduct you?

284

- Joo Song.
- What?

285
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,141
Shall we eat some beef?

00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,260
So what if it's not?

288
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:02,231
I can't take any more pills.

289
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,631

- It's me.

Yoon Jin...

295
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,137
was kidnapped by Oh Chi Hyun.

296
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,161
Where are you right now?

297
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,177
Why did you go off during a barbecue
to talk for so long?

298
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:39,971
I talked to Jae Gyeong.

299

He's coming.

300
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,280
Did you tattle to him again?

301
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:48,651
Darn it.

302
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,510
Will you tell me now?

303
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,421
Why did Chi Hyun take you there,

304
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:58,397
and why am I here grilling sirloin?

305
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:00,760
I need to know if I'm to taste anything.

306
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,570
How did you know that's where I was?

307
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,040
- Hyun Woo told me.
- Hyun Woo?

308
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:15,810
The teenager living at
the Audiophile address.

309
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,641
How did he know where I was?

310
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,310
I don't know that.

311
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,850
But he called and said
some guys had abducted you...

312
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,721
and had taken you
to Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

313
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:27,996
Was it Chi Hyun who kidnapped you?

314
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,526
What happened in there...

315
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,520
that made you conclude you wanted beef?

316
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:41,661
Are you insane?

317
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,370
What do you want?

318
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,570
What?

319
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:46,741
You lot can go, but bring two coffees.

320
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,840
I don't want a coffee, punk.

321
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,110
So,

322
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,921
I read what you'd been writing.

323
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
What?

324
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
You suddenly care?

325
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,790
The medication we supplied
to Woonjong Medical Center.

326
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,096
How did you know
there was a problem with it?

327
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,600
You think that's important right now?

328
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,661
You just abducted a journalist.

329
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:13,631
Do you think I'll let you off?

330
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,870
Will you let Jun Seo go?

331
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,741
He was in real estate.

332
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,270
What's this business card?

333
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,441
How will you explain it?

334
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,820
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

335
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,951
It's Jong Soo's job interview.

336
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,197
What?

337
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,496
If he's to become
Keumhyung Group's next chairman,

338
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,967
he has to turn
the failing Keumhyung Pharmaceutical...

339
00:26:42,991 --> 00:26:44,060
into a profitable company.

340
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,060
If he can't do that,

341
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:48,621
even as the only son,
his future isn't guaranteed.

342
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,570
What does that have to do with Jun Seo?

343
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:52,471
We were friends.

344
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,671
Jun Seo, Tae Jin, Yoon Ho, and I.

345
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,441
We all pitched in.

346
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,211
To make Jong Soo
the chairman of a large company,

347
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,751
we contacted cousins, in-laws,
and their cousins and friends.

348
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,850
We went to every person
we could think of...

349
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,320
to sell Keumhyung's medication.

350
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,860
That's why...

351
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:18,030
we all had business cards.

352
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:19,311
And Woonjong Medical Center?

353
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,731
There must've been
a designated salesperson.

354
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,671
We hadn't been able to supply
Woonjong Medical Center.

355
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,040
Jun Seo got us in...

356
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,770
because he'd met the director
at a gathering.

357
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
That was why...

358
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,751
Jun Seo went to so many events.

359
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,280
My investigation will reveal...

360
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,921
if you're telling the truth or not.

361
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
I don't think...

362
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:46,461
I can let this drop.

363
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,731
Now that you've abducted me,

364
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,070
are you going to make me vanish next?

365
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,310
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

366
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,467
What are these?

367
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,137
I prepared these because...

368
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:20,760
I had a feeling we'd meet like this.

369
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,806
I just saw how determined you were,

370
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,330
so one won't be enough.

371
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:25,961
I'll use both.

372
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,131
Gosh.

373
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:32,300
You're breaking lots of laws today.

374
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:34,141
Why?

375
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,870
Are you trying to buy me off?

376
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:39,810
Buying you off won't be enough, will it?

377
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,260
You got something very wrong about me.

378
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,510
The photos told me
I needed both a bribe and blackmail.

379
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,570
Hey.

380
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,911
How come
you're always photographed eating?

381
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:15,850
Which place was the best?

382
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,050
Joo Song.

383
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:24,251
What?

384
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,860
Today...

385
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,090
I miss my daughter even more.

386
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,800
Will you stop it?

387
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:38,901
You've had enough to drink.

388
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:41,800
Hey, Jae Gyeong.

389
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:50,411
You'll sit there?

390
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,560
How long was I out for?

391
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,370
During our school's summer break.

392
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:47,846
Where was that?

393
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,911
Jun Seo's mom's home.

394
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,381
- Busan.
- Yes, Busan.

395
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:54,411
Busan. And then...

396
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,080
What did we say we talked about?

397
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:00,820
Why she broke up with Jun Seo.

398
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:05,020
Yes. You fell asleep after that.

399
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Did he...

400
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,260
eat beef too?

401
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:16,401
He refused to eat meat
bought with suspicious money.

402
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:18,431
He didn't even touch his chopsticks.

403
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:19,741
Darn it.

404
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:22,741
You cold-blooded freak.

405
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,471
You cold-blooded freak.

406
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,026
Gosh.

407
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,421
Jae Gyeong, stop the car! Hurry!

408
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,790
Hey, Yoon Jin. Hang in there.

409
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,751
- Hey.
- I...

410
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:41,461
Are you okay?

411
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,161
Keep going.

412
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:51,100
Tissues.

413
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,340
I need some tissues too.

414
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:01,141
Hey, are you okay?

415
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,350
Jun Seo came to see me too.

416
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:14,891
He was standing outside my house.

417
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,590
Yoon Jin.

418
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:35,951
Are you feeling better?

419
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
About Yoon Hee.

420
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,830
I'm sure she went somewhere nice.

421
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,901
Right.

422
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,010
He stayed for about ten minutes in total.

423
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,840
Or maybe it was even less.

424
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:13,421
He just sat there without saying much
and then left.

425
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,190
I didn't even know
that would be the last time.

426
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,020
After I heard that Jun Seo had died,

427
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:27,131
I wondered,
"What did he come to tell me that day?"

428
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,270
'What was it..."

429
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,501
"that he found it so hard to spit it out?"

430
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,050
It made me think all sorts of things.

431
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,151
I wonder if that punk died
while knowing or not.

432
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:48,921
Hey.

433
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,820
Jun Seo's wife, Choi Ji Yeon...

434
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,991
She's hanging out with Park Tae Jin now.

435
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:59,030
She's making rounds with him every night
at all the motels throughout Anhyun.

436
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,060
How did you know?

437
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,901
I just happened to find out.

438
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,046
Isn't it the duty of a human being
to abstain for at least 49 days...

439
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,501
after your husband dies?

440
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,741
Who else knows about this?

441
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,370
I don't know.

442
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,161
I don't think the others know either.

443
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:20,280
Didn't Park Tae Jin kill Park Jun Seo?

444
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,421
That guy was acting weird
at the funeral too.

445
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:26,467
Hey, you should arrest him
and do some investigating.

446
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:28,120
You'll find something, at least.

447
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,967
What would I do after arresting
an acting prosecutor with no proof...

448
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,231
just because he had an affair?

449
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,940
Hey, what are you talking about right now?

450
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:40,270
Tae Jin killed Jun Seo?

451
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,340
It's late. Let's go.

452
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,080
No, I... Hey, I'm on the team too.

453
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:54,080
Why don't I know so much?

454
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:55,620
Tell me.

455
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
Pardon?

456
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:07,671
The most important thing
is to keep people's mouths shut.

457
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,570
Yes, take care of it and let me know.

458
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:16,301
Yesterday afternoon, at Keumhyung
Pharmaceutical research center,

459
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:18,810
Vice-Chairman Won went into shock
during his speech.

460
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,756
I've told the research center to take care
of things so that word doesn't get out.

461
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,911
Where is he now?

462
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,911
He's resting at home.

463
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,070
Darn it.

464
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,050
Dad.

465
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:00,951
I was...

466
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,961
not happy that you were my child.

467
00:36:08,721 --> 00:36:11,631
No matter how classless
your mother's blood may be,

468
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,177
you have at least half of my blood.

469
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:17,131
So, I expected you to have
at least one part of you...

470
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:20,671
that resembled me.

471
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,681
It's a flight for this afternoon.

472
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,211
(Won Jong Soo,
From Seoul-Incheon to LA)

473
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,850
Go...

474
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,461
and don't come back.

475
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,996
But...

476
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,860
Dad.

477
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:44,260
Dad.

478
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,391
I'm sorry, I...

479
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,401
I'll do better.

480
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,147
From now on,
I'll really stop doing drugs...

481
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:51,870
and do better, Dad. Please?

482
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,441
In order for Tae Jin to wrap this up well,

483
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,211
I should help him out.

484
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:59,171
I may not be a leader,

485
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,411
but you know
how I'm a great supporter, Dad.

486
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:07,451
So, please don't tell me
to go to the US, okay?

487
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,080
Please, Dad.

488
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,691
Meet with Mayor Joo In Sang...

489
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,461
and wrap up the licensing issue
as soon as possible.

490
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,991
That's where your role ends.

491
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
Hey.

492
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:52,161
Have you graduated from being
Won Jong Soo's driver?

493
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,030
I was worried
you might bring Jong Soo along.

494
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,731
What brought you here?

495
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:00,251
Was what you got yesterday not enough?

496
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:04,070
That's right. It was.

497
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Hey.

498
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:09,481
Hurry up and take it. My arm hurts.

499
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,470
You'll find that it's a bit short.

500
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,620
I got myself a comfortable pair
of sneakers.

501
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:18,620
Since you broke my laptop,
I ordered one with the latest specs.

502
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,996
And I felt like this money was
encouragement from a friend...

503
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,420
so that I could be a good reporter,

504
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,530
so I had some beef and soju.

505
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,631
And those pictures...

506
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,370
Send them wherever you want to.

507
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,641
I'm known in this field
for easily accepting what's offered to me.

508
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,340
Everyone will be tired of it.

509
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:44,911
Hey.

510
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,451
It would be worth a news article
if a giraffe ate some meat.

511
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,120
Who cares if a wolf has some meat?

512
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,461
I'm off. Gosh, that darn gorilla.

513
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:03,901
- You're here.
- Yes.

514
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,701
That punk is being so flippant.

515
00:39:08,241 --> 00:39:10,387
You didn't get any valuable information
all night, did you?

516
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,411
No, ma'am.

517
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,080
Gosh, seriously.

518
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,751
Do you want one too?

519
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,550
Thank you, ma'am.

520
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,100
Did you get anything else?

521
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:36,701
No, he keeps acting dumb.

522
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Captain.

523
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,317
We got the vehicle registration info
for the black SUV.

524
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,381
I sent it to you.

525
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:51,781
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.

526
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,136
(83P3234, black SUV, address of owner,
Join-dong Hongan-ro Fine Class Apartment)

Who is it?

(Calling)

533
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,910
I'm a security guard at this apartment.

534
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,071
What do you need to explain that...

535
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,040
- Excuse me.
- Who are you?

536
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,390
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong
from the Anhyeon Police Station.

537
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,556
On February 23, around 11:20 p.m.,

538
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,421
did you drive to Pilo-dong?

539
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:05,290
- Pardon?
- Last Friday night.

540
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,337
You dropped someone off
at a construction site...

541
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:11,121
near Pilo-dong
three-way intersection, right?

542
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,430
- No.
- Think about it carefully.

543
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,231
Last Friday night?

544
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:22,877
You mean the alley with the mill...

545
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,647
inside Pilo-dong three-way intersection?

546
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,711
- Yes.
- Yes, I was there.

547
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,317
Why did you go there?

548
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:30,751
That's my mom's place.

549
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:34,826
If you keep going past the mill,
there's an alley that comes to a dead-end.

550
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,496
The tile-roof house at the end
is my parents' house.

551
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,200
You went there
when it was almost midnight?

552
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:40,560
Can't I do that?

553
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:42,020
Why did you go there?

554
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,780
I went there
after fighting with my husband.

555
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,060
But then,
why did you stop there for a while?

556
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,100
- Where?
- In front of the mill.

557
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,806
You stepped on the brake
and stood there for about five seconds.

558
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,370
Didn't you let someone off there?

559
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,310
Oh, back then...

560
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,341
Someone suddenly jumped out
from an alleyway.

561
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,487
I was about to turn right
and someone suddenly jumped out.

562
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:04,151
I stopped because I was so surprised.

563
00:42:11,251 --> 00:42:12,866
I'll return this to you after we check it.

564
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,961
- When?
- Within a few days.

565
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,191
Okay.

566
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,430
Mister.

567
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,031
- Gosh, I couldn't help it.
- I was so surprised.

568
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,941
(Anhyun Shopping Mall)

569
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,720
(Antiques)

570
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,261
I told you not to leave anything out.

571
00:42:51,761 --> 00:42:53,361
But that's all you gave me.

572
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:58,430
- Come on.
- Okay.

573
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,071
You know this isn't enough.

574
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:05,071
Then, I'll buy more for you. Don't worry.

575
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,286
Buy us the good stuff.

576
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,341
Okay, fine.

577
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,011
Oh, is the next deal
the day after tomorrow?

578
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,680
Yes, that's right.

579
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,996
Okay. Prepare for it well.

580
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,281
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

581
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,790
Police, don't move.

582
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,370
Stay still.

583
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:50,520
Detective Kim,
how did you know about this place?

584
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:02,761
Just relax, guys.

585
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,140
What could've brought our Detective Kim
to this place?

586
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,881
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong.
Why did you get him addicted?

587
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,511
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong?

588
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,281
What, is he addicted?

589
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,460
I know everything,
so let's not waste our time.

590
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:24,921
Why did you do it?

591
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,790
I don't think you know everything.

592
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,490
So,

593
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:34,401
how is Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong now?

594
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,891
Has he ended up in the hospital
or something?

595
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,370
CEO Yoon.

596
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:41,240
It wasn't us.

597
00:44:41,901 --> 00:44:43,647
What would we gain...

598
00:44:43,671 --> 00:44:46,270
from giving Jang Jae Gyeong pills?
Don't you think?

599
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:47,511
Was it really not you?

600
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,640
No.

601
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:54,631
Where did you get
the Lemon Mulberry pills from?

602
00:44:56,381 --> 00:44:58,120
The wholesale dealer is Gong Jin Wook.

603
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,861
The guy who makes them
is called the Doctor.

604
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,421
I've never seen him, though.

605
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:04,691
Where is Gong Jin Wook?

606
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:07,261
I don't know that either.

607
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:09,401
CEO Yoon.

608
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,370
You're not doing as you promised me.

609
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:17,147
Didn't we promise that there would be
no more drug issues in Anhyun...

610
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:19,331
if we took care of
the Five Spider Gang for you? But...

611
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,511
You remember different from me.

612
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:28,281
That wasn't a promise.

613
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,520
It was a deal.

614
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,091
If it had been a promise,
it would've been free.

615
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,837
I've given you everything I should,

616
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:38,761
and you've got everything you should.
Isn't that right?

617
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,401
We'll deal with our business on our own.

618
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,540
If you get to know this field
too deeply as a detective,

619
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:49,841
it won't be good for you.

620
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,240
Jang Jae Gyeong was
acting up too much too.

621
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:58,611
Well, I don't have anything more
to tell you.

622
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,910
Why don't you give me something
while you're here?

623
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,550
Do you know someone called Kim Dae Sung?

624
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:05,366
I caught him
dealing Lemon Mulberry pills yesterday.

625
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,430
Isn't he one of your guys?

626
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,490
He's a guy who works for Gong Jin Wook.
A little guy.

627
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:12,731
I see.

628
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:16,561
Find out the whereabouts of Gong Jin Wook
and let me know by this week.

629
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,040
Kim Chang Soo.

630
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
Here's a month's worth...

631
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,750
of our business operating expenses.

632
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:45,761
And you find Gong Jin Wook on your own.

633
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
That's your job.

634
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,777
Let's call...

635
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,881
when we have stuff
to help each other out with, okay?

636
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,016
Don't keep coming to me
whenever you need something.

637
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Okay?

638
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:09,520
Why didn't I ask that?

639
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:11,191
Pardon?

640
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,961
That night.

641
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,060
When the Doctor called...

642
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,731
I was so excited
about making a direct deal...

643
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:26,246
that I didn't ask why we had to feed
Jang Jae Gyeong drugs...

644
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,501
and drop him off at a subway station.

645
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,511
I forgot to ask that.

646
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,880
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

647
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:05,040
Jeong Sang Eui.

648
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:16,890
Hey, it's me.

649
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,251
Yes, what?

650
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,890
The server found
in the murder case at the mill...

651
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:23,531
The NFS tried to save it, but...

652
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:25,361
they failed.

653
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,861
Thankfully, they didn't find anything.

654
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:30,301
That's good.

655
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:33,901
I'm meeting Mayor Joo In Sang
later in the evening.

656
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:35,071
What?

657
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:36,841
Today?

658
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:41,381
Why did you schedule it so suddenly?

659
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:43,140
It just happened.

660
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:46,331
That guy was making such a fuss
saying he didn't have time.

661
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:51,691
What should I say to him when I meet him?

662
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:53,471
What time did you say you'd meet?

663
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:55,091
At 8 p.m.

664
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,501
Okay, I'll go over to Pilo-dong
around 5 p.m.

665
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,930
Okay.

666
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:19,611
(Prosecutor's Office,
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin)

667
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:27,321
What are all these?

668
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:29,730
These are pictures of taxis
coming out of the alleyway...

669
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,830
on the day that
the mill owner was murdered.

670
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,560
- Taxis?
- Yes.

671
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:37,770
I was going to tell you before,

672
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:40,071
but I forgot to and left it out.

673
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:42,501
On the day of the incident,

674
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:45,941
Jang Jae Gyeong said something to me
at the crime scene.

675
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:48,786
The suspect will be a taxi driver...

676
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,180
or the accomplice will be a taxi driver.

677
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:53,496
What did you say?

678
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,890
Well, I'm not sure what made him say that,

679
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,890
but he said that with such certainty.

680
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,237
Well, I didn't look into it...

681
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,266
- just because Jang Jae Gyeong said so...
- Isn't it important to know...

682
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,490
what made him say that?

683
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,231
Yes.

684
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:09,401
So...

685
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:11,700
did you finish investigating?

686
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,540
I didn't find anything in particular.

687
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,171
Inspector Yoo,
is this what you came to tell me?

688
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:21,941
I thought I should...

689
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,080
report everything
related to Jang Jae Gyeong.

690
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,781
Jang Jae Gyeong said...

691
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,691
the taxi driver was the culprit
or at least an accomplice?

692
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,520
Yes.

693
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,830
(A drugless clean city, Anhyun)

694
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,441
You could just explain it to me.
Why do you always print things out?

695
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,531
What if someone sees?

696
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,240
It's just a habit from my job.

697
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,417
Mayor Joo In Sang got his bachelor's
at Seoul National University.

698
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:53,516
He received a government scholarship...

699
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,757
to get his doctorate in biology
at Stanford University in the U.S.

700
00:50:55,781 --> 00:50:57,727
And he used to be a professor
at a national university.

701
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:00,850
He went into politics in 2010
through Assemblyman Jang Jung Ho.

702
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,591
He's considered one of the bio experts
in the Central Party.

703
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:07,990
He's ambitious, and he's said to have
good administrative power.

704
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,020
What about his family?

705
00:51:11,131 --> 00:51:12,930
Nothing much.

706
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,930
- Weaknesses?
- I haven't found anything in particular.

707
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:18,071
But to pick one,

708
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,547
Mayor Yoo Eui Je in Hwansung,
the city nearby,

709
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:22,251
is aiming to develop
a bioindustry complex.

710
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,817
They were in the same bachelor's program
and the same department.

711
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,511
They're just one year apart.

712
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,040
But they're not close.

713
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,680
Using their rivalry to our advantage...

714
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,711
will be key to our strategy.

715
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,921
Does he like money?

716
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,220
Who doesn't like that?

717
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,397
Right.

718
00:51:43,421 --> 00:51:46,101
What happened with Vice President
Han Sung Hoon of Yigu Electronics?

719
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,060
He said he'd ask his father.

720
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,360
Then let's see how they react
instead of telling them everything today.

721
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:54,801
Okay.

722
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,281
- What do you want?
- What are you doing here?

723
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:09,450
I told him to come.

724
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,560
(Keumhyung, Tomorrow's solution)

725
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:28,491
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

726
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,520
(KH Pharmaceutical)

727
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,970
Park Jun Seo.

728
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:00,231
Did you kill him?

729
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,611
No.

730
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,941
You seem to know who did.

731
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,826
I don't.

732
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,421
Then why did you go to Pilo-dong...

733
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,751
on February 23, the day Jun Seo died?

734
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,620
I guess you know that I went there.

735
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:29,301
Then why don't you arrest me?

736
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,231
Are you not certain...

737
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,501
that I killed Jun Seo?

738
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,071
Are you playing games with me?

739
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,470
Why did you go there?

740
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,381
Jun Seo told me to come.

741
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,910
Jun Seo told you to come?

742
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:45,781
No.

743
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,751
Not just me.

744
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,251
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun.

745
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,421
He told all of us to come to that place
by 11:30 p.m.

746
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
What?

747
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,461
What are you...

748
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:03,131
saying right now?

749
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,901
It's just as I said.

750
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,150
The owner of the Pilo-dong mill.

751
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:09,071
Jeong Yoon Ho killed him.

752
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:12,970
You...

753
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,281
Are you insane?

754
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:17,781
Are you out of your mind?

755
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,381
Jong Soo.

756
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,281
I had no other choice.

757
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,156
There was a security camera there.

758
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,191
You...

759
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,160
Jong Soo.

760
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:30,961
Jong Soo.

761
00:54:31,761 --> 00:54:32,766
Hey, Oh Chi Hyun.

762
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,036
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him
to make sure he doesn't cause trouble?

763
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,780
Is this what you call
keeping an eye on him?

764
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:40,231
Oh Chi Hyun. You lied.

765
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:42,941
You knew, didn't you?

766
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,111
That he killed the owner.

767
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:53,711
Did you know?

768
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:56,821
Why didn't you tell me, you bastard?

769
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,151
You heard so today.

770
00:55:00,761 --> 00:55:02,881
If things go wrong,
it's not just me who will go down.

771
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:04,266
Do you think Won Chang Ho,
that cold person,

772
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,090
will throw me to the curb
and be done with it?

773
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,700
That'll be the end of you too!

774
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,270
How could you do this?

775
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,841
How can you call yourselves my friends?

776
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,841
Jong Soo. Calm down.

777
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:20,171
Come here.

778
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,481
- Jong Soo.
- Hey.

779
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,950
You...

780
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,781
Doing that won't change anything,
so calm down.

781
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,321
What were you doing?

782
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,591
What did you do
until things got this bad, you idiot?

783
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,060
Jong Soo.

784
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,761
Just kill this punk.

785
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,941
Just kill him and bury him
so nobody can find the culprit.

786
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,301
Okay?

787
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,501
Let's do that.

788
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:50,071
Let's kill him.

789
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:56,381
What I was most worried about
from the beginning...

790
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,370
was whether we were caught
on the security camera.

791
00:55:59,511 --> 00:56:01,481
Regardless of whether he did it
on purpose or not,

792
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,020
everything is gone
because the server burned up.

793
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,330
I looked into things with the police,

794
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,250
and they didn't even have evidence
to suspect Jeong Yoon Ho.

795
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:11,361
But...

796
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,731
What causes
our biggest anxiety still remains.

797
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,430
So let's kill him.

798
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:23,970
Chi Hyun.

799
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,870
Burying is the cleanest way, right?

800
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,341
Dead people won't talk.

801
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:31,251
Right?

802
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,421
I won't say anything.

803
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:38,990
I mean it.

804
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,620
I really live...

805
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,990
as if I'm dead.

806
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:45,691
Tae Jin.

807
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,631
Jong Soo.

808
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,176
I'll really live as if I'm dead.

809
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,200
I mean it.

810
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,071
- Jeong Yoon Ho.
- Yes?

811
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,381
I'm kidding, punk.

812
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,011
Get up.

813
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:09,620
It's not easy to kill a friend.

814
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,921
I don't want to make Si Jung a widow.

815
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:13,290
Right?

816
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,560
But...

817
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,160
Yoon Ho.

818
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,031
I'm going to keep my eye on you,

819
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,501
so let's move on from this incident.

820
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,870
Okay?

821
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,001
Okay.

822
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:34,441
Hey.

823
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:37,810
Make sure to keep this punk
out of my sight.

824
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,310
Don't even mention his name
in front of me. Got it?

825
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,950
Okay.

826
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,191
Get lost, you bastard.

827
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,817
Are you saying the phone records...

828
00:58:02,841 --> 00:58:05,040
with Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun...

829
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,516
left on Jun Seo's phone...

830
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,187
were calls Jun Seo made to tell them
to come to that place by 11:30 p.m.?

831
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,211
Yes.

832
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:12,511
Why didn't he call you?

833
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:14,931
There were no calls with you
on the record.

834
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,957
You weren't invited.

835
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:18,251
So why did you go there?

836
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,961
I was next to Jun Seo
when he called them for the last time.

837
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:23,720
You were next to Jun Seo?

838
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,237
Then did you also hear
what he said to Won Jong Soo,

839
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:29,021
Park Tae Jin, and Oh Chi Hyun
on those calls?

840
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:31,631
No.

841
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,016
He called outside of the car,
so I don't know what he said.

842
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,841
But I'm certain
that he called those three.

843
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,110
What are you planning to do?

844
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,660
What are you going to say to them now?

845
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,131
I want you to come...

846
00:59:02,031 --> 00:59:03,111
to that place at 11:30 p.m.

847
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:07,100
They won't just sit and watch.
It's too dangerous.

848
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:08,671
I still have to do this.

849
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:11,540
This might be...

850
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:13,611
our last chance.

851
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:21,520
So I went there at 11:30 p.m. too.

852
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,996
There was nowhere to park,

853
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,051
so I took a taxi
and got out on the main road.

854
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:35,551
(Say no to redevelopment
without the residents' agreement!)

855
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,640
I was about ten minutes early,
but I wasn't the first to arrive.

856
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:51,910
Who's there?

857
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,020
Jeong Sang Eui?

858
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,251
It's you, Tae Jin.

859
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,790
Did Jun Seo tell you to come here too?

860
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:01,660
Yes.

861
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,961
That looks like a switch.

862
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Will you flip it?

863
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:08,961
Okay.

864
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:18,970
That'll do.

865
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:34,821
What's this?

866
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,060
He called you to come too?

867
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:41,531
And Park Jun Seo.

868
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:43,700
Where was he then?

869
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:47,901
Upstairs.

870
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,270
"Upstairs?"

871
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,171
He was on the ninth floor.

872
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,716
Did you go to the ninth floor?

873
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,111
Did you meet Jun Seo there?

874
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,781
On the first floor.

875
01:01:04,691 --> 01:01:05,921
That's where we met.

876
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,770
(Beware of falling objects)

877
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:26,047
(Beware of falling objects)

878
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:27,071
But...

879
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:29,171
at the time,

880
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:31,240
no one saw it.

881
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,651
(Connection)

882
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,397
(April 2005)

883
01:02:46,421 --> 01:02:47,596
A one-month suspension?

884
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,620
(Notice Board)

885
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,567
(Disciplinary Committee Decision)

886
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:54,576
(For continued assault and extortion)

887
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,507
(Year 3 Class 6 Chae Kyung Tae,
1 month suspension)

888
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:57,531
Attention.

889
01:02:58,671 --> 01:02:59,731
Bow to the teacher.

890
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:01,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

891
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,317
Darn that punk Kyung Tae.

892
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:07,810
- Class president.
- Yes?

893
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:11,587
Tell Kyung Tae that even though
he was suspended,

894
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:14,651
he should come
to the teachers' office at least, okay?

895
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:16,881
He needs to graduate!

896
01:03:17,481 --> 01:03:18,551
Doesn't he want to?

897
01:03:19,691 --> 01:03:20,691
Okay.

898
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:25,160
The midterm exams start next week.

899
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:28,731
Study hard in preparation!

900
01:03:29,131 --> 01:03:30,107
Okay?

901
01:03:30,131 --> 01:03:31,301
- Yes.
- Yes.

902
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:34,941
Kyung Tae is such a pain.

903
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:38,886
I like studying in our club room
because it feels like a cafe.

904
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:39,910
- Right?
- Yes.

905
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,360
Will you stay until ten as usual?

906
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:43,111
I will stay,

907
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:45,651
but the music actually distracts me.

908
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:47,011
Do you want earplugs?

909
01:03:49,881 --> 01:03:50,881
Jun Seo.

910
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,996
Hey.

911
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,660
My tutor told me to come over
and study the chapter highlights.

912
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,131
Come with me.

913
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:03,060
I promised to study
in our club room with the others.

914
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:04,370
Jun Seo.

915
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,270
I'll come next time.

916
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,341
Let's go.

917
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,620
(Connection)

918
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:05,567
A resident saw the taxi
on the day of the murder.

919
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:08,477
We should look into all the taxis here.

920
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:11,731
Are we putting together
a joint investigation task force?

921
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:13,071
You're not...

922
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:16,446
asking me to pretend
to be a druggie, are you?

923
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:17,946
Where are you going? Hey!

924
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,587
Did they suspect anyone?

925
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:22,556
Someone reported seeing a driver
wiping blood off their hands.

926
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,957
Jun Seo killed himself.

927
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:26,587
Are you making an alibi for the others?

928
01:05:26,611 --> 01:05:29,539
Why would Jun Seo step up
and apologize then silence himself?

929
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:30,531
Who was it?

930
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:32,926
Jeong Sang Eui! Speak up!

931
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,620
I don't know. I really don't know!

932
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,196
It's your last chance. Tell me.

933
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:40,507
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Jeong Sang Eui. You were all together.

934
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:42,801
Did you know there was a camera?

935
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:44,337
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

936
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,100
I'm sorry.

937
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,501
Forgive me.
