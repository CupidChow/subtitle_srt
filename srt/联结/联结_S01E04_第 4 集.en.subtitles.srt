What's that?

3
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,611
Lee Myeong-guk…

4
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,030
Was he a member of our club?

5
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,919
Who was it?

6
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,338
Who threw the Molotov cocktails?

7
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,757
Someone who couldn't allow

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,260
Lee Myeong-guk's body to be discovered.

9
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,804
What if that wasn't it?

10
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,681
What if it was to get rid of us
for finding the body?

11
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,934
To get rid of us?

12
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,853
In any case, the link
between Lee Myeong-guk and Park Jun-seo

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,104
is Audiophile.

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,316
By the way, that photo…

15
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,069
It was as if someone wanted us to find it.

16
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,782
It was telling us to look into
a fellow Audiophile member.

17
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,327
After 20 years,
why Audiophile all of a sudden?

Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong!

21
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,457
I took it.

22
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,444
When was the last time you took it?

23
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,404
I can't remember.

24
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,033
Salute.

25
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,911
I'm here to review some CCTV footage.

26
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,164
Please write your name
and state your reason.

27
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,001
If you tell me the time frame,
I'll look it up.

28
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,168
Okay.

29
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,963
What time do you two get off?

30
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,256
We're on night duty, sir.

I forgot to congratulate you, sir.

00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,513
-Congratulations on your promotion.
-Congrats, sir.

35
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,597
Thank you.

36
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,600
Carry on.

37
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019

The last viewing was three days ago.

43
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,700
Hey, can you look at this?

44
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,372
This part here…

45
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,083
-Take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,670
The footage right here

47
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,925
skips from 8:27:33 p.m. to 8:52:16 p.m.

48
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,344
Why is there no video in between?

49
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,179
Just a moment, sir.

50
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,350
Oh, this…

51
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,811
This happens every now and then.

52
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,523
The camera was installed
when the power was a bit unstable,

53
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,942
so it'd turn on and off on occasion.

54
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,487
It's been fine after the power company
increased our usage…

55
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,114
Are you looking for something important?

56
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,782
No, not really.

57
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,951
I'll call them and take measures, sir.

58
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,788
-What do you mean by "take measures"?
-Excuse me?

59
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,957
Can this be recovered?

60
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,670
I won't know until I try,
but I'll do my best, sir.

61
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,715
So in the past when this happened,

62
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,051
were you able to recover it?

63
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,095
No, sir.

64
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh, is that so?

65
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,477
Finish up eating,
and keep up the good work.

66
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,729
Keep up the good work.

67
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,481
By the way,

68
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,361
did anyone else come today
to view the CCTV footage?

69
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,364
I thought you knew
when you came here, sir.

70
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,868
Inspector Kim Chang-su came by.

00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,552

00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,763
After the beep,
you will be connected to voicemail.

74
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,463
"Audiophile"?

75
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,216
That was the name of our high school club.

76
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,468
Park Jun-seo.

77
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,256
See you later.

78
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,399
Mom?

79
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,112
Excuse me!

80
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,122
What's your name?

81
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,665
Jang Seo-eun.

82
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,209
How old are you?

83
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,795
I'm six years old.

84
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,758
You're the same age as my daughter.

85
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,137
If she were here,

86
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,348
she could've been your friend.

87
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,438
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

88
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,192
Was my mom a bad person?

89
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,990
No.

90
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,825
Who told you that?

91
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,252
Can we identify the body?

92
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,004
Yes, we collected the DNA.

93
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,799
If the body was frozen,

94
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,801
recently buried,

95
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,763
and then taken back there…

96
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,226
That means it was buried
for a very short period of time.

97
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,978
That's right, sir.

98
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,772
Goodness.

99
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:51,400
It would've been good
to have at least one photo.

100
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,362
There were no CCTV cameras at the house,

101
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,989
so we're checking dashcam footage

102
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,158
from the cars parked nearby.

103
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,619
They couldn't have moved the body alone,

104
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,329
so I'm sure we'll find traces of them.

105
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,793
The killing, freezing,
and burying of the body

106
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,961
were probably done by the same person.

107
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:15,508
Whoever dug up the body
and took it back to Lee Myeong-guk's place

108
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,759
was likely someone else.

109
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,677
I agree it was a different person.

110
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,471
They wouldn't have buried

111
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,765
and then put back the body
just a few days later.

112
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,058
Right.

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,851
In that case,

114
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,813
it's highly likely the killer

115
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,690
was the person
who threw the Molotov cocktails.

116
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:37,571
If someone had dug up
and put back the body they'd buried,

117
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,951
they would've tried
to destroy it no matter what.

118
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,041
How did you know the body
from the house was Lee Myeong-guk?

119
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,460
I didn't definitively say
it was Lee Myeong-guk.

120
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,587
I said it was presumed
to be Lee Myeong-guk.

121
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,005
So on what grounds

122
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,134
did you presume it was Lee Myeong-guk?

123
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,011
I wrote it was based on
what a police official said.

124
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,640
Is that enough to publish this
as an exclusive about a murder case?

125
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,016
Is it?

126
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,185
There's no solid information.

127
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,813
Why are you so worried?

128
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,525
We don't see a case like this
in Anhyeon City very often.

129
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,736
If we chase after solid information,
we'll lose the exclusive.

130
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,199
You could've at least interviewed
your cop friend and put it in the story

131
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,826
instead of just saying "police official."

132
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,537
He's the type to sue us

133
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,581
for even referring to him
as a police official.

134
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,126
I'll publish the story for now
and follow up on it later.

135
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,297
Damn it.

136
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,258

00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,968
Ms. Oh.

138
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,930
Why didn't you tell him
you had plans to interview Lee Myeong-guk?

139
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,767
Then the director wouldn't have complained
about the lack of grounds.

140
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,852
And then what?

141
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,730
He would've told me
to include it in the story.

142
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,149
-Then what would happen?
-I don't know.

143
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,779
The suspect might mistakenly believe
I know a lot about this situation.

144
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,616
That person is capable of killing someone,

145
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,952
moving the body around, and burning it.
They might do the same to me.

146
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,915
Pretending not to know much
is the best way to survive.

147
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,752
Ms. Oh, about the lemon pop case…

148
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,962
I did my research on it.

149
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,382
That lady was in the middle of a divorce.

150
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,511
I don't know who initiated the divorce,

151
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,889
but she and her husband
frequently fought over child custody.

152
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,184
Everybody thinks she took drugs
because of the stress.

153
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,729
Their kid is six years old,
and her name is Jang Seo-eun.

154
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,814
-Her maternal grandmother--
-Let's drop it.

155
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,191
What?

156
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,819
Let's forget about lemon pop
and cover something else.

157
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,364
But we laid the groundwork already.

158
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,033
We just have to add something
for emotional effect,

159
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,660
so why should we drop it?

160
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,411
Jeez, I don't know.

161
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,580
Just forget it.

162
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,749
Follow me.
There's a medical malpractice case.

163
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,670
But you told me to investigate…

164
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,642
Where is it?

165
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,313
Chang-su also didn't sign the ledger
to view the security footage.

168
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,152
Does he know I'm addicted to that drug?

169
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,030
You told me to get here by 7:20 a.m.

170
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,952
My phone indicates
I texted Chang-su Sunday night,

171
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,328
but I have no recollection.

172
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,915
But it's easy to unlock my phone
with my fingerprint

173
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
and fake a text.

174
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,837
What if the person
who texted Chang-su from my phone

175
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,215
meant for him to get off
at Anhyeon City Station

176
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,385
instead of Jeonghoon Station
where the handoff took place?

177
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,471
Who could it be?

178
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,933
Who left me in front of platform 3-4

179
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,435
at Anhyeon City Station?

180
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,104
And why did they call
Chang-su of all people?

181
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:58,772
Was he in the know all along?

182
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,442
Even when he came
to wake me up at 7:20 a.m.?

183
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,486
On top of that,

184
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,948
the only person I told
about finding Lee Myeong-guk's body

185
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,283
was Chang-su.

186
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,577
Take down this address.

187
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:17,041
It's 63-38, 973 Inhyeon-ro,
Jangsu-dong, Anhyeon City.

188
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,294
Right after calling Chang-su,

189
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,004
someone threw Molotov cocktails.

190
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,464
In the master bedroom no less.

191
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,716
They started with the room I was in.

192
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,410
Captain, do you need something?

193
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,495
Not really.

194
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,822
Nothing yet?

195
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,450
Just search for medical malpractice
at Woonjong Medical Center last year.

196
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,743
What's taking so long?

197
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,622
Ms. Oh.

198
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,832
Am I a joke to you?

199
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,710
What are you mad about now?

200
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,630
First, you tell me to be bold
and finish investigating by today,

201
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,258
then all of a sudden,
you want to drop the story.

202
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,801
If you keep this up,

203
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,720
I'll burn out sooner than expected.

204
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,596
Who will you work with if I quit?

205
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,807
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,601
What's the reason?

207
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,021
Give me a convincing reason.

208
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,149
This morning…

209
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,111
I met their daughter, Seo-eun.

210
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,700
Let's drop the story.

211
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,998
The most recent medical malpractice
at Woonjong Medical Center

212
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,833
occurred three years ago.

213
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,376
The patient's name is different.

214
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,004
So we're the only ones who know of
the medical malpractice

215
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,214
from last September?

216
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,313
-Hello.
-Hello.

217
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,027
Who are you?

218
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,031
By any chance,
is this Ms. Park Bok-rye's residence?

219
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,159
That's my mother.

220
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,870
Oh, I see.

221
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,581
I heard a medication error occurred

222
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,875
while she received treatment
at Woonjong Medical Center.

223
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,710
Who told you that?

224
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,380
That's not important.

225
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,134
We'd like to hear more about it.
May we come in and--

226
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,720
I don't know anything. Please leave.

227
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,809
I know your mother has passed away,
but don't you feel frustrated?

228
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,355
-But…
-Wait…

229
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,273
Sir, just tell us what you know.

230
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,235
Once this story is published,
the hospital will compensate you…

231
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,489
Should we have brought some food?

232
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,283
Maybe he's upset we came empty-handed.

233
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,994
Let's ring the bell again.

234
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,918
We'll have to approach him differently.

235
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,509
What is it?

236
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,010
Yun-jin, what are you doing?

237
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,555
I'm working, of course!
I'm busy. What do you want?

238
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,099
Are you available around 5:30 p.m. today?

239
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,308
No.

240
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,895
Well, Ms. Choi called me
at around lunchtime today.

241
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,189
Choi Ji-yeon?

242
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,276
She has questions
and asked me to stop by her place.

243
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,486
She said to come at around 5:30 p.m.

244
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,864
But it's weird to go
by myself at that hour

245
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,366
now that the sun sets early these days.

246
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,411
She probably wants to ask you
about insurance matters.

247
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,495
Just go alone.

248
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,414
I asked if it was about insurance,
but she said no.

249
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,001
Jeez, just go and see what she has to say.

250
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:34,298
You look harmless enough to have over
even if she's alone at home.

251
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,592
Just take it as a compliment.

252
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,010
Fine.

253
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,094
Bye now.

254
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,850
-Let's go.
-Okay.

255
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
Who did you first get the drugs from?

256
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,359
I first got them from my friend's senior.

257
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,153
What's the senior's name?

258
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,406
I don't know his name.
He just told me to call him "sir."

259
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,200
-What about your friend?
-My friend?

260
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,579
He went back to the US.
That bastard is American.

261
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,914
Do you have the senior's number?

262
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,123
Yes.

263
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,751
That's Mr. Kang Min-ho's phone, right?
Hand it to me.

264
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,919
Here you go, sir.

265
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,715
Give him a call.

266
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,759
Tell him you need more pills.

267
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,762
Let's see this senior's face.

268
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,644
I don't think he'll answer

269
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,395
my call.

270
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,648
Then call him until he answers.

271
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,275
You need to prove he provided the pills.

272
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,238
If I prove it, you'll help me, right?

273
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,405
Right.

274
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,574
You're lying.

275
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,992
You didn't give me a pill that time.

276
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,535
What does this senior look like?

277
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,497
Tell me his height or anything unusual.

278
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,790
He's…

279
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,502
There's nothing special about him.

280
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,880
His height is average and…

281
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,009
Oh, wait.

282
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,222
He had tattoos on his fingers.

283
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
What kind of tattoos?

284
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,491
Boss.

285
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,493
Isn't this Doctor guy really weird?

286
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,247
How did he know
to give us the pills at the last minute?

287
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,500
If I'd known he'd do that,

288
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,252
I wouldn't have been so scared.

289
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,302
It wasn't Doctor.

290
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,470
What?

291
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,973
I couldn't wait
and ended up calling first.

292
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,309
Doctor?

293
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,643
It's me.

294
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,856
-I'm sorry for calling first--
-I guess it's been bearable

295
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,524
seeing how you're calling only now.

296
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,277
Let's resume business.

297
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,611
How many do you need?

298
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,364
I need 1,000 by the end of the day.

299
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,241
Very well.

300
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,539
The altered voice was the same,
but his style of speech changed.

301
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,125
He also didn't seem to know

302
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,169
that I broke our rule
of not calling first.

303
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,131
Then…

304
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,258
What's going on?

305
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,971
We'll have to wait and see.

306
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,173
-Captain.
-Yes?

307
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,300
I got nearby footage
of Mr. Lee Myeong-guk's house.

308
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,344
-Where shall we review it?
-Let's do it at my desk.

309
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,470
Okay. Just a moment.

310
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,270
-Inspector.
-Yes?

311
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:21,358
Remember the lemon pop pill we got
from the two kids we arrested yesterday?

312
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,693
-Yes.
-It's gone.

313
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,655
Look again carefully.

314
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,785
I left it in my desk drawer for a second
while I wrote up their reports.

315
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,911
Are you sure?

316
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,206
Why did you leave evidence in your drawer?

317
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,376
I don't know, sir. What should I do?

318
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,211
The captain will kill me if he finds out.

319
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,088
Did you request
an analysis of their blood?

320
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,798
Yes, I'm waiting for the results.

321
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,509
Follow me.

322
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,056
Captain?

323
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,558
Yes?

324
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,269
We have to tell you something.

325
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,478
What is it?

326
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,189
Remember the two kids from yesterday
who fought over lemon pop?

327
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,732
Yes.

328
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,986
Su-hyeon found it hard to go
back and forth from the evidence locker

329
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,114
while writing the reports,
so she left the lemon pop in her drawer…

330
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,448
And now it's gone.

331
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,120
I thought you knew
when you came here, sir.

332
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,997
Inspector Kim Chang-su came by.

333
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,542
Kim Chang-su, what are you up to?

334
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,503
It's gone?

335
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
What do you mean?

336
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,591
I'm sorry, sir.

337
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,970
It's one thing if it disappeared
because it got crushed.

338
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:35,307
But it's a drug.
If it's just lost, someone might abuse it.

339
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,559
Why didn't you store it properly?

340
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,685
You're right, but--

341
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,604
That's not the answer I want.

342
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,447
Did you check the CCTV footage?

343
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,244
No, sir.

344
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,080
I haven't either. I'm sorry, sir.

345
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,874
Did you get the suspects' blood?

346
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,085
Yes, sir. I also requested an analysis.

347
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,215
Then…

348
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,137
Change the record to say
that no evidence was found.

349
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,726
We can't hand the prosecution
a record with missing evidence.

350
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,187
Is there another way?

351
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,940
-No, sir.
-Be careful from now on.

352
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,567
I'll report this
to the section chief myself.

353
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,444
I'm sorry, sir.

354
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,154
This will never happen again.

355
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,614
You can go now, Su-hyeon.

356
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,117
Let's watch the footage.

357
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,786
Yes, sir.

358
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,458
Pull it up.

359
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,252
Yes, sir.

360
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,054
Maybe he's pretending not to know.

361
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,432
Maybe he covered for me

362
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,810
because he didn't want me
to get in trouble.

363
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,896
The cars that appear near the house
when the fire broke out

364
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,148
are this compact car and this SUV.

365
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,818
The second car belongs to my friend.

366
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,528
I was in it.

367
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,281
I see, sir.

368
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,285
Aren't you curious as to why
I left the crime scene in a hurry?

369
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,786
Of course, I'm curious.

370
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,871
That's why I called right away,
but you didn't answer.

371
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,582
I figured you had your reasons.

372
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,381
Did you get the ER footage
from Sunkwang General Hospital?

373
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,508
Yes, sir.

374
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,093
Why?

375
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,178
It was routine procedure, sir.

376
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,473
But how did you know, sir?

377
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,109
I wanted to see it myself,
so I called them.

378
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,570
But it was sent to you.

379
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,781
Yes, sir.

380
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,616
Continue.

381
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,702
Yes, sir.

382
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,080
As you can see,

383
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,125
the front and back license plates
of the compact car are taped over,

384
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,793
so we can't run them.

385
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,878
That's good.

386
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,546
No, wait.

387
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,632
The circumstances don't add up.
He's not just covering for me.

388
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,843
Did someone buy him off recently?

389
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,346
If so, who could it be?

390
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,599
They seemed aware of the CCTV cameras
when they went to the house.

391
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,768
There's another camera
at a different angle.

392
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,813
The compact car is
more visible in that one,

393
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,607
but we can't see the passenger.

394
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,526
Where does that direction lead to?

395
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,904
It connects to Yanghun-ro.

396
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,908
Then check the cameras near Yanghun-ro

397
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,577
and track down where that car went.

398
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,412
Yes, but that was during rush hour…

399
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,790
Still, Yanghun-ro has
a lot of CCTV cameras.

400
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,666
You can check multiple angles to track it.

401
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,003
That's true, but the cameras
are black-and-white and the darkness--

402
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,005
Just do as I tell you!

403
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,371
-You're here.
-Hello.

404
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,289
-Come in.
-Thank you.

405
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,582
I got this on my way here.

406
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,459
Thank you.

407
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294
-Do you like oranges?
-Yes, I do.

408
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm sorry for asking you to come
when you're busy.

409
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,592
No, not at all.
I had a meeting nearby that just ended.

410
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,885
I'm afraid I came too early.

411
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,096
Not at all. I came home early myself.

412
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,474
Would you like some tea?

413
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,269
Yes, anything is fine.

414
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,358
Gosh.

415
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,533
Hey.

416
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,980
Yun-hui's dad liked listening to music.

417
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
Right.

418
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,486
Back in high school, Jun-seo and I
were in the same music-listening club.

419
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,698
-I see.
-Right, what did you want to ask me?

420
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,242
My husband…

421
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:51,122
I'm unfamiliar with his financial affairs,
such as his accounts or insurance.

422
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,917
I heard there was a way
to check all that information at once.

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,001
Yes, there is.

424
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,588
It's Safe Inheritance One-stop Service.
You just have to sign up for it.

425
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,090
Do you have a laptop?
We can do it right now.

426
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,468
Yes, there's one my husband used.

427
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,554
Goodness, you could've just called

428
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,389
or gone to the community service center.

429
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,602
There's more than just that.

430
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,728
Excuse me?

431
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,606
To be honest,

432
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,151
I wasn't in the right state of mind
at the funeral.

433
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,904
Then I thought about how

434
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,157
this is about my husband,
not some stranger.

435
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,951
Okay.

436
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,870
Taking out insurance policies
means he paid insurance premiums.

437
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,165
So technically, he paid
those premiums with our money.

438
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,584
Right.

439
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,504
I don't know why,

440
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,341
but he left the death benefits
to Jae-gyeong and Yun-jin and not me.

441
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,510
And I'm sure he intended it.

442
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,264
One person is a police officer,

443
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,266
and the other is a reporter.

444
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,102
I think my husband set the bait

445
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,479
to help them uncover who killed him.

446
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:58,982
Bait?

447
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,361
I heard those two weren't even
that close to my husband.

448
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,199
So leaving the five billion won
to them instead of me

449
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,951
means it must be bait.

450
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,290
In the end,
I think he meant to leave it to me.

451
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,753
So I can't just sit and do nothing.

452
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,339
I deserve to know
how things are progressing.

453
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,468
And unlike those two,
you have no direct interest in the matter.

454
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,808
If you find out anything,
please let me know.

455
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,518
Sure.

456
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,771
I'll bring the laptop.

457
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,981
Okay.

458
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,166
ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY

459
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,876
MISSING
KH PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCHER

460
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,377
FOUND DEAD IN BURNED DOWN HOUSE

461
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,476
Did you see the article?

462
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,394
Yes, just now.

463
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,317
We need to come up with a plan.
Come to the Pilo-dong hideout.

464
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,112
Okay.

465
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,399
You're here.

466
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,152
What happened?

467
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,488
Why was Lee Myeong-guk's body
at his house?

468
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,115
Good question.

469
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,242
Hey, this involves all of us!

470
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,453
You couldn't even stop the autopsy.

471
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,373
Lee Myeong-guk was mentioned in the will,
but they just found his body!

472
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,791
How can you be so nonchalant?

473
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,419
-Jong-soo, this is--
-What?

474
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,879
If you're going to say don't worry,
then just shut up.

475
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,340
I wouldn't worry
if there wasn't anything to worry about!

476
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,592
Changing my mindset won't solve anything.

477
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,932
It's not bad.

478
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,354
Lee Myeong-guk being found dead
instead of missing isn't bad for us.

479
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,400
To put it bluntly, rather than
Lee Myeong-guk showing up out of nowhere,

480
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,153
this could be better for us.

481
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,696
This is just

482
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,241
a KH Pharmaceutical researcher
who died in a fire.

483
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,619
Nothing more, nothing less. Don't worry.

484
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,341
What's this?

485
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,093
Have a look.

486
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,061
PILO-DONG HOUSING SITE
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

487
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,979
The view here is always nice.

488
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,111
For me and the others,

489
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,406
the most important thing
is making you chairman of KH Group.

490
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,659
Jun-seo is gone now,

491
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,286
but our friendship remains the same.

492
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,748
I still believe you'll become chairman.

493
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,502
So, Jong-soo…

494
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:53,299
Let's not get anxious or rattled
over something as trivial as this.

495
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,191
How is the financial plan going?

496
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,151
I have to discuss it with Igu Group

497
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,653
since we can't do it alone.

498
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,864
I'll announce it at Friday's board meeting

499
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,324
and wrap up the financial plan.

500
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,161
I think there might be a need
for additional private investors

501
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,747
or funding from outside.

502
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,458
Why? Do you have someone in mind?

503
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,461
They might be willing if I ask.

504
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,880
Hey.

505
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,800
It has to be at least ten billion won.

506
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,760
Oh, are you talking about

507
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,346
your senior prosecutors
who have rich in-laws?

508
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,267
Tae-jin, this kind of project here

509
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,727
is a game played by people

510
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,605
who can afford to lose billions of won
but make it up tenfold later.

511
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,817
Tell them to know their place

512
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,070
and to focus on their jobs
instead of wasting time on this.

513
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,864
I wasn't referring to them.

514
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,534
I was wondering
if someone has ten billion won in cash,

515
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,120
we could accept their investment
regardless of who they are.

516
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,998
I just wanted to know
if you'd be willing to accept it.

517
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,458
Is that so?

518
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,547
In that case,

519
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,008
I'll consider it

520
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,677
if they bring me ten billion won
and beg with their head down.

521
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,061
Detective Park.

522
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,524
Did you find any CCTV footage
near the building where Park Jun-seo died?

523
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,110
-Yes.
-Can I see it?

524
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,989
If you ask Senior Inspector Yoo,
I'll show it to you.

525
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,116
Detective Park.

526
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,244
You know this is strange too.

527
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,038
The prosecutor doesn't want an autopsy,

528
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,081
and Senior Inspector Yoo
is barely investigating.

529
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,292
-I'm not doing this for the payout--
-Excuse me!

530
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,836
I don't know anything about that.

531
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,838
And I don't care.

532
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,095
Nothing came up.

533
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,975
Not even in the cameras
inside the construction site?

534
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,852
Detective Park!

535
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,021
Detective Park.

536
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,619
Here's the sketch
of the subway station handoff guy.

537
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,787
Please take a look.

538
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,538
WANTED FUGITIVE SUSPECT

539
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,756
Yes?

540
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,924
Turn on the computer.

541
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,558
Enter your date of birth.

542
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,190
From now on,
if you purchase Bitcoin from there

543
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,859
and transfer it to the electronic wallet,

544
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,445
the pills will be delivered the next day.

545
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,989
Collect the payment for yesterday's pills

546
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,824
and show me the shipping address.

547
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,079
TOWN VILLA, UNIT 302,
23 YEONGJI-DONG, ANHYEON CITY

548
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,581
That is all. Good day.

549
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,207
Hold on.

550
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,709
Just a minute, Doctor.

551
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,294
Yes?

552
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,298
May I contact you through this number?

553
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,302
If there's an emergency like last time…

554
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:13,100
You are allowed to call
one time after midnight.

555
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,268
Understood.

556
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,523
I said not to come here--

557
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,533
Tell me.

558
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,202
What's the password?

559
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,123
I'll ask one last time.

560
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,501
Tell me the password right now.

561
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,631
The password.

562
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,716
Give it to me right now!

563
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,237
Ji-yeon.

564
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,239
Hurry up and tell me.

565
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:55,077
It's the only way for both of us
to get out of this situation.

566
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,621
What situation?

567
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,750
The one where we had an affair?

568
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,211
Why?

569
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,088
Do you want to get rid of me now?

570
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,383
Those amazing friends of yours…

571
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,261
They thought
they were his closest friends.

572
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,471
Serves them right.

573
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,140
Now some random people
will be getting the payout.

574
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,517
Why did you ask for an autopsy?

575
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,769
You shouldn't have taken me
to the police station!

576
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,287
Give me ten billion won.

577
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,457
What?

578
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,958
Give me ten billion won first,

579
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,085
and I'll tell you.

580
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,467
Nothing good will happen

581
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,011
if your friends find out about our affair.

582
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,764
They won't let it slide.

583
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,559
They still called him class president
and practically worshipped him.

584
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,481
You're the bastard
who seduced their dead friend's wife.

585
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,193
Who knows?

586
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,905
Maybe that's why Park Jun-seo died.

587
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,324
-Shut your mouth!
-Stop yelling!

588
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,413
You said you won't leave your wife for me.

589
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,833
So give me something
to keep my mouth shut.

590
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,670
Isn't that how it works?

591
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,517
PILO TOWNHOUSE CONSTRUCTION SITE

592
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,784
Why this construction site of all places?

593
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,830
There are two other sites
within a 500 m radius

594
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,873
of Jun-seo's house and workplace.

595
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,752
Those sites are easier to access at night
since they're not on the main road.

596
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,214
What made him come all the way here

597
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,008
while avoiding CCTV cameras?

598
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,306
Hello.

599
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,725
Jeez, it's cold today.

600
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm from Anhyeon Police Station.

601
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,895
Is the site manager here?

602
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,774
That would be me.

603
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,319
The police have finished
their investigation.

604
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,695
I'm aware of that.

605
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,947
But I need to check a few more things.

606
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,742
There are CCTV cameras on site, right?

607
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,202
No, there aren't.

608
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,247
Don't you install cameras
to prevent theft of materials?

609
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,916
We only have one at the front gate.

610
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,461
There's nowhere
to install any at the actual site.

611
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,047
I'll check the front gate footage then.

612
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,008
Where can I see it? Right here?

613
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,843
Jeez.

614
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,400
Where is the other entrance?

615
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,778
This is the only one.

616
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,613
So many people steal

617
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,908
scrap metal and wires
at construction sites these days

618
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,327
that we made it impossible
for anyone to enter otherwise.

619
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,038
Was the front gate locked
on the day the body was found?

620
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,706
Of course.

621
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,500
I unlocked it myself that morning.

622
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,586
-Then how did that person get in?
-What?

623
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,838
You said the site's impossible
to enter otherwise.

624
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,048
The gate was locked,

625
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,384
and there's no sign of anyone
coming and going on camera.

626
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,968
So how did the man get in?

627
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,971
How should I know?

628
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,641
The police thought
he used the building next door.

629
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,477
Who commits suicide
by climbing the wall of the next building?

630
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,273
Did the police really see this footage
when they investigated?

631
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,401
-Yes.
-Let's go then.

632
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,069
-Excuse me?
-Let's go to the station,

633
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,279
write a report,
and start the investigation over.

634
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,575
Come on, detective.
Why are you doing this?

635
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,620
-Can I drink this water?
-Yes, of course.

636
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:11,250
We couldn't work these past few days
because of this incident.

637
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,085
We're in a tight spot here.

638
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,422
There's another entrance, right?

639
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,051
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT

640
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,054
We made a shortcut for the workers
so they could easily go

641
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,973
and eat their meals.

642
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,642
He must've come through here.

643
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,311
But not many people know of this.

644
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,524
So, may I go now?

645
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,068
Yes.

646
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,661
That entrance is blocked now.

647
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,009
So you're a cop.

648
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,845
Did a lot of people
use that entrance before?

649
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,388
Yes, of course.

650
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,557
Everyone used it during lunchtime.

651
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,101
But since that incident a few days ago,

652
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,563
they blocked the entrance.

653
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,647
How much?

654
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,774
Just give me 10,000 won.

655
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,901
Thank you.

656
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,821
-The police haven't been here, right?
-Right.

657
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,324
I thought they stopped investigating
when they said it was suicide.

658
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,160
But here you are.

659
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,538
Where's that CCTV camera?

660
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,500
It's under the awning.

661
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,214
GOOD FORTUNE RICE MILL

662
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,656
Sir, can I see the CCTV footage?

663
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,449
Preferably from February 23rd.

664
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,076
You're in luck.

665
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,577
I was about to delete old files.

666
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,933
-Hey, Yun-jin.
-Where are you?

667
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,393
I'm on my way home.

668
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,520
What?

669
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,273
Weren't you coming
to Jun-seo's by 5:30 p.m.?

670
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,483
I already talked to her and then left.

671
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,989
I wanted to see if Ms. Choi was okay,

672
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,324
so I rushed over here, but…

673
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,493
I'll head back over there then.

674
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,413
Hey, forget it.
There's no need to come back.

675
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,874
So why did she call you?

676
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,129
She asked about
Jun-seo's insurance and inheritance--

677
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,922
Hey, hold on.

678
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,090
I'll call you back.

679
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,770
Oh, jeez.

680
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,250
HAPPY CHANGES,
A NEW ANHYEON CITY

681
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,266
Please pause here.

682
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,812
I need a photo of the license plate.

683
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,652
Please continue.

684
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,617
Just a moment.

685
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,506
Why on earth did you come here, Jun-seo?

686
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,809
How are you connected to drugs?

687
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,400
Can we continue, please?

688
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,866
It's 10:56 p.m.

689
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,078
The estimated time of death
is between 11:30 p.m. and midnight.

690
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,205
But he got to the scene 30 minutes prior.

691
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,458
Why?

692
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,418
Would you like to see more?

693
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,919
Yes.

694
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,507
Right there.

695
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,737
Are there any other CCTV cameras outside?

696
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,157
No, that's the only one around here.

697
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,208
I'll copy the rest and take a closer look.

698
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,308
Goodness.

699
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,976
It was probably a cat.

700
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,743
Well, this is…

701
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,870
-I'll take my rice cakes.
-Sure.

702
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,330
It's not much,

703
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,624
but I backed up some files in this.

704
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,585
You can take it with you.

705
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,920
No, it's okay. I need all of the footage.

706
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,380
I'll be right back.

707
00:52:56,256 --> 00:53:00,093
Goodness, I installed it
to catch the construction workers

708
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,761
who keep parking illegally.

709
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,223
Who knew that footage would be so popular?

710
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:07,809
Excuse me?

711
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,020
This was a while back,

712
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:14,900
but some man came and asked
to see the footage just like you.

713
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,277
He asked if he could make a copy of it.

714
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,404
So I told him to go ahead.

715
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,698
When was that? Was he a cop?

716
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,825
No, he wasn't a cop.

717
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,661
I don't remember exactly when,

718
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,080
but I guess it's been six months.

719
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,333
Did he leave a contact number?

720
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,417
I'm not sure.

721
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,672
When I gave him a copy,

722
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,383
he came back after a few days to thank me

723
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,886
and left me this.

724
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,516
KH PHARMACEUTICAL

725
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,316
Do you see

726
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,611
the man in any of these pictures?

727
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:02,530
I'm not sure.
It's been so long I can't remember.

728
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,325
Hold on.

729
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,870
It's this person.

730
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,749
Oh, that's right.

731
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,460
He's the same one
who got out of the taxi in the footage.

732
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,171
I knew he looked familiar.

733
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,924
This is the person who copied the footage.

734
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,303
Goodness, I guess he passed away.

735
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,623
2 HOURS
AFTER PARK JUN-SEO'S DEATH

736
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,677
Goodness, that was quick.

737
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,473
Jeez.

738
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,641
How are you doing? What can I get you?

739
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,143
Hello.

740
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,257
Sir?

741
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,356
Sir? Sir!

742
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,128
Sir.

743
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,337
Sir.

744
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,635
Let's get out of here.

745
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,747
Are you free after cram school?

746
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,625
Hey, Yun-jin.

747
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,711
I just finished and left.

748
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,920
Really?

749
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,673
I have something to tell you in person.

750
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,927
I'm near the playground.
Can you come here?

751
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:54,804
Okay, I will.

752
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:02,729
Oh Yun-jin!

753
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,441
Why did you run here?

754
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,026
Just because.

755
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,569
Here.

756
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,036
So…

757
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,330
What do you want to tell me?

758
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,251
Actually, Jun-seo…

759
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,301
He asked me to be his girlfriend.

760
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,057
I told him I just wanted to be friends,

761
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,141
but he said no.

762
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,523
Even if I date Jun-seo,

763
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,358
we'll still be friends, right?

764
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,945
When friends end up dating each other…

765
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,656
I'm just worried we'll grow apart.

766
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,491
What about you?

767
00:58:58,826 --> 00:58:59,869
How do you feel?

768
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,709
Jun-seo…

769
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,337
Do you want to date him?

770
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,386
I'm thinking about it.

771
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,433
I'm really not sure.

772
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,606
Why are you asking me?

773
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,318
If you want to date him, do it.

774
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,532
You think so?

775
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,082
Then I'll assume this won't affect
us Audiophile friends.

776
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,754
I'll see you later.

777
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:03,474
Audiophile…

778
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,226
friends?

779
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,157
Hey.

780
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,118
Yun-jin asked to see you yesterday, right?

781
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,123
I just decided
to be satisfied with being friends.

782
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,044
Are you okay?

783
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,798
Why wouldn't I be?

784
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,053
Hey, aren't you hungry?

785
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,680
We're having tteokbokki. Come with us.

786
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:43,848
Shall I?

787
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,687
Jang Jae-gyeong.

788
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,690
Come on, let's go.

789
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:18,883
Hey, wait up!

790
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,221
Hurry up.

791
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,180
It was a taxi.

792
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,350
Then the taxi driver must be the culprit
or at least an accomplice.

793
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,269
Can you tell me
who was driving at the time?

794
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,855
Jae-gyeong beat me to the punch.

795
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,858
-Hey!
-Did Jang Jae-gyeong see that footage?

796
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,443
If you guys keep this up,

797
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,361
how can I trust you and get work done?

798
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,530
This case isn't about
the insurance payout.

799
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,908
If you keep accompanying me,
they'll target you too.

800
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,993
Worry about yourself.

801
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,328
It's too late for me to stop now.

802
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,205
-Excuse me?
-You know Park Jun-seo, right?

803
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,458
Jang Jae-gyeong and Oh Yun-jin. Follow me.

804
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,710
-Do you deliver drugs too?
-If what you say is true,

805
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,838
-that means Jun-seo dealt drugs.
-What are you looking for?

806
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,048
If you'd tried even a little bit
to understand Jun-seo…

807
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,010
This murder case
is related to Park Jun-seo.

808
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,803
Was your friend, Park Jun-seo, a druggie?

809
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,639
Park Jun-seo's case
is no longer a suicide case.

810
