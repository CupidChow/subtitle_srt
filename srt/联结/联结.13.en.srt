1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:04,890
(Connection)

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:09,754
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:11,288
Lee Myung Guk met Jeong Sang Eui
regularly at a lab...

4
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,208
in Pilo-dong and did something.

5
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:16,360
What they made then was Lemon Mulberry?

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,255
At first, they'll have made
small batches just for Jong Soo.

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,807
Lee Myung Guk manufactured it,
Jun Seo delivered it,

8
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,157
and Jong Soo took it?

9
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,290
What about now that Jun Seo is dead?

10
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,494
Who's delivering Jong Soo's supply,

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,404
and who's running
the Lemon Mulberry business...

12
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:31,239
Tae Jin used to?

13
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:32,170
Doctor, it's me.

14
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:34,302
I killed CEO Yoon.

15
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,326
I need you to get me on a boat to China.

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,859
I'm not asking for a free ride.

17
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:40,135
I'll send you two items
via subway courier very soon.

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:40,314
(The USB delivered)

19
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,844
I'm sending them believing
they'll be of some value to you.

20
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,562
(The Doctor was Jeong Sang Eui)

21
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:46,581
(Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin meet Sang Eui)

22
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:47,605
Are you the Doctor?

23
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,317
Fasten your seat belt if you want to know.

24
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,790
(Sang Eui brought them into the Cold Storage)

25
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,405
(He takes them inside the laboratory
where Lemon Mulberry was created)

26
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,875
I made the Lemon Mulberry.

27
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,655
I was the one who got you hooked
on Lemon Mulberries.

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,762
What did I do to you
that you got me addicted to drugs?

29
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:03,531
I thought,
"Sure, Jae Gyeong is so great,"

30
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:05,857
"he'll be able to avenge Jun Seo."

31
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:08,213
I meant for you to arrest Gong Jin Wook
and then find CEO Yoon through him.

32
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:10,838
Then, you'd find me, the Doctor,
and then Park Tae Jin.

33
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,173
That was my plan...

34
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,194
with No Gyu Min.

35
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:15,465
Is the taxi driver who drove Jun Seo
to the construction site, isn't it?

36
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,211
Ask him yourself.
I'm sure you'll meet him soon.

37
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:18,481
Manpyeong Port at 4:00 a.m.,
two days from now.

38
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,453
You can make a stop
in Boryeong before then.

39
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:21,791
That grandma who is receiving the pension?

40
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,626
Let's do it.

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:22,960
(Meanwhile, the Pilo-dong Development is fast developing)

42
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:23,775
Okay. Thank you.

43
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,149
(Meanwhile, the Pilo-dong Development is fast developing)

44
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:26,487
Didn't I tell you it would go well?

45
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:27,773
You worked hard.

46
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:28,098
(Won Chang Hho acknowledges Jong Soo)

47
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,879
The future chairman of Keumhyung Group...

48
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,551
can't rely on drugs for too long.

49
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,580
You were a drug dealer.

50
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:37,351
How can you plan and construct
the future of Keumhyung Group?

51
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:37,674
(He gives up Tae Jin who doesn't follow him)

52
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:41,522
The biggest risk this project has
isn't Joo In Sang or Jong Soo.

53
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:42,964
It's you.

54
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:43,175
(He gives up Tae Jin who doesn't follow him)

55
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,339
Hello, it's the police.

56
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,476
(Yoon Ho was being chased by the police)

57
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:48,275
(He received a voice message)

58
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,641
The police are pretty sure...

59
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:52,829
Yoon Ho's guilty of murdering
Lee Myung Guk and the mill owner.

60
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,282
If the police keep digging,

61
00:01:54,306 --> 00:01:55,396
it'll lead to you.

62
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,748
(It was the voice of Tae Jin, plotting to kill him.)

63
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:56,397
Jeong Yoon Ho.

64
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,086
He's too much of a risk.

65
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,470
(It was the voice of Tae Jin, plotting to kill him.)

66
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,654
(Text that arrived soon after)

67
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:03,318
(Yun Ho goes straight to Ji Yeon to find evidence)

68
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:05,342
I heard the evidence that shows
you killed Jun Seo with Tae Jin...

69
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:06,527
is here.

70
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,929
What do you mean?

71
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,303
(Just in time, Jae Gyeong and the police arrived)

72
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:12,767
Jeong Yoon Ho escaped
via the emergency stairs.

73
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:13,835
Request support
from the nearby patrol unit.

74
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:15,069
Jong Soo help me out.

75
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,344
I need you to scare Tae Jin.

76
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,998
What if I can't do that?

77
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,741
I'll have to tell the world you got
Lee Myung Guk to make you a drug,

78
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,059
and when he blackmailed you,

79
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,646
you got me to kill him.

80
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,664
I got the point. Let's talk in person.

81
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,389
(But it was Jong Soo's trap)

82
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:27,982
Jong Soo.

83
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,216
(But it was Jong Soo's trap)

84
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Chi Hyun, no!

85
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,264
(Episode 13)

86
00:02:58,755 --> 00:02:59,985
What took you so long?

87
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:01,384
Where's the drug?

88
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:24,604
Is it Jeong Yoon Ho?

89
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:26,415
Yes.

90
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,074
Who reported it?

91
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,115
They didn't want to reveal their identity.

92
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:31,854
They only reported the location
where the body was found.

93
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:34,884
From their voice, we presume them
to be in their 50s or 60s.

94
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,425
- Did you track the number?
- It was a payphone.

95
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:39,894
A case like this means...

96
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,865
they witnessed the body get buried, right?

97
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,065
They likely saw the face of the criminal.

98
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:45,994
Check all the security cameras
around the area.

99
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,195
Okay.

100
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,505
This isn't by a hiking trail.

101
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,104
What was the witness doing here?

102
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,345
I found a shoe here!

103
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:16,395
This shoe.

104
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:18,394
Compare it to the footprints
from the mill murder.

105
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:19,494
Okay.

106
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:24,305
What's that?

107
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:30,805
Isn't this a mono maple tree sap pouch?

108
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,014
This is what the caller came here for.

109
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,134
(Speed)

110
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,854
The biggest risk this project has
isn't Joo In Sang or Jong Soo.

111
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:06,724
It's you.

112
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,465
All you merely had were ten cows.

113
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,254
Your family couldn't even afford
to feed them.

114
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,604
I took their only son...

115
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,745
and poured my money into him
to turn him into a human.

116
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:21,745
What a work of art you've become.

117
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,335
(Won Jong Soo)

118
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,555
Hey, Jong Soo.

119
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:37,254
Where are you?

120
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:39,465
At the gym. Why?

121
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,825
You're trying hard to live long.

122
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,865
Let's drink to celebrate a good day.

123
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,434
Weren't you with Han Sung Hoon?

124
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,404
It's odd how I don't feel like
hanging out with him.

125
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,205
Come to Pilo-dong.

126
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:53,504
Well,

127
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,365
I'd like the night off. See you tomorrow.

128
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,515
Tae Jin.

129
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,045
Be there.

130
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,045
I have something to say.

131
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:04,955
Okay. I'll be there.

132
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,235
Who do you think killed Jeong Yoon Ho?

133
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,444
Right now, I suspect everyone.

134
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:30,015
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
and Oh Chi Hyun.

135
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,914
Why are all your friends so messed...

136
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,184
But then...

137
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,654
I'm not in the position to say that.

138
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,325
What do we do about Chang Soo?

139
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:44,924
Let's look into it quietly.

140
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:46,451
Who can we ask?

141
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,625
Soo Hyun.

142
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,534
Are you sure?

143
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,615
She's close to Chang Soo.

144
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,205
She can separate work and friendship.
It'll be fine.

145
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,275
What about tomorrow's Manpyeong Port raid?

146
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,404
Do we take Chang Soo?

147
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:03,315
We made it look like one of us
was leaving with Gong Jin Wook.

148
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,295
We need someone
Gong Jin Wook doesn't know...

149
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,815
to go undercover.

150
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,255
Let's take him.

151
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,715
I feel bothered.

152
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,385
I can't read him anymore.

153
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,294
It's not for sure yet.

154
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:24,115
(Connection)

155
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,484
Hey.

156
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,625
What's going on?

157
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:52,825
Did you sell drugs behind my back?

158
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,594
Darn you.

159
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:03,075
I didn't know you were such a backstabber.

160
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,674
On his knees.

161
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:12,570
I heard a lemon-colored pill
was all the rage,

162
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:14,484
and I really wanted to try it.

163
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,085
It was
"made in Keumhyung Pharmaceutical."

164
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,224
This punk said...

165
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,094
it was made with
the same raw materials as mine.

166
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,395
If you got caught,

167
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:29,644
were you going to reveal
the manufacturing lab,

168
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:30,965
put the blame on me,

169
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,734
and get off scot-free, you psycho?

170
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:37,974
We should've killed him, not Yoon Ho.

171
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,145
Hey. Because you came from...

172
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,715
a family that had nothing,

173
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,844
I thought you'd have
a sense of justice that I didn't.

174
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,525
But what are you really?

175
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:54,975
What was in this head of yours...

176
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,924
that you'd do something so darn sneaky?

177
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,755
Hey.

178
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,424
Why...

179
00:09:01,144 --> 00:09:02,565
do you think...

180
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:05,335
I did everything you said...

181
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,664
without a complaint?

182
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,034
Because we were friends?

183
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,174
You know better than anyone
it's not that, you dirtbag.

184
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:17,844
So what?

185
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,244
Hey.

186
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:20,885
If we take away the fact...

187
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:25,385
you're the heir to Keumhyung Group,
you're nothing at all.

188
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,805
You're stupid and have no guts.

189
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,395
All you have is greed.

190
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,195
If it hadn't been for your father,

191
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:34,125
I'd have made it so you could
never look me in the eye.

192
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:39,565
Oh Chi Hyun.

193
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:41,164
What are you doing here?

194
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,425
You were the best fighter
in all of Anhyun.

195
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,844
Why do you work for the likes of him?

196
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,604
Because of your outstanding friendship?

197
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,575
Aren't you in it for the money too?

198
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:59,385
Park Tae Jin.

199
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:00,955
Did that hurt?

200
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:03,574
I heard you couldn't breathe
if you got hit in that spot.

201
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,794
Did that hurt? Did it?

202
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,625
I'll kill you.

203
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,294
So,

204
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:13,265
do you feel better now that
you've spoken your mind after 20 years?

205
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:14,465
Hey.

206
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,505
What do you think that changes?

207
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,304
Nothing changes.

208
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,565
Does it change the fact
that you sold drugs...

209
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,744
or that I'm filthy rich?

210
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:27,215
Where's the cash?

211
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,515
Where's the money you made
from selling my stuff?

212
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:34,185
Zero, six, one, seven.

213
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,420
What?

214
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,354
Zero, six, one, seven.

215
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,265
That's the first half of the password.

216
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:45,594
I don't know the other half. Why?

217
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:50,734
Because Park Jun Seo took it to the grave.

218
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,024
What are you on about?

219
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,725
Tell it to me straight.

220
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,044
That money!

221
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,844
No one can get it out.

222
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:03,185
No one can get it
unless Jun Seo comes back to life!

223
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,415
Do you get it?

224
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,420
Hey.

225
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:11,594
Darn you!

226
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,494
Is that true?

227
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:16,935
Is Jun Seo the only one
who knows the other half of the code?

228
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,504
This happened because you and Jun Seo...

229
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:30,215
called each other friends
and tried to work as equals.

230
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,144
This is why hierarchy is important!

231
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,384
Why did you two morons
have to split that precious code?

232
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,285
You're laughing?

233
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:45,594
Jong Soo.

234
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,195
Who do you think...

235
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,864
was superior?

236
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,134
Go and get the pills.

237
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,445
What?

238
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,354
You sold the stuff...

239
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,514
without knowing what happened
when you took it, right?

240
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:07,045
You should taste whatever it is
you're selling.

241
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,085
Get it now!

242
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,535
What are you going to do, Jong Soo?

243
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:14,285
Film him taking the drug.

244
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,524
Film his eyes glaze over...

245
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:19,295
and him crawling and groveling for more.

246
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,325
That will stop him
from pulling something like this again.

247
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:26,935
Get the stuff.

248
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:30,835
Darn it.

249
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:37,945
That goes for you too.

250
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:42,484
Hey. You should've reported to me first.

251
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,185
I pay you, so how dare you
wag your tail for someone else?

252
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,195
I'll let you taste what you made too.

253
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,165
Tae Jin.

254
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:02,535
You know,

255
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,905
I wouldn't be friends with you
if it weren't for my old man.

256
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:11,315
Punks who act out
because they have brains?

257
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,445
I hate them.

258
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:16,035
It was always,

259
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:17,785
"What did Tae Jin say?"

260
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:20,175
"Do as Tae Jin says."

261
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,685
"Learn from Tae Jin."

262
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,295
I was just sick of it.

263
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:27,665
But you know,

264
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:29,594
I did my best...

265
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,134
to try to get on with you.

266
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,675
Knowing that someone smart like you...

267
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,774
did my bidding...

268
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,844
was pleasing sometimes.

269
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,644
But your crucial mistake was...

270
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:50,285
You tried to become me.

271
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:55,155
There's only one Won Jong Soo
who's the son of Won Chang Ho!

272
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:01,094
That's why you ended up
in this state today. Get it?

273
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,935
It's in the Students' Creed
that my father made too.

274
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,435
"Be someone who performs one's duty."

275
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,244
Have you forgotten?

276
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:39,665
Jong Soo.

277
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,774
Jong Soo.

278
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,734
Jong Soo!

279
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,185
What will happen now?

280
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,734
I'm going to wipe them all out.

281
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,094
Then what about me?

282
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:15,805
Shouldn't you also wipe me out
in order for you to be safe?

283
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,634
Give me your phone.

284
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:50,405
Give it here.

285
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:26,405
Sang Eui.

286
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,474
I'll give you 12 hours from now.

287
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,964
If you have any pictures or recordings,
get rid of them during that time...

288
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,285
and go abroad.

289
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:36,014
I'll call you once things are sorted.

290
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,585
This isn't a threat.
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

291
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:51,195
Joo Song.

292
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,474
Why? Is something wrong?

293
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,274
You...

294
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,004
Why?

295
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,715
Just get in.

296
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,835
How could you keep
something like that from me?

297
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,734
Can you not trust me?

298
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,905
Hey.

299
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,935
How is that a matter of trust?

300
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,675
If you were him...

301
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,604
"Hey, I'm addicted to drugs."

302
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:38,244
"Will you help me?"
Would you say something like that?

303
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:42,395
I told you that I only found out
by pure chance.

304
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,565
But still.

305
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,005
Didn't you think that
you should've told me sooner...

306
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,511
so that we could look for
a solution together?

307
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,854
What good is a friend
if you can't even tell me such things?

308
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,565
Then,

309
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:01,565
do you still get the urge
to take drugs now?

310
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,435
No.

311
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,885
Do you know...

312
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,575
when you get those withdrawal symptoms
or whatever?

313
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:11,374
Do withdrawal symptoms
announce themselves before they come?

314
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:12,815
Is that so?

315
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,215
Hey, should I drive?

316
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,285
No, it's fine.
I'll let you know if I get tired.

317
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,175
Anyone home?

318
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:47,085
Hello?

319
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,415
Is no one home?

320
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:52,354
I don't think anyone is here.

321
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,335
Are you Ms. Yoon Sung Mi?

322
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,175
Yes.

323
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:15,874
Detective Jang Jae Gyeong?

324
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:19,844
Reporter Oh Yoon Jin?

325
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:26,785
I'm Heo Joo Song.

326
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,024
Oh, right.

327
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,655
I'm...

328
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,655
No Gyu Min.

329
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,344
February 23,

330
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,060
licence plate 35A0233.

331
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:38,135
Could you tell me the driver
who was driving at the time?

332
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:40,165
It was No Gyu Min.

333
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,774
You're the taxi driver
who drove Jun Seo...

334
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,675
to the construction site the last time.

335
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:48,274
Yes, that's me.

336
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,385
You're Chae Kyung Tae's mother, right?

337
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:00,185
I've told her about Jun Seo.

338
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,224
Did Jun Seo come here often?

339
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,095
Yes, well...

340
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,524
I think he came here
about once every two months or so.

341
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:10,895
Gyu Min, how do you know
Kyung Tae and Jun Seo?

342
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:14,435
I was friends with Kyung Tae
to begin with.

343
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,935
Give me a lighter.

344
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,205
Here.

345
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,375
After Kyung Tae died like that,

346
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:24,774
I met Jun Seo afterward.

347
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,385
Where?

348
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:28,084
Jun Seo...

349
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:30,455
He came to see me.

350
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,955
It must've been over ten years ago.

351
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,395
I don't know how he found me.

352
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,425
Ma'am.

353
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:41,865
Who...

354
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,135
Are you...

355
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,304
Kyung Tae's friend from back then?

356
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,534
Yes.

357
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,345
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:06,215
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:08,784
- He said...
- It's okay.

360
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,820
he should've stopped Kyung Tae's death.

361
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:14,294
- I'm sorry.
- But he said he wasn't able to.

362
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:17,734
He stood there and cried for a long time.

363
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,244
You must be hungry.

364
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:34,934
I'll go and get some stuff...

365
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,115
- No.
- It's fine.

366
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,254
No, it's because I'm feeling hungry.

367
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:40,955
But it's fine.

368
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,155
When Jun Seo was...

369
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,715
on his way to
the Pilo-dong construction site,

370
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,425
did he say anything else in the taxi?

371
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:51,734
No, he didn't say anything.

372
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:54,365
But...

373
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,915
He told me to give this to you...

374
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:05,774
when you guys came by.

375
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:08,145
What is...

376
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:10,685
on here?

377
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,564
It was a long time ago,

378
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:25,961
but some guy came...

379
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,605
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

380
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,774
He asked if he could get a copy.

381
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:32,660
So, I told him to go ahead.

382
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,405
Jun Seo already knew...

383
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:36,974
that Oh Chi Hyun and Jeong Yoon Ho
had killed Lee Myung Guk.

384
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:38,875
That was why Sang Eui...

385
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:41,845
Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

386
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,484
"Lee Myung Guk's corpse?"

387
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,784
Did you put it back in his home?

388
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,155
By yourself?

389
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,054
With No Gyu Min.

390
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:54,294
You moved Lee Myung Guk's corpse
with Jeong Sang Eui, didn't you?

391
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:00,531
You must've met Sang Eui.

392
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:02,924
But how did you know...

393
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,435
they would move Lee Myung Guk's corpse
outside Youngryun Cold Storage?

394
00:23:06,295 --> 00:23:09,675
Sang Eui said he heard what Jun Seo said.

395
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,115
So, I waited.

396
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,434
It was past 1 a.m.

397
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:16,505
(The day of Park Jun Seo's death)

398
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:19,155
He said that Jun Seo had died
at the construction site...

399
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,185
and that I had to go back there.

400
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:25,955
I met Sang Eui there, and a little later,

401
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:29,395
Jeong Yoon Ho's taxi came out from
the alley where the mill was.

402
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,064
I saw him going into the alley
where Youngryun Cold Storage is.

403
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,734
When I got there,
Oh Chi Hyun and Jeong Yoon Ho...

404
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,175
came out with Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

405
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:41,945
So, that was why we tailed them.

406
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,945
Oh Chi Hyun was there too?

407
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,814
Yes.

408
00:23:55,374 --> 00:23:57,224
What are you doing?

409
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,895
We'll search and seize
Youngryun Cold Storage.

410
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,395
Let's head inside.

411
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:05,815

(Stop: All visitors must check in
with the guard.)

413
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,415
Go all the way in,
and there will be a stairwell going down.

414
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,544
The passcode is 3-8-0-8.

415
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,215
This was a site where drugs were produced.

416
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:25,364
Please take extra caution.

417
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,524
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,965
Tae Jin is at Youngryun Cold Storage
for a search and seizure.

421
00:24:42,384 --> 00:24:43,534
What?

422
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:45,605
Also,

423
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:47,705
they found Yoon Ho's body.

424
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,284
Father...

425
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,054
Let's go see Father.

426
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:04,994
We can't get through
to Prosecutor Park Tae Jin's phone.

427
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,315
It must be because he's searching
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

428
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:11,064
What on earth are you talking about?

429
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:14,435
Contact PR
and have them block any news reports.

430
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,774
Tell PR to stop them
by all means possible.

431
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:19,274
Yes, sir.

Have you heard?

435
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,715
Tae Jin is searching
and seizing my company.

436
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:30,984
Did something happen...

437
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,155
between you two?

438
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:37,155
Tae Jin that jerk had been making
and selling drugs.

439
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:40,844
That lunatic was making drugs
at our company to sell them.

440
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:41,994
So?

441
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:44,564
- Did you already know?
- So?

442
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:48,365
So...

443
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:51,334
I called Tae Jin in...

444
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,345
and tried to teach him a lesson
by giving him some drugs.

445
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,004
My goodness...

446
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,244
What is it?

447
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:05,155
What do you mean?

448
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,324
I guess Jun Seo never got to tell you.

449
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:15,794
I told him it would be a good idea
to tell Inspector Jang or Ms. Oh,

450
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,294
but Jun Seo delayed doing it.

451
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,564
He said he'd tell you
when the time was right.

452
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,955
(April, 2005)

453
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,455
- What is this?
- What?

454
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:27,031
What are you looking at?

455
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,205
Darn it.

456
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:33,885
Are you crazy?

457
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,615
It happened in a flash.

458
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,224
The boys...

459
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:43,644
must've knocked over the oil burner
while beating Kyung Tae.

460
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,024

461

Where is it right now?

491
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,185
I gave it to Jun Seo.

492
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:57,955
Why aren't you asking me the question?

493
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,564
I had the name tag,

494
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:03,994
and I witnessed the whole incident.

495
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,395
Why aren't you asking
why I didn't report it?

496
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:08,304
I thought you of all people would ask me.

497
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,405
You were forced to transfer because of it.

498
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:27,155
I've only set what we had.

499
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:29,554

00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:42,055
the whole story from Gyu Min,

504
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:44,734
I bet he was heartbroken.

505
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,345
So it was never an accident to begin with.

506
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,415
It's late,

507
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,984
but we should still try everything we can.

508
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:00,014
A long time ago,

509
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:02,805
we visited Jun Seo's mother's family.

510
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,524
It's the first time...

511
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:06,895

Are we going the right way?

- Are you sure this is it?
- Yes.

517
00:30:22,924 --> 00:30:24,195
- I don't think I need to eat it.
- Hey!

518
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:26,115
- Jun Seo!
- Jun Seo!

519
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,805
- What are you doing here alone?
- Exactly.

520
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:32,834
Why are you here?

521
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,484
Because we missed you.

522
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:41,494
You traveled so far.

523
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,304
Thank you.

524
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,244
Why did you leave without a word?

525
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:07,385
No reason.

526
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:11,425
Do you feel better...

527
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,155
now that you're here?

528
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,264
What do you think?

529
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:19,865
You left...

530
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:23,234
as soon as summer break started.

531
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:27,074
To be honest,

532
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,345
all of us felt a bit sad.

533
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:32,744
Jun Seo.

534
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:36,845
There's nothing friends can't share.

535
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,385
Are you going
to suffer through whatever it is alone?

536
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:42,685
Park Jun Seo.

537
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,695
What did you see...

538
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:50,895
that day?

539
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:57,234
That day,

540
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,705
I heard the story for the first time
from Jun Seo.

541
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:06,715
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Oh Chi Hyun, and Jeong Yoon Ho.

542
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:08,544
The four of them were stunned...

543
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,334
and frozen standing in front...

544
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,584
of Chae Kyung Tae's burning house.

545
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:17,724
I got angry after hearing the story...

546
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:21,125
and tried to persuade him
that the incident must not be overlooked.

547
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:25,234
I told him we should report it
to the police together.

548
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:29,504
But even after summer break ended
and school resumed,

549
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,474
Jun Seo didn't go to the police.

550
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,875
So that was why you reported it.

551
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:38,675
I knew about it too.

552
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,544
That same night,

553
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,254
I heard everything too.

554
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,724
Kyung Tae was inside the burning house,

555
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,855
but no one thought to rescue him.

556
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:54,465
They just paced in front of it.

557
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,064
I wanted to give...

558
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,315
the two of you the time to talk,

559
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:01,405
so I acted like I was going to sleep.

560
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,405
I was curious too.

561
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,705
I felt that something had happened
to Jun Seo,

562
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,274
but he wouldn't say anything to me either.

563
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,185
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,415
I heard everything...

565
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:24,655
and watched you get forced to transfer,

566
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:28,494
but I could never find...

567
00:33:29,144 --> 00:33:30,494
the courage.

568
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:35,534
I became a reporter after that.

569
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:39,034
I tried to be more courageous
to make up for that time...

570
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,405
and gave my best shots,

571
00:33:44,894 --> 00:33:47,084
but I lost every time.

572
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:51,014
I know.

573
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:53,615
I'm not strong enough
to fight the unjust world.

574
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:57,554
I could turn a blind eye
and go on with my life.

575
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:04,564
But that didn't dilute the guilt
I felt for you and Jun Seo.

576
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:24,814
What about you?

577
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:28,455
Didn't you hear everything from your tent?

578
00:34:32,305 --> 00:34:33,494
You went to sleep?

579
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:39,865
Yes.

580
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,955
(Yoo Kyung Hwan)

581
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:52,364
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

582
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:59,235
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

583
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:15,614
(Manpyeong Port)

584
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,074
Captain Jang.

585
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:26,574
It's so windy by the sea.

586
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,345
Where's Chang Soo?

587
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:30,244
I told him to get a motel room
and wait there.

588
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:32,715
Large groups tend to get noticed.

589
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,484
Did he say anything on the way?

590
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:35,754
No.

591
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,824
There was a lot
I wanted to ask but didn't.

592
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:41,595
I did some thinking on the way.

593
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,294
I think it's possible Chang Soo did...

594
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:47,330
what he did in that given situation.

595
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,834
Think about it.

596
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:52,905
Sit behind the wheel.

597
00:35:52,955 --> 00:35:54,094
Let's act it out.

598
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:55,405
Go on.

599
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:01,314
Look. I'll do this.

600
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:02,784
Darn it.

601
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,415
Here.

602
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,350
What would you do
if Ko Gi Sung kicked you like that?

603
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,434
First, I'd block the kicks
with my right arm.

604
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,595
Then...

605
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:13,494
I'd try to pull over
to the side of the road.

606
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,125
Yes. You would.

607
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,794
And as we discussed before,

608
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:20,734
if he had kicked like that,
his body would've leaned to the left.

609
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,004
Kick me.

610
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:29,995
If that happened,
I wouldn't turn the wheel to the right.

611
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,845
If I leaned to the left, so would the car.

612
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:35,084
Look. Sit back up straight.

613
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,414
What if I kicked like this?

614
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:44,124
Plus, why would Chang Soo kill Ko Gi Sung?

615
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:46,725
Isn't there no motive?

616
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,825
I would hope so.

617
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,195
- Let's go inside and get ready.
- Okay.

618
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:54,734
Go on inside.

619
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:56,064
Bye.

620
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:02,874
Darn it.

621
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:10,184
Hey, I eat those when I drive.

622
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:11,715
- Do you?
- Yes.

623
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,655
- Do you want one?
- Yes.

624
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,995
It helps when you crave a coffee.

625
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:31,475
This place is quiet with few people.

626
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:33,204
Yes.

627
00:37:33,624 --> 00:37:35,475
I wish I could move with Ye Eun...

628
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:37,774
to a quiet place like this.

629
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:41,044
Thinking of going back to that mess...

630
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:43,885
gives me a headache already.

631
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,794
I really don't get it.

632
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,294
What do you mean?

633
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:56,024
Jun Seo.

634
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:59,195
He knew he could die.

635
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:02,191
That's why he took out
an insurance policy in our names...

636
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:04,675
and left the USB flash drive
with No Gyu Min.

637
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:08,504
They were all fast friends,

638
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:10,715
but they tried to kill Jun Seo...

639
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,445
to keep their secret.

640
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:18,615
When you first told me
Jae Gyeong was addicted to drugs,

641
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,215
I blamed Jun Seo.

642
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:22,854
Think about it.

643
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:25,995
He got addicted
while looking into Jun Seo's death...

644
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:29,225
while you got kidnapped
and then almost died.

645
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,894
But today's visit to Boryeong...

646
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,535
made me realize
how lonely he must've felt.

647
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:39,175
He always seemed to be
surrounded by friends.

648
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,905
But it turned out...

649
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,745
the only friends he had...

650
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:46,914
were us three.

651
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:01,095
- Hi, Woo Sung.
- Where are you?

652
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,425
I'm on the way to Seoul. Why?

653
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,564
Things are crazy over here.

654
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:08,885
Prosecutors searched...

655
00:39:08,885 --> 00:39:10,954
a cold storage unit
in Pilo-dong owned by...

656
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:12,475
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
and their head office.

657
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:14,104
What? And?

658
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:17,441
There's talk that they found
a drug manufacturing lab...

659
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:20,171
in the unit basement
and a large batch of drugs,

660
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:22,945
but Keumhyung Group is stopping
the media from reporting on it.

661
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:26,235
Their people...

662
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:28,454
have been here for two hours
arguing with our boss.

663
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:31,354
Okay. Keep me updated.

664
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,265
Is something wrong?

665
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:39,064
Park Tae Jin is finally on the move.

666
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:48,044
You must've been very busy today.

667
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,104
Why are you here?

668
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,945
You must've been busier than me...

669
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:54,015
trying to silence the press.

670
00:39:54,164 --> 00:39:55,885
Park Tae Jin, you...

671
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:58,555
This isn't the only way.

672
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,055
There are many other options.

673
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,244
You seem to have a misunderstanding.

674
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:05,425
I doubt that.

675
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,865
But I do understand you, sir.

676
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:12,215
Even if I were you,

677
00:40:12,215 --> 00:40:14,234
since the mayor approved the project,

678
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:16,664
you'd have no reason...

679
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,334
to keep a hound that bit its master.

680
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:20,124
That's where you're mistaken.

681
00:40:20,124 --> 00:40:22,745
Chairman. I don't care.

682
00:40:25,994 --> 00:40:27,274
Let me take Jong Soo.

683
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,135
- What, punk?
- You can't do that.

684
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:31,910
If you say Jong Soo went off the deep end,

685
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:33,484
the company will stay unscathed.

686
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:35,624
No.

687
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,215
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

688
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:45,164
Take it.

689
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,925
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

690
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,314
This is Chairman Won Chang Ho.

691
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,314
Mr. Mayor...

692
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:23,684
(Mayor Joo In Sang)

693
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:25,774
Mr. Mayor.

694
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:27,604
It's Anhyun prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

695
00:41:28,025 --> 00:41:29,274
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin?

696
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:32,394
Why are you taking this call...

697
00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:35,814
I'm here to apprehend CEO Won Jong Soo.

698
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:39,984
Are you? Is this true?

699
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:44,024
Did Won Jong Soo make,
take, and sell drugs?

700
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:46,325
What do you say?

701
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:48,490
Give me Jong Soo...

702
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,425
and your Pilo-dong project stays on track.

703
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:51,784
Shut your mouth, punk.

704
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:52,965
Hello?

705
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:54,765
Prosecutor Park?

706
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,965
What's this about?

707
00:41:57,385 --> 00:41:59,234
- Prosecutor Park?
- Sir.

708
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:03,405
I'll ask you one last time.

709
00:42:05,894 --> 00:42:07,115
Is it Jong Soo...

710
00:42:08,034 --> 00:42:09,385
or Keumhyung Group?

711
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:17,894
Father.

712
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:19,624
Hello?

713
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:21,751
Who says the project stays on track?

714
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,995
I never approved it, okay?

715
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:26,195
- Chairman.
- Father.

716
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,365
Father.

717
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:33,374
What...

718
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:45,414
Jong Soo.

719
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:47,155
No.

720
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:50,325
What... What are you doing?

721
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:52,024
How could you...

722
00:42:52,345 --> 00:42:53,954
You won't go away for long.

723
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:55,765
What is this, Father?

724
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:58,164
I'm your only son.

725
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:02,064
This isn't right, Father!

726
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,575
I'm your son, not him!

727
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:09,175
How could you abandon me?

728
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,274
Jong Soo.

729
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:17,285
Make sure he isn't hurt or taken ill.

730
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:21,254
Yes, of course.

731
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:23,354
Father.

732
00:43:24,204 --> 00:43:25,425
What on earth...

733
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:27,294
I'm sorry, Father.

734
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,175
- I won't do it again.
- Prosecutor Park.

735
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:30,725
What do you think you're doing?

736
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:32,535
- Father.
- I'm hanging up.

737
00:43:32,885 --> 00:43:35,604
You're messing with the wrong person.
Do you know that?

738
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:37,465
Shut your mouth and listen up.

739
00:43:37,525 --> 00:43:39,805
What? Are you out of your mind?

740
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:42,845
I sent two photos to your number.

741
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,644
Just 2 out of 38 very disgusting photos.

742
00:43:46,394 --> 00:43:48,644
I sent one that would be
less embarrassing for others to see.

743
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:53,354
What...

744
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:01,695
The licensing
for the bioindustrial complex...

745
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:03,524
There's no problem with it.

746
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,734
And we never had this phone call.

747
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:09,465
Can I assume that to be true?

748
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,035
Yes.

749
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,104
That is true.

750
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:33,124
Take him away.

751
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:38,865
Let's go.

752
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:49,095
(Keumhyung Group)

753
00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:07,789
Act naturally...

754
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,779
if you meet Gong Jin Wook
in front of Manyang Ferry.

755
00:45:09,779 --> 00:45:12,379
Yes, sir. Are we going to ride
on Manyang Ferry?

756
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,379
I don't know yet.

757
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,369
We could meet there
and move to another boat.

758
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:19,398
But can't we just arrest him
in front of Manyang Ferry?

759
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,909
Is it really necessary
to get on the boat with him?

760
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:24,338
What nonsense is he going on about now?

761
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:25,989
I told you earlier.

762
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,608
It's highly likely Gong Jin Wook is armed.

763
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,849
We won't provoke him
until you get on the boat with him.

764
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,349
If we fail to arrest him on land,
citizens might be in danger.

765
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:38,109
If he goes into
a store or someplace else...

766
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,469
and takes a hostage,
it'd be a problem.

767
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,619
Fix that line.

768
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:43,708
Once we get on the boat
and go out to sea...

769
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,929
See that seawall?

770
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,449
When we go beyond that seawall,

771
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,429
the coast guard
will apprehend the boat there.

772
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:51,039
Then, we'll arrest him on the boat.
That will be the safest.

773
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,398
You're right.
He won't have anywhere to run.

774
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,288
Be sure to wear your bulletproof vest.

775
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:58,179
Don't think of jumping in
even if you see an opportunity.

776
00:45:58,328 --> 00:45:59,478
Yes, sir.

777
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,129
(Sergeant Oh Soo Hyun)

778
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:08,918
Hey, did you get anything?

779
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:11,768
That van where Ko Gi Sung died...

780
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,914
Yes?

781
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,858
There was a dashcam inside the car.

782
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,159
I thought we couldn't restore the footage.

783
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:21,918
We couldn't restore the sound,

784
00:46:21,918 --> 00:46:23,779
but we got some of the video back,

785
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:25,438
so I just sent you the file.

786
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,869
You saw it, didn't you?

787
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,168
Did you get anything?

788
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:33,579
Take a look at the file,

789
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:35,309
and you can make your call.

790
00:46:37,368 --> 00:46:38,748
Oh, okay.

791
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:10,679
Where did you go without me?

792
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,119
Where's your gun?

793
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,989
Here.

794
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,789
What are you doing?

795
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:25,724
Kim Chang Soo.

796
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:27,568
You're under arrest for the murder
of Ko Gi Sung.

797
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:29,199
Captain.

798
00:47:29,978 --> 00:47:31,418
You have the right to an attorney.

799
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:32,688
You will have a chance to defend yourself.

800
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:33,938
Captain, why are you doing this?

801
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,288
You may apply to have the legality
of your arrest reviewed.

802
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:42,259
You may refuse to make a statement.

803
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,409
You...

804
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:45,849
Why did you kill Ko Gi Sung?

805
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:49,719
Me?

806
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,069
Why would I kill Ko Gi Sung?

807
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,219
That day...

808
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:55,389
The day CEO Yoon died...

809
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,159
That wasn't the first time
you saw her, right?

810
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:00,869
I saw her for the first time.

811
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,628
And when would I ever meet CEO Yoon?

812
00:48:04,018 --> 00:48:05,699
Seriously, why are you all doing this?

813
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:07,298
Watch.

814
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,869
See what you did.

815
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,208
Ko Gi Sung didn't attack
as you said in your statement.

816
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,679
In case the car door didn't open...

817
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,648
when you entered the water,

818
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:22,018
you rolled down
the driver's seat window beforehand.

819
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:02,858
Come in.

820
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:08,449
We're in the middle
of a stakeout right now.

821
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:10,829
Please take him into the precinct
as quietly as possible.

822
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:14,539
Someone will come
from Anhyeon Police Station...

823
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,068
to take the suspect.

824
00:49:46,188 --> 00:49:48,739
So, what should I say when we meet
Gong Jin Wook?

825
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:50,719
Haven't you already thought of that?

826
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:51,878
Well,

827
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:54,349
should I say I'm a distributor
who used to deal drugs in Seoul...

828
00:49:54,498 --> 00:49:55,828
but has to stow away?

829
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:56,978
Sounds good.

830
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:01,598
Gong Jin Wook might try
to take you hostage.

831
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,489
So, if something happens on the boat,
drop back, no matter what.

832
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,989
The coast guard
and I will make the arrest.

833
00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:09,509
Stay away from Gong Jin Wook
at all times.

834
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:11,958
Gosh, fine.
Just mind your own business.

835
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,829
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

836
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:15,029
Say something.

837
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,398
Forsythia. Water parsley.

838
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:20,099
Idiot Jang Jae Gyeong.
Come in, over.

839
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:21,309
I can hear you fine.

840
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,039
Here.

841
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,748
Well, I can't take it with me.

842
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:33,949
You never know, so hang onto it.

843
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:06,492
Can you hear me?

844
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,162
Yes, I can hear you fine.

846
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:27,142

Not yet.

848
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:34,503

Is this your first time?

854
00:52:41,632 --> 00:52:42,822
What?

855
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:44,282
Smuggling out.

856
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:48,563
No wonder you're dressed so lightly.

857
00:52:49,672 --> 00:52:51,833
It's super cold out at sea
at this time of the year.

858
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,392
I don't think it's something to boast.

859
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:56,932
It's better to have experience
than none at all.

860
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:00,333
Do you speak any Chinese?

861
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:02,802
No. Do you?

862
00:53:04,123 --> 00:53:05,313
No.

863
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:29,162
It must have been troublesome to get here.

864
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:32,702
Are you two heading out
on Manyang Ferry today?

865

Yes.

- Yes?
- Your cover was blown.

869
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:50,083
They know the police sent someone.

870
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:53,179
They're going to leave Korea tonight,
so they'll use a different port.

871
00:53:53,203 --> 00:53:55,622
Which one of you was sent here by Straw?

872
00:53:56,472 --> 00:53:59,193

- Are you okay?
- Handcuffs.

from Manpyeong Port.

Just a minute.

886
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:20,362
It's about 15km north from there.

Call local patrol units for support.

890

Tell the coastal guard to head
to Ingok Port too.

Who are you calling a suspect? Come on.

That's just what you want to believe
Jun Seo would want.

905
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:20,890
That's not true, so shut your mouth.

01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,136
I'm going
to run this article no matter what.

908
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,466
The moment I get out, I'll kill you first!

909
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,559
This success should be something
we achieved together.

910
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,559
You're really something.

911
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,649
You were out of it then,
and you're still out of it now.

912
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,379
- Wake up.
- Park Tae Jin.

913
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:36,950
I'll do anything you ask,

914
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:38,490
- Jong Soo.
- Hey.

915
01:00:38,539 --> 01:00:39,745
Jong Soo killed him.

916
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,586
He was set on killing Jun Seo.

917
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,990
Did you offer to help him?

918
01:00:45,149 --> 01:00:46,149
Don't you know who I am?

919
01:00:46,149 --> 01:00:48,899
He sponged off of his friends
and lived as a drug delivery man.

920
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,430
He had a pathetic life!

921
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,665
Wake up.

922
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:55,169
They found DNA
underneath Park Jun Seo's fingernails.

923
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,495
You know whose it is, don't you?

924
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,780
You claim you're taking revenge
for Jun Seo.

925
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,384
But perhaps he never wanted one.

926
01:01:05,669 --> 01:01:07,669
