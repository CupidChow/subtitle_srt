1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,809
The Narcotics Unit is the pride
of Anhyeon Police Station.

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,561
"Transaction at Jeonghoon Station."

4
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,812
One-eight-eight-two.

5
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,775
Captain, don't you remember?
You told me to get here.

6
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,401
The man took the gun.

7
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,570
It's a new drug the police
have never heard of before.

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,280
Take your pill, and I'll see you soon.

9
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,032
Hand tremors and dizziness.

10
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,826
This means my body is rejecting the drug.
One-eight-eight-two.

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,703
You still remember our SOS signal, right?

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,122
-Park Jun-seo, where are you right now?
-Captain Jang?

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,291
He fell to his death
at a construction site in Pilo-dong.

14
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,919
That police officer looked like an addict.

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,212
No!

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,505
I've heard about that drug.

17
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,590
-Who's the distributor?
-CEO Yoon.

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:34,219
Someone sent me this text
to get me to platform 3-4.

19
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,054
And someone kidnapped and drugged me.

20
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,305
They're one and the same.

21
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,682
Who are you?
How do you know about 1-8-8-2?

22
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,476
What's Park Jun-seo's connection to drugs?

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,686
The body should be
at the Anhyeon University Hospital morgue.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,314
We need an autopsy. Too many things
are suspicious about Jun-seo's death.

25
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,399
Jae-gyeong. It's been a long time.

26
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,152
The people Jun-seo spoke to last
on the phone right before he died.

27
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,238
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin, Oh Chi-hyeon.

28
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,447
In the last 20 years,

29
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,825
they went through thick and thin
with Jun-seo.

30
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,160
One week ago, Jun-seo came to see me

31
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,704
to take out a life insurance policy.

32
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,998
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

33
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,918
Jun-seo left a will.

34
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,462
The life insurance policies
worth five billion won were taken out

35
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:13,174
under the name Audiophile Corporation
of which Jun-seo was the sole owner.

36
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,927
The person who will inherit
all of the company's shares

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,971
and the beneficiary
of the payout worth five billion won

38
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,848
are stated as follows.

39
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,100
Jang Jae-gyeong.

40
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,270
Oh Yun-jin.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,022
-Five billion won?
-Really?

42
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,983
To Jae-gyeong?

43
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,568
These people will inherit.

44
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,245
I know

45
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,746
it's too late.

46
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,667
But I came here to tell you this.

47
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,255
I want you to know
that I'll set things right.

48
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,009
He died a day after coming to see me.

49
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,219
So how was he going to set things right?

50
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,558
He got these policies a week before dying.
Did someone threaten to kill him?

51
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,395
Why did he choose
me and Yun-jin, of all people?

52
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,357
Right now, the only clue
connected to my drug addiction

53
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,485
is this text with Park Jun-seo's SOS.

54
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,323
Jun-seo was a realtor.
How was he connected to drugs?

55
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,824
This is all my fault.

56
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,076
Who drugged me?

57
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,496
I made it clear to him.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,833
If he commits suicide within two years,
there won't be a payout.

59
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,086
No, you know what?

60
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,173
I think it's all my fault.

61
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,633
What should I do, Jae-gyeong?

62
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
Jae-gyeong?

63
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,430
Are you listening to me?

64
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,777
I'm sorry you had to wait.

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,070
No, not at all.

66
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,239
-Did you get everything?
-Yes.

67
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,116
You must have been so overwhelmed earlier.

68
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,618
It's cold. Let's go.

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,298
Ms. Choi.

70
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,259
Yes?

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,511
I've been thinking…

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,972
Why don't we let them

73
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,099
do an autopsy on Jun-seo?

74
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,226
Excuse me?

75
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,310
I mean…

76
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,730
Jun-seo wasn't the type to kill himself.

77
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,149
Don't you agree?

78
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,570
Shouldn't we do
everything we can to find out?

79
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
What if…

80
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,242
What if it wasn't suicide?

81
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,955
It wasn't suicide?

82
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,209
Then someone killed him?

83
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,544
I'm just saying…

84
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,215
There's a slight possibility
it could be true.

85
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,427
If something comes up in the autopsy,

86
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,554
everyone will jump in
to take care of matters.

87
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,139
You saw them earlier.

88
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,018
His friends include
a prosecutor, a police officer…

89
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,396
And a reporter.

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,325
Don't cry.

91
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,414
I'll talk to Tae-jin and the doctor.

92
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,250
So please consider

93
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,045
doing an autopsy.

94
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,486
When did you find out about the policies?

95
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,573
-Just now.
-Even if you just found out…

96
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,786
You should've come to me first
if you knew there was a will.

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,164
Why did you disclose it to everyone?

98
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,753
Hey. Jang Jae-gyeong
talked to Heo Joo-song.

99
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,713
The will would've been
revealed eventually.

100
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,382
It's better it came out this way.

101
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,010
It won't matter what Jae-gyeong says now

102
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,887
since they'll think
it's because of the payout.

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,767
By the way,

104
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,062
what did Jun-seo
really say to you guys on the phone

105
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,022
before he died?

106
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,107
Hey.

107
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,067
What do you mean "really"?

108
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,070
It's just as Jong-soo said earlier.

109
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,617
What was Jun-seo thinking

110
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,994
leaving death benefits
to people he wasn't close to?

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,872
If we're this disappointed,
imagine how his wife feels.

112
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,165
That's what I'm saying.

113
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,793
To put it bluntly,
if Jun-seo didn't commit suicide,

114
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,795
they'll get the entire
five billion won payout.

115
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,879
Hey!

116
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,179
Nothing will change
because it's a suicide case.

117
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,932
So no one will get the payout.

118
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,435
Then what about the autopsy?

119
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,603
There can't be an autopsy.

120
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,191
I'm saying this as a prosecutor.

121
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,695
A case like this
definitely would've gone to autopsy.

122
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,989
Jang Jae-gyeong is a problem right now,

123
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,908
but the DPO will get
suspicious later as well.

124
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,244
An autopsy is the right way to go.

125
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,620
Hey.

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,381
Hey.

127
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,425
Step outside for a bit.

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,803
Come on.

129
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,056
Hurry up.

130
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,855
They always talk about
important stuff without us.

131
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,859
We were all class officers,
so why exclude us?

132
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,986
Be quiet. They'll hear you.

133
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,823
Hey.

134
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,742
Sang-ui.

135
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,410
What?

136
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,790
What is it?

137
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,376
Where did you say Jun-seo died?

138
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:28,090
The old Fashion Town building
in Pilo-dong is what I heard.

139
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,177
Fashion Town?

140
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,722
Is it that construction site
near the Pilo-dong three-way intersection?

141
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
Yes.

142
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,644
Okay. You can go now.

143
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,233
What is it?

144
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,986
Are you afraid they'll find something
during the autopsy?

145
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,656
Can you guarantee they won't?

146
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,409
It's weird there's no suicide note.

147
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,204
Look at the will. We didn't expect it.

148
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,709
So…

149
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,964
What did Jun-seo tell you guys
before he died?

150
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,009
Was there anything else
other than what I already know?

151
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,805
No.

152
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Same here.

153
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,355
It might come at a cost,
but let's tell them no autopsy.

154
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,152
We'll just argue
that we don't want our friend cut open.

155
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,742
By the way,

156
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,831
the will mentioned
one more person whom we all know.

157
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,708
What?

158
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,294
Who?

159
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,797
Lee Myeong-guk.

160
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,342
Lee Myeong-guk.

161
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,928
Lee Myeong-guk?

162
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,888
Yes, Lee Myeong-guk.
Have you heard of him?

163
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,473
No. You?

164
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,558
I don't know either.

165
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,476
That's strange.

166
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,105
Why didn't Tae-jin
mention Lee Myeong-guk earlier?

167
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,565
Maybe because we don't know him?

168
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,983
Jun-seo didn't tell you?

169
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,652
And you didn't ask who that was?

170
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,613
Well, no.

171
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,906
I suppose I should've asked.

172
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,452
Didn't it occur to you
to ask who Lee Myeong-guk was?

173
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,829
It's not easy to find someone
with just their name.

174
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,546
LEE MYEONG-GUK
BORN MARCH 12TH, 1967

175
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,882
Oh, come on.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,720
LEE MYEONG-GUK
ID NUMBER: 670312-11353522

177
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,265
They're back.

178
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,434
You're still here.

179
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,356
-Did something happen in the car?
-What?

180
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,524
No.

181
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,026
Oh, I can just ask you.

182
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,404
If I take out a life insurance policy
but commit suicide right after,

183
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,406
there's no payout, right?

184
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,077
Why do you want to know?

185
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,286
What?

186
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,705
Someone asked me.

187
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,668
-Their friend committed suicide and--
-Who's this friend?

188
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,252
Would you know even if I told you?

189
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,337
Still, just tell us.

190
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,007
What's wrong with you guys?
It's my private life.

191
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,134
Hey, I have tons of friends.

192
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,636
How much is the payout?

193
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,765
-How much was it again?
-Five billion won?

194
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,144
So you saw the will.

195
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,774
You didn't tell Ms. Choi, did you?

196
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,943
-What?
-Did you tell her?

197
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,528
That Jun-seo left us death benefits?

198
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,738
Are you crazy? Of course not!

199
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,198
How did you find out?

200
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,499
Here.

201
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,252
I can't believe you opened this.

202
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,129
It was just weird, okay?

203
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,549
Jun-seo died, but he got so much mail
from insurance companies.

204
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,969
I wasn't going to open them, but…

205
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,349
Wait. How did you guys find out?

206
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,435
He took out these policies through me.

207
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,982
Well, that's a relief.

208
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,985
I was wondering
how to explain all this to you.

209
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,653
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

210
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,906
We need an autopsy.
You made a good point earlier.

211
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,325
It's too suspicious.

212
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,751
An autopsy will reveal something, right?

213
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,214
It'll prove that it's murder.

214
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,301
Goodness.

215
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,474
Ms. Choi.

216
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,904
Jang Jae-gyeong.

217
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,365
You're still here. I thought you left.

218
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,035
Let's do an autopsy.
I'll convince Ms. Choi.

219
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,164
Is it because you want the payout?

220
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,125
You've got it all wrong.

221
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,962
It'll be better for you guys
if Jun-seo's death is a suicide.

222
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,464
If not,

223
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,883
you three will be
at the top of the suspect list.

224
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,804
You and I both
conduct investigations for a living.

225
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,640
So stop talking nonsense

226
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,101
and let's convince Ms. Choi
to rush an autopsy.

227
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,939
You seem convinced
an autopsy will reveal something.

228
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,274
-That seems suspicious.
-Hey, Tae-jin.

229
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,946
Jun-seo took out those policies
a week before he died.

230
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,114
Isn't it obvious what that means?

231
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,408
He wants someone
to uncover the truth about his death.

232
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,328
What are they doing here?

233
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,580
What's wrong?

234
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,166
Isn't this what you wanted?
To uncover the truth?

235
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,254
But you know what we need to do first
to uncover the truth, right?

236
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,882
We both conduct investigations
for a living after all.

237
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,852
I know it's a difficult time for you,
but it's a routine investigation.

238
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,647
I'm Park Tae-jin of Anhyeon DPO.
What brings you here?

239
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,358
I'm Inspector Park In-su
from Anhyeon Police Station.

240
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,903
I'm here to investigate
the death of Mr. Park Jun-seo.

241
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,613
Is that so?

242
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,076
Senior Inspector Jang,
you'll have to come with us too.

243
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,494
I'll explain on the way.

244
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,872
Is this because of the insurance and will?

245
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,206
Hey, Park Tae-jin.

246
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,918
A will?

247
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,297
Ms. Choi, I think it'll be better
if I explain that to you.

248
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,506
Be quiet.

249
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,175
I should've told you about this sooner.

250
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,096
Before Jun-seo died,

251
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,140
he took out insurance policies
worth five billion won.

252
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,058
But…

253
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:58,522
The payout of five billion won
was made out to these two, not you.

254
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,401
I find that strange too.

255
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,864
He left that large sum to someone
he hasn't kept in touch with.

256
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,241
That makes no sense at all.

257
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,701
-That's why--
-That's why…

258
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,289
That's why you want an autopsy?

259
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,832
-No.
-No, that's not it.

260
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,001
You said my husband wouldn't kill himself!

261
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,169
No, I mean…

262
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,838
I still believe that, and--

263
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,548
It's the insurance payout.

264
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,302
You're doing this because of the payout!

265
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,847
How could you?

266
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,850
How could you do this
at a friend's funeral?

267
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,478
How dare you call yourselves his friend?

268
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,025
I'm sorry, Ms. Choi.

269
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,278
I should've told you sooner,
but you weren't here.

270
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,822
Everyone is here, so we'll all go.

271
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,199
Yun-jin and Joo-song, you too.

272
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,744
Ms. Choi, please calm down
and come with me.

273
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,871
-Please come with us.
-Okay.

274
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,210
Stay here.

275
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,878
Got it.

276
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,358
We're here as references,
so why are we in this room?

277
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,490
I suggested doing it here.

278
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,951
Let's hear what they have to say.

279
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,537
Good idea.

280
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,709
I apologize
for bringing you in at this hour.

281
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,961
May your husband rest in peace.

282
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,796
This won't take long.

283
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,134
Were you two aware

284
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,263
that a will was made?

285
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,181
-No.
-No.

286
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,933
Then in your opinion,

287
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,520
were you two closer to Mr. Park
than his own family

288
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,355
to receive the five billion won payout?

289
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,108
Look, I already know

290
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,196
that you two didn't kill Mr. Park
to get the five billion won.

291
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,614
Excuse me?

292
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,158
Watch what you say.

293
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,076
Did I offend you?

294
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,661
To put it bluntly,

295
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,373
if you'd killed Mr. Park Jun-seo
for the five billion won,

296
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,334
you would've staged it
as a murder or an accident

297
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,087
instead of a suicide.

298
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,215
I was just trying to help you out.

299
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,717
You don't agree?

300
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:36,430
Then why did Mr. Park Jun-seo
leave five billion won to you two?

301
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,434
I don't understand why neither of you
can give me an explanation.

302
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
Is it just me? Is it?

303
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,230
-You're right.
-What?

304
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,066
We find that strange too.

305
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,944
Park Jun-seo rarely kept in touch with us,
so why did he do it?

306
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,907
This is why we need to do an autopsy

307
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,700
and investigate this properly.

308
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,787
Park Tae-jin is out there, right?

309
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,038
Did you ask him?

310
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,291
A week before a man fell to his death
from the ninth floor,

311
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,126
he took out five billion won in insurance.

312
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,796
But you didn't ask him why
he refused an autopsy in this case.

313
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,881
Be quiet.

314
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,508
Or maybe you couldn't ask him.

315
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,261
Why? Are you still dancing
to the prosecutor's tune?

316
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,182
Hey, you bastard. I was trying to be nice,
but you're way over the line.

317
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,811
You came in as a reference.
Do you want to leave as a suspect?

318
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,271
Good. Keep this up.

319
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,816
I'm fine becoming a suspect,
so just do this right.

320
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,442
And don't embarrass yourself.

321
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,152
Why you bastard…

322
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,992
Everyone, calm down.

323
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,954
Let's just look at the facts.

324
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,041
There was no proof
of foul play at the scene.

325
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,754
As the prosecutor who did the postmortem,
I didn't see anything unusual.

326
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,258
Would the police like to add anything?

327
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,342
Park Tae-jin.

328
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,302
Don't you dare call me by name.

329
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,514
I'm here as a prosecutor, not your friend.

330
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,641
Understood?

331
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,146
Anything else to say?

332
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,773
No, sir.

333
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,652
The family has already made it clear
they don't want an autopsy.

334
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,863
Proceed accordingly.

335
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,620
Why? Will we find something on his body?

336
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,373
What are you trying to hide? Tell me!

337
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,292
Tell me, you bastard!

338
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,459
That's enough!

339
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,670
Are you insane?

340
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,130
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,683
I'm Senior Superintendent Bae Byeong-ho.

342
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,978
My deepest condolences to you.

343
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:53,859
Please understand that we're only trying
to carry out our duties.

344
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,321
Senior Inspector Yoo, finish up here.

345
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,405
Yes, sir.

346
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,699
They didn't want an autopsy
to begin with, right?

347
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,451
That's right, sir.

348
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,203
Then why are they still here?

349
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,872
-Escort her back to the funeral home.
-Sir!

350
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,504
Prosecutor Park,
let's have some tea in my office.

351
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,631
Very well.

352
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,092
The autopsy…

353
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,602
I want an autopsy.

354
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,441
I think it's what he wants.

355
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,110
What are you talking about?

356
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,363
-Jun-seo is dead.
-Hey, Park Tae-jin!

357
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,198
Are you serious?

358
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,408
Why are you so eager
to cut into our dead friend?

359
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,952
Ms. Choi, why are you doing this?

360
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,043
I need to put my mind at ease.

361
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,799
I just can't believe he took his own life.

362
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,010
After Yun-hui died…

363
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,181
I wanted to end my life too.

364
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,396
But I'm still here.

365
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,775
He used to tell me

366
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,778
that our Yun-hui…

367
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,324
is in a better place now.

368
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,495
So in order to see her again,

369
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,791
we have to be good
for the rest of our lives,

370
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,962
and that we must wash away
any sins we have.

371
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,047
A person who says that
wouldn't kill himself.

372
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,053
I want to know for sure
if there was another reason.

373
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,016
If it turns out to be suicide after all,

374
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,145
I'll just curse him then.

375
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,829
Then at the request of the family,

376
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,999
we'll proceed
with Mr. Park Jun-seo's autopsy.

377
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,878
Sir?

378
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,717
Very well.

379
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,616
What kind of a damn prosecutor are you?

380
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,368
I told you no autopsy no matter what!

381
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,247
-Jong-soo…
-Shut up.

382
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,376
You brought us to the police station
and made fools out of us.

383
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,506
How will we remain friends like this?

384
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,217
I know you're anxious…

385
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:06,968
Anxious?

386
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,514
But you and I were both there.

387
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,017
We both watched.

388
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,227
So what's the problem?

389
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,564
They won't find anything on Jun-seo, so--

390
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,317
Even if they find something,

391
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,986
you need to take care of it.

392
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,738
Do whatever it takes to stop this

393
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,241
even if it means
quitting your job as a prosecutor.

394
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,159
Got it?

395
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,288
-Got it.
-Say it louder!

396
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,210
I said I got it. Someone might hear.

397
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,565
We will begin the autopsy.

398
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,691
THE LATE PARK JUN-SEO

399
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,430
-Here.
-Thanks.

400
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,807
What are you doing?

401
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,810
I'm sending some photos to Jae-gyeong.

402
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
What's the matter with him?

403
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,024
After causing a scene like that,
he didn't show up today.

404
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,068
I know.

405
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,903
He said something came up at the station.

406
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,988
He's always been like this.

407
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,531
Everything's all about him.

408
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,452
Everyone asked why Jae-gyeong didn't come.

409
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,580
Of course, it doesn't make sense to them.

410
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,334
Maybe he's lying low
until the autopsy results come out.

411
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,253
From what I heard,

412
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,546
it'll take at least a month
to get the results.

413
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,257
Oh, dear.

414
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,925
Hey.

415
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,970
We can't just sit back
and wait until then.

416
00:25:55,637 --> 00:26:00,100
Jun-seo put my name in his will,
which means I have a role to play.

417
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm determined…

418
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,819
to play that role right.

419
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,578
This morning, someone reported those two
fighting in front of a convenience store.

420
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,456
A local police station responded.

421
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,335
They reported even at a glance,
both people appeared to be drug addicts.

422
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,462
And…

423
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,300
One of them had this on him.
It's that drug again.

424
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,176
Found out anything?

425
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,555
Yes, it started becoming popular
about three months ago.

426
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,599
It lifts up your mood
and improves your focus.

427
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,768
It's being sold through word of mouth.

428
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,645
Users become highly dependent on it

429
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,314
and develop a high tolerance for it.

430
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,107
It's become a serious problem recently.

431
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,110
What's it called?

432
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,487
They call it lemon pop.

433
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,751
HEO JOO-SONG
WE'RE SAYING GOODBYE TO JUN-SEO

434
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,188
On February 27th, 2024 at around 4 a.m.,

435
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,940
near a convenience store
in Panseo-dong, Anhyeon City,

436
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,568
you two were fighting
before being brought to the precinct.

437
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,652
Yes.

438
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,865
-Continue.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,119
At the precinct,
you were suspected of drug use

440
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,621
and now you're here.

441
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,122
Do you admit to using drugs?

442
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,250
I told you I'm not admitting anything.

443
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,336
Since you denied using drugs,

444
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,254
we'll collect blood and hair samples.

445
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,424
We'll pause the video recording
until the tests are done.

446
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,732
This is what you fought over, right?

447
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,445
Sit down.

448
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,743
Remove your hands.

449
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,541
When did you start using?

450
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,171
Answer me, and you can have this.

451
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,007
Two months…

452
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,175
No, I mean…

453
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,553
About a month and a half ago.

454
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,722
How long does one pill last you?

455
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,183
In the beginning,
it lasts about one or two days…

456
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,270
-Then it gets shorter.
-Yes.

457
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,480
How long ago since you had some?

458
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,777
Detective.

459
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,238
It's been a week since I took any!

460
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,659
Why so long? You couldn't get any?

461
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,704
It's been really hard to get any
since two weeks ago.

462
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,084
-Please…
-How many do you take at a time?

463
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,045
Right now…

464
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,590
-Four pills.
-Four pills?

465
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,384
-Yes.
-You did other drugs before this, right?

466
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,096
Yes.

467
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,807
What makes this drug different?

468
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,851
Just one pill.

469
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:30,935
Just one more.

470
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,781
Give it to me!

471
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,034
Give it to me!

472
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,455
-Get off him!
-Give it!

473
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,915
-No!
-Grab him!

474
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,250
Give it to me!

475
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,961
-Let go!
-I want it, you bastard!

476
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,546
-Let go!
-I said give it!

477
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,173
Give it to me!

478
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,597
JINYEONG FUNERAL SERVICE

479
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,102
If it's difficult to go home alone,

480
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,063
would you like us to go with you?

481
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,356
No, thank you.

482
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,317
If you need anything or have questions,

483
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,152
please give me a call.

484
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,071
Okay.

485
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,407
I'll get going as well.

486
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,368
Thank you for everything.

487
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,703
Once we wrap up some urgent matters,

488
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,789
we'll help you
with the real estate office,

489
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,834
-so don't worry and rest for a few days.
-I will.

490
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,004
Who was that?

491
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,049
She's a manager at my husband's office.

492
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,469
I see. You're going to sell
the real estate office?

493
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,514
Yes. It's hard to run it
without my husband.

494
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,890
I'll take care of it slowly.

495
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,976
Thanks for coming all the way here.

496
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,310
See you next time.

497
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,770
It looks like they're leaving.

498
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,355
See you.

499
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,027
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

500
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,112
We'll see you again.

501
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,239
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

502
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,704
Take care.

503
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,455
Have a safe trip home.

504
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,584
They even make a cool exit.

505
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,961
I know.

506
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,007
All right. What should we do now?

507
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,801
What do you mean?

508
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,679
You said you'd play your role
to shed light on Jun-seo's death.

509
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,763
What are we doing first?

510
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,140
You're going to join me?

511
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,434
Yes. Jun-seo…

512
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,979
He took out policies through me,
made a will,

513
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,731
and did all these weird things.

514
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:43,276
But I didn't ask any questions
or try to stop him.

515
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,447
It makes me wonder
if that's why Jun-seo died.

516
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,199
I feel bad, so I want to help.

517
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,286
Of course, I like being with you too.

518
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,207
Are you doing this
for the insurance payout?

519
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,543
Yes.

520
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,715
So what?

521
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,926
Stop looking at me like that.

522
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,011
Jang Jae-gyeong is no different.

523
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,471
What will you do with the money?

524
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,683
Ye-eun.

525
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,229
I want to bring her back
and live with her.

526
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,652
The thought of Ye-eun is making me hungry.

527
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,489
It's weird, but I get hungry
when I think of my daughter.

528
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,701
Okay, then shall we go eat something?

529
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,747
There's a good
banquet noodle place nearby.

530
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,918
Let's have a bowl and hope
for a long and peaceful life.

531
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,086
Sounds great.

532
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,963
Let's go.

533
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,592
Is this what they call lemon pop?

534
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,718
Yes.

535
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,762
Jeez, what a good name.

536
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,556
They've been selling this
both online and offline.

537
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,933
Why did they stop supplying?

538
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,227
Two weeks ago,
they started running low on supply.

539
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,104
Maybe they couldn't
keep up with the demand.

540
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,564
Considering its efficacy and potency,

541
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,817
I think they aimed
to sell a lot in a short period.

542
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,694
It's different from other drugs.

543
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,196
They say you experience
less hallucinations than on meth,

544
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,700
and at first, it clears your mind
and boosts confidence.

545
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,662
Those two guys first took it
for better focus and a confidence boost.

546
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,374
But the effects don't last long,
so you get lethargic and short of breath.

547
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,751
On top of that,
you end up increasing the dosage.

548
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,587
Eventually, it destroys
your central nervous system.

549
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,173
The initial barrier to entry
for this drug will be low.

550
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,550
This is dangerous.

551
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,178
For now, go check out
the existing suppliers and ask around.

552
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,557
If there are new players involved,
they'll know about them.

553
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,434
Go out and find whatever you can.

554
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,727
-Yes.
-Yes.

555
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,148
Jang Jae-gyeong.

556
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,232
Yes?

557
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,155
You didn't return your firearm again?

558
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,657
No, I didn't.

559
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,244
Hurry up and return it.
The incident room manager called.

560
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,414
Understood.

561
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,806
Have it ready by midnight tomorrow.

562
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,558
If you're late,

563
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,144
I'll stop distributing lemon pop

564
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,772
and focus on hunting down people instead.

565
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,153
DOCTOR

566
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,876
Doctor?

567
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,671
Have you heard of CEO Yoon?

568
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,048
CEO Yoon? No.

569
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,508
They distribute lemon pop.

570
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,510
-Where did you hear about this?
-Jang Cheol-gu.

571
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,762
-I don't know who Jang Cheol-gu is.
-Right.

572
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,597
I'll look into it.

573
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,432
Remember that guy, Lee Myeong-guk?

574
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,267
Yes.

575
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,854
Jae-gyeong didn't seem to know
who Lee Myeong-guk was.

576
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,398
Right.

577
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,818
He asked a colleague
to run a check on him.

578
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,364
Do you know him?

579
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,448
What?

580
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,414
When I was reading the will in the dark

581
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,001
and saw Lee Myeong-guk's name,
I got chills.

582
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,336
MISSING PERSON REPORT
LEE MYEONG-GUK

583
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,462
He's missing?

584
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,299
Yes, he was reported missing
seven months ago.

585
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,511
He was last seen heading down
to a subway station near his office.

586
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,471
-Who reported him missing?
-His colleague.

587
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,931
And the name of his company?

588
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,224
KH Pharmaceutical.

589
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,767
KH Pharmaceutical?

590
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,602
Won Jong-soo is the CEO there.

591
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,479
Right.

592
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,900
It's a subsidiary managed by
KH Group's vice chairman, Won Jong-soo.

593
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,821
How did you know about Lee Myeong-guk?

594
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,617
He had information on workplace corruption
and asked me to publish it in the paper.

595
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,952
So did you meet him?

596
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,370
Hey.

597
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,206
There are tons of people
with tips like that.

598
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,457
So you didn't see him?

599
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,669
I said no thanks and was about to hang up…

600
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,633
but his last words were a real shocker.

601
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,468
He had end-stage lung cancer,

602
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,470
so Detective Division One investigated,

603
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,473
but they assumed
he took his own life out of despair

604
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,852
instead of considering the possibility
of him being linked to another case.

605
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,979
Holy cow.

606
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,524
In other words, he had nothing to lose.

607
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,943
You know people like him
will go over the line, right?

608
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
Right.

609
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:42,325
But he never showed up to our interview
and didn't answer his phone.

610
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,534
Are you saying…

611
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,702
Yes.

612
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,079
I found out later

613
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,208
he went missing the day before.

614
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,633
Hey, shouldn't you tell
Jae-gyeong about this?

615
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,717
Me?

616
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,887
Do I have to?

617
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,933
Damn it. I really don't feel like it.

618
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,227
Still, you should let him know.

619
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,314
Okay, I'll let him know.

620
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:21,072
Actually, I know
what that guy is up to right now.

621
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,407
MIJU APARTMENTS

622
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,368
Who are you?

623
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,412
Is this Ms. Lee Eun-hui's residence?

624
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,582
-Mr. Lee Myeong-guk's daughter…
-Hey, be quiet!

625
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,585
Yes, that's me.

626
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,920
Anhyeon Police, ma'am.

627
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,015
The police said to take it back
as they didn't need it.

628
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,268
Do you need it again?

629
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,019
KH PHARMACEUTICAL

630
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,230
Have you heard of the name Park Jun-seo?

631
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,856
No.

632
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,445
What did your father do
at KH Pharmaceutical?

633
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,863
I'm not sure.

634
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,824
He was a researcher,

635
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,326
so as far as I know, he made generic drugs

636
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,454
and sometimes developed new ones.

637
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,795
Did anyone from the company
visit or contact you after what happened?

638
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,588
No.

639
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,347
I'll contact you if I have more questions.

640
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,557
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

641
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,714
What's it called?

642
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,132
It's called lemon pop.

643
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,550
Lemon pop?

644
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,136
That's a pretty simple name.

645
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,139
They just added "pop" to the drug color.
What else?

646
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,265
That's it.

647
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,769
-Are you saying you didn't visit the home?
-Yes.

648
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,146
Hey, I told you to go there!

649
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,774
I'm overwhelmed because my friend died,

650
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,193
so I need you to go and investigate!

651
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,611
Come on, Ms. Oh.

652
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,488
His wife died of an overdose
a few days ago.

653
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,323
How can I barge into their house?

654
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,532
Shut it.

655
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,952
Go there today and find out
every little detail about her.

656
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,163
-Got it?
-But Ms. Oh…

657
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,175
What's wrong with him?

658
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,889
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

659
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,726
What's wrong with you?

660
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,852
Are you sick?

661
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,687
Wait, is this sweat?

662
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,357
What's wrong with you?

663
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,192
Let go.

664
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,323
What's going on?

665
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,450
Are you okay?

666
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,536
Hey!

667
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,745
Okay, this won't do.

668
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,540
Get on your feet.

669
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,043
Use your legs.

670
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,504
Let's get to my car for now.

671
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,103
Which hospital should I take you to?
Where do you usually go?

672
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,272
I can't go to the hospital.

673
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,024
What are you talking about?

674
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,569
You need to go
to the hospital if you're sick.

675
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,947
No hospital.

676
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,616
Home…

677
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,953
Take me home.

678
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,306
You can do this.

679
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,349
Jeez.

680
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,647
Jae-gyeong.

681
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,524
What's the passcode?

682
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,609
Zero.

683
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,862
-Five, zero, two.
-Five?

684
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,447
Zero, two.

685
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,581
Hey!

686
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,541
Hey.

687
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,925
Hold on.

688
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,636
Hold on.

689
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,183
Why is this so empty?

690
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,816
Jae-gyeong.

691
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,987
Drink this.

692
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,665
Do you feel better?

693
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,475
PARK JUN-SEO

694
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,753
Lemon pop.

695
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,804
I saw you already took the pill.
Take this one sparingly.

696
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,106
What is it?

697
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,237
It's in there, right?

698
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,448
What do you mean?

699
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,336
Give it to me.

700
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,547
What are you talking about?

701
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,132
What are you…

702
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,430
Let go!

703
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,985
Yun-jin, open the door.

704
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,029
No.

705
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,781
Open the door.

706
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,783
This is a drug.

707
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,577
Jang Jae-gyeong, get a hold of yourself.

708
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,329
I can't live without it.

709
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,040
I might die without it.

710
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,333
Help me.

711
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,210
What happened to you?

712
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,672
How could you do drugs?

713
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,600
Open the door.

714
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,186
You think I can't open it?

715
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,068
Get it together.
Jae-gyeong, get it together!

716
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,154
Open the door.

717
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,824
Get it together.

718
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,659
Jae-gyeong, get a hold of yourself!

719
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,401
Jun-seo.

720
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,990
He came to see me

721
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,784
the day before he died.

722
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,371
That was the tenth time.

723
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,331
What?

724
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,169
That was the tenth time
Jun-seo came to see me.

725
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,757
The fact that I remember
how many visits he made

726
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,052
probably means I was waiting for him too.

727
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,722
What did he tell you?

728
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,475
He said the same thing all ten times.

729
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,852
He asked me to forgive him.

730
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,896
Don't tell me…

731
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,732
The incident from 20 years ago?

732
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,111
Then what?

733
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,446
What did you tell him?

734
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,073
I always gave him the same response.

735
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,869
"I don't want to hear it…

736
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,707
so get out of my life."

737
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,630
If I had accepted his apology then,

738
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,050
he would still be alive, right?

739
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,390
That fool.

740
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,184
He should've told me instead of dying.

741
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,943
Why care if I forgave him or not?

742
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,571
He should've just lived a good life.

743
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,366
I'm nothing to him,

744
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,785
yet he asked ten times…

745
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,918
And I refused to forgive him to the end.

746
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,965
How did you end up like this?

747
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,635
I don't remember.

748
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,055
After having dinner with my colleagues,

749
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,891
I got kidnapped from a restroom.

750
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,227
When I woke up, three days had passed.

751
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,021
And I was already addicted to the drug.

752
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,775
I'm sorry about earlier.

753
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,779
Does anyone come to mind?

754
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,370
What's strange is…

755
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,000
Jun-seo was supposedly a realtor,

756
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,586
yet he was connected to drugs.

757
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,549
I can't prove anything yet,

758
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,885
but that's my only clue.

759
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,930
But for now…

760
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,391
For now, let's tell the authorities.

761
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
No.

762
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,605
You'll get in big trouble at this rate.

763
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,734
I saw the woman who took that drug
and died in front of her child.

764
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,696
I saw the look in her eye.
It just wasn't right.

765
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,490
Tell the police right away, okay?

766
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,325
And go to the hospital.

767
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:01,790
I can't.

768
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,458
Why not?

769
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,503
If word gets out about this,
I'll get dropped from the case.

770
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,257
And if I get dropped,
nobody will try to solve it.

771
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:11,800
You saw it yourself.

772
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,054
The case detective and the prosecutor
wanted to cremate before doing an autopsy.

773
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,265
Keep it a secret for now.

774
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,061
Nobody can know that I'm addicted.

775
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,771
If I get removed from this case,

776
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,690
you won't get any of the insurance payout.

777
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,322
After everything is handled,
I'll tell them myself.

778
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,617
Until then, nobody can know about this.

779
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,204
And I can't collapse again.

780
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,249
That drug.

781
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,084
Do you still have it?

782
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,212
No.

783
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,299
I got rid of it…

784
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,260
in the bathroom.

785
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,519
Good job.

786
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,272
You did well.

787
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,531
Where are you going in that state?

788
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,991
There's no time.

789
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,204
I have to find out who got me addicted

790
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,539
and who did that to Jun-seo.

791
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,837
If you're going to Lee Myeong-guk's house,

792
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,964
I'll drive you there.

793
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,012
I'll tell you on the way

794
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,598
about how I know Lee Myeong-guk.

795
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,083
-Is it locked?
-Yes.

796
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,847
Are you okay?

797
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,515
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

798
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,396
Hey.

799
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,940
Open the gate.

800
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,859
Stay in the car.

801
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,652
Hey.

802
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,696
I'm not waiting in the car
like I'm your driver!

803
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,115
I'm a reporter.

804
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:43,869
What if you collapse again?
Open the gate right now.

805
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,372
Fine, forget it.

806
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,252
Damn it.

807
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,504
Seriously?

808
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,506
Are you playing games with me?

809
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,977
What is it?

810
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,854
Nothing. It's just a clothesline.

811
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,315
It touched my head.

812
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,067
Watch your step.

813
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,784
Hey, is it okay to just go in?

814
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,703
Up or down?

815
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,955
Up?

816
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,098
Let's stick together.

817
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,794
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

818
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,509
KH PHARMACEUTICAL

819
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,179
Lee Myeong-guk should be
the oldest person in this photo, right?

820
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,059
This person with a scar on his face.

821
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,592
What's that?

822
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:09,973
Who is it?

823
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,857
JEOGANG HIGH SCHOOL
MUSIC CLUB AUDIOPHILE

824
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,442
Bring me the frame from out there.

825
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,526
Okay.

826
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,164
Lee Myeong-guk…

827
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,583
Was he a member of our club?

828
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,962
Where are you going?

829
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,599
Hold this.

830
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,257
It's Lee Myeong-guk.

831
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,634
-Right?
-Yes.

832
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,765
I can't stand the smell.

833
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,252
Answer the phone.

834
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,878
Hurry up and answer.

835
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,422
Hurry.

836
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,007
Please answer.

837
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,348
Yes, Captain?

838
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,393
Take down this address.

839
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:22,689
It's 63-38, 973 Inhyeon-ro,
Jangsu-dong, Anhyeon City.

840
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,775
A body was found in the master bedroom.

841
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,485
Come quickly with KCSI.

842
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,905
Did you say 63-38, 973 Inhyeon-ro?

843
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:31,990
That's right.

844
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,491
Understood, sir.

845
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:43,585
When a person dies,
do they normally release this much fluid?

846
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,004
No, not this much.

847
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,884
Lee Myeong-guk
went missing late last July.

848
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,886
Seven months have passed,

849
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,013
but there's hardly any decomposition.

850
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,724
He must've been frozen
right after his death

851
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,392
and thawed out recently.

852
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,603
That's why there's so much bodily fluid.

853
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,858
Then why…

854
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,236
Why go through the trouble of burying him

855
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,447
-only to bring him back here?
-I want to know too.

856
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,908
They didn't even know
he's been dead for seven months.

857
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,189
Let's go.

858
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,291
What just happened?

859
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,126
Who did this?

860
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:11,339
Jang Jae-gyeong, what's wrong?

861
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,216
Hey, get a hold of yourself.

862
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,009
You can't collapse here.

863
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,928
The police are coming!

864
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,304
Get a hold of yourself.

865
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,389
Jae-gyeong!

866
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,558
-Go to the car.
-What?

867
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,309
Okay, let's go.

868
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,936
Wait a minute.

869
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,062
Hold on.

870
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,189
Can you stand up?

871
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,478
CAPTAIN JANG JAE-GYEONG

872
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,779
Where are we going?

873
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,450
Jae-gyeong, get it together.

874
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,619
Come on, tell me where to go!

875
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,455
The police station.

876
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,623
What?

877
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,169
We just avoided the police,
so why go to the police station?

878
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,422
Go to the police station quickly.

879
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,424
The station…

880
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,637
ANHYEON POLICE STATION

881
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,313
Are you sure you'll be okay?

882
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,192
Jae-gyeong.

883
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,402
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong!

884
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,210
BREAK ROOM

885
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:13,920
Captain.

886
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,463
Captain?

887
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,382
Captain, what's wrong?

888
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,342
Are you sick?

889
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,177
Can you buy me some medicine?

890
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,179
What do you need?

891
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,806
Stomach medicine and…

892
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,600
A fever reducer.

893
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,352
Please wait a moment.

894
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,627
Let go!

895
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,171
Give it to me!

896
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,928
Yes.

897
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,012
I'll keep it safe.

898
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,615
Get it together.

899
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,618
Get it together.

900
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,714
For the next month,
Oh Yun-jin will clean the classroom.

901
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,636
Every day on the board,
write the classroom creed word for word!

902
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,680
And have the class president check it!

903
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,379
QUIET PLEASE

904
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,843
NEW FACES WANTED!

905
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:02,440
AUDIOPHILE CLUB

906
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,330
What is this place? It's so nice.

907
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,415
-Are you done cleaning?
-Yes.

908
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,335
-And the classroom creed?
-I didn't write it.

909
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,921
You've got some nerve, new girl.

910
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,885
Are you the president here too?

911
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:33,888
Yes, but why?

912
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,514
I want to sign up.

913
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,186
If you don't write the creed,
you'll get punished until you graduate.

914
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,146
I'll write it then.

915
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,857
It's not even a big deal.

916
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,823
Once a week,
we take turns cleaning the room

917
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,618
and wiping down the records. Is that okay?

918
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:56,911
-Of course.
-Good.

AUDIOPHILE CLUB
MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION

920
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:05,836
What brings you here?

921
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,047
I came to see you

922
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,383
and to sign up.

923
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,301
You?

924
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,637
Why not? Can't I listen to music?

925
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,430
I'm busy. Give me an application.

926
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,644
Here.

927
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,524
Let me borrow your pen.

928
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,792
Thanks.

929
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,886
We're all in the same club now, right?

930
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,435
Looking forward to it.

931
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,981
Hi.

932
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,025
Hey, Yun-jin.

933
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:22,204
I SAW YOU ALREADY TOOK THE PILL
TAKE THIS ONE SPARINGLY

934
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,115
One of the lemon pops is missing.

935
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,284
Nobody came
to check the CCTV camera, right?

936
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,119
I thought you knew when you came here.

937
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,580
Lee Myeong-guk was mentioned in the will,
but they just found his body!

938
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,915
How can you be so nonchalant?

939
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,833
I heard a medication error occurred

940
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,960
while she received treatment
at Woonjong Medical Center.

941
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:12,671
Did you get the ER footage
from Sunkwang General Hospital?

942
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,006
How did you know, Captain?

943
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,133
-Doctor?
-Let's continue business.

944
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,928
-Who did you first get the drugs from?
-He had tattoos on his fingers.

945
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,763
I think my husband set the bait

946
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,224
-to help uncover who killed him.
-Bait?

947
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,433
Where's that CCTV camera?

948
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:25,976
It's under the awning.

949
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,103
It's this person.

950
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,898
I'll consider it

951
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,275
if they bring me ten billion won
and beg with their head down.

952
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,485
The password.

953
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,654
Give it to me right now!

954
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:48,040
