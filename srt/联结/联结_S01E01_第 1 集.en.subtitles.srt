1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,808
In light of a surge in drug crimes,

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,644
the government
has declared a war on drugs.

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,814
Despite extensive crackdowns
since last year,

5
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,693
drug use in Seoul and the metro area
has spread at an alarming rate.

6
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,029
Early this morning, in Anhyeon New City,

7
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:15,533
police arrested a female in her 30s
for driving under the influence of drugs.

8
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,495
These drugs were seized in Anhyeon City
in the past month.

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,788
They're worth 20 billion won.

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,665
And that's enough to supply 20,000 people.

11
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,251
Anhyeon City is the first local government

12
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,337
to advocate for a drug-free, clean city

13
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,924
and held a ceremony
declaring a war against drugs.

14
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,842
We will eradicate all drugs

15
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,970
so that no drug gangs will set foot

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,056
in Anhyeon City.

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,188
Over there!

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,237
This is the police!

19
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,781
It's the police, open the door!

20
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
You can't go out.

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,912
Arrest them.

22
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,497
Will you join us?

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,921
We arrested the Ogeomi Gang's dealer

24
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,631
at the Anhyeon Nightclub.

25
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,051
Next up is the financier.

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,136
FINANCIER

27
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,648
Grab the drugs!

28
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,194
Don't move.

29
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
Run!

30
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,080
Damn it!

31
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,338
Congratulations.

32
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,091
-Great job.
-Nicely done.

33
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,551
OGEOMI GANG ORGANIZATION CHART

34
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,641
Hey!

35
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,435
Come here, bastard!

36
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,353
Stay still!

37
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,326
WANTED
JANG CHEOL-GU, LEADER

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,294
I'm on a stakeout to catch
Ogeomi Gang's Jang Cheol-gu.

39
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,820
Jang Cheol-gu has entered the restaurant.

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,740
We'll enter in one minute.

41
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,824
Understood.

42
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go in first.

43
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,627
You come in when the driver does.

44
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,711
Yes, sir.

45
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,011
PORK HEAD MEAT RESTAURANT

46
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,638
Jeez, my hair…

47
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,931
Hello, come on in.

48
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,849
-Hello.
-How many? Just one?

49
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,601
-No, two.
-Okay.

50
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,936
Take a seat over there.

51
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,855
-We'll have the pork head meat.
-Okay. Anything to drink?

52
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,023
Soju, please.

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,566
Soju. Got it.

54
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,955
Jeez, it's cold.

55
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,304
-Did you call for backup?
-They'll be here in ten.

56
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,974
This looks good.

57
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,856
-Oh Yun-jin?
-Ms. Oh!

58
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,984
-Yes?
-Over here.

59
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,653
Do you know her?

60
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,323
-Ma'am, you can bring out the meat now.
-Okay.

61
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,577
-It's been a while.
-It really has.

62
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,623
What have you been eating?
Your skin looks incredibly good.

63
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,834
You only treat me to pork head meat.

64
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,878
So why is my skin good?

65
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,963
Maybe it's the collagen.

66
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,011
Enough with the pleasantries.

67
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,555
Just get to the point.

68
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,807
I need your help.

69
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,978
I've settled with the employees
about their unpaid wages.

70
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,147
Really? But this afternoon,

71
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,900
I heard nobody could reach your HR team.

72
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,653
I watched a man in his 50s
cry in front of me.

73
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,156
He reminded me of my father.

74
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,366
HR isn't available all the time.

75
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,287
We need to file an internal report
and get approval

76
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,416
before we can tell them anything
over the phone.

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,959
-Gosh.
-Have some.

78
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,961
Ms. Oh.

79
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,589
You know how it is.

80
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,098
So?

81
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,641
Where's the agreement?

82
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,602
Here.

83
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,148
PETITION WITHDRAWAL FORM

84
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,987
Well, this is awkward.

85
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,490
I've already written the article
to have it published.

86
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,284
Can't you have it pulled?

87
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,870
Everything has been settled.

88
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,123
I can't do that.

89
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,501
You should've paid them to begin with.

90
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,670
Is that so?

91
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,765
When did you get so bold?

92
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,101
This is a fat envelope.

93
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,397
Damn, you scared me.

94
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,316
Think of it as

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,820
our company's official statement
on this matter.

96
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,666
COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT REACHED
REGARDING UNPAID WAGES

97
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,922
What's this?

98
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:49,302
For now, we thought we should inform
the media of our position.

99
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,137
"For now"?

100
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,434
Are you saying there's more to this?

101
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,899
Sir.

102
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,359
When I treat you with respect,
I expect the same in return.

103
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,986
Got it?

104
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,237
At the very least,

105
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,241
shouldn't you compensate me
for wasting my time?

106
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,534
Hold on.

107
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,036
Compensate you?

108
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,929
What are you playing at?

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,641
Take out your phone.

110
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,725
Why?

111
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,478
-What do you need it for?
-Hey.

112
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,855
Take it out right now.

113
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,360
You bastard…

114
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,366
Oh, is this the watch?

115
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,452
The one you got for pulling the story
on Manbae Electronics?

116
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,080
What is it?
Do you want to get a phone out of me?

117
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,624
Have you lost your mind, you bastard?

118
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,251
Let go of me, damn it.

119
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,586
You think you'll last
in this business after this?

120
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,672
I'm older than you.

121
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,550
So don't curse at me.

122
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
And I don't care
if I last in this business.

123
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,928
When I said I was going after you,

124
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,765
every PR manager from other companies
rolled up their sleeves to help me.

125
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,269
I've been taking pictures
of all your goings-on

126
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,854
over the past few weeks.

127
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,483
I'm quitting next week
to take over my father's company,

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,361
so I'll be just fine

129
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,738
since I won't have to deal
with trashy reporters like you.

130
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,617
You're the one who should
worry about lasting in this business.

131
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,619
Now then.

132
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,205
Should I send this to your newsroom?

133
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,790
Or to the police?

134
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,798
Let's split the bill this time.

135
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,009
TOTAL: 17,000 WON

136
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,471
I'll be on my way then.

137
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,764
Okay. Goodbye.

138
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,878
Get back here!

139
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,007
What in the world?

140
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,134
Run!

141
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,100
Get him!

142
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,560
Move!

143
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,649
-Stop!
-Are you okay?

144
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,319
Jang Cheol-gu is escaping toward
the Inju-dong motel district.

145
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,032
Out of my way! Get out of my way!

146
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,451
-Move!
-Let go.

147
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,120
Stop! Police!

148
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,914
Get out of the way!

149
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,169
Excuse me!

150
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,634
-Move!
-Excuse me!

151
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
Damn.

152
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,934
Seriously?

153
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,602
Hey, this way!

154
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,074
You bastards!

155
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,451
Come at me!

156
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,286
Just try me!

157
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,371
Don't come near me!

158
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,457
Damn it.

159
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,376
Don't come near, you bastard!

160
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,514
Next one's a live round.

161
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,023
Stop!

162
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,233
Damn!

163
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,411
Jang Cheol-gu.

164
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,313
Damn it.

165
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,155
I give up.

166
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,324
I give up. You win.

167
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,327
Look, my hands are empty.

168
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,580
So you can't hit me, okay?

169
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
Hey.

170
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,669
Arrest me.

171
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,465
I'm cold.

172
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,842
Damn!

173
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,804
Look who we have here.

174
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,389
Don't do it.

175
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,894
Jang Cheol-gu. Don't do it.

176
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,235
Myeong-ho!

177
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,945
Myeong-ho!

178
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,693

Inspector Jang Jae-gyeong.

This investigation concerns the incident
on January 22nd, 2024,

183
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,379
where Jang Cheol-gu,
the wanted leader of Ogeomi Gang,

184
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,464
a Southern Gyeonggi drug organization,

185
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,758
was arrested on the rooftop
of the Sujeong Motel in Anhyeon City.

186
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,012
We're investigating the potential misuse
of a firearm during the arrest.

187
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,514
Describe what happened on the rooftop.

188
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,393
According to a report
by Assistant Inspector Kim Chang-su,

189
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,354
he heard a gunshot
prior to arriving at the scene.

190
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,401
So your statement is the only one
that describes the rooftop situation.

191
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,321
But Jang Cheol-gu's account is different.

192
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,949
It's as it says
in my statement and forensic report.

193
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,953
Jang Cheol-gu was shot
in the left Achilles tendon.

194
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,040
Forensics indicates
he was shot at close range.

195
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,292
-Correct?
-Yes.

196
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll get straight to the point.

197
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,799
On December 11th of last year,
one month prior to Jang's arrest,

198
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,802
Assistant Inspector An Myeong-ho
suffered a serious injury

199
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,554
to his left Achilles tendon
during an operation.

200
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,682
I hear he's a close junior colleague.

201
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,477
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

202
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,479
Is that what it was?

203
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,440
Arrest me.

204
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,524
Okay?

205
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,751
Police Duty Act, Article 10-2.

206
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,462
Officers may use firearms
when arresting flagrant offenders

207
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,173
or those who have committed crimes

208
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,800
punishable by a three-year sentence.

209
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,552
Per protocol, I fired two warning shots.

210
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,055
When the suspect charged at me
with a weapon in hand,

211
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,307
I fired a live round at his lower body.

212
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,144
I wasn't aiming for a specific area
nor was there any need to.

213
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,813
That is all.

214
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,409
SENIOR INSPECTOR JANG JAE-GYEONG
SPECIAL PROMOTION CEREMONY

215
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,499
Goodbye, sir.

216
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,965
-Good for you!
-Great job!

217
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,177
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.

218
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,554
-Congrats.
-It's all thanks to you.

219
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,972
Thank you.

220
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,308
You look good.

221
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
I got a lot of rest.

222
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,646
I start rehab next week.

223
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,939
That's great.

224
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,442
Otherwise, you'll get used to resting.

225
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,278
Congratulations, sir.

226
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,821
Thank you.

227
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,073
And…

228
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,367
Thank you, sir.

229
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,288
Return to duty soon.

230
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,460
You guys…

231
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,213
Damn it, you're making me
get teary-eyed on a happy day.

232
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,717
How much is the money gift?
Enough to treat us to some beef?

233
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,178
I haven't checked, but I think so.

234
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,554
Nice.

235
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,347
Instead of just talking,

236
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,349
you should buy us some beef, too,

237
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,686
if you want to make Myeong-ho
want to return faster.

238
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,271
Words alone won't cut it.

239
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,359
I know a place that'll slaughter a cow
if I give them a call.

240
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,613
-Should I call them?
-Sounds good. Let's do it.

241
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,699
Chief!

242
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,868
Congratulations, Senior Inspector Jang.

243
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,703
Thank you for coming, sir.

244
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,996
What do you mean?

245
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,332
You got a special promotion,
so of course I should come.

246
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,833
Of course.

247
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,585
If it weren't for you,

248
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,212
the esteemed commissioner

249
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,256
wouldn't have patted
our chief on the shoulder.

250
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,633
Where was it again?

251
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,676
-Was it here?
-Hey, don't touch it.

252
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,429
Don't even think about making it dirty.

253
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,891
You might as well
get it preserved and hang it up.

254
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,810
That's enough nonsense.

255
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,814
In any case, the Narcotics Unit
is the pride of Anhyeon Police Station.

256
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,732
-Nicely done, everyone.
-Thank you, sir.

257
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,318
I'll set up a time and place soon

258
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,362
so that we can enjoy a good barbecue!

259
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,866
-How about a photo?
-Sure.

260
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,577
Inspector Yoo, can you take our photo?

261
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,371
-Senior Inspector Yoo.
-Yes, Chief?

262
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,622
Come over here.

263
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,375
Over here.

264
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,501
I'm a senior inspector too.

265
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,336
Then drop the formalities.

266
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,755
On the count of three, let's say,

267
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,757
"Good luck, Senior Inspector Jang!"

268
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,883
Sounds good.

269
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,261
One, two, three.

270
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,721
-Good luck, Senior Inspector Jang!
-Good luck, Senior Inspector Jang!

271
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,481
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

272
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,576
MONEY GIFT

273
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,328
Captain! You forgot your money gift.

274
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,497
Drop it off to Myeong-ho.

275
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,003
He should've given it to him earlier.

276
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,804

JANG CHEOL-GU

283
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
Mom.

284
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,368
I got promoted today.

285
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,045
It's been a while.

286
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,518
Congratulations on the promotion.

287
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,729
I read it in the paper.

288
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,523
You started as an officer
and made senior inspector.

289
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,525
That's no easy feat.

290
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,070
I doubt you're here to congratulate me.

291
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,238
Tell me why you're here.

292
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,074
I just…

293
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,245
I wanted to see you before it's too late.

294
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,080
"Before it's too late"?

295
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,302
It's been 20 years.

296
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,179
Jae-gyeong.

297
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,681
It can't get any later than that.

298
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,019
If it's about that again, just leave.

299
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,481
You're right.

300
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,816
It's been 20 years.

301
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,485
During that time,

302
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,029
I regretted it so much.

303
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,532
If I'd just listened to you,

304
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,202
our relationship would be

305
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,621
a lot different now.

306
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,042
I'm sorry, Jae-gyeong.

307
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,586
Back then,

308
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,839
I was too foolish.

309
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,300
And I was a coward.

310
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,512
It's late, but I--

311
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,432
You're right.
You were foolish and cowardly.

312
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,601
And you were blinded by greed.

313
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,478
-Jae-gyeong…
-I understand.

314
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,481
I've seen many like you
while working as an officer.

315
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,275
Foolish and cowardly yet blinded by greed.

316
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,362
-Jae-gyeong.
-They've all been punished, but you?

317
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:30,283
You're still living it up
with those cool friends of yours, right?

318
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,079
What is it?

319
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,164
Do you still feel guilty
about what happened?

320
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,718
If you want my forgiveness
for your peace of mind…

321
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,430
I can't give it to you.

322
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,518
Consider that your punishment.

323
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,538
I know it's too late.

324
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,290
But…

325
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,208
I'm still going to try.

326
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,503
But I came here to tell you this.

327
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,841
I want you to know
that I'll set things right.

328
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721
I'll go now.

329
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,405
Are you Jang Jae-gyeong?

330
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,823
Yes, sir.

331
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,327
Is everything in the police report
that you filed true?

332
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,204
Did you witness it yourself?

333
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,499
Jun-seo.

334
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,378
You saw it. Tell them what you saw.

335
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,172
The report states

336
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,508
that Park Jun-seo witnessed the scene.

337
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,677
Did you really witness it?

338
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,557
No, that's not true.

339
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,687
I didn't see anything.

340
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,022
Jun-seo!

341
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,106
I…

342
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,192
I didn't see anything.

343
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,444
Park Jun-seo.

344
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,239
We're friends.
Why did you hide it from me?

345
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,365
I didn't!

346
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,503
I LOVE MOM

347
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,681
Come on, I'm almost done.

348
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,103
Seriously.

349
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,688
KIM U-SEONG

350
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,357
They don't even know
how to prioritize articles.

351
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,192
They don't deserve to get paid.

352
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,780
I'm almost done,
so tell them to shut up and stop nagging.

353
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,573
He wants you to return.

354
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,369
Why?

355
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,246
I don't know. He said to return for now.

356
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,417
But…

357
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,963
He told me to stay home and edit
because he couldn't stand me.

358
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,589
What is it?

359
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,718
Has ad revenue gone down
since I've been gone?

360
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,806
The director smoothed things over
with Doseong Chemical and the PR manager,

361
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,890
so he said to come back.

362
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,606
How am I going to tolerate his boasting?

363
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,068
Okay.

364
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,154
Tell him I'll be there soon.

365
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,118
Yes!

366
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,412
Hold on, I need to…

367
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,417
The news said there was
heavy snowfall in Toronto

368
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,252
and that everything was closed.

369
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,004
Did Ye-eun go to kindergarten?

370
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,505
What's she doing?

371
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,633
She's asleep already?

372
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:21,848
-Hello.
-Hello.

373
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,351
-Mom.
-I've been waiting for you.

374
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,810
Goodbye, ma'am.

375
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
-I'm off.
-Take care.

376
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,193
Take care.

377
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,819
-See you!
-You too!

378
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,321
Mom!

379
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,906
I have to get going.

380
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,407
Take care.

381
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,828
Okay, stop nagging me about child support.

382
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,122
You're not making good
on the divorce terms either.

383
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,710
Ye-eun looks thinner in recent pictures.

384
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:55,715
I know you've been using work as an excuse
to just feed her burgers and frozen pizza.

385
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,343
If you keep this up, I'll--

386
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,970
Hey!

387
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,474
Damn it.

388
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,686
Hello?

389
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,313
Hello?

390
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,278
Excuse me.

391
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,363
Look at this.

392
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,281
The screen is cracked. What'll you do now?

393
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,576
Seriously.

394
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,370
Listen, lady.

395
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,296
What's that?

396
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,383
Ma'am?

397
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,853
Mom?

398
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,446
Are you okay?

399
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,122
Excuse me!

400
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,977
"The phone screen got damaged,

401
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,563
so in order to receive compensation,

402
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,690
I followed her inside."

403
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,858
By the way, Detective…

404
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,193
Yes?

405
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,569
They were drugs, right?

406
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,573
Is it a new type of drug?

407
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,241
Well…

408
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,494
We're still investigating.

409
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,037
I see.

410
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,916
It really must be a new type

411
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,711
if a narcotics detective
doesn't recognize it.

412
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,088
It must be new.

413
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,050
It must be really addictive

414
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,886
seeing how she took it on the spot.

415
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,111
Here.

416
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,950
Yoo Yeong-mi.
She was a 36-year-old housewife.

417
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,577
She went to get her daughter
from kindergarten

418
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,913
when she got the drugs
and took them right there.

419
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,123
She was running from a witness

420
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,084
when she got hit by a truck
and died instantly.

421
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,503
-Did we request an analysis?
-Su-hyeon just did.

422
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,213
What's this now?

423
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,507
There's no end to this.

424
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,175
That woman looks familiar.

425
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,845
-Yes?
-Step out for a second.

426
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,351
Captain, doesn't she look familiar?

427
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,019
Where have we seen her before?

428
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,897
-Yes, Captain?
-Hey.

429
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,441
Be careful. She's a reporter
at Anhyeon Economic Daily.

430
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,735
Right, from the pork head meat restaurant.

431
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,738
If you answer all her questions,
your name will be in the paper.

432
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,448
I'll be careful, sir.

433
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
-Let's go to the scene.
-Okay.

434
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,784
-See you later.
-Okay.

435
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,119
Hey!

436
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,121
Don't forget our plans for later.

437
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,168
ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY

438
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,006
Why are you so late?

439
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,008
I called you ages ago
to return immediately.

440
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,051
I have my reasons.

441
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,512
-Follow me.
-Okay.

442
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,142
Oh Yun-jin, who do you think you are?

443
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,102
-Do you know what time--
-Hold on.

444
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,856
I know what you're about to say.

445
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:44,277
I'll listen to your boasting later
on how you got me reinstated.

446
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,486
But for now,

447
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,196
listen to what I say.

448
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,874
I think I was born to be a reporter.

449
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,043
So today…

450
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,297
It's as if they knew
it was my first day back to work.

451
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,383
Someone took drugs
and died in front of me.

452
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,804
And it's a new drug
the police have never heard of before.

453
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,601
It feels like some higher power

454
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,812
just dropped an exclusive in my lap.

455
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,901
Listen to that sizzle.

456
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,488
It's different
than when you grill pork, right?

457
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,240
-I'll pour you a shot.
-Was this cow really slaughtered today?

458
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,035
Fresh beef isn't good.
Aged beef tastes better.

459
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:38,539
-But it was to be slaughtered today.
-Why do you take everything so literally?

460
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,251
Slaughtering a cow today
is just a symbolic expression.

461
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,629
Can you do a good job investigating
being that slow?

462
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,255
Can you?

463
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,883
Water for you.

464
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,219
Let me fill your glass.

465
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,180
Cheers, everyone.

466
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,850
To our newly promoted
Senior Inspector Jang!

467
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,814
And to Myeong-ho returning to duty soon!

468
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,857
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

469
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:05,942
Myeong-ho, bottoms up.

470
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,153
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

471
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,739
Bottoms up!

472
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,616
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

473
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,535
Go!

474
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,223

476
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,533
Captain!

477
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,951
-Captain!
-Captain!

478
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,036
I don't have money.

479
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,246
One, two, three.

480
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,206
-Thank you for dinner.
-Thank you for dinner.

481
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,208
Dinner was great, thanks to you.

482
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,752
Where are we going next?

483
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,754
-Second round.
-Hey, you punk.

484
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,881
Go home early.

485
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,467
Oh Su-hyeon, you're on duty tomorrow!

486
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,927
Our dear Myeong-ho.

487
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,556
I hope rehab goes well
so that you return soon.

488
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,099
I'll be back soon.

489
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,477
Thank you for coming.

490
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,479
-Thank you.
-Take care.

491
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,938
Kim Chang-su!

492
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,356
Go grab a cab for them.

493
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,067
-Got it!
-It's okay.

494
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,027
-You don't have to.
-It's no problem.

495
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,528
-Let's go.
-It's okay.

496
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,197
-Bye.
-See you Monday!

497
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,281
Get home safely!

498
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,365
-Take care!
-Take care!

499
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:45,875
Where are you going?

500
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,711
The restroom. Go on ahead.

501
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,879
Take care, sir!

502
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,963
Take care.

our SOS signal, right?

Captain!

524
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,805
Where have you been these past three days?

525
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,516
Captain?

530
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,675
Where am I?

535
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,490

00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,136
Don't you remember?

541
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,806
Is today Monday, February 26th?

542
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,350
What time is it?

543
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,477
It's 7:26 a.m.

544
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,821
Are you okay?

545
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,905
I'm fine.

546
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,699
-What?
-I'm fine.

547
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,578
Hold on.

548
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,500
MONDAY, 26TH

549
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,981
This stop is Anhyeon City Station.

550
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,193
The doors are on your right.

551
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,570
The doors are closing.

552
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,979
This stop is Jeonghoon Station.

553
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,941
The doors are on your right.

554
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,437
Red hair clip.

555
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,139
I'm sorry.

556
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,955
I'm a police officer.
Take this to a nearby station.

557
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,226
Police. Hands up.

558
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,395
Or else I'll shoot.

559
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,099
The man took the gun.

560
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,581
Don't say a word.

561
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,668
I'll be back, so don't say anything.

562
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,550
Keep the gate locked
at all times from now on.

563
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,310
MISSED CALLS
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR KIM CHANG-SU

564
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,233
Did you catch her?

565
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,609
Yes, what about you?

566
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,278
I lost him. Who's the woman?

567
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
I think she's a cash courier.

568
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,990
She said she was offered 300,000 won

569
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,034
to leave a backpack in a public locker.

570
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,746
We also got word
from the Jeonghoon 3-dong police.

571
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,207
They recovered the drugs from the street.

572
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,127
And the section chief wants you back.

573
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,670
She wants to know what's going on.

574
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,464
Okay, get her statement and wait for me.

575
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,052
Hello.

576
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,242
PARK JUN-SEO

577
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,664
The phone is turned off.

578
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:54,126
After the beep,
you will be connected to voicemail.

579
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,521
That'll be 4,400 won.

580
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,781
Sir?

581
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,386
Captain?

582
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,691
FROM DOCTOR

583
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,557
FROM DOCTOR

584
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,350
Don't try so hard.

585
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,686
Take your pill, and I'll see you soon.

586
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,697
Can you pull up?

587
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,781
Okay.

588
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,482
-Safety shoes!
-Check!

589
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,984
-Safety hat!
-Check!

590
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,445
-Safety check complete!
-Safety check complete!

591
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,488
-Let's have a good day.
-Okay.

592
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,663
Who did you drink with yesterday?

593
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,833
I didn't drink yesterday.
I can't drink on Sundays.

594
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,294
Really? But you smell like alcohol.

595
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
I was at home all day.

596
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,550
What's wrong?

597
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,646
Over here.

598
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,606
There's a dead person here!

599
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,650
-There's a dead body!
-What is it?

600
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,942
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

601
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,194
Sir!

602
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,112
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

603
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,364
You must be busy.

604
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,573
Yes.

605
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,159
I live in Building 102, Unit 315.

606
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:18,622
Remember the lady who died
in a traffic accident a few days ago?

607
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,917
She lived in my building.
Do you know which unit?

608
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,294
I was told not to say.

609
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,506
Who? The police?

610
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,882
No, not the police.

611
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,593
The resident representative.

612
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,886
The resident representative?

613
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,931
Seriously, that person…

614
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,017
Who do they think they are
ordering you around?

615
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,312
They're acting as if
they're the president, right?

616
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,397
Jeez.

617
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,190
Here. Have this while it's warm.

618
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,692
You shouldn't have.

619
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,073
So?

620
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,617
Which unit is it?

621
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,411
Unit 215.

622
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,038
That's right below me.

623
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,709
This is why they say no one knows

624
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,503
if your neighbor is dead or alive
when you live in an apartment.

625
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,629
Right.

626
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,589
By the way…

627
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,801
What do you know about her family?

628
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,851
Excuse me.

629
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,354
Si-jeong, it's been a while.

630
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,023
I'm a bit busy right now…

631
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:30,819
What?

632
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,990
Who did you say died?

633
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,132
The man took the gun.

634
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,227
No signs of hallucinations.

635
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,981
Nausea and dizziness.

636
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,441
Hand tremors.

637
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,528
This means my body is rejecting the drug.

638
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:15,947
Who is it?

639
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,451
Who could have done this to me?

640
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,666
Jang Cheol-gu.

641
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,752
Yes, Jang Cheol-gu.

642
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,378
You did this to get revenge.

643
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,298
Jae-gyeong.

644
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,841
One-eight-eight-two.

645
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,761
One-eight-eight-two.

646
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,929
It's Park Jun-seo.

647
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,423
Nobody can know about this right now.

648
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,093
Not now. Nobody can know.

649
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,078
Where's Jang?

650
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,413
He'll be here shortly.

651
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,708
Why were you there?

652
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,544
Captain Jang sent me a text
late last night. Here.

653
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,548
Who's this Doctor?

654
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,216
Captain Jang doesn't know either.

655
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,467
And what's 1-8-8-2?

656
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,802
That too.

657
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,054
So you know nothing.

658
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,603
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM

659
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,979
-Senior Inspector Jang?
-He's here.

660
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,398
You don't look good.

661
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,025
And what's with your arm?

662
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,986
-Did you find out anything new?
-No, that was it.

663
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,031
But can't we still get a sketch of the guy
who told her to leave the backpack?

664
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,575
We're waiting for a sketch artist to come.

665
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,952
Who tipped you off?

666
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,081
Who is this Doctor,
and what does 1-8-8-2 mean?

667
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,708
I don't know.

668
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,418
I just texted you a phone number.

669
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,795
-Find out who it belongs to and tell me.
-Yes, sir.

670
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,798
And Ogeomi Gang's Jang Cheol-gu.
Which hospital is he at?

671
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,300
Sunkwang General Hospital. Third floor.

672
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:57,609
What should I do with this?

673
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,944
Did you lift all the prints?

674
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,028
Yes, sir.

675
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,571
Hold on to it for now.

676
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,615
I was really surprised.

677
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,741
Why?

678
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,077
What prosecutor comes so quickly
for a postmortem?

679
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,080
Do you have a problem
with them being quick?

680
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,539
I'm just saying.

681
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,503
They usually send new prosecutors
for unnatural death postmortems.

682
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,797
But a deputy chief prosecutor
rushed over here.

683
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,257
I know that prosecutor well.

684
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,592
Really?

685
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,677
He's a good person

686
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,261
and good at his job.

687
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,181
-What is it?
-I didn't need a password

688
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,849
to unlock this phone.

689
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,935
That's good.

690
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,187
Hey.

691
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,898
Senior Inspector Jang.

692
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,359
Congratulations on the promotion.

693
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,570
You and I are the same rank now.

694
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,242
Everything went well
with the Inspection Division, right?

695
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,953
PARK JUN-SEO

696
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,080
Yes.

697
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,254
-Wait, what?
-What is it?

698
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,172
JANG JAE-GYEONG

699
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,674
What's going on? Answer it.

700
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,885
-Park Jun-seo.
-Hello?

701
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,263
Park Jun-seo, where are you right now?

702
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,890
Park Jun-seo.

703
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,184
Jun-seo?

704
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,269
Captain Jang?

705
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,374
He fell to his death
at a construction site in Pilo-dong.

706
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,876
The estimated time of death

707
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,962
is between 11:30 p.m.
and midnight last Friday.

708
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,497
Take me to Sunkwang General Hospital.

709
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,342
You still remember our SOS signal, right?

710
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,054
One-eight-eight-two.

711
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,309
Captain.

712
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:13,972
No.

713
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,475
I can't let them find
traces of drugs in my blood.

714
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,730
Thank you.

715
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,434
-Have you eaten yet?
-Yes, I have.

716
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,104
Really?

717
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,857
See you later.

718
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,112
Hello, I'm here.

719
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,992
TREATMENT ZONE A

720
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,760
Patients aren't allowed here.

721
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,513
Are you okay?

722
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,475
Excuse me! Open the door!

723
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,645
Excuse me!

724
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,230
Sir, open the door!

725
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,773
Sir!

726
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,066
Open the door!

727
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,734
I need to find it.

728
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,237
I must find my blood.

729
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:54,989
Sir!

730
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,286
JANG JAE-GYEONG

731
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,214
Sir!

732
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,301
Sir, open the door!

733
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,346
Quickly!

734
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,973
Sir, open the door.

735
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,184
Sir?

736
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,896
-It won't open?
-No.

737
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,856
Sir, open the door.

738
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,024
Tell them to come quickly!

739
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:32,986
Sir!

740
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,072
Sir!

741
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,408
Hurry and open the door.

742
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,995
Sir, open the door.

743
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,791
If you don't, I'll call the police.

744
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,884
FROM DOCTOR

745
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,472
Be careful from now on.

746
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,516
I have to overcome this.

747
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,852
He fell to his death
at a construction site in Pilo-dong.

748
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,895
That's why I'm here.

749
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,690
To let you know
that I'll set things right.

750
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,774
Sir!

751
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,234
I can do this.

752
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,528
I'll call the police.

753
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,239
Open the door right now!

754
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,125
Open the door!

755
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,209
Here's the key.

756
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,235
MARCH 2005

757
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,237
Classroom, 1-8-8-2.

758
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,918
What is it? Why did you call me?

759
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,672
That was fast.

760
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,965
That was under three minutes.

761
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,968
Park Jun-seo.

762
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,304
I told you not to use
1-8-8-2 just whenever.

763
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:24,597
Hey!

764
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,183
Why are you so strong?

765
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:28,434
Seriously!

766
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,651
What are you listening to?

767
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,153
What?

768
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,030
What are you listening to?

769
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,826
-Do you want to listen?
-Forget it.

770
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,369
That's a bit much.

771
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,455
A new student is coming tomorrow.

772
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,749
Who cares?

773
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,753
I went to the teachers' office
and saw her photo on the desk.

774
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,715
She's from Seoul and looks pretty.

775
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,010
You just like her
because she's from Seoul.

776
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,610
Does a friend always have to be helpful?

777
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,737
Don't you agree, sir?

778
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,072
That police officer

779
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,448
looked like a drug addict.

780
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,868
I don't do drugs.
I arrest the ones who do them.

781
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,246
Who kidnapped and drugged me that night?

782
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,832
The body should be
at the Anhyeon University Hospital morgue.

783
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,916
We need an autopsy.

784
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,043
Too many things are suspicious
about Jun-seo's death.

785
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,128
Jae-gyeong, it's been a long time.

786
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,340
The people who talked to Jun-seo
right before he died.

787
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:05,758
Hey!

788
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,968
In the last 20 years,

789
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,345
they went through thick and thin
with Jun-seo.

790
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,889
What did you talk about
the day before Jun-seo died?

791
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,141
You can give it to me.
I'm Park Jun-seo's friend.

792
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,185
He left a will before he died.

793
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,687
Get him!

794
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,690
You killed Park Jun-seo.

795
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,067
This is your last chance.

796
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:33,786
