00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:04,933
(Connection)

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:09,938
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:09,962 --> 00:01:14,662
(Previously)

4
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,112
Please give me your attention
for a moment.

5
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:20,082
Before Jun Seo died, he left a will.

6
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,482
He signed up for life insurance...

7
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,552
worth a total of five million dollars
under the name...

8
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,091
of his fully-owned corporation,
Audiophile.

9
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,822
He indicated the legatee
of his company's full shares...

10
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:32,762
and the beneficiary
of the five million dollars.

11
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,602
"To Jang Jae Gyeong..."

12
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,631
"and Oh Yoon Jin..."

13
00:01:39,472 --> 00:01:41,002
What is this?

14
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,742
Jae Gyeong?

15
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,642
"in equally divided portions."

16
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,121
I know...

17
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,852
I'm late.

18
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,822
However,

19
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,592
I came to tell you that.

20
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:05,161
I'll put everything back in order.

21
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,632
This happened just a day
after he came to see me.

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,901
How was he planning
to put everything back in order?

23
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:14,942
If he signed up for insurance
just a week ago,

24
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,372
did he feel like his life was threatened?

25
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,211
But why me and Yoon Jin?

26
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:24,211
The only clue that connects
to the one who drugged me...

27
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:27,081
is this text
that has Jun Seo's SOS code in it.

28
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:31,298
Jun Seo was a realtor,
so what did he have to do with drugs?

29
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,551
It's all my fault.

30
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,991
Who did this to me?

31
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,461
I made sure to tell him...

32
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:41,601
he wouldn't get any payment
if he committed suicide within two years.

33
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,672
No... I just...

34
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:47,902
I think it's all my fault.

35
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,642
What should I do, Jae Gyeong?

36
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,441
Jae Gyeong?

37
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,581
Are you listening to me?

38
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,792
Sorry for the long wait.

39
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:09,991
Not at all.

40
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:12,192
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

41
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,702
You must've been so flustered earlier.

42
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,702
It's cold. Let's hurry back.

43
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:30,451
Hey, Ji Yeon.

44
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,411
Yes?

45
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:34,622
I did some thinking.

46
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:36,752
Jun Seo.

47
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:39,221
How about doing an autopsy?

48
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,338
What?

49
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:42,462
Well...

50
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,862
Jun Seo wasn't the type to kill himself.

51
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:48,231
Am I wrong?

52
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,731
Shouldn't we do everything we can?

53
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:54,842
If...

54
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,411
it wasn't suicide...

55
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:02,112
So it wasn't a suicide?

56
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,351
Did someone kill my husband?

57
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:07,851
No, well...

58
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,252
Just in case,
since it could be a possibility.

59
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:15,462
If an autopsy's done
and something is found,

60
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,532
they will all do something, you know.

61
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,091
You saw for yourself.

62
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,261
Among his friends...

63
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,171
is a prosecutor and a detective.

64
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,441
And a journalist too.

65
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,552
Don't cry.

66
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:44,122
I'll meet with Tae Jin and the doctor
and talk about it.

67
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:47,161
Try to consider...

68
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:50,261
doing an autopsy.

69
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:04,471
(Connection)

70
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,141
(Episode 3)

71
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,421
When did you know
about the insurance policy?

72
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:16,821
Just now.

73
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,622
Even if you just found out.

74
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,962
Why didn't you discuss it with me
if you knew there was a will?

75
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:26,331
Why did you read it out
in front of everyone?

76
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:29,602
Hey.

77
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,731
Jang Jae Gyeong met with Heo Joo Song.

78
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,802
It was a matter of time
before he learned about the will.

79
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,511
Now that I announced it to everyone,

80
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,672
whatever Jae Gyeong says now,

81
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,011
people will think
it's about the insurance.

82
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,781
Guys.

83
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:49,321
What did Jun Seo actually say
on the phone...

84
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,051
before he died?

85
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,151
Hey.

86
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,191
What do you mean "actually?"

87
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,691
It was exactly as Jong Soo said.

88
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,761
So...

89
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,531
what was Jun Seo thinking when he made...

90
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,131
two people he wasn't close with
the beneficiaries?

91
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:07,971
If we feel this disappointed,
how must his wife feel?

92
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,071
Exactly.

93
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,812
If it turns out
that Jun Seo didn't kill himself,

94
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:13,911
they can take
the whole five million dollars.

95
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:15,011
Darn you.

96
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,352
Nothing changes.

97
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,351
It's a suicide case.

98
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:26,122
So no one will get any money.

99
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,222
Then...

100
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,021
what about the autopsy?

101
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,591
There can't be an autopsy.

102
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:35,401
This is my opinion as a prosecutor.

103
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,231
In this kind of situation,

104
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,831
any other body would've been autopsied.

105
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,701
Jang Jae Gyeong's making a fuss right now,

106
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,912
but later on,
my office will get suspicious too.

107
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,112
It's better...

108
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:46,611
to perform an autopsy.

109
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,812
Hey.

110
00:06:57,652 --> 00:06:58,752
Guys.

111
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,622
Can you wait outside?

112
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:03,762
Let's go.

113
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,931
(Family Room)

114
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,062
Come on.

115
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,002
They whisper about
the important stuff among themselves.

116
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,402
We were all class officers.

117
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,972
Why are we discriminated against?

118
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:20,081
Be quiet. They might hear.

119
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:23,812
Hey.

120
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:25,781
Sang Eui.

121
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,881
- What?
- Come here.

122
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,821
What?

123
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,062
Where was it?

124
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:35,492
Where Jun Seo was found dead.

125
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,031
It was Pilo-dong.

126
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,232
The old Fashion Town building.

127
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,002
Fashion Town?

128
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:47,841
The building under construction
a bit before the three-way intersection?

129
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,841
Yes.

130
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,711
Okay. You can go.

131
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,312
What?

132
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:02,081
Are you afraid something will show up
in the autopsy?

133
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,352
There's no guarantee nothing will.

134
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,422
I'm bothered there was no suicide note.

135
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,391
Think about the will.
That was unexpected too.

136
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:16,802
So,

137
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:21,201
what did Jun Seo say to you guys
on the phone before he died?

138
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,242
Other than what I know.

139
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,141
Did he say anything else?

140
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:28,912
No.

141
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:31,612
Not to me.

142
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,722
It might be extra pressure on me,

143
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,521
but let's skip the autopsy.

144
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:40,622
Officially,

145
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,191
we don't want to cut open our friend.

146
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,261
Actually,

147
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,002
on the written will,

148
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,932
there is...

149
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,941
one more name we all know.

150
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:56,742
What?

151
00:08:58,212 --> 00:08:59,312
Who is it?

152
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,011
Lee Myung Guk.

153
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:06,252
Lee Myung Guk.

154
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:08,821
Lee Myung Guk?

155
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:10,298
Yes, Lee Myung Guk.

156
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,352
- Do you know the name?
- No. Do you?

157
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,761
I don't either.

158
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,722
That's weird.

159
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:19,132
Why didn't Tae Jin read out that name too?

160
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,731
Was it because we didn't know the person?

161
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,162
Didn't Jun Seo tell you anything?

162
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,831
Didn't you ask who that was?

163
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:29,048
Well, yes. I guess I should've asked.

164
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:32,141
Given the situation, didn't you
want to know who Lee Myung Guk was?

165
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,941
Do you think it's easy
to find someone with just a name?

166
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:43,506
(Lee Myung Guk, March 12, 1967,
670312-11353522)

167
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:45,951
Seriously?

168
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:47,622
(Funeral Hall)

169
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,791
Gosh.

170
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:50,656
(Lee Myung Guk, March 12, 1967,
670312-11353522)

171
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,232
They're back.

172
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,901
You're still here.

173
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,441
Did something happen in the car?

174
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:01,541
What?

175
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:03,342
No.

176
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,112
Hey, I could ask you.

177
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,112
- Say you get a life insurance policy.
- Yes.

178
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:08,342
If you kill yourself right after,

179
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,212
you don't get the money, do you?

180
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,222
Why do you suddenly want to know?

181
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,051
What? Well,

182
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:17,822
someone asked me.

183
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,862
Their friend committed suicide...

184
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:21,962
- and the policy...
- Which friend?

185
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,362
You wouldn't know them.

186
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,461
Tell us anyway.

187
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,431
What's up with you two?

188
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,161
It's a friend from my personal life.

189
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,232
I have lots of friends.

190
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:31,732
How much is the claim for?

191
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,901
How much did they say it was?

192
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,202
Five million dollars?

193
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,082
You saw the written will too.

194
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:44,911
Did you tell Jun Seo's wife?

195
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,951
- What?
- Did you tell her?

196
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,752
That Jun Seo named us as beneficiaries?

197
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:50,992
Do you think I'm crazy?

198
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:52,391
How did you find out?

199
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:01,131
Here.

200
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,571
Did you go through their mail?

201
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,431
It seemed weird.

202
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,671
The guy's dead,

203
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:09,442
and he had a pile of mail
from insurance companies.

204
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:13,271
I didn't mean to
go through the mail but then...

205
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,381
Wait.

206
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,612
How did you find out?

207
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,651
I helped him take out all these policies.

208
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,021
I see.

209
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:26,021
That works out, then.

210
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,921
I was wondering how to explain this.

211
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,592
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

212
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:31,992
They should do an autopsy.

213
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,061
You were very right earlier.

214
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,431
Too many things are suspicious.

215
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,872
Do you think they'll find something
in the autopsy?

216
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,411
It's a clear proof of murder.

217
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,181
Goodness.

218
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,252
(The late Park Jun Seo)

219
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,391
Ji Yeon.

220
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,002
Jang Jae Gyeong.

221
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,041
You're still here.

222
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,602
I thought you'd left.

223
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,687
Let's do the autopsy.

224
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,171
I'll convince Ji Yeon.

225
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,281
Are you doing this
because you want the insurance money?

226
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:26,281
You seem to be mistaken.

227
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:30,051
It's better for you guys
if Jun Seo killed himself.

228
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,151
If not,

229
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,061
you three would be
at the top of the suspect list.

230
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,831
You and I both
investigate cases for a living.

231
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,602
Let's forget about the nonsense.

232
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:44,201
Let's persuade Ji Yeon
and rush the autopsy.

233
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,372
You seem pretty sure...

234
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:48,041
something will show up
if an autopsy is done.

235
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,478
That's suspicious.

236
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,612
Hey, Tae Jin.

237
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:52,242
Jun Seo took out...

238
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,811
the policies a week before he died.

239
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:56,742
What do you think this means?

240
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:59,281
It means he wants someone
to look into his death, doesn't it?

241
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,281
What do they think they're doing?

242
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,421
Why?

243
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,952
You wanted to reveal the truth.

244
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,592
Wasn't this what you wanted?

245
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,962
But...

246
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,462
you know what we must reveal first
in order to reveal the rest, don't you?

247
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,801
You and I both make a living
doing investigations.

248
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,972
You must be devastated,

249
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:27,041
but this is all just part
of the investigation.

250
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:28,718
I'm Prosecutor Park Tae Jin from Anhyun
District Public Prosecutor's Office.

251
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:29,911
What is going on?

252
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:32,051
I'm Lieutenant Park In Soo
of Anhyeon Police Station.

253
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,551
There's something
we need to investigate...

254
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:36,122
regarding Mr. Park Jun Seo's death.

255
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:37,992
Is that so?

256
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:41,661
You should come with us too,
Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong.

257
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,632
I'll explain to you on the way.

258
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,931
Is this perhaps about the insurance
and his will?

259
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,102
Hey, Park Tae Jin.

260
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,072
What do you mean, a will?

261
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:54,442
Ji Yeon, I think it'd be better
if I explained that to you.

262
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,702
You, be quiet.

263
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,342
I should've told you about it first.

264
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,541
Jun Seo...

265
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:04,181
took out a five-million-dollar
life insurance policy before he died.

266
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:05,911
But...

267
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,122
the beneficiary wasn't you
but these two people here.

268
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,752
For five million dollars.

269
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,462
That's what I find strange too.

270
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:19,962
It doesn't make sense that he'd leave
that much money to me,

271
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,262
a friend he rarely contacts.

272
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,462
- So...
- So,

273
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,318
is that why you wanted to do an autopsy?

274
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,002
- No, that's not it.
- No, that's...

275
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,041
You said my husband wasn't someone
who'd commit suicide!

276
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,141
But...

277
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,242
I still think the same.

278
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,252
- Also...
- Because of the insurance money?

279
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,521
This is all about that insurance money,
isn't it?

280
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,722
How could you people...

281
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,962
How could you do this
at your friend's funeral?

282
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,322
Do you still call yourselves his friend?

283
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,732
Please calm down.

284
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,732
I'm sorry.
I should've told you beforehand,

285
00:14:57,902 --> 00:14:59,131
but you weren't here earlier.

286
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,702
Everyone involved is here,
so we should all go together.

287
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,342
Yoon Jin, Joo Song.
You should come with us too.

288
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:06,171
Ji Yeon, please calm down first.
Come this way.

289
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,311
Come with me.

290
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:14,582
You should stay here.

291
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,082
Okay.

292
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:35,641
I'm only here as a testifier.

293
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,311
Why are you interviewing me in here?

294
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,582
I asked to do it here.

295
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,011
We should at least hear
what he has to say.

296
00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:49,521
Good.

297
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:54,661
Sorry for making you come
at such a late hour.

298
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:56,962
Also, may he rest in peace.

299
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,761
This won't take long.

300
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:03,061
The two of you.

301
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,242
Were you aware of the fact
that the deceased wrote a will?

302
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:08,872
- No.
- No.

303
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,911
Then, from both your perspectives,

304
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,472
do you consider yourselves close enough...

305
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,581
to Mr. Park Jun Seo that
he'd leave you his insurance money...

306
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,411
of five million dollars
instead of his family?

307
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:19,082
Well, I'm also aware...

308
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:22,681
that you didn't kill Mr. Park...

309
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,352
with the intention of receiving
five million dollars.

310
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:25,521
Excuse me.

311
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,051
Please watch what you say.

312
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:28,822
Did what I say bother you?

313
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:30,761
I'm just saying.

314
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,561
If you had really killed Mr. Park...

315
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,462
with the intention of
getting five million dollars,

316
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,631
you would've made it look like
a murder or an accident.

317
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:39,931
You wouldn't have made it look like
a suicide.

318
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,072
I said that out of consideration
for you two.

319
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:44,712
You know?

320
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:49,311
Then, why do you think Mr. Park
left you five million dollars?

321
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,581
Neither of you are able to give me
any particular answers.

322
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,482
I don't understand this situation at all.

323
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,381
Is it just me?

324
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,291
That's right.

325
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,651
We also find that strange.

326
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,122
Honestly, Park Jun Seo wasn't
a close friend who kept in touch with us.

327
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,261
Why did he do such a thing?

328
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,902
So, do the autopsy as you should,

329
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,502
and let's do this investigation right.

330
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,572
Park Tae Jin is behind that mirror, right?

331
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,141
Did you ask him?

332
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,972
What is the reason he's against
doing an autopsy...

333
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,141
when someone who fell from the ninth floor
of a construction site...

334
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,942
took out a five-million-dollar
insurance policy a week ago?

335
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,982
Seriously, quiet down.

336
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,352
Weren't you able to ask him?

337
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,811
Why?

338
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,321
Are you still crawling on the floor
at one word from a prosecutor?

339
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:30,421
Hey, punk.

340
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,992
I'm seriously trying to
wrap this up nicely.

341
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,322
Are you out of your mind?

342
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,762
Do you seriously want to
come in as a testifier...

343
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:36,921
and leave as a suspect?

344
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,692
Fine, let's do that.

345
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,661
I'm fine with becoming the suspect.
Just do your job.

346
00:17:42,301 --> 00:17:43,531
Don't embarrass yourself.

347
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,031
Why, you little...

348
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:52,011
Everyone, calm down.

349
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,881
Let's just look at the facts.

350
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,112
There were no signs of foul play
at the site.

351
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,852
And as the prosecutor who conducted
the postmortem screening.

352
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,681
I didn't find anything
out of the ordinary.

353
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,291
Does the police have anything more to add?

354
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,862
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- Don't call my name so easily.

355
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:13,861
I'm here as a prosecutor right now,
not as your friend.

356
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:15,732
Got it?

357
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,132
Anything else?

358
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:22,442
No, sir.

359
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,311
The family has already expressed...

360
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:26,871
that they do not want to do an autopsy.

361
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,081
Let's proceed with that.

362
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,722
Why? Is there something
we might find in Jun Seo's body?

363
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,021
What are you trying to hide
that you're going this far?

364
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,192
Say it, you jerk.

365
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:42,521
That's enough!

366
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,632
Are you crazy?

367
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:46,091
What do you think you're doing right now?

368
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,841
I'm Chief of Police, Bae Byung Ho.

369
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:01,041
I hope the funeral goes well.

370
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:04,882
We must also do our jobs.
Please understand...

371
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,712
that things have come to this.

372
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,252
Inspector Yoo, wrapt things up quickly.

373
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,427
Yes, sir.

374
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,752
I thought the family said
they didn't want to do an autopsy.

375
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:15,422
Yes, sir.

376
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,192
Then, what more is there to discuss?

377
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,161
Take her back so that they can continue
with the funeral.

378
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:20,291
Chief!

379
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,972
Prosecutor, join me for a cup of tea
in my office.

380
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:28,702
Sure.

381
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,172
The autopsy...

382
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,521
I want to do the autopsy.

383
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:47,422
I think he's asking me to do it.

384
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,222
What are you talking about?

385
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,568
Jun Seo is already dead!

386
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,492
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- My goodness.

387
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,437
Why are you all so eager
to cut up a dead man's body?

388
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,031
Ji Yeon, why are you doing this?

389
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,011
I just want to feel at ease.

390
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,511
No matter how I think about it,

391
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,452
I can't believe that he committed suicide.

392
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:15,081
After Yoon Hee left,

393
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,152
I wanted to die several times myself.

394
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,361
But I'm still alive.

395
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,662
He said to me.

396
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:32,801
Our dear Yoon Hee...

397
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:37,142
would've gone to a nice place.

398
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,511
So, in order to meet Yoon Hee again,

399
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:45,851
we should live the rest of our lives
as good people too.

400
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:49,652
We should wash away all of our sins
if we have any.

401
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,121
But someone like that, committing suicide?

402
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,692
I want to know exactly
if there was any other reason.

403
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,632
But if it really was suicide,

404
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:06,172
I'll just curse at him all I want, then.

405
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:23,781
Then, as per the family's request,

406
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:27,051
we will conduct an autopsy
on Mr. Park Jun Seo.

407
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,091
Prosecutor.

408
00:21:35,602 --> 00:21:36,702
Go ahead.

409
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:39,727
(Interview Room)

410
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:00,591
Is this normally how you do your job
as a prosecutor, you punk?

411
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,291
I told you to stop that autopsy,
no matter what, didn't I?

412
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:07,132
- Jong Soo.
- Shut up.

413
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:09,931
You called me all the way
to the police station...

414
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,472
and made me look like a fool.

415
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,502
At this rate, will you be able to
stay my friend for life?

416
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,341
You must be very anxious.

417
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,111
What, anxious?

418
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,611
You and I were there together.

419
00:22:25,582 --> 00:22:26,752
We saw it together.

420
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,452
What's the problem?

421
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,752
Nothing will be detected
from Jun Seo's body. So...

422
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,591
Even if something is detected,
you should go ahead and stop it. Got it?

423
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,832
Even if you have to step down
from being a prosecutor,

424
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,261
just stop it this time. Okay, punk?

425
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,101
Understood?

426
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:48,341
- Understood.
- Answer me loudly, punk!

427
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:53,111
Okay. Someone might hear you.

428
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,702
We'll now start the autopsy.

429
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:58,111
(Park Jun Seo)

430
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,582
(Rest in peace)

431
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,502
- Here.
- Thanks.

432
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:30,541
What are you doing?

433
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,912
It's Jae Gyeong.
I'm going to send him Jun Seo's pictures.

434
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:35,841
What's wrong with him?

435
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,152
He caused all that fuss,
but he was not here for the funeral.

436
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,028
Exactly.

437
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:42,981
He said something urgent came up
at work.

438
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,021
He was always like that.

439
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:46,652
He's so self-centered.

440
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:50,261
Everyone asked me where he was.

441
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,632
Of course,
no one would understand it.

442
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:57,502
Do you think things will be calm
until the autopsy report comes out?

443
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,031
From what I hear,

444
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:01,541
it'll take a month for the result
at the earliest.

445
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,402
Gosh.

446
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,142
Hey.

447
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:08,011
I can't just sit around until then.

448
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:10,981
Jun Seo wrote my name in his will.

449
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:13,252
This means I have a role to play.

450
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:20,521
I'll make sure...

451
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:23,992
I play that role right.

452
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,501
Early this morning,

453
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:33,801
someone reported those two fighting
in front of a convenience store.

454
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:36,371
The station nearby dispatched,

455
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,642
and even with the naked eye,

456
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:40,442
it was obvious both were suspicious
of using drugs.

457
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:42,412
Also,

458
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,051
they found this in the pocket
of one of them.

459
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,281
It's that drug again.

460
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:48,321
Did you find out anything about it?

461
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:51,752
Yes.
It became popular about three months ago.

462
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,092
They told people...

463
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:54,721
it could make you feel happy
and help you focus.

464
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,462
They started selling it
through word of mouth.

465
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,632
It's highly addictive,

466
00:25:58,632 --> 00:25:59,831
and the tolerance level is high.

467
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,261
It recently started
to cause serious issues.

468
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,271
Does it have a name?

469
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:07,531
I heard it's called Lemon Mulberry.

470
00:26:17,312 --> 00:26:20,682
(Heo Joo Song: Here's Jun Seo
on his way. Good luck with work.)

471
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,202
On February 27, 2024, around 4:00 a.m.,

472
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,071
you two had a brawl
in front of a convenience store...

473
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,541
in Panseo-dong, Anhyun,
before you were taken to a station.

474
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,111
That's right.

475
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:51,811
- Continue.
- Okay.

476
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:56,152
The patrol station
found you suspicious of drug usage,

477
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:57,382
and you were sent here.

478
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,252
Do you admit to using drugs?

479
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,462
I told you, I didn't use drugs.

480
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,292
Since you won't admit to it,

481
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,392
we'll go ahead
and conduct urine and hair tests.

482
00:27:06,862 --> 00:27:09,331
We'll stop recording until the tests.

483
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:24,851
Hey.

484
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:25,982
Did you fight over this?

485
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,182
Sit down.

486
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,261
Put your hands down.

487
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:42,662
Since when did you take these?

488
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:48,341
If you answer me, I'll give it to you.

489
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:51,972
Maybe since two months ago? No.

490
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,642
I think about a month and a half ago.

491
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:56,882
How long does a pill last?

492
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,152
It lasts for a day or two at first,
but then...

493
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,351
Does it last shorter?

494
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:03,621
Yes.

495
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,692
How long has it been
since you last had one?

496
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,722
Detective.

497
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,261
I haven't had one for a week!

498
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,902
Why has it been so long?
Were you not able to get any?

499
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:20,801
It has become very difficult
to get them since two weeks ago.

500
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:26,111
- Please...
- How many do you take now?

501
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,142
Now?

502
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,152
Four.

503
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:32,581
- "Four?"
- Yes.

504
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:34,521
Did you take other drugs before?

505
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:37,952
Yes.

506
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,992
What's different with this one?

507
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,621
Try it.

508
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:44,361
Try one.

509
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,571
Hand it over!

510
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,611
You said you'd give it to me!

511
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,441
- Get up, jerk!
- Hand it over!

512
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,652
- You said you'd give it to me.
- Get him!

513
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,011
Let go!

514
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,412
Give it to me!

515
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:09,952
- Come with me.
- You're a liar!

516
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,452
Come on!

517
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:13,021
Give it to me.

going home alone,

520
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:28,202
would you like us to come with you?

No, it's okay.

Okay.

526

I'll get going too.

527
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,481
I see. Thank you for everything.

00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,721
As for the realtor office,
I'll help you get it organized...

529
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,792
after all the urgent matters
are dealt with.

530
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:48,322
So don't worry about that
and get a few days of good rest.

531
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:49,422
Okay.

532
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,962
- Who is that?
- Oh, she's...

533
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,261
She was the manager
of the realty my husband used to run.

534
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,531
I see.

535
00:29:57,971 --> 00:29:59,471
Are you planning to get rid of it?

536
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,571
Yes.

537
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,601
It'll be difficult to run without him.

538
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,941
I'll do that in time.

- Let's get together to eat soon.
- Thanks for coming out so far.

- It looks like they're leaving.
- We'll all go together.

00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,242
Let's meet up soon.

542
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:10,442
Bye.

543
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:15,021
Are you leaving?

544
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,021
- Yes.
- We'll get going.

545
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,392
Thank you and sorry for troubling you.

546
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:24,732
Bye.

547
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:25,861
Take care.

548
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,331
Take care.

549
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,702
Even their exit looks cool.

550
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:32,871
You're right.

551
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,242
So,

552
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,172
what's the next step?

553
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:39,971
What do you mean?

554
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,312
You want to play the role...

555
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:42,782
of uncovering the truth
behind Jun Seo's death.

556
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:43,911
What will you do first?

557
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,081
- Are you going to join me?
- Yes.

558
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:47,682
Jun Seo came...

559
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:51,052
to me to sign up for insurance
and wrote a will.

560
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:52,791
He was acting so strange,

561
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,392
but I didn't ask him any questions
or help him.

562
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,632
Maybe that was why he died.

563
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,261
My heart feels heavy.

564
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:06,271
Of course, I like being around you too.

565
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,301
Are you really doing this
because of the insurance money?

566
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,172
Yes.

567
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:18,811
What?

568
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,752
Don't look at me like that.

569
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:23,021
Jang Jae Gyeong is not any different.

570
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:24,581
What will you do with the money?

571
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:28,621
Ye Eun.

572
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,791
I want to bring her back
and live with her.

573
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,902
Why does thinking
about her make me hungry?

574
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,571
For some reason,
I get hungry whenever I think of her.

575
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,871
Hold on. Should we eat something?

576
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,882
I know a good noodle place nearby.

577
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:52,951
Let's have a bowl each...

578
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:54,981
so we can live long noodle-like lives.

579
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,152
That sounds great.

580
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:57,882
Let's go.

581
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:02,392
So is this called Lemon Mulberry?

582
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:03,722
Yes.

583
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,892
What a fantastic name.

584
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:08,501
They were selling it high
and low online and offline.

585
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:10,201
Why did they suddenly stop supplying?

586
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:12,231
The supply has been scarce
since two weeks ago.

587
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,201
Maybe they had trouble keeping up
with the demands.

588
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,642
It's designed
to be highly effective and addictive.

589
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,771
They were planning to sell
a large sum in a short time.

590
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,771
It's different
from the drugs we saw before.

591
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,181
Hallucination symptoms
aren't as severe as meth.

592
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,312
Instead,
it can actually clear your head...

593
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,811
and give you confidence at first.

594
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:28,921
Those two started using it
for better concentration...

595
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,781
and to boost their confidence.

596
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:32,322
But the drug wears out fast,

597
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,521
so you feel lethargic
and get shortness of breath.

598
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:36,822
Most of all, it encourages you
to increase the dosage.

599
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,732
Which then damages the central nerves.

600
00:32:39,862 --> 00:32:41,962
It must be easy for someone
to start using them.

601
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,361
This is dangerous.

602
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:47,271
First, check the regular supply routes
and ask around.

603
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,971
If someone new is responsible for this,

604
00:32:48,971 --> 00:32:50,702
I'm sure they would know already.

605
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,541
Get out there and fetch something.

606
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:53,841
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

607
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:58,041
Jang Jae Gyeong.

608
00:32:58,681 --> 00:32:59,781
Yes?

609
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,192
You forgot to turn in your firearm again?

610
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:09,591
- Yes.
- Hand it in now.

611
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:11,422
The guy in charge called.

612
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,462
Okay.

613
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:31,412
Let's make it tomorrow at midnight.

614
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:33,652
If you go past midnight,

615
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,122
I'll also stop dealing Lemon Mulberry...

616
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:38,752
and focus on going around to catch people.

617
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,162
(Doctor)

618
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,871
Doctor.

619
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:03,741
Have you heard of a CEO Yoon?

620
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,088
"CEO Yoon?" No.

621
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,452
They're a Lemon Mulberry distributor.

622
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,321
- Where did you get that info?
- From Jang Chul Gu.

623
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:10,482
- He doesn't know who it is?
- No.

624
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,192
I'll look into it.

625
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:14,452
That Lee Myung Guk guy.

626
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,321
Yes.

627
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:19,962
Jae Gyeong doesn't seem to know
who Lee Myung Guk is?

628
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:22,632
Right.

629
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:25,071
He asked his colleague to run the ID.

630
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:29,972
- Do you know him?
- What?

631
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:35,942
You know,

632
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,412
when I saw that name on the will...

633
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:42,021
in the dim light of the corridor,
my hair stood on end.

634

(Lee Myung Guk,
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals researcher)

635
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,530
He's missing?

636
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:48,021
Yes. He was reported missing
seven months ago.

637
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,292
He was last seen entering...

638
00:34:50,292 --> 00:34:51,732
the subway station by his office.

639
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:53,591
- Who reported him missing?
- A colleague.

640
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:54,902
Where did he work at?

641
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:56,202
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals.

642
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,902
Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals?

643
00:34:58,302 --> 00:34:59,771
Won Jong Soo's the CEO.

644
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:01,271
Correct.

645
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,642
It's a subsidiary of Geumhyung Group...

646
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,942
that Vice-Chairman Won Jong Soo
runs in person.

647
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:09,712
How did you get to know Lee Myung Guk?

648
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,551
He wanted to report
some internal corruption.

649
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:14,712
He asked me to put it in the paper.

650
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,722
- Did you meet up with him?
- Hey.

651
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,192
Do you think he was the only one
with such a story?

652
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,862
So you didn't meet him?

653
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:24,661
I said no and was about to hang up.

654
00:35:28,231 --> 00:35:30,532
That last comment hit me hard.

655
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,532
He had terminal lung cancer.

656
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,632
Criminal Affairs Division One
looked into it.

657
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,342
They didn't think
it was linked to any other case.

658
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,971
They're assuming he took drastic measures
due to his negative situation.

659
00:35:41,882 --> 00:35:42,982
No way.

660
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:46,252
That meant he had nothing to lose.

661
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:49,021
It's no joke when someone like that
decides to blow the whistle.

662
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,152
Right.

663
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:54,021
But he didn't show up
on the day we were supposed to meet.

664
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,491
- I couldn't reach him either.
- Then...

665
00:35:57,092 --> 00:35:58,192
Yes.

666
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,161
I heard later on...

667
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,262
that it was the day after
he'd gone missing.

668
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,072
Hey.

669
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:11,741
Shouldn't you tell Jae Gyeong right away?

670
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:12,871
Who, me?

671
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:16,041
Should I?

672
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:18,081
Darn it.

673
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:19,951
I don't want to.

674
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:22,252
Still, you should.

675
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,351
Okay, I will tell him.

676
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:33,762
I know pretty well
where he is and what he's doing.

00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:41,247
- Does Lee Eun Hee live here?
- It's mine!

680
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:42,472
Then which is mine?

681
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:44,771
- Mr. Lee Myung Guk's daughter.
- Will you be quiet?

682
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:47,442
That's me.

683
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:49,081

- Pow...
- Pow...

685
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:01,192
The police gave it back
saying they didn't need it.

686

Have you heard the name
"Park Jun Seo" before?

689
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,061
No.

690
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:14,431
What did your father do
at Geumhyung Pharmaceuticals?

691
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,942
I don't know well. He was a researcher.

692
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,371
Sometimes he made copies
of foreign medications,

693
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:23,512
and sometimes he developed something new.

694
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,851

What a simply obvious name.

00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,371

plus a slang term for drugs.

- Anything else?
- That's it.

Are you... Is this all sweat?

721
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,391
What's the matter?

722
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:22,402
What's going on?

723
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,402
Are you okay?

724
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,032
Hey.

725
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,701
This won't do.

726
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:30,302
Get up.

727
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,212
Try to walk.

728
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:36,342
Let's take my car.

729
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:52,262
Which hospital should we go to?
Are you registered anywhere?

730
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,161
No hospitals.

731
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:57,008
What are you on about?

732
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:59,632
You're sick.
You need to go to a hospital.

733
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:02,942
You can't take me to a hospital.

734
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:05,842
Home.

735
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:09,212
Take me home.

736
00:40:26,653 --> 00:40:28,069
We're almost there.

737
00:40:35,204 --> 00:40:36,333
Jae Gyeong.

738
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:38,464
What's the code to the door?

739
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,003
Zero.

740
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:41,974
- Five.
- Five.

741
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,074
Zero, two.

742
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,543
Zero, two.

743
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:53,413
Hey.

744
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,183
Come on.

745
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,264
Hang on.

746
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:06,764
Wait.

747
00:41:10,963 --> 00:41:12,233
There's nothing in here.

748
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:20,844
Jae Gyeong.

749
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:24,913
Drink this.

750
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,123
Goodness.

751
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:35,893
Do you feel better?

752

(Park Jun Seo)

754
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:22,607
Lemon Mulberry.

755
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:29,947
I see that
you've already taken all your pills.

756
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,648
Take this when you really need it.

757
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:42,098
What is it?

758
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:43,828
It...

759
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,237
It was inside, wasn't it?

760
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,507
What was?

761
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,447
Give it to me.

762
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:06,257
I don't know what you're talking about.

763
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:08,357
What?

764
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:12,558
Let go!

765
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,357
Let go of me!

766
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,777
Yoon Jin, open the door.

767
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:30,248
No.

768
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:31,348
Open the door.

769
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:33,677
This is a drug.

770
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:36,288
Come to your senses, Jang Jae Gyeong.

771
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:38,217
I can't do without that.

772
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:40,958
I might die without that.

773
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:42,328
Help me!

774
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:44,128
Why did you get like this?

775
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:47,697
How could you do drugs?

776
00:43:58,737 --> 00:43:59,837
Open the door.

777
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,107
Do you think I can't open this up?

778
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:09,018
Please, come to your senses, Jae Gyeong.

779
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,487
Open up.

780
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:14,618
Come to your senses.

781
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:16,757
Come to your senses, Jang Jae Gyeong!

782
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,705
(Tuesday, February 27, 6:30 p.m.)

783
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:14,361
Jun Seo.

784
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,370
He came to see me the day before he died.

785
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:25,270
This was the tenth time.

786
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,410
What?

787
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:29,810
The number of times
Jun Seo came to see me.

788
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,040
This was the tenth time.

789
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:36,750
Seeing how I can remember
how many times it was,

790
00:46:37,781 --> 00:46:39,790
I must've been waiting for Jun Seo too.

791
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:43,620
What did he say when he came by?

792
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,390
The same thing each of the ten times.

793
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,790
To forgive him.

794
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:50,861
No way.

795
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,571
About what happened 20 years ago?

796
00:46:55,871 --> 00:46:56,971
So,

797
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,370
what did you say?

798
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:01,111
I said the same thing each time too.

799
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,810
That I didn't want to hear it...

800
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:09,721
and that he should get out of my life.

801
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:16,620
If I accepted his apology then,

802
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:19,960
he'd still be alive, right?

803
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,031
That idiot.

804
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:29,241
He should've just said it.
Why would he die?

805
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:37,980
Whether or not I forgive him,

806
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,511
he could've just lived fine on his own.

807
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,921
What am I to him?

808
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,721
Why did he keep coming back,
and ten times at that?

809
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,890
And until the end,
I kept refusing to forgive him.

810
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,031
How did you end up like this?

811
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,500
I don't remember.

812
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:05,841
After a team dinner,

813
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:08,940
I was abducted by someone
in the bathroom.

814
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,810
When I opened my eyes,
three days had gone by.

815
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,881
And I was already addicted to drugs.

816
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,821
Sorry about earlier.

817
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,890
Is there someone you suspect?

818
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,201
But what's weird is...

819
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:34,901
that Jun Seo, who was a real estate agent,

820
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,671
was involved in drugs.

821
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,480
I can't prove it yet,

822
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,611
but that's the only lead.

823
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:47,681
Still, for now,

824
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,421
let's tell someone about this.

825
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,980
No.

826
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:56,460
You might really end up in big trouble
at this rate.

827
00:48:57,321 --> 00:49:00,690
I saw a woman die in front of her child
after taking that pill.

828
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,160
Her eyes weren't human.

829
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,230
Tell the police
about this right away, okay?

830
00:49:06,831 --> 00:49:08,401
And you need to go to the hospital.

831
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,940
No.

832
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,540
Why not?

833
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,350
If this gets out,
I will be taken off this case.

834
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:23,321
If I step aside from this,
no one will be interested in this case.

835
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,980
You saw it too.

836
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,851
The prosecutor and detective in charge...

837
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:28,921
tried to have him cremated
without an autopsy.

838
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,321
Please keep it a secret for now.

839
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,701
You can't tell anyone that I'm addicted.

840
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,661
If I'm taken off the case,

841
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,671
the insurance money you're hoping to get
is gone too.

842
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:47,341
Once everything is sorted out,
I'll tell them myself.

843
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:50,480
Until then, this fact can't get out,

844
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,151
and I can't collapse.

845
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:56,951
Do you...

846
00:49:57,851 --> 00:49:59,051
still have that pill?

847
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:02,660
No.

848
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,120
I got rid of it.

849
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,230
In the bathroom.

850
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:17,701
Good.

851
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,270
You did well.

852
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:29,580
Where are you going in that state?

853
00:50:29,851 --> 00:50:30,951
There isn't much time.

854
00:50:32,891 --> 00:50:34,651
Someone made me get addicted,

855
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,520
and someone did that to Jun Seo.
We have to find out quickly.

856
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,431
If you're going to go
to Lee Myung Guk's house,

857
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:45,931
I'll give you a ride.

858
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,000
I'll tell you on the way...

859
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,370
about how I know Lee Myung Guk.

860
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,571

- Yes.

- Yes.

864
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:44,960

What will you do if you faint again?

870
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:56,971
Hurry up and open it.

871
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,040
Fine, don't open it.

872
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:04,881

It's nothing. It's just a clothesline.

877
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:26,071
I hit my head on it.

878

Be careful.

879
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:37,580
Hey, is it okay to just go in like this?

880
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,710
Is it above or below?

Above?

It's 63-38,
973 Inhyun-ro, Jangsoo-dong, Anhyun.

906
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,120
A dead body was found
in the master bedroom.

907
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:40,321
Hurry over with Forensics.

908
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:43,797
Was it 63-38, 973 Inhyun-ro?

909
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:44,921
That's right.

910
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:46,491
Understood.

911
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:54,401
Is it normal for a dead body...

912
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,671
to have that much fluid pouring out?

913
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,801
No, not this much.

914
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:03,580
Lee Myung Guk went missing
around late July last year.

915
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,910
It has been seven months,

916
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,310
but the body hardly decomposed.

917
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,451
This means he was frozen after death...

918
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:12,181
and was only defrosted recently.

919
00:57:12,621 --> 00:57:14,551
That is why there is so much body fluid.

920
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,830
But...

921
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,631
If they went through
the trouble of hiding him,

922
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,660
why did they bring him out now?

923
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,701
Exactly my point.

924
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:27,901
No one even knew he was dead
for the last seven months.

925
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,230
Come on.

926
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,250
What's going on?

927
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:20,020

929
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:26,091
Hey! Wake up!

930
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,460
It's no time for this.

931
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:29,761
The police cars are coming.

932
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,801
Wake up. Jae Gyeong!

933
00:58:32,161 --> 00:58:33,330
Go to the car.

934
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,000
What? Okay, let's go.

935
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,401
Wait.

936
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:41,011
Can you get up?

937
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,381
Go.

Hey, Jae Gyeong. Wake up.

941
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:35,591
Where should I go?

942
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:38,401
To the police station.

943
00:59:38,701 --> 00:59:39,830
What?

944
00:59:40,571 --> 00:59:43,971
We just dodged them.
Why would we go to the station?

945
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,540
Hurry to the station.

What's the matter?

955
01:00:31,051 --> 01:00:32,281
Are you feeling sick?

956
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:34,190
Can you go get me some medicine?

957
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:37,560
- What do you need?
- One for digestion...

958
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:40,460
and one for fevers.

959
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,160
Wait just a moment.

960
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:07,651
Let go!

961
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,097
You said you'd give it to me!

962
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:11,221
Come on.

963
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:16,801
Yes?

965

write down the students' creed

972

What about the students' creed?

980
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:35,181
I didn't write it down.

981
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:37,851

Didn't you just transfer here?

982

01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:46,831
