1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,647
When did he go in?

3
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,192
Hasn't it been over 30 minutes?

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,359
It has.

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,867
Hey.

6
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,744
Isn't that…

7
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,204
How do you know the door passcode?

8
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,920
I know what you must be thinking--

9
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,380
I told him the passcode.

10
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,551
After hearing about my husband,

11
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,719
I went straight to the hospital.

12
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,430
But Prosecutor Park said
it could've been suicide,

13
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,516
so he told me he wanted to stop by

14
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,893
and check any laptops or notepads.

15
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,771
Ms. Choi.

16
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,399
I told you to change
the passcode, remember?

17
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,235
I checked to see if you did,
but you didn't.

18
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,114
If you don't know how,
I can change it for you.

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,575
No, it's okay. I'll do it later.

20
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,951
Okay.

21
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,663
You looked at Jun-seo's laptop?

22
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,457
Why?

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,546
To see if there was another explanation
other than suicide.

24
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,172
Like maybe a suicide note.

25
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,260
And Ms. Choi said it was better

26
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,388
that his friend came by
instead of the police.

27
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,599
But why did you come at this hour?

28
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,517
What do you mean "at this hour"?

29
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,274
This is when civil servants get off work.
It's not an unusual time.

30
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,318
So why did you come here?

31
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,530
Ms. Choi wanted to know
how the investigation will proceed.

32
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,033
So I told her I'd come when I had time.

33
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,284
And that day is today.

34
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,202
Satisfied?

35
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,746
What about you?

36
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,831
What brings you here?

37
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,002
-I'll take my leave now.
-Okay.

38
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,715
Move.

39
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,842
-Why are you here?
-Move.

40
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,142
Prosecutor Park,

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,852
I'm sorry you came all this way,

42
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,521
but the hour is late,
and I'm rather tired.

43
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,482
I'll meet you near your office next time.

44
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,276
That's probably better.
Let me know when you're available.

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,153
I'll take my leave.

46
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
Goodbye.

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,296
What made you come here?

48
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,258
What investigation progress?

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,678
What?

50
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,388
You said it was a suicide.

51
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,559
So what's this investigation progress
that made you come

52
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,561
and explain in person?

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,233
We did an autopsy,

54
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,360
and Ms. Choi was concerned.

55
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,294
-Here they come.
-Oh, gosh.

56
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,534
What the heck?

57
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,163
Is Jang Jae-gyeong clueless?

58
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,456
It seems so.

59
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,083
How can he be so clueless?

60
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,837
Isn't it obvious what it means
when a man visits a woman after dark?

61
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,215
Senior Inspector Jang came
when it got dark too.

62
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,469
You idiot.

63
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,181
-What is it?
-Hush.

64
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,807
Did they see us?

65
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,406
-Hey, follow her.
-Okay.

66
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,303
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

67
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,609
Hello, sir.

68
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,821
Where is everyone?

69
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,947
They went out to eat.

70
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,078
Did you look into CEO Yoon?

71
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,204
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,540
But nothing really came up.

73
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
How exactly did you look into it?

74
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,256
I went to some meth dealers
and asked around.

75
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,842
They've never heard of CEO Yoon

76
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,053
but said CEO Yoon might
switch names constantly.

77
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,763
It's what people do in this business.

78
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,016
-That's it?
-I'll look into it more.

79
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,810
Captain?

80
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,941
Have I done anything to offend you, sir?

81
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,111
You're treating me differently these days.

82
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,905
I've been wondering why that is,

83
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,366
but I can't figure it out.

84
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,501
The night of Lee Myeong-guk's house fire,

85
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,337
you left the scene
and returned to the station, right?

86
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,881
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

87
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,925
I saw a car quickly leaving the scene.

88
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,179
It would've taken time to put out the fire
before examining the scene,

89
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,597
so I followed it.

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,056
But I saw that car

91
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,184
enter the police station.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,311
So I…

93
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,482
You came into the office?

94
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,192
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,446
When you came in…

96
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,910
What was the situation?

97
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,537
Nobody was here.

98
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,498
What?

99
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,125
Nobody was in the office when I came in.

100
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,420
But Su-hyeon's desk was a mess.

101
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,549
Then what?

102
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,636
I straightened out her desk
and went to check the CCTV camera.

103
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,179
Why?

104
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,139
I wanted to find out where you were,

105
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,391
and what happened in the office was weird.

106
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,310
But?

107
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,480
But for some reason,
that time frame wasn't recorded.

108
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,191
I had the security office guys fix it,

109
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,151
but the footage wasn't recovered.

110
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,611
When all is said and done,

111
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,988
I should've conducted the scene
at Lee Myeong-guk's house.

112
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,367
I know I was wrong for leaving early.

113
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,036
I know you think I'm not good at--

114
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,246
No.

115
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,831
No, it's not that. Forget about it.

116
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,799
I think I was a bit sensitive
because I was so tired.

117
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,961
-Hey, she stopped.
-Right.

118
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,045
Park here.

119
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,141
-Ms. Oh.
-What?

120
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,267
Over there.

121
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,525
Hey, did you bring the camera?

122
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,610
Of course.

123
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,155
Here.

124
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,663
Jeez.

125
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,628
Look at that bastard smile.

126
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,087
Are you happy?

127
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,639
What's that?

128
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,932
I was craving some caffeine.

129
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,934
You're not the only one craving caffeine.

130
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,064
Learn how to share.

131
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,945
Ms. Oh, I'm moving in.

132
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,113
Okay. Good luck.

133
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,420
Jeez.

134
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,925
Thank you.

135
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,021
Should we move over there?

136
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,697
Drink your tea for now.

137
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,166
MS. OH YUN-JIN

138
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
You can't show up without any warning.

139
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,797
I didn't know Jang Jae-gyeong was there.

140
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,383
You should've texted me.

141
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,386
It wasn't weird, right?
Did he seem suspicious?

142
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,263
It was fine.

143
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,181
Why was that punk there?

144
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,602
He asked to see
Jun-seo's laptop and flash drives.

145
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,272
He kept looking up and playing videos.

146
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,483
Videos? Like what?

147
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,777
I stood by and watched them,

148
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,572
but they were videos of Yun-hui
or when we were on vacation.

149
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,199
I don't know what he wanted,

150
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,034
but he didn't find it.

151
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,914
Don't worry about it.
He can't do anything anyway.

152
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,171
So have you given it some thought?

153
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,049
-About what?
-The thing I brought up last time.

154
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,511
About taking off together?

155
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,638
I thought you were joking.

156
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,392
-I'm not in the mood to joke.
-Neither am I.

157
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,603
You barged into my house

158
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,189
and demanded the password
while choking me.

159
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,732
But now you want us to leave together?

160
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,900
Password?

161
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,110
He choked her?

162
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,074
I apologized enough
for what happened that day.

163
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,993
So let's drop it.

164
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
If I give you the password…

165
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,708
will you really leave with me?

166
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,210
Yes.

167
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,882
You're willing to quit your job
and run away with me,

168
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,468
but you can't get a divorce?

169
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,512
Shouldn't that come first?

170
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,472
Get a divorce.

171
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,226
Then I'll tell you the password
and go wherever with you.

172
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,353
I'll get a divorce.

173
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,939
But that doesn't come first, Ji-yeon.

174
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,815
A divorce doesn't happen overnight.

175
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,151
If we're going to live overseas,

176
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,654
I can hire someone
to handle the divorce later.

177
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,739
-What's so important--
-It's important.

178
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
I refuse

179
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,662
to be a married man's mistress anymore.

180
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,207
So until you bring me
finalized divorce papers,

181
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,334
I won't tell you a thing.

182
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,802
Give me your hand.

183
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,514
Come on.

184
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,186
Ji-yeon.

185
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,565
I love you.

186
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,901
What matters most right now

187
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,820
is our love for each other.

188
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,821
And…

189
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,574
my love for you will never change.

190
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,242
In this moment,

191
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,578
and in the future,

192
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,913
the most precious thing to me…

193
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,375
will always be you.

194
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,543
Are you kidding me?

195
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,719
The money in there

196
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,847
now belongs to us,
the ones with the password.

197
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,641
It's enough for us
to make a fresh start anywhere,

198
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,893
so let's be

199
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,896
wise about this.

200
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,363
Give me more time.

201
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,575
It's not an easy decision for me.

202
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:16,916
Shall we leave?

203
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,751
Let's go eat something good.

204
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,302
Hey, why aren't you following them?

205
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,347
They'll catch on if I keep following them.

206
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,641
Damn it!

207
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,331
Have you had breakfast?

208
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,669
I haven't eaten yet, so I'm hungry.

209
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,214
But I still can't eat food at a funeral
while paying my respects

210
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
to a victim's family.

211
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,387
Are you in the mood for a bowl of gukbap?

212
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:57,975
If it wasn't for me,

213
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,519
he wouldn't be dead.

214
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,522
Don't beat yourself up.

215
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,899
Just catch the culprit.

216
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,569
He was watching me from nearby.

217
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,074
It's because of me that he found out
about the CCTV camera there.

218
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,370
He knew I'd go to my car

219
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,664
and waited for that moment.

220
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,999
Jae-gyeong…

221
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,629
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

222
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,931
I've been watching you investigate
and didn't want to get in your way

223
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,851
because you've been doing a good job.

224
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,855
But when it comes to
Lee Myeong-guk's case and this one,

225
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,899
I have a bad feeling.

226
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,903
If things aren't going well,
you need to tell me.

227
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,239
Keeping it to yourself won't help any.

228
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,119
Everyone at the station is talking.

229
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,662
They're saying

230
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,374
you're sticking your nose into other cases
for the insurance payout.

231
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,794
And that you've been acting arrogant
since your promotion.

232
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,670
Is that who you really are?

233
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,174
I can't defend you
if I don't know what's going on.

234
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,136
About the handoff tip

235
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,514
at the subway station…

236
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,184
I got the tip

237
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,146
from my dead friend, Park Jun-seo.

238
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,773
One-eight-eight-two?

239
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,316
And Doctor?

240
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,652
Also,

241
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,613
Lee Myeong-guk, who was found dead,

242
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,616
was a researcher at KH Pharmaceutical.

243
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,495
He and Park Jun-seo
were in the same high school club.

244
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,956
How is KH Pharmaceutical related to this?

245
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,874
The CEO of KH Pharmaceutical,

246
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,546
the prosecutor
who did Jun-seo's postmortem,

247
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,843
the ones mentioned in the will,
namely myself and Reporter Oh Yun-jin,

248
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,847
were all classmates
at the same high school.

249
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,182
Are you saying

250
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,395
your dead friend who tipped you off
about the lemon pop handoff,

251
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,564
the CEO of KH Pharmaceutical,

252
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,734
and the current deputy chief prosecutor
are all connected?

253
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,448
No wonder you've been struggling.

254
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,913
Do you have any leads on the case yet?

255
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
I have some suspicions,

256
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,876
but they're difficult to prove.

257
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,960
Yoo Gyeong-hwan

258
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,922
plans to treat your friend's suicide,
Lee Myeong-guk's case,

259
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,592
and this murder case as separate cases.

260
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,929
Will you continue

261
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,473
this investigation?

262
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,312
Yes.

263
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,567
I can't authorize it,

264
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,195
but I'll turn a blind eye.

265
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,701
There's one more thing
you need to turn a blind eye to.

266
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,748
Go to number three.

267
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,166
Right, that one.

268
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,667
Hey.

269
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,419
Section Chief Jung.

270
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,670
What an honor to have you here.

271
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,173
Honor, my foot.

272
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,174
Here.

273
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,095
Cheol-hong, this isn't just any coffee.

274
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,848
Getting to drink coffee
Section Chief Jung bought herself

275
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,225
is nearly impossible.

276
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,186
And I'm experiencing it before I retire.

277
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,274
-Are you busy?
-No.

278
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,777
Then let's have a quick chat.

279
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,992
What is it? You're scaring me.

280
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,495
Jang Jae-gyeong…

281
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,247
Jang Jae-gyeong?

282
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,999
He still hasn't returned his firearm.

283
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,587
How much longer do I have to
break the rules and put up with him?

284
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,467
Until I tell you to stop.

285
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,594
What?

286
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,809
You have ten days at most.

287
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,645
Two Mondays from now,

288
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,690
they're doing a full inspection
of firearms and ammunition.

289
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
Make sure…

290
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,070
to find your gun and return it by then.

291
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,156
This is the best I can do.

292
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
Hello?

293
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,546
Hello, I'm calling
from Anhyeon City Station.

294
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,880
You looked at our footage…

295
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,591
Yes.

296
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,302
I'd like to see you.

297
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,433
Did you see that?

298
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,518
It's the same footage as last time.

299
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,061
Here.

300
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,527
Did you see it?

301
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,240
What is that?

302
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,160
The trains weren't running yet,

303
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,704
so we left the screen doors open
for a moment to test them.

304
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,414
Here it is.

305
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,999
I went there yesterday

306
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,834
and found this on the tracks.

307
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,304
The money in there

308
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,849
now belongs to us,
the ones with the password.

309
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,727
It's enough for us
to make a fresh start anywhere,

310
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,811
so let's be

311
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,397
wise about--

312
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,233
The money in there

313
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,862
now belongs to us,
the ones with the password.

314
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,655
It's enough--

315
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,244
"It now belongs to us,
the ones with the password."

316
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,624
Then why did he ask Fairy
for the password?

317
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,417
Why doesn't Park Tae-jin know?

318
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,585
I'm not sure.

319
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,922
It sounds like a large amount of money,

320
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:06,134
but what kind of account is it in
that Fairy knows the password,

321
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,678
but Park Tae-jin doesn't
and is under her thumb?

322
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,681
One thing's for sure.

323
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,227
It's definitely dirty money.

324
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,229
And…

325
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,773
Park Tae-jin is
the original account holder.

326
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,774
What?

327
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,983
Think about it.

328
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,277
Listen to their conversation.

329
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,240
Fairy doesn't even know
how much money there is.

330
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,324
Okay.

331
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,118
Look.

332
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,285
Park Tae-jin only says

333
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,373
it's enough money
for a fresh start anywhere

334
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,457
but doesn't say the amount.

335
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,750
That means

336
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,003
Fairy has no idea what this account is

337
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,466
and doesn't know
where this money came from.

338
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,136
So even though she knows the password,

339
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,430
she can't withdraw the money
and doesn't know the amount.

340
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,977
But if Park Tae-jin was
the original account holder,

341
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,020
how could he not know the password?

342
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,413
UHYEON HEARING AID

343
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,133
Where did you get this?

344
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,178
It was found at a crime scene.

345
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,601
I hear this is the only place
in Anhyeon City that sells this product.

346
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,896
This product came from our store, but…

347
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,981
Do many people wear this hearing aid?

348
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,816
No, not many.

349
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,863
These days, people prefer
smaller and lighter models.

350
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,157
Is there any way to know who bought this?

351
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,667
-He came yesterday.
-What?

352
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,670
He came by for a hearing aid fitting

353
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,297
because he lost one.

354
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,801
But I don't know his name
or have his number.

355
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,095
What did he look like?

356
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,931
What do you think?

357
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,600
He looked like he got into trouble a lot.

358
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,856
He'll be back.

359
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,945
People usually come back
to get the volume adjusted.

360
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,656
I see.

361
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,078
Hello.

362
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,788
I was wondering when you'd get here.

363
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,083
Ta-da! I saved these for you.

364
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,167
Thank you, ma'am.

365
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,295
PARK JUN-SEO

366
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,215
ACCOUNT PASSWORD

367
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,430
What are you doing?

368
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,057
Have you eaten?

369
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,184
Yes, why?

370
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,397
I was just curious.

371
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,526
Hey, why did you go
to Choi Ji-yeon's place last night?

372
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,236
To look into something.

373
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,072
So did you find anything?

374
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,868
No.

375
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,454
But how did you know I went there?

376
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,629
You didn't find anything?

377
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,133
Well…

378
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,885
It's near the spot where Joo-song
dropped you off yesterday,

379
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,929
so I just took a wild guess.

380
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,224
How are you feeling?

381
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,685
Do you crave drugs or anything?

382
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,230
I'm okay. Don't worry about me
and focus on yourself.

383
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,523
Seriously?

384
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,110
How can I not worry about you?

385
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,780
I'm the only one who knows
you're a ticking time bomb.

386
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,203
Still, if you feel the least bit unwell,

387
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,747
let me know right away.

388
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,750
You said no hospitals
until the case is solved, right?

389
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,835
Then this is the least I can do.

390
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,005
Fine.

391
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,632
By the way, what happened
with the Park Bok-rye case?

392
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,804
I was going to call her son again.

393
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,265
I'll call you if I find out anything.

394
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,100
Hey.

395
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,352
Give me a call too!

396
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,520
Stop keeping things to yourself!

397
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,522
Okay.

398
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,093
It's time for the board meeting.

399
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,345
Okay. Thanks.

400
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,223
KH GROUP VICE CHAIRMAN
WON JONG-SOO

401
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,282
Jong-soo!

402
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,520
PILO-DONG
HOUSING SITE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

403
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,692
The chairman has arrived.

404
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,503
KH GROUP CHAIRMAN
WON CHANG-HO

405
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,671
Let's begin.

406
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,013
I will now present

407
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,224
the Pilo-dong Housing Site
Development Project.

408
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,979
This is the scheduled area

409
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,607
of the Pilo-dong housing site development.

410
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,275
This is Pilo-dong.

411
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,486
It's 1.8 million square meters big.

412
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,323
Now, 81% of this
has been purchased in advance

413
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,701
by you, the chairman, and our people.

414
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,079
The remaining 19%…

415
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,999
Now, 19% of this
is privately owned property.

416
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,793
But it's not enough to affect the project.

417
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,378
But likely will not
affect the project overall.

418
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,463
However,

419
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,298
if you say this,

420
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,509
the chairman will question you.

421
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,260
Are you sure this will go as planned?

422
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,931
The vice chairman seems to have forgotten

423
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,351
that 20 years ago,
during the first Anhyeon New City project,

424
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,187
we still struggled
despite owning a large percentage.

425
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,565
Don't underestimate that 19%.

426
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,944
About the remaining landowners,
how much do we--

427
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,028
Yes.

428
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,698
You make a good point, sir.

429
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,201
But that was 20 years ago.

430
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,664
Are you telling me
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

431
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,457
You can't be in his shadow forever.

432
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,879
If you let the chairman throw you off
at the start of the presentation,

433
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,966
this project will become his too.

434
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,385
Won Jong-soo.

435
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,678
Show them what you've got.

436
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,558
Show them you're more than capable
of leading this project.

437
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,477
The project's current obstacle

438
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,229
is Anhyeon City Hall.

439
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,856
The mayor of Anhyeon City thinks

440
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,150
KH Group earned too much in excess profits

441
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,612
during the first and second
Anhyeon New City projects in 2003.

442
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,740
He believes KH Group
earned too much in excess profits.

443
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,452
So even though the Pilo-dong project
went through official channels…

444
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
He thinks KH Group shouldn't do it.

445
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,498
So?

446
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,292
What Mayor Joo In-sang wants

447
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,420
isn't a 20-year-old
residential-oriented new town

448
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,047
but a future-oriented,
industrial complex city.

449
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,843
JOO IN-SANG PRESENTS PLAN
TO FOSTER BIOINDUSTRY

450
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,346
This article was written by Mayor Joo
when he was a university professor.

451
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
What he wants

452
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,434
is a bioindustrial complex.

453
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,020
He wants a large-scale industrial complex

454
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,522
that attracts pharmaceutical companies

455
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,900
and brings together
related businesses and research centers.

456
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,527
We need at least 30 companies.

457
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,112
To make that happen,

458
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,489
we need Korea's largest
pharmaceutical companies,

459
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,367
such as Igu Biotech
and Yongseong Pharmacy, to come in.

460
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,413
This part is already in progress,

461
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,664
and the response is positive.

462
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,376
Do you know Mayor Joo well?

463
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,170
I haven't met him yet,

464
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,630
but I know what he's like.

465
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,006
You should've met with him.

466
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,636
Major Joo is a lot more ambitious
than you might think.

467
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,930
-Someone like him--
-Yes.

468
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,100
He likely wants a bioindustrial complex
for another reason.

469
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,270
What Mayor Joo really wants

470
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,272
is an achievement.

471
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,359
He wants to create
a successful bioindustrial complex

472
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,029
that will establish him
as a strong politician in the region

473
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,491
which will serve as a way
to get into politics on a national level.

474
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,867
That's the achievement he wants.

475
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,954
And I can give

476
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,456
Mayor Joo what he wants.

477
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,959
We'll make legitimate contributions

478
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,337
and attract investors in an honest way.

479
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,551
The chairman looked very pleased.

480
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,886
It was a great presentation.

481
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,054
Sir.

482
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,555
The chairman would like to see you.

483
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,644
Of course.

484
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,564
ANHYEON ECONOMIC DAILY

485
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,115
-Hello?
-Is this Ms. Park Bok-rye's residence?

486
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,866
Who is this?

487
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,743
Hello, I'm…

488
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,871
We've met before. I'm Oh Yun-jin
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

489
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,873
How did you get my phone number?

490
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,127
Well, I…

491
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,922
Are you the one who asked
Eunseong Realty for my number?

492
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,219
I'm sorry, sir. Please don't be angry.

493
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,679
How can I not be angry?

494
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,889
How dare you use my mother's name?

495
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,726
I hear you claimed to be
my mother's adopted daughter.

496
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,102
I'm going to sue you.

497
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,563
Excuse me.

498
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,733
You're too afraid
to sue the ones who deserve it.

499
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,152
But you're going to sue me?

500
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,154
-What?
-You're her son.

501
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,365
You couldn't clear
your mother's wrongful death

502
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,868
and refused to meet with me
even though I wanted to help.

503
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,037
So I had no choice but to get your number.

504
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,039
So what? I mean,

505
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,958
where do you get off yelling at me?

506
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,169
-What?
-Aren't you angry?

507
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,504
It was obviously medical malpractice,

508
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,381
but you didn't get any compensation.

509
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,427
Your late mother would be so proud

510
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,888
to see that you've given up.

511
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,272
What do you want?

512
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,361
What I want is…

513
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,991
the truth about what happened that day.

514
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,289
Come over.

515
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,096
How long has it been since we texted
the senior who sells lemon pop?

516
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,263
It's been two hours.

517
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,474
He'll respond.

518
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,310
The quantity is too big to ignore.

519
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,647
If he responds,
someone has to take him there.

520
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,190
Who wants to go?

521
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,817
I'll do it.

522
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,113
I've gone undercover
as an addict before, remember?

523
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,824
I'll go today. You guys can go next time.

524
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,118
Su-hyeon, keep checking for responses.

525
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,161
Yes, sir.

526
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,928
Did your friend's funeral go smoothly?

527
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,304
Yes, sir.

528
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,393
Here.

529
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,939
Meet with Mayor Joo.

530
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,485
Figure out exactly what he wants
before you make any moves.

531
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,613
Understood, sir.

532
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,410
Was it Tae-jin's idea?

533
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,540
I noticed his speech patterns

534
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,709
in the business plan.

535
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,794
And in the presentation too.

536
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,382
Tell him that I said

537
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,678
not to get distracted
and to successfully complete the project.

538
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,308
Do the best you can
to provide him with whatever he needs.

539
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,477
Yes, sir.

540
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,227
You shouldn't get this wrong.

541
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,395
MAY 2003

542
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,732
MATHEMATICS

543
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,410
Park Tae-jin?

544
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,625
I heard you were top of the class
on the midterm exam.

545
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,709
Yes, sir.

546
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,337
He's always been first in his year
since middle school.

547
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,422
He also received top grades

548
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,966
when entering high school.

549
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,426
What do your parents do?

550
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,595
Cows…

551
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,889
They raise cattle.

552
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,978
They run a cattle farm
near the entrance of Hwanseong City.

553
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,980
I heard a lot about you from Jong-soo.

554
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,899
He says you're smart and polite.

555
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,069
And that you're a loyal friend.

556
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,281
What kind of friend is Jong-soo to you?

557
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,705
A rich friend.

558
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,333
Do you dislike him because he's rich?

559
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:16,919
I envy him.

560
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,842
I envy your parents for having such a son.

561
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,887
We seem to envy what the other person has.

562
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,934
Would you like to be rich too?

563
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,312
Yes, sir.

564
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,398
Then what will you do to become rich?

565
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,608
I'll continue to be the best.

566
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,652
I won't stop…

567
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,530
until no one's above me.

568
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,828
I've always hoped
Jong-soo would come in first.

569
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,498
I hired private tutors for him

570
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,376
and provided him with everything
that money could buy.

571
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,629
But I guess this is as far as he can go.

572
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,676
How about this?

573
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,055
You continue being the best.

574
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,681
And I'll provide everything

575
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,934
that money can buy to you too.

576
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,811
In exchange,

577
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,939
you have to make Jong-soo
the richest person in Korea.

578
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,693
That way, you and I
will both get what we want.

579
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,737
Of course,

580
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,491
you'll become rich
if you stay by Jong-soo's side.

581
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,827
For the next three years,
Jong-soo and Tae-jin

582
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:35,456
will continue to be in the same class
regardless of their grade level.

583
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,875
I want you to find students

584
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,088
who could be helpful to Jong-soo
and put them in the same class.

585
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,298
Yes, sir.

586
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,092
Young Master.

587
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,928
What are you doing here?

588
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,726
I'm sorry, sir.

589
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,156
What's next?

590
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,244
There's a training session
for new KH Pharmaceutical researchers.

591
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,879
Su-hyeon, any word?

592
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,964
No.

593
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,342
Should I send another urgent text?

594
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,511
No, let's just wait for him to respond.

595
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,289
What's wrong?

596
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,566
Sir, what are you doing here?

597
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,277
EVIDENCE LOCKER

598
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,251
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

599
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,093
Jeez!

600
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,389
What are you doing here?

601
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,017
Tell me.

602
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,022
I just asked what you're doing here.

603
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,654
What's the matter with you?

604
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,572
Are you sick?

605
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,699
I think I caught a cold.

606
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,204
Do you want to catch it?

607
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,795
You bastard.

608
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,009
We need to go, sir.

609
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,511
Right.

610
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,960
-Come in.
-Thank you.

611
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,135
Thank you.

612
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,224
I'm going to record

613
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,185
what you say.

614
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,270
Okay.

615
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,110
When exactly did your mother pass away?

616
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,195
On September 11th of last year.

617
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,156
How did she…

618
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,325
She had a brain tumor.

619
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,327
I see.

620
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,913
The hospital said they could
no longer treat her with chemotherapy.

621
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,957
So she received

622
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,793
a big prescription
of her usual painkillers.

623
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,920
It was called…

624
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,881
Just a moment.

625
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,594
It's this right here.

626
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,346
She took it every day.

627
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,806
Oh, it says here "Xinopam."

628
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,100
XINOPAM

629
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,103
Painkiller, Xinopam?

630
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,522
But she acted strangely that day.

631
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,900
When?

632
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,735
The day before she passed away.

633
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,030
After taking the medicine,

634
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,283
she suddenly had a seizure.

635
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,163
She broke out in a cold sweat
and talked incoherently.

636
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,916
She eventually fell asleep,

637
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,876
but the next morning,

638
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,171
someone kept tapping my leg
while I was sleeping.

639
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,090
I was startled and woke up,

640
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,466
but my mother…

641
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,136
She couldn't turn on her side
on her own for the longest time,

642
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,765
but she was sitting up halfway
and waking me up.

643
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,687
XINOPAM

644
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,821
TALK WITH THE CEO

645
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:02,408
We would like to thank
all board members and employees

646
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,826
for attending today.

647
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,745
For today's talk,
we have invited CEO Won Jong-soo,

648
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,747
vice chairman of KH Group

649
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,125
and CEO of KH Pharmaceutical.

650
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,045
Was it Tae-jin's idea?

651
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,923
I noticed his speech patterns

652
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,842
in the business plan.

653
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,719
And in the presentation.

654
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,432
I envy your parents for having such a son.

655
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,437
Please welcome CEO Won Jong-soo.

656
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,896
Let's give him a round of applause.

657
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,286
Sir? Sir!

658
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,329
Wake up.

659
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,290
Get it together.

660
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,459
Move!

661
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,836
Jong-soo, pull it together.

662
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,717
Please get out.

663
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,179
Get out!

664
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,807
Nobody is allowed in!

665
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,935
Jong-soo, get it together.

666
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,980
It's okay, Jong-soo. Jong-soo.

667
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,273
Jong-soo!

668
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,525
Jong-soo, can you hear me?

669
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,576
Jong-soo.

670
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,328
Jong-soo?

671
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,371
I said no one's allowed in here!

672
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,249
Give this to him now.

673
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,340
Jong-soo.

674
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,759
Jong-soo, swallow this.

675
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,177
Swallow it.

676
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,887
It's okay, Jong-soo.

677
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,223
Jong-soo, pull it together.

678
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,307
Jong-soo!

679
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,104
Jong-soo.

680
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,024
I was shocked at first,

681
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:03,320
and I thought maybe she was improving,
so I gave her more, but…

682
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,781
But?

683
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,907
She passed away

684
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,242
that night.

685
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,996
It must've been because of the medicine.

686
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,290
Otherwise, she could've lived
a few more months.

687
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,378
Or even a few more years.

688
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,048
What did the hospital say?

689
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,132
The hospital?

690
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,969
I couldn't believe it.

691
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,765
They said she died
because it was her time.

692
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,477
When I heard that,
I got so mad that I cursed them out.

693
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,813
Then the next day, someone came

694
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,233
and took away
all of the prescription medicine.

695
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,987
Why didn't you tell me this
when I came by before?

696
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,822
Why did you avoid me?

697
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,786
Because I promised not to cause trouble
by bringing up this matter.

698
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,249
So you received compensation.

699
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,876
They gave me a very small amount

700
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,712
even though my mother died.

701
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,756
If this story is published,

702
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,925
will those jerks offer more money?

703
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,137
Who came and took the medicine?

704
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,763
Were they hospital officials?

705
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,516
No, they came from KH Pharmaceutical.

706
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,396
They said they had to collect
the medicine to examine it.

707
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,606
Just a moment, please.

708
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,697
This is the business card
the employee gave me that day.

709
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,368
PARK JUN-SEO

710
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,760
Ma'am. He responded.

711
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,101
LET'S MEET AT AROUND 6:30 P.M.
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE

712
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,614
They almost never deal directly in person.

713
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,741
Did they not suspect you?

714
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,704
They actually thanked me
for holding on this long.

715
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,998
When we first met,

716
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,626
You said you had gone
a week without the pills.

717
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,544
Yes.

718
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,006
It must've been hard to survive a week
for someone who needs to take four a day.

719
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,634
I pretty much went to hell and back.

720
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,886
How did you bear it?

721
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,013
You must've had help.

722
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,475
You've experienced this, right?

723
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,103
Like when somebody
is squeezing your throat,

724
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,438
and you're just about to pass out,

725
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,733
but if they loosen their grip
for just a second,

726
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,319
you can suddenly breathe again.

727
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,281
There's a drug that can do
at least that much.

728
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,159
What's the drug?

729
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,371
Come on, I can't tell you that.

730
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:03,041
If you confiscate those drugs as well,

731
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,918
all of us addicts will die.

732
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,962
You're so greedy.

733
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,307
Mr. Kang Min-ho.

734
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,060
Now that I've ordered
all the food you want

735
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,354
and let you make phone calls…

736
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,358
you seem to think you can joke around.

737
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,528
Sorry, sir.

738
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,325
The meeting location is in Ohyeon-dong.

739
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,453
It's in the old Anhyeon shopping mall

740
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,246
where the electronics stores used to be.

741
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,416
Most of the stores have closed,
and the mall is now empty.

742
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,796
They're meeting at Store 44.

743
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,299
Where will we be if they meet indoors?

744
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,383
We plan to hide

745
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,051
right over here.

746
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,554
He'll need to wear a wire then.

747
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,514
But what if they pat him down?

748
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,309
If the wire is sewn into his jacket,
they won't find it through a pat-down.

749
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,396
We don't know
how much they trust Kang Min-ho.

750
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,900
They'll be suspicious of me,

751
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,569
and it's highly likely
they won't bring the drugs there.

752
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,447
So even if something happens inside,

753
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,907
don't jump the gun and move in.

754
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,991
Got it.

755
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,285
But will you be okay?

756
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,204
You don't look so well.

757
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,331
I'm fine.

758
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,208
What if…

759
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,794
I go in instead?

760
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,840
Why not?

761
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,510
I can pass myself off as an addict.
Do you want to see?

762
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,227
I'm so cold. I need drugs.

763
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,436
Please give me drugs.

764
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,146
-Get ready and move out.
-Yes, sir.

765
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,523
-Hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

766
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,276
I'm so cold. Give me drugs.

767
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,966
SCHEDULED FOR DEMOLITION

768
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,761
Is this the place?

769
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,264
You'll help me in return, right?

770
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,896
We're going in now.

771
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,037
This place gives me the creeps.

772
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,297
Sir.

773
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,602
Sir.

774
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,479
Sir?

775
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,409
Nice to meet you two.

776
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,538
Is it you, sir?

777
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,583
Min-ho!

778
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,251
It's been a while.

779
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,796
-Sir.
-Hey.

780
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,089
I missed you.

781
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,633
You crazy bastard.

782
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,052
Where's our backup?

783
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,054
They're on standby three minutes away.

784
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,432
Hey, you look pretty terrible.

785
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,935
He looks miserable. Give him a pill.

786
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,407
We haven't met.

787
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,077
Right.

788
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,125
Let's do a quick pat-down.

789
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,688
Let's see here.

790
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,484
Mr. Jung Yeong-gyu?

791
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,444
Yes.

792
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,742
You didn't bring the money.

793
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,329
It's in the car.

794
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,248
I see.

795
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,459
You seem to be okay

796
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,586
for someone who's been using our drugs.

797
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,798
How did you bear it?

798
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,261
Tell me.

799
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,569
What's the drug?

800
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,238
You need a prescription for it.

801
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,365
It's called Etaphen.

802
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,160
Etaphen.

803
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,378
Oh, the appetite suppressant?

804
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,049
I did hear of people using it to get by.

805
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,260
That probably didn't help much, though.

806
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,179
My dear customer.

807
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,598
You must feel anxious right now.

808
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:55,894
Okay.

809
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,980
This is just protocol,

810
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,774
so I hope you understand.

811
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,951
Just relax and take it easy.

812
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,745
I'm trying to make you feel good.

813
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,539
Let's take off your jacket.

814
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,624
Okay?

815
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,843
This is new. It's diluted lemon pop.

816
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,096
You know injection's
more effective, right?

817
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,014
Here's a sample.

818
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,892
They're sticking a needle
in Captain's arm, right?

819
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,937
They're checking to see if he's a cop.

820
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,979
What?

821
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,191
Addicts keep still,
but cops are afraid of getting addicted,

822
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,776
so they instinctively pull their arm away.

823
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,986
Then what about Captain?

824
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,322
Should we move in?

825
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,159
We don't know if it's a real drug
or just saline.

826
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,662
If we just move in

827
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,580
and it's not real,
it'll all be for nothing.

828
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,833
Captain Jang is keeping still
because he knows this.

829
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,503
Okay then.

830
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,214
I'm pushing it in now.

831
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,033
Okay.

832
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,285
You passed the test.

833
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,745
Come over here.

834
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,583
Min-ho, help him out.

835
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,798
You handled that well.

836
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,342
It's great, isn't it?

837
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,011
Come on, let's go.

838
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,288
Ta-da.

839
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,043
Now, let's go get the money.

840
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,420
Money first, drugs later.

841
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,548
Okay?

842
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,389
That bastard's a cop!

843
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,307
Kang Min-ho is on the run.

844
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,017
Damn it.

845
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,269
He's a cop!

846
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,944
Damn it.

847
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,959
The crazy bastard.

848
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,756
Damn it.

849
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,269
You bastard cop.

850
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,710
You think wearing leather makes you a cop?

851
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,463
Keep still!

852
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,593
Who are you, old lady?

853
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,429
Go home and cook, old lady!

854
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,806
This old lady is a detective.

855
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,267
I said go home and cook!

856
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,769
I actually like to eat out.

857
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,313
I said stay still.

858
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,397
Damn it!

859
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,574
Damn it!

860
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,254
About the needle

861
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,756
they put in your arm…

862
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,341
It didn't show up at the crime scene.

863
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,177
Did you do this to me?

864
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,304
This might be our last chance.

865
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,681
They won't just sit back and watch.
It's too dangerous.

866
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:34,060
But it looks like you know who killed him.

867
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,311
Are you insane, you bastard?

868
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,814
It'll be over for all of you idiots too!

869
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,233
Did Park Tae-jin kill Park Jun-seo?

870
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,693
He's been acting weird since the funeral.

871
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,821
The biggest cause
of our anxiety still remains.

872
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:45,822
So let's kill him.

873
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,198
We're going in right now.

874
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,491
-Want me to leave?
-What's this?

875
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,617
Yun-jin!

876
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,410
Someone help me!

877
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,495
Where are you right now?

878
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:03,756
