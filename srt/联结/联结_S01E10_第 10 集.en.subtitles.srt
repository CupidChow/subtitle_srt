1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,106
I'll take your bag.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,191
Thanks.

4
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,695
Satisfying, right?

5
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,281
It seemed pretty far-fetched though.

6
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,991
We should've watched Crying Fist.

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,327
But you don't feel
stressed anymore, right?

8
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,371
-Do you ever get stressed?
-What did you say?

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,290
-Say that again.
-Hey, Sang-ui.

10
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,292
-But you don't.
-What's going on?

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,671
Okay, I'll be right there.

12
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,673
What is it?

13
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,675
Hey, I have to go.

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,552
Hey, where are you going?

15
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
Hey!

16
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,813
Jun-seo.

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,068
This is…

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,445
Isn't this Gyeong-tae's house?

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
Where's Gyeong-tae?

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,741
Where's Gyeong-tae?

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,535
-Hold on.
-Let go of me.

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,829
Hey, where's Gyeong-tae?

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,163
Tell me where he is!

24
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,456
You can't go in.

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,209
It's…

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,336
It's too late.

27
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,839
Gyeong-tae!

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,340
It was an accident, Jun-seo.

29
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,967
-It was just an accident.
-What?

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,009
We have to go!

31
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,595
Hey, Chae Gyeong-tae!

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,180
-We have to go!
-Hey!

33
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:20,932
Gyeong-tae.

34
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,684
Chae Gyeong-tae!

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,436
Let me go, damn it!

36
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,939
I said let go of me!

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,679
It's me.

38
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,599
Jung Yun-ho was near my place just now.

39
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,766
I don't know where we went,

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,935
but he's using public transit
instead of his taxi.

41
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,813
He just used a payphone,
so ask them to trace the call.

42
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,398
Hold on.

43
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,280
The number is 031-0325-7898.

44
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,282
Okay, thanks.

45
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,335
What are these photos?

46
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,921
Let me explain.

47
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,422
I'll explain it to you.

48
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,549
I'll tell you, so give me back my phone.

49
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,093
Start talking.

50
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,474
I had Choi Ji-yeon followed.

51
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,436
That's how I found out
about her affair with Park Tae-jin

52
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,980
and how I got those photos.

53
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,148
Are you crazy?

54
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,275
What if Park Tae-jin finds out?

55
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,196
I told you
Park Tae-jin could be behind all this.

56
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,740
On top of that,
Jung Yun-ho is a murder suspect.

57
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,950
Why don't you get that?

58
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,618
Fine, I got it.

59
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,411
That's enough.

60
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,169
Choi Ji-yeon.

61
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,671
Are you still tailing her?

62
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,339
-Yes.
-Let's go then.

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,219
We're going?

64
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,868
KIM U-SEONG

65
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,913
Where are you?

66
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,123
Put him on speaker.

67
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,251
At Cossack. Fairy just went inside alone.

68
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,420
-Follow her in.
-I was going to do that.

69
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,964
I'm Jang Jae-gyeong
from Anhyeon Police Station.

70
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,300
-What?
-Can you get a recording?

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,760
It's okay. We're all on our way there.

72
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,555
Yes, I can do that.

73
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,558
Get a recording if Park Tae-jin arrives.

74
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,101
Don't do anything else. Just wait.

75
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,519
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,771
Where's Cossack?

77
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,106
In Hwanseong City's café district.

78
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,274
-I'll look it up for you.
-Okay.

79
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,442
-Let's step on it.
-Okay.

80
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,402
Hey, what does "Fairy" mean?

81
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,155
Oh, well…

82
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,449
It's Choi Ji-yeon's nickname.

83
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,117
Why "Fairy," though?

84
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,454
I'll tell you later. Here.

85
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,373
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,001
One iced Americano, please.

87
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,127
Okay.

88
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,132
U-seong!

89
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,388
-Ms. Oh.
-Hey.

90
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,896
Hello, I'm Kim U-seong
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

91
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,356
-Hurry up and connect it.
-Okay.

92
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,778
Did you find out anything?
What did Jang Jae-gyeong say?

93
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,239
I need to ask you something first.

94
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,949
Oh Yun-jin.

95
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,368
What was she to Park Jun-seo?

96
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,286
Did they date?

97
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,249
Did they?

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,501
You don't know?

99
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,587
I think they did for a bit in high school.

100
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,758
Why do you ask? Did something happen?

101
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,468
How did they start dating?

102
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,095
Wasn't she a transfer student?

103
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,265
After transferring,
she joined the music club Jun-seo was in.

104
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,100
Why do you ask?

105
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,686
That's when they dated?

106
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,148
How long did they date?

107
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,192
I don't know. I don't remember.

108
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,863
They dated briefly
then broke up after an incident.

109
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,531
What incident?

110
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,950
Something happened.

111
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,328
Jang Jae-gyeong had to transfer
and the music club disbanded after that.

112
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,415
My understanding is
that they broke up then.

113
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,458
That's it.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,502
Why did they say to you
to make you act this way?

115
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,504
What about recently?

116
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,466
Did my husband

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,093
say anything about Oh Yun-jin
before he died?

118
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,387
-Ji-yeon…
-Answer me!

119
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,266
Lower your voice.
What's the matter with you?

120
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,236
You made me come here
at this hour just to ask me this?

121
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,363
Is this important right now?

122
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,531
Yes.

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,658
It is.

124
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,290
As far as I know,
nothing went on between them.

125
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,669
Even if you keep asking,
I have nothing more to say.

126
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:32,345
The three of them were on their guard,
so I didn't learn anything new.

127
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,806
I'm going to Boryeong with them soon,
so I'll find out something then.

128
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,270
Did they seem unaware about Boryeong?

129
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,397
Yes.

130
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,945
Get friendly with them
as much as possible.

131
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,572
You're leaving already?

132
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,658
I have to go.
My family's waiting for me at home.

133
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,910
By the way…

134
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,584
Please make up your mind by this weekend.
The money won't matter to me…

135
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,463
after this weekend.

136
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
Why?

137
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,012
Let me know when you decide.

138
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,857
After leaving my place the way she did,
she just wanted to ask Park Tae-jin

139
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,151
whether you and Park Jun-seo dated?

140
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,737
I know.

141
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,574
I can't figure her out at all.

142
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,245
What?

143
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,708
Do you still have all the recordings
of Park Tae-jin and Choi Ji-yeon?

144
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,627
Do I? I'm not sure.

145
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,754
Do we?

146
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,550
We have some recordings,
but we deleted some too.

147
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,011
What did they talk about when they met?

148
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,471
They don't talk when they meet up.

149
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,057
They just went straight to a motel.

150
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,394
I guess you wouldn't know
because you haven't dated much.

151
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,312
Oh Yun-jin.

152
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,397
What?

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,984
You already knew this wasn't
their first meeting at this café.

154
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,069
So what did they talk about?

155
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,489
They really didn't say anything important.

156
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,533
It's what you'd expect
from a couple having an affair.

157
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,202
"Get a divorce." "No, I can't do that."

158
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,496
"Let's take off together."
"I don't want that."

159
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,624
-Is that right?
-Yes, sir.

160
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,625
What about the money?

161
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,129
Park Tae-jin said the money
won't matter after this weekend.

162
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,631
Is this news to you too?

163
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,965
Yes.

164
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,553
Maybe the two of them
invested in stocks or something?

165
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,979
Even if we don't get the password,

166
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,982
there's a chance
Park Tae-jin will talk about

167
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,485
what kind of account it is
and how much is in it.

168
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,410
ANHYEON POLICE STATION

169
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,039
I checked the CCTV cameras
in the area you mentioned,

170
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,040
but I got nothing.

171
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,919
If he hasn't left Anhyeon City by now,
there's a chance he'll stay.

172
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,754
How'd it go with Kang Si-jeong?

173
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,799
I asked if she knew of
any places where he'd hide,

174
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,716
but she remained silent.

175
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,885
Send her home for now,

176
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,262
-and have officers stand guard nearby.
-Understood.

177
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,056
What about the phone records
for the payphone?

178
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,224
We'll get them soon.

179
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,353
Hey there.

180
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
Hello, Section Chief.

181
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,276
Straw!

182
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,114
STATEMENT

183
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,616
What's all this about?

184
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,076
A guy named Lee Geun-ho

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,412
says he drove this car around.

186
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,288
Lee Geun-ho?

187
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,250
He used to drive hostesses
from the outskirts of town,

188
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,293
but he must've made some money recently

189
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,673
because I heard he started playing golf
and has been spending a great deal.

190
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,590
That's it?

191
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,134
Of course not, sir.

192
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,844
If you look here,

193
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,804
this is Lee Geun-ho's home address.

194
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,390
It says, "18-49, Join-dong."

195
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,392
Did anyone get hurt
while you looked into this?

196
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,939
I'm not exactly sure
what you mean by "hurt," sir.

197
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,899
Did anybody end up in the ER?

198
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,278
Oh, the ER? Nobody went to the ER, sir.

199
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,738
Everyone was relatively cooperative.

200
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,157
Good job.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,119
So does this mean
I'm no longer connected to this case?

202
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,120
What?

203
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,413
I'm completely done, right?

204
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:28,998
Excuse me?

205
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,418
What's that look in your eye, sir?

206
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,087
STATEMENT

207
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,225
You live at 18-49, Join-dong.

208
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,270
Did you think we wouldn't
find out on our own?

209
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,939
We're going to this address now,

210
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,442
so is there anything else
you want to tell us?

211
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,278
No, nothing.

212
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,488
Nothing?

213
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,406
-That's right.
-Okay then.

214
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,785
Oh, do you know the man
sitting next to you?

215
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,955
He's the owner of the car
you've been driving.

216
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,082
What are the odds, right?
Say hello to him.

217
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,793
Hello.

218
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,089
Your nickname is famous but not your face.

219
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,007
Introduce yourself.

220
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,614
Oh, shit! Straw?

221
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,539
Eleven years ago,
he went to see An Hyeong-sik,

222
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,625
the boss of the largest gang
in the western district of Seoul.

223
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,835
Of course, they searched him thoroughly,

224
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,338
so he basically entered the room
with nothing on him

225
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,007
where An Hyeong-sik
and five of his men were waiting.

226
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,425
And just like right now,

227
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,262
there were six iced Americanos
in the room.

228
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:11,600
By the time I got to the scene,
all six men in that room were dead

229
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,521
because their carotid arteries
were punctured.

230
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,774
The only thing found
in the hand of this guy,

231
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,944
who was covered in blood
and showing no signs of wanting to flee,

232
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,070
was a single straw.

233
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,200
After that, everyone called him Straw.

234
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,578
Come here.

235
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,580
Listen carefully.

236
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,583
You just turned the legendary Straw

237
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,586
into a petty suspect
in a drug case on the outskirts.

238
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,087
Look at his face.

239
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,382
You're in a very tight spot right now.

240
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,301
And…

241
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,429
We'll be going to this address right now.

242
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,973
Everyone will think
you gave us this information,

243
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,266
so now you're a rat too.

244
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,977
But if you still insist
you were alone on this,

245
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,605
we're willing to accept that.

246
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,231
It's up to you.

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,318
I…

248
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,111
What?

249
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,740
Send him to the prosecution

250
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,992
for grand theft auto and for violating
the Narcotics Control Act.

251
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,620
Hold on. Please wait a minute!

252
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,748
It wasn't me!

253
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,041
I swear.

254
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,585
How could someone like me
pull this off on my own?

255
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,046
There was another guy named

256
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,422
-Lee--
-Lee Geun-ho?

257
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,134
No, it was Gong Jin-uk!

258
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,219
Gong Jin-uk.

259
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,973
My boss's name is Gong Jin-uk.

260
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
He gave the orders.

261
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,226
Is this Gong Jin-uk?

262
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,978
Yes, that's him.

263
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,229
Is Gong Jin-uk also Doctor?

264
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,523
No, Doctor only makes the drugs.

265
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,067
We just distribute them.

266
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,568
Have you seen Doctor?

267
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,779
No, and Boss probably hasn't either.

268
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,198
He doesn't reveal his face.

269
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,824
Where does Gong Jin-uk live?

270
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,244
I don't… No, I swear I don't know!

271
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,288
Only Geun-ho knows where Boss lives.

272
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,581
And CEO Yoon?

273
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,792
Do you know CEO Yoon,
the main distributor?

274
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,918
Yes.

275
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,712
Most of our products
get distributed by CEO Yoon.

276
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
Where's CEO Yoon?

277
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,929
I'm not sure about that either.

278
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,307
Do you know anything?

279
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,518
This whole time, you knew nothing
yet refused to cooperate

280
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,686
and acted like a fool?

281
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,814
But I really don't know anything.

282
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,482
Damn bastard.

283
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,153
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,656
Check Gong Jin-uk's criminal record
and find out where he is.

285
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,573
Yes, sir.

286
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,283
Lee Geun-ho wouldn't be at home, right?

287
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,245
We'll look for Gong Jin-uk first.
If we can't, we'll go to Lee Geun-ho.

288
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,287
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,790
-Where are you going?
-I have to stop by somewhere.

290
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,959
Tell me right away
when you find Gong Jin-uk.

291
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,335
Yes, sir.

292
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,721
Please check your balance
and select a transaction option.

293
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,390
Please wait a moment.

294
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,892
Thank you for using our service.

295
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,731
What?

296
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,942
Boss, today's the day
we collect our money.

297
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,738
I told you to never mind that and lay low.

298
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,407
Why are you worried?
It's a routine pickup.

299
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,118
Let's be real. If the cops come after us,

300
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,412
we'll need money to go into hiding.

301
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,583
-I'll just go and collect the money.
-No. Do as I say.

302
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,419
If CEO Yoon finds out Dae-seong's been
arrested, we'll all be in danger.

303
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,755
How in the world would CEO Yoon find out?

304
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,133
And Dae-seong doesn't know anything
other than my address.

305
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,677
Lee Geun-ho. Do as I say.

306
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,140
I'll figure out something,
so don't do anything and lay low.

307
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,934
But Boss…

308
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,105
Damn it.

309
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,116
What did the board members say?

310
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,578
It's your job to make sure
they don't bring up anything weird.

311
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,996
Damn it.

312
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,460
You seem busy.

313
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,420
Okay, hang up.

314
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,344
Who the hell let someone into my office?

315
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,315
-What brings you here with no appointment?
-Can't you speak to me nicely?

316
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,651
You're so aggressive
that I don't know where to start.

317
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,155
Do you want a cup of tea?

318
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,282
Chi-hyeon told you
what we talked about, right?

319
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,619
Well,

320
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,373
he said you knew we were there
when Jun-seo died.

321
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,126
So what?

322
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,419
Do you need to confirm that with me too?

323
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,257
I read some interesting things
in Lee Myeong-guk's work logs.

324
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,051
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

325
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,639
That's where he made
and sold the drugs, right?

326
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,599
And you got Jun-seo
to deliver them to you.

327
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,395
How many pills do you take?

328
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,190
What?

329
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,819
I'm just curious. How many do you take?

330
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,035
So why did you and Lee Myeong-guk
have a falling out?

331
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,788
Did he charge too much for the drugs?

332
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,000
Did you tell Yun-ho
to kill Lee Myeong-guk?

333
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,796
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

334
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,173
Oh, wait.

335
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,135
Yun-ho couldn't have
moved the body on his own.

336
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,889
Right. You must have helped him.

337
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,640
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

338
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,475
The person who made the drugs

339
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,352
and the one who delivered them
are both dead.

340
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,273
The only one left is you, the user.

341
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,608
Isn't the answer obvious then?

342
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,902
Did you tell them to kill both men?

343
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,111
-Hey!
-Am I wrong?

344
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,322
You're wrong!

345
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,658
You're wrong.

346
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,121
You're running your mouth like that,
but you don't have anything on me.

347
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,624
Hey.

348
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,709
If you had anything on me,

349
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,545
you wouldn't be flapping your mouth here.

350
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,590
What is it?

351
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,342
"I killed Lee Myeong-guk."

352
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,886
"And I killed Park Jun-seo too."

353
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,931
Is that what you want to hear?

354
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,355
I don't care about getting a confession.

355
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,398
I just came to see

356
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,817
how badly you might panic
about what I told you

357
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,612
and how anxious
you might feel once I leave.

358
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,532
I was curious, so I thought I'd stop by.

359
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,287
But the next time I come,

360
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,457
I promise I'll cuff you.

361
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,375
Bye then.

362
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,712
I'm going.

363
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,045
Where have you been?

364
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,089
Somewhere nearby.

365
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,510
Did you take care of the taxi?

366
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,429
I hid it well.

367
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,348
Give me what I need.

368
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,942
Don't call anyone else.

369
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,485
Only call me on this phone.

370
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,611
I got it.

371
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,409
Hey, what evidence
does Jang Jae-gyeong have

372
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,453
to come after me?

373
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,289
-I don't know yet.
-You don't?

374
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,459
I'm not the only one in trouble, am I?

375
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,128
Can't you do something?

376
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,339
What are your plans?

377
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,842
I don't have any.

378
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,054
You need to make them for me,
like you always have.

379
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,390
You use your head,
and Chi-hyeon and I do as we're told.

380
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,601
Jeez.

381
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,399
You should be especially grateful to me,

382
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,985
so don't be so harsh, Tae-jin.

383
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,489
You said so yourself.

384
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,700
It doesn't matter
if I knew what I was doing.

385
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,162
I burned the rice mill's CCTV server,

386
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,664
so no one knows what happened that day.

387
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:01,088
If someone had killed Jun-seo
and made it look like a suicide…

388
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,424
You're the only one who comes to mind.

389
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,260
What?

390
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,679
Jong-soo has a soft heart,

391
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,057
even though he's immature.

392
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,559
Chi-hyeon might beat up someone,

393
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,145
but he wouldn't go as far as
causing permanent damage.

394
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,563
But you're different.

395
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,901
You could do it if you really needed to.

396
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,570
But this time,

397
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,115
you probably really needed to,

398
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,993
assuming that Jun-seo had found out

399
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,829
about you and his wife.

400
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,878
So what I'm saying is that
you were likely caught on camera that day,

401
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:46,424
but because I burned the CCTV server,
everything is okay now. Am I wrong?

402
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,846
Yun-ho.

403
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,013
What?

404
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,517
Like you said, don't use your head.

405
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,561
And keep your thoughts in check.

406
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,605
If you don't,
your life will get cut short.

407
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,149
Okay, got it.

408
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:03,775
I'll do that.

409
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,485
I'll keep my mouth shut

410
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,529
and do as you say,

411
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
so please help me out.

412
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,760
Yes?

413
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,679
Gong Jin-uk is 34 years old.

414
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:36,016
He's been convicted for an assault
and soliciting prostitution in the past.

415
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,727
He was running a hostess business
when he was arrested.

416
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,146
He probably met Lee Geun-ho
in that line of work.

417
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,564
I believe so, sir.

418
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,775
But how did he get in touch
with a drug manufacturer like Doctor?

419
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,486
Networks are important in that line
of work, but I don't see a connection.

420
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,446
I'm not sure, sir.

421
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,866
Kim Dae-seong claims they're too new
to have a distribution network,

422
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,410
so they relied on CEO Yoon
to sell 70% to 80% of their product.

423
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,622
Where are you right now?

424
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm on my way to Lee Geun-ho's house.

425
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,875
Shall I meet you there?

426
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,793
Okay. His address was--

427
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,170
Hold on.

428
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,546
UHYEON HEARING AID OWNER

429
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,797
The guy is here.

430
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,633
Please come right now.

431
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,761
I went there yesterday
and found this on the tracks.

432
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,223
People usually come back
to get the volume adjusted.

433
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,266
Chang-su, I can't go right now.

434
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,186
Check it out on your own,
and let me know what you find.

435
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,229
Yes, sir.

436
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,406
Say something, please.

437
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,451
Can you hear me?

438
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,536
Yes.

439
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,414
By the way,

440
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,875
do you work at a butcher shop?

441
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,295
No. Why do you ask?

442
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,546
Well,

443
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,299
it smells like
you've been to the butcher's.

444
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,644
Are we done here?

445
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,275
We need to do the other one too.

446
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,192
Let's take a look.

447
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,306
Hello, I'm here.

448
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,433
Good to see you. You're early.

449
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,643
Yes, I was eager to see you.

450
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,855
How is Mr. Gong Jin-uk?

451
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,024
Of course.

452
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,528
I came to get today's collection amount.

453
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,822
Yes, of course. Just a moment.

454
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,673
What is it again?

455
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,467
Guess where I am?

456
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:17,886
Where are you?

457
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,596
I'm in CEO Yoon's office.

458
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,183
I told you not to go there.
Why didn't you listen?

459
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,685
Come on. We do what we have to, sir.

460
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,022
CEO Yoon has no idea.

461
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,857
She asked after you.

462
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,152
Geun-ho.

463
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,196
Don't worry, sir.

464
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,114
I'll get the money and head right back.

465
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,325
Geun-ho, get out of there right now.

466
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,495
Boss, I said everything is okay.

467
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,288
CEO Yoon went to get the money.

468
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,875
Geun-ho?

469
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,001
Lee Geun-ho!

470
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,130
Here, ma'am.

471
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,595
Shall I go over there,
or do you want to come here?

472
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,639
CEO Yoon.

473
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,392
I'll kill you if you hurt him.

474
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,893
Right.

475
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,562
So shall I go over there,
or will you come here?

476
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,232
I'll go.

477
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,400
Okay.

478
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,113
I want the burner phone
that directly connects to Doctor

479
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
in exchange for Geun-ho.

480
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,324
Put Geun-ho on.

481
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,120
I don't think he'll last long.

482
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,081
You should get here in 30 minutes.

483
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,709
Damn it.

484
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,027
Here, try it.

485
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,287
Hey, I can hear well.

486
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,329
We're done then.

487
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,957
Come back if there's a problem again.

488
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,168
Thank you.

489
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,873
What are you looking for?

490
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,459
I thought I might find it,
but it's not here.

491
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,543
By any chance,

492
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,797
has this man been here before?

493
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,882
No, he hasn't.

494
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,843
Okay. Thank you, sir.

495
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,053
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

496
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,930
I told him to remove the label first.

497
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,057
Why won't he ever listen?

498
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,392
My word.

499
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,613
GONG * UK UNIT 302,
23 DAEUN VILLA, YEONGJI-DONG

500
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,535
Hello?

501
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,537
Hello, Detective Kim.

502
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,373
I'm calling because I have a gift for you.

503
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,294
I'll grab Gong Jin-uk and Lee Geun-ho
and hand them over to you.

504
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,754
In 30 minutes,

505
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:44,592
I'll have them nice and ready for you
in our building's basement boiler room.

506
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,802
So please

507
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,179
take them away quietly.

508
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,228
ANHYEON SHOPPING COMPLEX

509
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:20,939
Excuse me.

510
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,982
Did someone just pass by here?

511
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,944
He's about 180 cm tall and wearing a cap.

512
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,320
I don't know.

513
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,488
Okay. Thank you.

ANHYEON SHOPPING COMPLEX

515
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,017
You got here right on time.

516
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,312
Sir.

517
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,065
Did you ask that man
what he does for work before he left?

518
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,568
-You still haven't caught him?
-Do you know his job?

519
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,486
I didn't ask him that.

520
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,909
Kim Chang-su!

521
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,376
Kim Chang-su!

522
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,217
What are you doing here?

523
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,683
Over there.

524
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,960
What happened in there?

525
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,296
It's dangerous. Please move.

526
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,423
Go somewhere safe.

527
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,154
Hey.

528
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,532
Hey.

529
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,996
We're at Anhyeon Shopping Complex.
There's a gunshot victim.

530
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,525
Who are you?

531
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,529
Did you get me addicted?

532
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,908
Why did you do it? Tell me.

533
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,121
-Did you call an ambulance?
-Yes, sir.

534
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,249
Look at me. Do you know Park Jun-seo?

535
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,835
What about Park Tae-jin?

536
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,545
Do you know Park Tae-jin?
Did he order you?

537
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,754
Hey!

538
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,096
No, stay awake.

539
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,307
Do you know Park Tae-jin?
Did he order you?

540
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,975
Tell me.

541
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,146
Hey! Did you get me addicted?

542
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,360
You have to tell me.

543
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,403
Hey.

544
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,978
Yes, sir. I'll tell you after the meeting.

545
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:18,110
We need to find out the password
Park Tae-jin is looking for.

546
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,905
You're understimating Park Tae-jin.

547
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,408
He'll do anything to get Choi Ji-yeon
to give him the password.

548
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,869
Even if we don't get the password,

549
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,956
there's a chance
Park Tae-jin will talk about

550
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,625
what kind of account it is
and how much is in it.

551
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,515
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

552
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,558
What's that?

553
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,686
They're free gifts for our clients.

554
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,812
Oh.

555
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,647
I see.

556
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,608
Sir, I have to step out
and take care of some business.

557
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,069
Sure thing. I'll see you back here.

558
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,071
TWO STAR HOLDINGS

559
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,739
-Hello.
-Hello.

560
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,324
You're here.

561
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,119
Yun-jin.

562
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,371
Is she your only employee?

563
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,039
Yes. Take a seat.

564
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,835
Hey, you did it.

565
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,003
Gosh.

566
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,588
When I heard you went into insurance,

567
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,590
I didn't think you had
the right skills for it.

568
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,761
Jeez, why don't you
organize this as you go?

569
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,971
What is it anyway?

570
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,598
Hey, it's a gift for our clients.

571
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,599
It's a gift?

572
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,059
Go ahead and take it.

573
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,061
Here, I'll mix it in water for you.

574
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,733
Is it a supplement?

575
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,028
Hey, we give out good quality gifts.

576
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,946
I can see that. It looks great.

577
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,906
What brings you here?

578
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,991
Oh, well…

579
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,703
I wanted to ask you something.

580
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,207
Thanks.

581
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,547
What do you want to ask?

582
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,009
I'm not sure…

583
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,056
how to explain this.

584
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,684
-What if--
-Yun-jin.

585
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,311
Those "what if" questions.

586
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:20,775
Can you stop asking me "what if" questions
and what I'd do in those situations?

587
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,652
I didn't realize I asked so often.

588
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,408
The password…

589
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,497
is your birthday, right?

590
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,332
It's 0-3-0-5.

591
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,504
Yesterday, Ms. Choi…

592
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,634
She found out her husband kept using
his ex's birthday as his password.

593
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:47,635
That's why

594
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,304
she ran to the bathroom.

595
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,723
That's why she asked about you and Jun-seo

596
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,810
as soon as she met with Park Tae-jin.

597
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,105
How did you find out about that?

598
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,774
The money is connected
to Park Tae-jin and Park Jun-seo, right?

599
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,984
But Jun-seo is dead,

600
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,112
and Park Tae-jin needs to
withdraw that money,

601
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,865
and he thinks only Choi Ji-yeon
knows the password.

602
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,618
But that password is your birthday,

603
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,746
and the only two people
in the world who know this

604
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,540
are you and Choi Ji-yeon.

605
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,042
No, make that three since I know as well.

606
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,670
Just how much do you know?

607
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,839
If everything I've said so far is right…

608
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,841
Yun-jin.

609
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,386
Why did you come to see me?

610
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,561
That money…

611
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,359
Can't I keep it for myself?

612
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,944
No.

613
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,240
-Why not?
-Because you didn't earn it.

614
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,248
Right.

615
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,042
I didn't earn that money.

616
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,088
Do you think Park Tae-jin earned it?

617
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,551
Hey.

618
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,679
What do you think this means?

619
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,641
It means Park Jun-seo earned that money.

620
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,269
Park Tae-jin and Choi Ji-yeon
betrayed Park Jun-seo.

621
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,689
Is it right to let people like them
have that money then?

622
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,817
Look.

623
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,070
Think of it as me
coming across a treasure box.

624
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,700
It's hard to prove who the owner is
or how that money was earned.

625
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,204
Whoever opens the box gets to keep it.

626
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,749
But it just so happens

627
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,793
the password that unlocks the treasure…

628
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,840
turns out to be my birthday.

629
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,303
So is it still wrong for me to keep it?

630
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,680
If that's what you think,
why did you come to see me?

631
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,058
What is it you want to hear?

632
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,316
Yun-jin.

633
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,527
You know this isn't right.

634
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,031
You came here because you hoped
I'd tell you it's wrong.

635
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,081
No.

636
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,377
"Take the money."

637
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,049
I was hoping you'd tell me that.

638
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,910
Are you okay?

639
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,413
Yes.

640
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,249
Excuse me. Just a moment.

641
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,552
Okay.

642
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,015
I found the CCTV files.

643
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,057
I'll take a look.

644
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,100
Okay, sir.

645
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,975
She was already dead
when you arrived, right?

646
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,394
And you didn't find a firearm?

647
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,271
-Is that CEO Yoon?
-Yes.

648
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,773
We'll run a background check…

649
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,610
A test will confirm
it's from a 38 caliber.

650
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,404
Please let me know the results right away.

651
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,449
Section Chief, would you like
to see the CCTV footage?

652
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,202
Yes. Let's go.

653
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,131
You know this isn't right.

654
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:40,010
You came here because you hoped
I'd tell you it's wrong.

655
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,977
Ye-eun.

656
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,106
Hello?

657
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,274
Ye-eun?

658
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,569
-Ye-eun--
-It's me, Mom!

659
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,992
It's Mom.

660
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,704
Why aren't you in bed?

661
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,790
It's morning here.

662
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,126
Oh, that's right.

663
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,087
I keep forgetting.

664
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,714
But Ye-eun,

665
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,134
what's the occasion?

666
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,488
Thank you.

667
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,786
I'm so happy
you called to congratulate me.

668
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,957
Your birthday was yesterday,
but I forgot to congratulate you.

669
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,125
I'm sorry.

670
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,420
It's okay.

671
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,386
I miss you so much, Ye-eun.

672
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,555
I miss you too.

673
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,891
Mom, I have to go to school now.

674
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,018
Oh, okay. Bye then.

675
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,895
Ye-eun!

676
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,354
I love you, Ye-eun!

677
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,981
I love you too!

678
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,153
He has no prior murder record.

679
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:07,157
For him to be bold enough
to shoot someone in the chest…

680
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,618
It means he knew what was coming.

681
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,662
South Korea is surrounded by water.

682
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,664
Shooting and killing a person here

683
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,208
means you have to quit the drug business.

684
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,585
Then why did he shoot CEO Yoon?

685
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,630
He knew if he didn't kill her,
she'd come after him no matter what.

686
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,465
On top of that,

687
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,135
if Doctor were to deal with CEO Yoon
without going through Gong Jin-uk,

688
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,180
Gong Jin-uk would be left
with no bargaining chip.

689
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,686
He probably wanted to leave Doctor
with no viable option.

690
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,564
I had a travel ban imposed
when I issued a BOLO.

691
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,483
Stowing away will be his only option.

692
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,573
See if Gong Jin-uk has any connections
in China or Southeast Asia.

693
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,575
-Understood.
-And check stowaway routes.

694
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,034
-Yes.
-Will do.

695
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,163
Chang-su.

696
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,959
You never answered my question.

697
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:00,711
Excuse me?

698
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,423
How did you know to come here?
You were at Lee Geun-ho's house.

699
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,674
Oh, right.

700
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,093
I was searching his house…

701
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,139
when I found Gong Jin-uk's home address.

702
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,349
When I went over there,

703
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,019
he happened to come out.

704
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,895
So I decided to tail him.

705
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,065
You went to Gong Jin-uk's home alone?

706
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,193
Without reporting to me
or asking for backup?

707
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,320
Yes, sir.

708
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,072
I was going to call you
after staking out the place.

709
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:33,243
I was also surprised to see you here, sir.

710
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:39,958
Okay.

711
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,630
Captain?

712
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,842
Are you taking Etaphen right now?

713
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,261
Yes.

714
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,430
Do you feel okay?

715
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,182
For now.

716
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,559
That's a relief.

717
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,603
We need to catch these guys.

718
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,854
I'll collect the evidence

719
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,981
and return to the station
with CEO Yoon's guy.

720
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,239
Be safe.

721
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,158
See you at the station.

722
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,452
Yes, sir.

723
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,592
ANHYEON SHOPPING COMPLEX

724
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:34,971
Get in.

725
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,814
Go help out at the scene.

726
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,732
-I'll take him back myself.
-Yes, sir.

727
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,360
Keys.

728
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,087
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin-uk?

729
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,590
I'm sorry, but do you mind speaking up?

730
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,217
I'm hard of hearing.

731
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,511
Why did CEO Yoon call Gong Jin-uk?

732
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,973
She wanted to deal lemon pop
directly with Doctor,

733
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,600
so she tried to take his burner phone.

734
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,524
In exchange for Lee Geun-ho?

735
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,193
Yes.

736
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,209
Where are we going?

737
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,213
Listen to me carefully.

738
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:51,840
What?

739
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,428
If you swear on your life to keep quiet

740
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,598
about seeing me that last time,

741
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,143
I'll have your jail time reduced.

742
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,686
Got it?

743
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:09,149
How much time are we talking about here?

744
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,443
I don't know, you bastard.

745
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,905
If anyone asks, keep your mouth shut.

746
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,205
Detective.

747
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,959
I didn't have a choice
because CEO Yoon ordered me to,

748
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,961
but I killed a lot of people.

749
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,964
So are you sure
you can reduce my jail time?

750
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,258
It sounds difficult to me.

751
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,679
So how about if you just drop me off

752
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,473
right up there?

753
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,266
Are you insane?

754
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,603
I can't let you go after so many people
saw you getting arrested.

755
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,939
Damn it, then what am I supposed to do?

756
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:53,151
I saw how close you and CEO Yoon were
and how you two exchanged money.

757
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,154
I won't get out of prison early
just because I keep quiet.

758
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,991
Oh, and the other detective back there…

759
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,618
I remember him

760
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,954
because I got him addicted to lemon pop.

761
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,456
He's a druggie, right?

762
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,708
What?

763
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,508
What's wrong with cops these days?

764
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,718
One guy is an addict

765
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,555
-and the other is--
-Shut your mouth!

766
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,431
I promise I'll live quietly,

767
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,308
so drop me off at that intersection.

768
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,477
Otherwise…

769
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,187
I've got nothing to lose.

770
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,093
Hey! Stop the car!

771
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,096
Stop the damn car!

772
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,254
GOLD PC ROOM

773
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,884
Who is she to rent out the whole place?

774
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,595
-I'm so pissed.
-Same here.

775
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,282
Hey.

776
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,786
Take a seat.

777
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,766
OH YUN-JIN
I KNOW THE PASSWORD

778
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,101
What's this text?

779
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,811
It's as it says.

780
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:19,107
Do you even know what the password is for?

781
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,359
No, I don't.

782
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,196
I see you're trying to test me--

783
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,240
Then keep asking Choi Ji-yeon.

784
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,081
I have a question.

785
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,001
How did you

786
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,878
make this money?

787
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,255
Why do you want to know?

788
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,801
Why wouldn't I be curious?

789
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,179
After all, I'm taking half of it.

790
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,849
I don't want to get in trouble
if it's dirty.

791
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,145
Answer me.

792
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,480
How did you make that money?

793
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,523
Did you make it illegally?

794
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,985
What if I did?

795
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,241
Not telling me the password
and keeping me from taking the money

796
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,286
is your way of making sure
justice is served?

797
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,791
Be honest. You don't care
where this money came from.

798
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,088
I've seen many like you
while working as a prosecutor.

799
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,715
"I didn't know it was wrong
from the start."

800
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,884
"I didn't mean for that to happen."

801
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,387
After saying that,
they still want to reap the benefits.

802
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,059
Look around.

803
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,936
You chose this location.

804
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,397
You rented out this entire PC room
to withdraw the money online,

805
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,568
but you want me to tell you
where the money came from?

806
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,740
Yun-jin, I'm saying this as a friend,

807
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,952
but shouldn't you be
more honest with yourself?

808
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,746
Don't you agree?

809
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,335
So cut the crap and give me the password.

810
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,400
My gosh.

811
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,110
You're really photogenic.

812
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,868
Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission,
SPO Inspection Department,

813
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,496
broadcasting companies, Anhyeon Police
Agency, Anhyeon Municipal Office,

814
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,206
Oh Chi-hyeon, and Won Jong-soo.

815
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,794
Is this enough?

816
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,090
You've been busy.

817
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,389
I'll put in the password myself.

818
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:02,020
If you transfer half of the money
into an account that I designate,

819
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,023
I'll give you the originals

820
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,484
of these photos and recordings.

821
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,880
Oh Yun-jin!

822
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,515
You…

823
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,350
Just die!

824
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,904
Yun-jin!

825
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,489
Yun-jin.

826
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,545
Wake up.

827
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,731
Chang-su!

828
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,982
Hold on. Chang-su!

829
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,526
Chang-su, are you okay?

830
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,988
Don't move. What happened?

831
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,741
This is my fault.

832
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,492
I thought I could escort him back alone.

833
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,537
So what exactly happened?

834
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:29,250
I had him handcuffed in the back seat,
but Ko Gi-seong started kicking.

835
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,379
Maybe something made him nervous,
but he was out of control.

836
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,799
I used my arm to defend myself
and tried to calm him down,

837
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,009
but it didn't work.

838
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,678
I tried to get control of the wheel,

839
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,555
but ended up like this.

840
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,767
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

841
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,935
-How do you feel?
-I'm okay.

842
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:51,564
You're lucky you weren't hurt more.
You almost got killed.

843
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,316
We need to transport him now.

844
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,317
Yes, of course.

845
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,985
Chang-su, take care.

846
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,153
See you at the hospital.

847
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,946
-Su-hyeon, go with him.
-Got it.

848
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,158
Jeez.

849
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,414
This is unbelievable.

850
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,875
First, someone gets shot to death.

851
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,920
Then a person of interest dies
on the way to the station.

852
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,631
I'm afraid of what might happen tomorrow.

853
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,800
The commissioner will go after the chief,

854
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,678
and the chief will come after me.

855
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,360
What is it?

856
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,697
-It's nothing.
-Don't lie.

857
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,283
You think something is off. What is it?

858
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:49,080
Ko Gi-seong attacked him
from behind the passenger seat.

859
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,081
But the car

860
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,460
drove straight into the water
after veering to the right.

861
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:55,962
So?

862
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,797
Remember what Chang-su said?

863
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,800
Ko Gi-seong attacked him with his feet,

864
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,177
so he used his arm to defend himself.

865
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,304
If so, his body
would've shifted to the left,

866
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,724
causing the steering wheel to turn left.

867
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,601
So how did the steering wheel turn right?

868
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,894
Well, I suppose…

869
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,357
If the steering wheel had turned left,

870
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,277
the car would've crossed the centerline
and crashed over there,

871
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,404
so maybe he tried to overcorrect

872
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,991
by subconsciously turning
the wheel to the right.

873
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,785
And if he jerked the wheel too hard

874
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,080
without really thinking, then…

875
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,291
It's possible.

876
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,584
I suppose it's possible.

877
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:36,711
Let's go.

878
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,190
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

879
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,817
How did the driver,
Kim Chang-su, escape the car?

880
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,196
By the time we arrived,
he was already on the riverbank.

881
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,200
Did anyone lower the driver side window?

882
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,327
No, we just pulled the car out.

883
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:13,748
And power windows don't work
if the car is submerged in water

884
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,541
because the engine cuts off.

885
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,667
I see.

886
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,545
Are you saying

887
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,881
the window was down
when the car hit the water?

888
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,550
In this weather?

889
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,596
Then did Chang-su…

890
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,188
But Jun-seo is dead now.

891
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,983
So who's running the lemon pop business?

892
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,401
-Good job.
-Thanks.

893
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,318
Sang-ui.

894
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,196
I told you not to call me about this!

895
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,114
Are you Doctor?

896
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,408
Sang-ui, did you meet with Jae-gyeong?

897
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,784
-Yes.
-I knew it was you.

898
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,580
We can't let him be.

899
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,039
Are you saying we should kill him?

900
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,040
Is there any alternative?

901
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,585
You damn idiots,
Park Tae-jin was behind all this!

902
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,961
I won't take the fall for this.

903
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,170
We'll all go down.

904
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,047
You and Tae-jin
killed Jun-seo, didn't you?

905
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,257
What are you talking about?

906
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,343
I bet you don't know what to think.

907
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,263
You think one of us did that to Jun-seo.

908
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,932
But you can't prove
we were directly involved in his murder.

909
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:55,975
You must've had your wheels turning.

910
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,101
But too bad.

911
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,854
I think I almost have you.

912
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:00,813
All I have to do

913
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:02,899
is reach my hand out and get you.

914
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:09,822
