1
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,089
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,729
What time did he go in?

3
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,930
Hasn't it been over 30 minutes?

4
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,269
It has.

5
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,209
Hey.

6
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,709
What?

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,219
How do you know the passcode
to their place?

8
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,960
I know what you're thinking.

9
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,400
I told him.

10
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,469
I rushed to the hospital
when I heard of Jun Seo's news.

11
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,646
Prosecutor Park wanted to double-check
although it was a suicide,

12
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,585
so he asked to drop by...

13
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,840
and look through our laptop
or any memos...

14
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,225
Ji Yeon,

15
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,480
I told you to change the passcode.

16
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,249
I tried it just in case,
and you haven't changed it.

17
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,359
If you don't know how to change it,
shall I do it for you?

18
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,760
No. I'll change it myself.

19
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,359
Okay.

20
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,560
You took a look at Jun Seo's laptop?

21
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,670
Why?

22
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,239
I wanted to see if anything indicated
something other than suicide.

23
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,340
He could've left a suicide note.

24
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,340
And rather than
have detectives come and go,

25
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,509
Ji Yeon said she'd prefer it
if I came by as a friend.

26
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,749
Why are you here at this hour?

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,509
What do you mean "this hour?"

28
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,695
A civil servant
usually gets off work at this hour.

29
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,460
It's not a special timeframe.

30
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,430
Why are you here?

31
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,729
Ji Yeon wanted to know
how the investigation would proceed.

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,075
I'd said I'd visit when I could.

33
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,169
And I chose to come today.

34
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Okay?

35
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:24,969
What about you?

36
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,870
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
I'll go now.

38
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Okay.

39
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,620
Step aside.

40
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Why did you come here?

41
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:37,979
Step aside.

42
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,030
Mr. Park.

43
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,936
I'm sorry to say this when you came by.

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
It's a bit late, and I'm tired.

45
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,669
I'll meet you near your office one day.

46
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,175
That would be better, right?

47
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,639
Call me when you're free to come by.

48
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,870
I'll leave you, then.

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,169
Bye.

50
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:10,280
(Connection)

51
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,390
What did you come to ask her?

52
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,390
How is the investigation proceeding?

53
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,689
What?

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,530
You called it a suicide.

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,645
I'm wondering what investigation
there could possibly be...

56
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,539
for you to come and explain.

57
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,270
We did an autopsy,

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,439
and Ji Yeon was concerned too.

59
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,090
(Episode 6)

60
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,360
They're coming out.

61
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,690
What's going on?

62
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:30,099
Did Jang Jae Gyeong not catch on?

63
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,530
It looks like it.

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,200
He's so slow.

65
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,945
Isn't it obvious what it is
if a man visits a woman...

66
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,000
after sundown?

67
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,369
Inspector Jang arrived after sundown too.

68
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,609
Darn you.

69
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,349
- Hey.
- What?

70
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,119
Where is she going?

71
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,159
Look.

72
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,530
Hey.

73
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
- Follow her.
- Okay.

74
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,320
- Take care.
- Thanks.

75
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,229
(Every second counts for the informant.)

76
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,729
Hello.

77
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,570
Everyone went out?

78
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,070
Yes, to have dinner.

79
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,250
Did you look into CEO Yoon?

80
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,650
Yes, but I didn't find much.

81
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,670
Where did you go
and what did you look into?

82
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,390
I asked the meth dealers I knew.

83
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,030
But no one had heard of CEO Yoon.

84
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,960
It's possible the person changes names.

85
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,900
Dealers tend to do that.

86
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,770
Is that it?

87
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,130
I'll ask around some more.

88
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
Captain.

89
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,070
Did I do something to upset you?

90
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,039
You've been treating me differently.

91
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,849
I tried to think of a reason,

92
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,419
but I couldn't come up with one.

93
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,310
The night Lee Myung Guk's house
burned down.

94
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,500
You returned to the station
instead of securing the scene.

95
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:44,929
- Yes.
- Why?

96
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,070
I'd noticed a car
speeding away from the scene.

97
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,246
I thought it would take a while to put
the fire out and Forensics to start,

98
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,640
so I decided to give chase.

99
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,169
And I saw the car...

100
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,309
drive into the police station.

101
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,309
And then?

102
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,650
Did you come into the office?

103
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Yes.

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,549
When you came in...

105
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:13,890
What was the situation like?

106
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,659
There was no one here.

107
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:18,775
What?

108
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,229
The room was empty
when I came in, but...

109
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,500
Soo Hyun's desk area was a mess.

110
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,616
- And then?
- I cleaned up,

111
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,780
then went downstairs
to see the CCTV footage.

112
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Why?

113
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,250
To locate you and because...

114
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,580
the office situation seemed off.

115
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,049
And?

116
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,349
The system...

117
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,690
failed to record what had happened then.

118
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,320
I told the security staff to fix it.

119
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,929
They couldn't.

120
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,559
The bottom line is that...

121
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,030
I should've stayed and managed
the Lee Myung Guk scene,

122
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,330
and I know it was my mistake
to leave early.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,176
I know you must think...

124
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,940
- I lack in many ways and...
- No.

125
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,710
It's not that. Don't mind it.

126
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,380
I was a bit too tired...

127
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:09,979
and on edge, I guess.

128
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,220
Hey, she pulled over. Stop the car.

129
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,970
- Yoon Jin.
- What?

130
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Over there.

131
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Hey.

132
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,209
- Did you bring your camera?
- You bet.

133
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,650
Here.

134
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,760
Look at that punk smile.

135
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,059
Are you having fun?

136
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,610
What's that?

137
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,246
I suddenly craved some caffeine.

138
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,010
Are you the only one that needs caffeine?

139
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,110
You should learn to share.

140
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:54,689
I'm heading in.

141
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,159
Okay. Take care.

142
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,079
Thanks.

143
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,159
Shall we move tables?

144
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:38,929
Drink your coffee.

145
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,439
(Oh Yoon Jin)

146
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,209
(Oh Yoon Jin)

147
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,839
Why did you come over so suddenly?

148
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,010
I didn't know Jae Gyeong would be there.

149
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,179
You should've texted me.

150
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,120
It didn't sound off, did it?

151
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Did he suspect anything?

152
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,319
We got away with it.

153
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,260
What did he want?

154
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,559
He asked to see Jun Seo's laptop
and some USB flash drives.

155
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,459
He looked for videos and played them all.

156
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,530
Videos? Like what?

157
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,470
I sat next to him and watched.

158
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,640
They were clips of Yoon Hee
or stuff we'd taken on trips.

159
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,289
I don't know what he was looking for,

160
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,080
but I don't think he found it.

161
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,909
Don't mind him. There's nothing he can do.

162
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,089
So,

163
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,220
did you give it some thought?

164
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:37,459
About what?

165
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,089
About what I said last time.

166
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,699
About leaving together?

167
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,730
Wasn't that a joke?

168
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,100
- I'm not in the mood for jokes.
- Do you think I am?

169
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,775
You barged in out of the blue
and strangled me,

170
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,199
demanding I hand over the passcode.

171
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,809
- And now you want to leave together?
- A passcode?

172
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,110
He strangled her?

173
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,980
I apologized profusely
and more than enough for that.

174
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,020
Let's not drag it on.

175
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,589
If I give you the passcode,

176
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,890
will you really leave with me?

177
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,159
Yes.

178
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,699
You say you'll quit your job
and elope with me,

179
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,580
but why can't you say
you'll get a divorce?

180
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,470
Isn't that the right order?

181
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:26,740
Get a divorce.

182
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,079
Then I'll give you the passcode
and go anywhere with you.

183
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,480
I will get a divorce,

184
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,049
but not in the order you want, Ji Yeon.

185
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:36,949
You can't get divorced overnight.

186
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,295
If we move abroad together,

187
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,490
I can get someone
to file the paperwork for me.

188
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,720
- Why is that so important?
- It is important.

189
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't want to be...

190
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,699
an adulterer who fools around
with married men.

191
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,030
So until you bring me
the signed divorce papers,

192
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,299
I won't tell you anything.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Give me your hand.

194
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,809
Come on.

195
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,449
Ji Yeon.

196
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,689
I love you.

197
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,289
What's most important to us now...

198
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,790
is our sincere love for each other.

199
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,030
And...

200
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,669
my feelings won't change.

201
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,429
At this moment...

202
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,500
and in the future,

203
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,770
what's most important to me...

204
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,039
is you.

205
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,780
What a joke.

206
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,419
The money in there...

207
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,760
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

208
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,765
It's more than enough
to start over anywhere,

209
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:53,789
so let's...

210
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,929
be a little wiser.

211
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,339
Give me a little more time.

212
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,740
It's not an easy decision for me either.

213
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,780
Shall we leave?
Let's get something nice to eat.

214
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,329
What are you doing? Follow them.

215
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,230
They'll notice if I follow them there too.

216
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,669
Darn it.

217
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:39,470
Did you have breakfast?

218
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,439
I haven't yet, so I'm hungry.

219
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,545
But then and even now,

220
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,339
I've never been able to eat...

221
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,620
after paying my respects to a victim.

222
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,549
Shall we have some gukbap?

223
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,020
He wouldn't have died...

224
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,390
if not for me.

225
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:03,459
Why guilt-trip yourself?

226
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,020
Catch the killer.

227
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,459
He was watching me from close by.

228
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,100
He learned about the camera because of me.

229
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,299
He knew I'd go back to my car,

230
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,709
and he used that opening.

231
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,870
Jae Gyeong.

232
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,679
Are you hiding something
from me these days?

233
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,720
You always did a good job
investigating cases,

234
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,760
and I kept my distance and watched
to stay out of the way.

235
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,860
But the day you found Lee's body
and then this time.

236
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,900
It feels weird.

237
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:50,870
Talk to me if you're stuck on something.

238
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,270
When did worrying about it
on your own ever work?

239
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,240
Everyone who can talk is talking about it.

240
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,710
They're saying...

241
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,226
you're poking around...

242
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,130
in other people's cases
for the insurance money.

243
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,950
That you look down on others
since you got promoted.

244
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,750
Is that what you're like?

245
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,089
I need to know something
if I'm to cover for you.

246
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,129
The tip-off on the delivery...

247
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,329
at the subway station.

248
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,299
It was from...

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,039
my dead friend Park Jun Seo.

250
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,270
The 1882 text?
From the Doctor or something?

251
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,710
And...

252
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,579
Lee Myung Guk whose body I found.

253
00:18:36,109 --> 00:18:37,989
He was a researcher
at Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,

254
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,520
and he knew Jun Seo
from their high school music club.

255
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,365
What does Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
have to do with it?

256
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,920
The CEO of Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

257
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,706
(We offer our deepest condolences.)

258
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,160
The prosecutor who did the postmortem.

259
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,930
Me and Oh Yoon Jin, the journalist...

260
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,930
mentioned in the written will.

261
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,839
We were all in the same class
in high school.

262
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,170
Then...

263
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,309
your dead friend who sent you
the Lemon Mulberry tip-off,

264
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,510
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical's CEO,

265
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,879
and the current deputy chief prosecutor
are all involved?

266
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,490
I see why you kept it to yourself.

267
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,930
Do you have an outline of the whole case?

268
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,430
I have my suspicions,

269
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,770
but they're all hard to prove.

270
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,039
Yoo Kyung Hwan wants to...

271
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,639
file your friend's suicide,
Lee Myung Guk's death,

272
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,609
and this murder
all as separate, unrelated cases.

273
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,049
Are you...

274
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,780
going to keep digging?

275
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,619
Yes.

276
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,589
I can't give permission.

277
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:56,230
But I just condoned it.

278
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,899
There's one more thing...

279
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,799
I need you to condone.

280
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,839
Number three. Yes, that one.

281
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:10,410
Hey.

282
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,410
- Unit Chief Jeong.
- Salute.

283
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,855
What do I owe the honor?

284
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,319
It's no honor.

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Here.

286
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,020
Cheol Hong, this is a rare cup of coffee.

287
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,996
It's almost impossible to get a coffee...

288
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,460
Unit Chief Jeong paid for herself.

289
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,129
I can't believe it happened to me
before I retired.

290
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,430
Don't be silly.

291
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,000
- Are you busy?
- No.

292
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,799
Then can I have a word?

293
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,190
You're scaring me. What is this about?

294
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:46,410
Jang Jae Gyeong.

295
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,210
Jang Jae Gyeong?

296
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,250
That punk hasn't returned his gun.

297
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,589
How much longer
must I break the rules to put up with it?

298
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,220
Until...

299
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,460
I tell you to stop.

300
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,559
What?

301
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:08,799
You have ten days at most.

302
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,339
On Monday two weeks from now,

303
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,339
a routine firearms
and ammo inspection is scheduled.

304
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,809
You must...

305
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,109
find your gun and put it back before then.

306
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,420
That's the most I can do for you.

307
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:34,789
Hello?

308
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,500
Hello. I work at Anhyun City Hall Station.

309
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,899
You checked our CCTV footage.

310
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,270
- Yes.
- I'd like to speak with you.

311
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,609
Did you see it?

312
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:51,579
It's what I saw last time.

313
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,910
No, look.

314
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,950
Did you see it?

315
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,319
What is that?

316
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,206
The trains weren't in service yet,

317
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,660
and we'd left
the screen doors open for testing.

318
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,329
Here it is.

319
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,730
I checked yesterday
and found this on the tracks.

320
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,250
The money in there...

321
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,780
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

322
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,825
It's more than enough
to start over anywhere,

323
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:34,849
So,

324
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,460
we...

325
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,329
The money in there belongs...

326
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,930
to you and me
since only we know the passcode.

327
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,299
It's...

328
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,000
"Belongs to you and me
since only we know the passcode."

329
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,770
Then why did he ask CW for the passcode?

330
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,579
Does Tae Jin not know it?

331
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,809
You're right.

332
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,910
It sounds like a large sum of money.

333
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,396
Where is that money from,
and what kind of account is it?

334
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,049
How come only CW knows the passcode?

335
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:08,750
Is Tae Jin panicking
because he doesn't know it?

336
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,690
What's certain...

337
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,260
is that it's dirty money.

338
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,930
Also, the original owner
of this account is Park Tae Jin.

339
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,099
- What?
- Right?

340
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,139
Listen to the conversation carefully.

341
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,139
CW doesn't even know
how much is in there right now.

342
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,609
Right.

343
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,039
Look.

344
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,510
Tae Jin says...

345
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,250
it's enough for them to start
a new life anywhere,

346
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,720
but he doesn't say the amount.

347
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:42,119
This means CW has no idea
what kind of account it is.

348
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,059
She also has no idea...

349
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,700
where the money came from.

350
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,160
So she knows the passcode,

351
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,859
but she can't withdraw the money.

352
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,889
She doesn't know
how much is in there either.

353
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:54,569
But...

354
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,976
if Park Tae Jin is the account holder,

355
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,170
why wouldn't he know the passcode?

356
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,450
(Woohyun Hearing Aid)

357
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,200
Where did you get this?

358
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,170
It's from a crime scene.

359
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,869
I heard this was the only place...

360
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,710
that supplies the product in Anhyun.

361
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,879
Yes, it's from our store.

362
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:43,010
Do a lot of people use this model?

363
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,879
Not really.

364
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:50,136
People prefer smaller
and lighter products these days.

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,220
Is it possible to tell me who bought this?

366
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,700
They came yesterday.

367
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,099
What?

368
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:05,839
They came here to get a new one...

369
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,440
to replace the missing side.

370
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,510
But I don't know their name...

371
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,910
or their number.

372
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,180
What did they look like?

373
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,809
Make a guess.

374
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:18,750
He looked like a troublemaker, no less.

375
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,789
They'll come back.

376
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:29,960
Usually,
people return to adjust the volume.

377
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,246
Hello.

378
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,039
I was wondering
when you would come today.

379
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,910
Ta-da. I kept it aside for you.

380
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,386
Thank you.

382
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,490
What are you doing?

383
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Did you eat?

384
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,230
I did. Why?

385
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,960
No reason. I was just curious about
what you were doing.

386
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,569
Hey, why did you go
to Choi Ji Yeon's yesterday?

387
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,299
I had to check something.

388
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,186
And? Did you find out anything?

389
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,886
(And? Did you find out anything?)

390
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,910
No.

391
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,585
But how did you know I went there?

392
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:28,166
(But how did you know I went there?)

393
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,896
He didn't find out anything?

394
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,389
(But how did you know I went there?)

395
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:32,789
Well,

396
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,960
Joo Song dropped you off nearby,

397
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:37,930
so I made a guess.

398
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,105
(So I made a guess.)

399
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:41,470
Are you feeling okay?

400
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,946
Are you craving the drug?

401
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,075
(Are you craving the drug?)

402
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,069
I'm okay. Don't mind me and focus on work.

403
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:48,785
Are you serious?

404
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,156
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

405
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,386
How can I not?

406
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,525
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

407
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,055
I'm the only one who knows
you're a walking time bomb.

408
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,065
(Don't mind me and focus on work.)

409
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:03,690
If there are any signs, contact me.

410
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,889
You refused to see a doctor
until the case was solved.

411
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:08,990
This is the least I can do.

412
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:11,829
All right.

413
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,746
So how did Park Bok Rye's case go?

414
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,115
(So how did Park Bok Rye's case go?)

415
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:20,039
I'm about to call her son again.

416
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,420
I'll call you if I find out anything.

417
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,039
Hey.

418
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,309
You should call me too.

419
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,649
Don't keep information to yourself.

420
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,525
Fine.

421
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:30,619
(Fine.)

(Chairman, Won Chang Ho)

433
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,859
Let's start.

434
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,976
(Pilo-dong Development Plan)

435
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Now,

436
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:28,369
I will begin the presentation
on the Pilo-dong Development Plan.

437
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:33,139
What you see on the screen...

438
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,619
is the district
in Pilo-dong planned for development.

439
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,280
This is Pilo-dong.

440
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:39,609
It's 1.8 million square meters.

441
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
Out of this,

442
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,510
eighty-one percent was bought
in advance...

443
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,849
by you, the chairman, and our people.

444
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:49,990
The remaining 19 percent...

445
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,166
The remaining 19 percent
is privately owned...

446
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,936
But it won't get in the way of the plan.

447
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,605
But it's unlikely it'll get in the way
of this plan.

448
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,629
But,

449
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,399
if you say this,

450
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,845
the chairman will definitely question you.

451
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:04,309
I'm not sure if it will go smoothly.

452
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,809
Maybe you forgot,

453
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,180
but 20 years ago during
the first Anhyun development project,

454
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:14,309
we also owned a large percentage
but still faced difficulties.

455
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,720
We shouldn't overlook the 19 percent.

456
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,265
As for those landowners, how much...

457
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,289
Right.

458
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,690
You have a point,

459
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,389
but that was 20 years ago.

460
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,700
Are you telling me...

461
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,530
to ignore the chairman's opinion?

462
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,299
How much longer do you plan
to stay in the chairman's shadow?

463
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,899
If you let him walk all over you
at your first presentation,

464
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,109
this project will go under him too.

465
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Won Jong Soo,

466
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:46,809
show us what you've got.

467
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:51,349
Show everyone you can lead
this project on your own.

468
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,060
The only thing getting in the way
of this project...

469
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,525
is the city of Anhyun.

470
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:58,089
Mayor Joo In Sang of Anhyun thinks...

471
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,359
Keumhyung Group made excessive earnings
during the first...

472
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,736
and second Anhyun development plans
in 2003.

473
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,045
He believes Keumhyung Group made
excessive earnings.

474
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:10,006
So even if he heard
of the Pilo-dong Development Plan...

475
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,646
via an official route...

476
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,470
He doesn't think
Keumhyung Group should do it.

477
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,569
So?

478
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,410
What Mayor Joo In Sang wants...

479
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,579
is not a residential town
that's over 20 years old.

480
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:23,669
What he wants is an industrial complex
that's future progressive.

481
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:26,625
("Biotechnology Professor Joo In Sang,
Blueprint for Promoting Bioindustry")

482
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:27,729
This article was written...

483
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,460
when Mayor Joo was a university professor.

484
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,420
What he wants...

485
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,559
is a bioindustrial complex.

486
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:37,176
He wants it
to attract pharmaceutical companies...

487
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,760
and have related organizations
and labs concentrated in one area.

488
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,410
What he wants to make
is a large-scale industrial complex.

489
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,670
We need at least 30 companies for it.

490
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:48,270
In order to do this,
we need Korea's biggest Yigu Biotech...

491
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:51,539
and Yongsung Pharmacy to move in.

492
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,149
We're already in negotiation with them,

493
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,780
and their feedback is positive.

494
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,490
Do you know Mayor Joo In Sang well?

495
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,295
I have yet to meet him,

496
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,966
but I'm aware of
what kind of person he is.

497
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,089
You should've met with him.

498
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,460
He's more ambitious...

499
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,690
than he looks.

500
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,859
- Such a person...
- Right.

501
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,129
He wants a bioindustrial complex,

502
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:16,270
but not for genuine reasons.

503
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,339
What Mayor Joo In Sang wants...

504
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,970
is an achievement.

505
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,480
By establishing
a successful bioindustrial complex,

506
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,010
he can make himself look like
a politician deeply rooted in the region.

507
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:31,525
Moreover, it can create a path...

508
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,109
for him to join the central government.

509
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,990
I can create...

510
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,460
what Mayor Joo dreams of.

511
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,229
We'll make fair contributed acceptance...

512
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,200
and attract investment honorably.

513
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,539
The chairman looked pleased.

514
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,115
Your speech was impressive.

515
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,440

the chairman is asking for you.

516
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740

Well...

Are you the one who asked Eunsung Realty
for my number?

525
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,210
Yes, I'm sorry. Please don't be upset.

526
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,680
How can I not be upset?

527
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,849
How dare you go around
abusing my mother's name?

528
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,926
I heard you introduced yourself
as my mother's foster daughter.

529
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,220
I'm going to sue you.

530
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:43,619
Hey.

531
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,840
I know you don't dare touch
the people you should sue.

532
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:49,289
Who are you threatening to sue?

533
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,099
- What?
- You're her son.

534
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,329
Why aren't you doing anything
to prove she died unfairly?

535
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,599
I'm offering to help,
yet you won't see me.

536
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,970
I had no other choice
but to get your number.

537
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,569
So what?

538
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,699
What are you screaming for?
It's not like you're someone special.

539
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,839
- What did you say?
- Doesn't it make you mad?

540
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,149
It's clearly a medical accident,

541
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,280
but you're not getting any compensation.

542
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,149
Just sit there and sulk.

543
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:16,849
Your mother would be happy to see that.

544
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,359
What do you want?

545
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,440
What I want?

546
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,809
The truth behind what happened.

547
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:43,649
Come over.

548
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,666
How long has it been...

549
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,375
since we texted that person
who sells Lemon Mulberry?

550
00:34:58,399 --> 00:34:59,460
About two hours.

551
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,370
They'll reply.

552
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,470
The quantity is too big
for them to ignore.

553
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:07,669
Someone has to go out with him
when they get in touch.

554
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,370
Who wants to go?

555
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,979
I'll go.

556
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,149
I sneaked in last time
by impersonating a druggie.

557
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,950
You two can do it next time.
I'll go this round.

558
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:20,249
Soo Hyun, keep an eye on the text.

559
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:21,850
Okay.

560
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,705
(Keumhyung Group)

561
00:35:36,729 --> 00:35:38,799
Did you see your friend off
at his funeral?

562
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,609
I did.

563
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,310
Here.

564
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,910
You should try and meet
with Mayor Joo In Sang.

565
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,749
Figure out exactly what he wants
before you make your move.

566
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:57,720
Yes, sir.

567
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,490
Was it Tae Jin's idea?

568
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,700
I can see traces
of his manner of speaking...

569
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,600
in your business plan.

570
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,899
The same goes for your presentation.

571
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,439
Tell him I said this.

572
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,749
Don't get sidetracked
and do your best until it's wrapped.

573
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,220
If he needs any support,
give him the best you can.

574
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:28,589
Yes, sir.

575
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,935
How could you get this wrong?

576
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:11,459
(May, 2003)

577
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,799
(Mathematics)

578
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,280
Park Tae Jin?

579
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,519
I heard you got the highest midterm score
at school.

580
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,756
Yes, sir.

581
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,450
He was always ranked first
ever since middle school.

582
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,160
Of course, he entered high school
with the top marks too.

583
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,660
What do your parents do?

584
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:44,899
Cow...

585
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,060
They farm cows.

586
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,999
They run a livestock farm
right where the city of Hwansung starts.

587
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,116
Jong Soo told me a lot about you.

588
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,970
He says you're smart and polite.

589
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,879
He also says you're loyal.

590
00:38:00,709 --> 00:38:03,049
What kind of friend is Jong Soo to you?

591
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,919
(Won Jong Soo)

592
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:10,760
A rich friend.

593
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,459
Do you not like that he's rich?

594
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:16,959
I envy him.

595
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,799
I envy your parents
for having a son like you.

596
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,939
It seems we envy each other
for what we have.

597
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,910
Do you wish to be rich too?

598
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,625
Yes.

599
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:37,479
What will you do to become rich?

600
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,720
I'll continue to keep my place in first.

601
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,749
Until...

602
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,620
there's no one else above me.

603
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:50,899
I always wish for Jong Soo
to get the first place.

604
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,299
I got him a tutor...

605
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:57,439
and did everything I could with money.

606
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,499
But it looks like this is his limit.

607
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,609
How about this?

608
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:08,680
Keep your place in first place,

609
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:10,749
and I promise...

610
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,979
to support everything you need
that requires money.

611
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:18,819
In return,
make Jong Soo the richest man in Korea.

612
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,689
Wouldn't that satisfy both of us?

613
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,999
Of course, you'd become extremely rich
if you stayed with Jong Soo.

614
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,700
For the next three years,
Jong Soo and Tae Jin will stay...

615
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,815
in the same class as your students...

616
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,569
even if they move up in grades.

617
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,839
As their teacher, look after them...

618
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:42,010
and assign any useful individuals
to Jong Soo's class.

619
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,280
Yes, sir.

620
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,749
Young Master,

621
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:49,220
what are you doing here?

622
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm sorry.

623
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,410
What's next on my schedule?

624
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,415
You have to go
to Keumhyung Pharmaceutical Lab...

625
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:13,310
for the new researchers' training.

626
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,850
Soo Hyun, any updates?

627
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,266
Should I urge them to reply...

628
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,565
saying we're in desperate need
of the drugs?

629
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,459
No, they'll reply. Let's wait.

630
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,560
What's wrong?

631
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,696
Captain, what are you doing here?

632
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,319
(Temporary Evidence Storage)

633
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,339
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

634
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:53,640
Gosh, you scared me.

635
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,649
Hey, what are you doing here?

636
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
What?

637
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,959
I asked you what you were doing.

638
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,330
What's up with you?

639
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,530
Are you sick?

640
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,899
I think I have a cold.

641
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,309
Would you like to catch it too?

642
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,879
Darn it.

643
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:34,249
You need to get going soon.

644
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,850
Okay.

645
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:08,359
- Hello. Please come in.
- Thank you.

646
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,370
- Here you go.
- Oh, right.

647
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,330
I'll record...

648
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,475
what you say.

649
00:43:25,499 --> 00:43:26,499
Okay.

650
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,280
When exactly did your mother pass away?

651
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,350
September 11 of last year.

652
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,310
How...

653
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,419
She had a brain tumor.

654
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,220
I see.

655
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:45,120
The hospital said she couldn't even do
chemotherapy anymore.

656
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,630
So, we had gotten a large prescription...

657
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,959
for the painkillers she used to take.

658
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,799
It was called...

659
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,930
Hang on.

660
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
This was it.

661
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,545
This was what she'd take every day.

662
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:02,045
Oh, it's written here.

663
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,069
Xinopharm.

664
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,386
(Xinopharm)

665
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,209
"Pain relieving medication, Xinopharm."

666
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,580
But that day, she seemed a bit strange.

667
00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:13,049
Which day?

668
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:14,850
The day before she passed away.

669
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,160
After she took that medicine,

670
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,490
she suddenly started seizing.

671
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,060
She was having cold sweats,
and she was rambling too.

672
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,700
Then, she fell asleep.

673
00:44:29,129 --> 00:44:30,669
And early the next morning,

674
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,299
someone kept touching my leg
while I was asleep.

675
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,315
So, I woke up startled.

676
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:37,339
My mother,

677
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,350
who hadn't even been able
to turn over in her bed by herself,

678
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,819
was sitting halfway up and was waking me.

(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,
A Talk with the CEO)

681
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:02,545
Welcome to the executives and employees
of Keumhyung Pharmaceutical...

682
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:03,899
who are here today.

683
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,016

and Keumhyung Pharmaceutical's CEO.

685

Here is CEO Won Jong Soo.

686
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,249
Was it Tae Jin's idea?

687
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,625
I can see traces
of his manner of speaking...

688
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,096
in your business plan.

689
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,390
The same goes for your presentation.

690
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:28,565
I envy your parents
for having a son like you.

691
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:31,576
Everyone, here is CEO Won Jong Soo.

- Wake up.

696

Wake up.

697
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,749
Out of the way!

698
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,749
- What happened?
- Jong Soo, wake up.

699
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,290

Oh, gosh.

702
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,406
Get out!

703
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,530
What's going on?

704
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,930
No one comes inside. Got it?

705
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:12,169
Jong Soo, wake up. Okay?

706
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,939
Jong Soo, it's okay.

Jong Soo.

711
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:31,660
I told you that no one could come in!

712
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,490
Feed him this now.

713
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,569
Jong Soo.

714
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,729
Jong Soo, swallow this, okay?

715
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:45,140
Swallow this.

716
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,939
Jong Soo, it's okay.

717
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:49,109

Jong Soo.

720
00:46:57,549 --> 00:46:59,120
At first, I was surprised,

721
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:01,525
but I thought
her condition might've improved,

722
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:03,350
so I gave her more of the medicine.

723
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,620
And?

724
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,490
Then, she passed away that evening.

725
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,060
I'm sure there was something weird
about that medicine.

If not, she would've had
another few months, at least...

727
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,040
A few years more...

728
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,569
to live.

729
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:23,240
What did the hospital say?

730
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,339
The hospital?

731
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,040
I couldn't believe it.

732
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,950
They said it was her time to go,
so she did.

733
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,756
After I heard that, I was so furious...

734
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,419
that I cursed them out.

735
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,919
Then, the next day, someone came.

736
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,390
And they took away all of the medicine
we had gotten back then.

737
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,835
If that had been the case,
you could've said something...

738
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,229
the last time I came.

739
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,999
Why did you avoid me?

740
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:52,899
I promised them that I wouldn't cause
any more problems on this matter.

741
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,410
You must've gotten compensated.

742
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,979
They paid me the tiniest bit.

743
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,850
My mother had passed away.

744
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:04,949
If you write an article about this,

745
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,080
will those guys say they will pay me more?

746
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,089
Was it the people from the hospital...

747
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,990
who took the medicine away?

748
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,589
No. They came from
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

749
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:17,705
They said the pharmaceutical company
had to take the medicine back...

750
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,560
to see if there was something wrong.

751
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,700
One moment.

752
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,540
This is the business card
of the person who came back then.

753
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,410
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical, Park Jun Seo)

754
00:48:47,919 --> 00:48:48,930
Ma'am.

755
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:50,129
We got a text.

756
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,240
(Let's meet around 6:30.
I'll let you know where.)

757
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:10,780
I'm sure it's rare to meet in person
to make a deal.

758
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:12,819
Didn't they suspect you?

759
00:49:12,979 --> 00:49:13,979
No.

760
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,525
They were actually grateful,

761
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:18,229
wondering how I had stuck it out
until now.

762
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,120
When you first met me,

763
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,830
you said you hadn't taken the pill
for about a week.

764
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:24,565
Yes.

765
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:26,036
If you take four pills a day,

766
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,341
it would've been hard to endure
a whole week without them.

767
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,830
I was close to death a few times.

768
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,069
How did you endure it?

769
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,220
I'm sure you didn't quit cold turkey.

770
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,730
You have that kind of experience,
don't you?

771
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,040
When someone chokes you hard...

772
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,479
and you're about to pass out,

773
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,926
but then, they let you go
for the tiniest moment,

774
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,426
you get a rush of air.

775
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,770
You feel like you can live again.

776
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:53,260
There's a pill that can help
to that degree.

777
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:55,959
What is that pill?

778
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,430
Come on.

779
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,499
I can't tell you that.

780
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,830
If you confiscate all of those pills too,

781
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:05,040
all of us druggies will die.

782
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:07,200
You're too greedy.

783
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,280
Mr. Kang,

784
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:22,189
you must be feeling comfortable...

785
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,790
since I order you
everything you want to eat...

786
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,129
and even let you use the phone.

787
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
Sorry.

788
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,129
The meeting is in Ohyeon-dong.

789
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,640
It's inside
the old Anhyun Shopping Mall...

790
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:41,486
where several electronics stores
used to be.

791
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,415
Most of the stores here have
gone out of business,

792
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:44,569
so it's now empty.

793
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,025
They said they'd meet in Unit 44.

794
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:52,625
If they're meeting indoors,
where will we be?

795
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,649
We will be...

796
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,395
hiding here.

797
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,689
Then, you'll have to wear a mic.

798
00:50:58,359 --> 00:50:59,736
They will search your body, though.

799
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,036
If we sew it into his jacket,

800
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,180
they won't be able to find it
with a rough body check.

801
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,629
We don't know
how much they trust Kang Min Ho.

802
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,045
They'll doubt me for sure,

803
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:13,399
It's highly likely that they won't bring
the pills to that meeting.

804
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,370
So, even if something goes down inside,

805
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:17,145
don't come in too rashly.

806
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:18,180
Got it.

807
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,339
But will you be okay?

808
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,350
You don't look too great.

809
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:24,479
I'm good.

810
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,350
Don't be like that.

811
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,589
Should I go in?

812
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
Why not?

813
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:35,560
I'm good at acting like a druggie.

814
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,060
Do you want to see it?

815
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:45,169
I'm cold. Give me some pills.

816
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,875
- Give me some pills.
- Hey, let's hurry up and get going.

817
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:49,669
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

818
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,209
So cold. Pills...

819
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:15,999
(To be demolished)

820
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:19,870
Is this it?

821
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,069
You will help me, right?

822
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,080
We're heading in now.

823
00:52:44,189 --> 00:52:46,060
This place just keeps getting
more decrepit.

824
00:52:54,569 --> 00:52:55,569
Senior.

825
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,749
Senior.

826
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,490
Senior.

827
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,430
It's nice to meet you both.

828
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:28,439
Senior, is that you?

829
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,510
Min Ho!

830
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,510
It's been a while.

831
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:36,749
- Senior.
- Yes.

832
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:38,180
I missed you.

833
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,749
You psycho.

834
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,326
What about backup?

835
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,710
The patrol unit's forces are standing by
three minutes away.

836
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,120
Hey, you look terrible.

837
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,105
I can't stand to see him
in this pitiful state.

838
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:50,129
Give him a pill first.

839
00:54:03,669 --> 00:54:04,740
I haven't seen you before.

840
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
Right.

841
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,819
Let me do a body search.

842
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,339
All right.

843
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,510
Mr. Jeon Young Kyu?

844
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:41,979
Yes.

845
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,949
You didn't bring any money, though.

846
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:51,490
It's in the car.

847
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:53,359
I see.

848
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,530
I hear you've been taking our pills.

849
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,560
You seem rather normal.

850
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,600
How did you endure it?

851
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,269
How?

852
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:22,620
What is that pill?

853
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,890
You need a prescription for it.

854
00:55:25,919 --> 00:55:27,089
It's called Etaphen.

855
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:30,290
Etaphen.

856
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,370
Oh, that anorectic agent?

857
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,129
I hear lots of people took that
to hang in there.

858
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,240
But I'm sure that wasn't enough
to do anything.

859
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,249
My dear customer.

860
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:51,850
You must be in quite a rush right now.

861
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:55,950
Okay.

862
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,290
Since this is the protocol
in our line of work,

863
00:55:59,919 --> 00:56:00,990
please understand.

864
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,669
Gosh, hang on.

865
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,839
Loosen up.
We're just trying to make you feel good.

866
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,439
All right. Take off your clothes.

867
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,850
This is watered down Lemon Mulberry.
It's a new product.

868
00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:31,329
You know that it acts faster
if you inject it, right?

869
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,089
Give it a taste.

870
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,000
Aren't they sticking a needle
in Captain's arm?

871
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,060
Those jerks are trying to check
if he's a cop or not.

872
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:40,330
What?

873
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,975
A druggie would stay still,

874
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,346
but a cop would be afraid
of being addicted...

875
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,210
that he'd pull his arm back
without meaning to.

876
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,100
Then, what about Captain?

877
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:49,640
Should we go in?

878
00:56:50,569 --> 00:56:53,180
We don't know if that's really a drug
or just saline.

879
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:57,319
If we bust in without knowing,
it'll all go to waste if it's not a drug.

880
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:59,950
Captain Jang knows that,
which is why he's holding still.

881
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:03,549
Let's see.

882
00:57:04,749 --> 00:57:06,060
Here comes the drug.

883
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,890
Okay!

884
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,890
We've checked your identity.

885
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,830
All right. This way.

886
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:20,859
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

887
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,569
Min Ho, take care of him.

888
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,609
You're handling yourself well.

889
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,180
Isn't it awesome?

890
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,939
Let's hurry. Come on.

891
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,209
Ta-da.

892
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,786
All right.

893
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,050
Let's go and get the money now.

894
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,410
Money first. Drugs later.

895
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,549
Okay?

896
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,490
That punk is a cop!

897
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:21,399
Kang Min Ho is on the run.

898
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:23,105
Darn it.

899
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:24,760
That jerk is a cop!

900
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:48,149
Min Ho, that psycho jerk.

901
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,019
Stop!

902
01:00:05,229 --> 01:00:06,569
You darn cop!

903
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,705
Why?

904
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,790
You think wearing leather makes you a cop?

905
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Stay still!

906
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:38,569
Who are you, lady?

907
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,200
If you're an old lady, go home and cook.

908
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,640
Sure. I'm an old lady detective.

909
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:45,939
Go home to your kitchen.

910
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,986
No thanks, I like eating out.

911
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,149
I told you to stay still.

912
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,089
(Connection)

913
01:03:16,229 --> 01:03:19,205
(Connection)

914
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,775
The needle they used to inject you...

915
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,430
We couldn't find it on the site.

916
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,100
Are you the one doing this to me?

917
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,446
This might be our last chance.

918
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,815
They won't just sit and watch.

919
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:30,910
It's too dangerous.

920
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:33,915
You look like you know
who killed Park Jun Seo.

921
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:35,379
Are you out of your mind?

922
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,350
That'll be the end of you too!

923
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:40,426
Maybe Park Tae Jin killed Park Jun Seo.

924
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,696
He was acting suspiciously at the funeral.

925
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,995
What causes
our biggest anxiety still remains.

926
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:45,995
That's why we should get rid of it.

927
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:47,019
We're heading in.

928
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,490
- Shall we go?
- What is this?

929
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,766
Yoon Jin!

930
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,229
Help!

931
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,399
Where are you right now?
