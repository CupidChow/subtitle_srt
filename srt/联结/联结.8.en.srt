(April 2005)

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,375
Let's watch "Crying Fist."

5
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:18,876
"Innocent Steps" just came out
in theaters.

6
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:19,876
Let's watch that.

7
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:20,985
Hey, Joo Song.

8
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,985
Our exams just ended.
"Innocent Steps?" What are you saying?

9
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,886
"Crying Fist" is the way to go.

10
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,825
That's right.
I vote for "Crying Fist" too.

11
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:29,755
What about you?

12
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:31,895
I want to watch "Kingdom of Heaven."

13
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,965
Hey, that doesn't open in theaters
until next week.

14
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:35,766
Really? Why did you hit me?

15
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,766
Hey, let's decide when we get there.

16
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,256
The class president went to see a movie
with Yoon Jin and Jae Gyeong.

17
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:58,216
I can't even reach him.

18
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,826
(Park Tae Jin)

19
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:01,726

20
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,125
(Jeong Sang Eui)

21
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,125
Jeong Sang Eui!

22
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:10,635
Chae Kyung Tae.

23
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:13,805
Did that jerk take...

24
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,775
your money again?

25
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,586
(Park Tae Jin)

26
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:33,685
We're going on our own without Jun Seo.

(Say no to redevelopment

34
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,706
I arrived about ten minutes early,

35
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:30,075
but I wasn't the first to arrive.

36
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,286
Who's there?

37
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,385
Jeong Sang Eui?

38
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,556
It's you, Tae Jin.

39
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:39,985
Did Jun Seo tell you to come here too?

40
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,126
Yes.

41
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:46,395
That looks like a switch.

42
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:47,626
Will you flip it?

43
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,395
Okay.

44
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,306
That'll do.

45
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:14,855
What's this?

46
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:17,026
He called you to come too?

47
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:21,596
What about Park Jun Seo?

48
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,696
Where was he then?

49
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,705
- Upstairs.
- "Upstairs?"

50
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,346
Explain further.

51
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:35,575
You guys arrived at the construction site,

52
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,675
and Park Jun Seo was
on the ninth floor. Correct?

53
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,515
Yes.

54
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:41,246
But how did you know
he was on the ninth floor?

55
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:43,415
The lights came on.

56
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,085
What time is it now?

57
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,395
It's almost 11:30 p.m.

58
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,265
What?

59
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,036
He must be up there.

60
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:57,936
Hey, Park Jun Seo!

61
00:03:58,396 --> 00:03:59,605
Are you up there?

62
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,566
Come on down, punk!

63
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:05,575
(Seeing danger is
the first step to safety.)

64
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,675
We should go up.

65
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,946
Hey, how can we ride that?

66
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,246
Jun Seo went up by taking that too.

67
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,385
Hey.

68
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,645
(Beware of falling objects)

69
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:20,686
Darn it.

(Freight elevator)

71
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,196
Everyone must've been nervous
because no one was talking.

72
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,825
And I think we were passing
the fourth floor or so.

73
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:04,566
Just as we were looking over
at Pilo-dong through the wire mesh...

74
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:14,806
Did you see that?

75
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,686
We all tried to
look over the wire in shock,

76
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:26,856
but we couldn't see much.

77
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,056
That's when Jun Seo fell?

78
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:34,225
Yes.

79
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,796
Are you saying he killed himself?

80
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,275
Just when you guys were in the elevator,

81
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,475
Jun Seo jumped from the ninth floor?

82
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:48,775
I didn't say he jumped.

83
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,405
We only saw him fall.

84
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,475
Are you...

85
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:54,446
making an alibi for the others?

86
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:00,616
Who saw Jun Seo fall?

87
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:01,686
Did you see it too?

88
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:04,655
Jong Soo and Tae Jin saw it.

89
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,525
So you didn't go to the ninth floor?

90
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,196
Tae Jin pressed the stop button.

91
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,566
Hey, Park Jun Seo. Are you up there?

92
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,035
Let's go down.

93
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,825
(Elevator Safety Protocol)

94
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,626

95
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:49,135
(Beware of falling objects)

96
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,446
Who is it?

97
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,686
It's not Jun Seo, is it?

98
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,265
Is it Jun Seo?

99
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,395
Who is it?

100
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:19,306
It's Jun Seo.

101
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:25,905
Did you check too?

102
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:28,845
Yes.

103
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,116
Did you see with your own eyes
if Jun Seo was dead,

104
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,916
or did you assume he was dead?

105
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:37,085
Tae Jin went up to him
and checked his pulse.

106
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:38,756
Tae Jin?

107
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,856
Then he said we should get out of there.

108
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,455
That it wouldn't help anyone if word
got out that we were there that late.

109
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,265
Tae Jin said that too?

110
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,265
Was it all Park Tae Jin?

111
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:51,566
You lot can't do anything without him.

112
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,736
What then?

113
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:56,205
We all left the way we came in.

114
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:57,876
We went our separate ways
at the main road.

115
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,676
We found our own ways home.

116
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,986
You guys...

117
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,325
You did the same 20 years ago
when Chae Kyung Tae died.

118
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:16,155
You provided each other
with witness statements and alibis.

119
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:18,325
Do you think you can
get away with it this time?

120
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,395
Whether you believe me or not
is up to you.

121
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,965
If what you said is true,

122
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:26,635
Jun Seo called you all there
at 11:30 p.m. to say something.

123
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,765
He came to me before he died...

124
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:31,036
and said
he'd put everything back in order.

125
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:33,835
He said that only to jump
to his death right when...

126
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:34,835
you guys were on your way up?

127
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:36,176
Do you think that makes sense?

128
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:38,886
You guys in the elevator.

129
00:08:39,175 --> 00:08:41,316
One is capable of killing others
without getting...

130
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:42,955
a drop of blood on their hands.

131
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,986
Another is capable of carrying out
a task as soon as the order is given.

132
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:48,455
And the third is capable
of covering it all up.

133
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,526
If just one of those three...

134
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:53,795
had a reason that what Jun Seo
wanted to say couldn't come out,

135
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:54,926
then it's possible.

136
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,395
You just had to get someone
to push Jun Seo...

137
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,196
when you all could alibi each other out.

138
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:01,266
But what are you?

139
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:07,905
A spectator who just watches,
whatever they do?

140
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:08,975
Is that what you are?

141
00:09:18,555 --> 00:09:20,455
You're the investigator.

142
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,855
That's for you to find out.

143
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:35,066
There's a mill by the corner
of the construction site.

144
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:37,735
Under the eaves of that mill...

145
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:40,375
is a CCTV camera.

146
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,046
Did you know that?

147
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,376
No.

148
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:47,516
In the video...

149
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:52,086
taken from before 11:30 p.m.
until after 11:40 p.m.,

150
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:54,426
none of you, including you, were filmed.

151
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:00,395
If you'd taken a taxi
to Pilo-dong's main road...

152
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,766
and walked from there,

153
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:05,036
you wouldn't have been filmed
because you came from another direction.

154
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:09,035
But how did the others
manage to get into the site...

155
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,105
without being caught on camera?

156
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,705
I don't know how they came in.

157
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:15,875
But...

158
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:19,046
I'm sure they all came
through the alley by the mill.

159
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:22,455
What you told me
made things much clearer for me.

160
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:27,056
Someone in the group of people
that were there killed Jun Seo.

161
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:28,896
And that person thought...

162
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:32,595
they were caught
on the mill's security camera...

163
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,995
and killed the mill owner.

164
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:02,125
Would you like to kill time elsewhere?

165
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:06,296
No. I'll wait here.

166
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,595
Okay.

167
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,156
Hey.

168
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,056
Are you sure
the appointment was confirmed?

169
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,396
Hello.

170
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:43,436
Where about is the mayor now?

171
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,505
Okay, thanks.

172
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,536
He's almost here.

173
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:59,416
Mr. Oh!

174
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:06,526
Call again.

175
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,125
Okay.

176
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,906
I am so very late. I apologize.

177
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,136
It's fine.

178
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,335
Please, take a seat.

179
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:32,786
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

180
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,745
Likewise.

181
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:37,656
You must be hungry. Let's eat first.

182
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:38,985
Serve the food.

183
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,186
Just a moment.

184
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:41,825
I'm sorry,

185
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,125
but I ate at my previous appointment.

186
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:46,465
I have another meeting right after,

187
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,865
so how about we have tea instead?

188
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,335
Sure.

189
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,075
You're a busy man,

190
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,446
so I'll get right to the point.

191
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,976
I asked to meet you today
because I might be able to...

192
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:08,186
get the chance to assist you.

193
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,386
- Is that so?
- You want to make...

194
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,455
Anhyun City a bioindustry complex.

195
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:16,926
I do.

196
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:19,965
Then you must sign a deal
with the major pharmaceutical companies,

197
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,235
and your term ends in four years.

198
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:24,266
You want and need...

199
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,266
visible results before the next election.

200
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:28,936
I would.

201
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,205
Keumhyung will take the lead...

202
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,575
and build a bioindustry complex.

203
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:36,875
If this is a success, it could become...

204
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,246
a friendship that you could
benefit from in the future when you...

205
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:41,345
go on to bigger things.

206
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:45,455
You must know that...

207
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:49,495
Keumhyung Group's network
can assist you well.

208
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:54,725
Keumhyung Group's sales last year.
How much was it?

209
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:01,395
I know what you're trying to say, but...

210
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:02,806
After this meeting was scheduled,

211
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,575
I memorized some numbers.

212
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,606
Your sales were 3.22 billion dollars.

213
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,646
A 9.2 percent drop from the year before.

214
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,715
Your business loss
was 62.2 million dollars.

215
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:14,046
That's a loss three years in a row.

216
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,816
I heard the banks have decided to
increase the interest rate...

217
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:20,926
on your existing loans
while refusing to loan you any more.

218
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,595
Hearing a company like that
wants to lead the way...

219
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:28,426
makes me anxious.

220
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:34,865
Yes.

221
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:37,906
I said I'd lead the way...

222
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:41,406
because Keumhyung Group
and Yigu Electronics' Vice-Chairman Han...

223
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:46,786
as well as many influential men
from Yeouido's financial district...

224
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,416
You are...

225
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:52,145
the third person
just this week to meet me...

226
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,125
with a plan to do this or that...

227
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,455
to improve Anhyun City.

228
00:14:56,956 --> 00:15:00,766
They all claimed to have the backing
of powerful people.

229
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:03,036
I don't think...

230
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,335
I can do business with a man...

231
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:09,705
who dares to guarantee my future
as a politician when we just met.

232
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:12,705
It makes me too uneasy.

233
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,215
- Mr. Mayor. I meant...
- Please, excuse me.

234
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,686
Mr. Mayor.

235
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:24,455
I'm...

236
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,245
Lee Myung Guk.

237
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:50,345
He was your superior, right?

238
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,546
You'll have heard
his body was found recently.

239
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:56,886
Yes.

240
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,615
What did he do here?

241
00:16:00,456 --> 00:16:02,796
He researched generic drugs mostly.

242
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:05,556
What did you think...

243
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,825
he was like as a person?

244
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,525
Was he in enough trouble
or under threat...

245
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,705
that he'd suddenly disappear...

246
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,865
and then show up dead?

247
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,705
How much do you know about Jun Seo?

248
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,345
What?

249
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,715
You were close friends 20 years ago,

250
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,245
but you have no idea
what he was thinking before he died.

251
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,355
That's why you're doing this.

252
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:37,156
Mr. Lee...

253
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,365
was nothing more or less
than a superior at work.

254
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,436
What kind of person someone's like
and what goes on around them?

255
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,005
You never know until they tell you.

256
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:05,416
So...

257
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,485
what will you do now?

258
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,055
I'll ask everyone...

259
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,896
why they didn't share
that they were at the scene.

260
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:15,196
Why?

261
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:19,205
You don't want them to know you talked?

262
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:24,275
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

263
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,146
What I said today.

264
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,346
Do you believe it all?

265
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:32,215
No.

266
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:36,656
What about you?

267
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:39,426
Do you...

268
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:43,856
also think Jun Seo killed himself?

269
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,396
- No.
- Why not?

270
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:50,896
I saw it.

271
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:55,065
But...

272
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,275
at the time,

273
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:59,705
no one saw it.

274
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,616
His shoes.

275
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,186
He was wearing his shoes.

276
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,725
Jun Seo's shoes were found
on the ninth floor which was assumed...

277
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,366
to be where he jumped.

278
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:22,166
But the elevator on-site wasn't
on the ninth floor, but the first.

279
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,805
(Keumhyung)

280
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,315
- Mr. Oh.
- What?

281
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:40,386
Inside...

282
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,156
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

283
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:53,666
What are you doing here?

284
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:56,026
I have a meeting pretty soon.

285
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:58,166
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical
Chief Secretary Oh Chi Hyun)

286
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,235
Depending on the situation
you might have to miss it.

287
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,146
What's up?

288
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:13,186
If you so much as abduct or bribe...

289
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,086
Yoon Jin or anyone,

290
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,755
I'll come after you.

291
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:18,886
What will you do?

292
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:20,755
Find out for yourself.

293
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:24,896
Hey.

294
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,765
Why are you two doing this to me?

295
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:32,565
It's true I went too far for fear...

296
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,435
Yoon Jin would cause a fuss,

297
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,906
and as a result, I failed.

298
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,705
She returned the money yesterday.

299
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:41,846
She'd spent quite a bit, though.

300
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,975
If you came to talk about that,
how about we not bother?

301
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,186
Do you mind?

302
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,745
You.

303
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,656
Why did you kill Jun Seo?

304
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,256
- What?
- February 23, at 11:30 p.m.

305
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,396
You must remember.

306
00:19:58,185 --> 00:19:59,295
You were there.

307
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:12,136
Don't people kill themselves
in deserted places?

308
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,446
A construction site is a great place.

309
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,176
But why were you there?

310
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:20,646
If someone else was there,
it's no longer called a suicide.

311
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,686
Who said I was there?

312
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:27,715
You should ask
if I have proof you were there.

313
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:29,755
Why would you ask who told me?

314
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,326
What?

315
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,525
Did you suddenly think of someone...

316
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,965
who could testify you were there?

317
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,606
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

318
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:46,606
Jun Seo killed himself.

319
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:47,946
How so?

320
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:51,275
I went there
because Jun Seo told me to come.

321
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,815
I took the elevator up
because he seemed to be upstairs,

322
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:56,455
but he jumped.

323
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,426
Couldn't you have
gotten someone to push him?

324
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:04,326
- Did Jong Soo tell you to do it?
- Jang Jae Gyeong.

325
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:07,465
Is that loyalty or devotion?
Why are you so riled up?

326
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:08,826
Think about it.

327
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:11,225
Jun Seo knew something about Jong Soo,

328
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:12,565
and Jong Soo didn't like it.

329
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,305
And you're someone who does as he's told.

330
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:20,045
Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Jeong Sang Eui. You were all together.

331
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,276
You refused to give up names.

332
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:26,886
You have some loyalty in you
from your high school days.

333
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,785
You're tight-lipped.

334
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:33,785
How did you get into the site,
and where did you exit from?

335
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,455
I parked by the road in Jungji-dong...

336
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:41,126
and walked in through an alley.

337
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:43,936
There was nowhere to park there.

338
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,636
Did you leave the same way?

339
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:49,406
Did you meet up with someone?

340
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:50,965
Jeong Sang Eui?

341
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:53,245
Did you know there was a camera?

342
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,376
No.

343
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,946
You're not surprised.
I thought it would be surprising.

344
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:02,985
I'll ask one more thing.

345
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,515
After Jun Seo landed,

346
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,755
who confirmed he was dead?

347
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:12,295
Does it matter who checked?

348
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:13,955
You should've checked,

349
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,965
even if you meant to kill him.

350
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,735
Tae Jin checked.

351
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:25,376
Was Jun Seo wearing shoes then?

352
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,406
I don't know.

353
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:31,275
It was dark, and I was stunned
by the fact that he'd fallen.

354
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,446
Didn't someone say his shoes
were found on the ninth floor?

355
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,295
Oh, yes. Right.

356
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:46,596
I'll let you get back to work.

357
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,995
Tell the others I came to talk to you.

358
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:53,366
Remember the questions I've asked
and tell them about it...

359
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:54,906
so you can come up with a story.

360
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,275
I'll be back if I find evidence.

361
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,586
I'm glad you returned the cash
to Oh Chi Hyun.

362
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:11,686
Good for you.

363
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,555
Now let's stop digging into this case.

364
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,725
When I heard you'd been abducted,

365
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:18,926
my legs almost gave way.

366
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:21,326
I thought I'd lose my mind.

367
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:23,936
Let Jae Gyeong investigate...

368
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:26,866
and focus on your newspaper stuff.

369
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,666
I'd like you to do that.

370
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:30,805
And Woonjong Medical Center?

371
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,545
There must've been
a designated salesperson.

372
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:37,376
We hadn't been able to supply
Woonjong Medical Center.

373
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,815
Jun Seo got us in...

374
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,745
because he'd met the director
at a gathering.

375
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:47,525
That was why
Jun Seo went to so many events.

376
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:49,995
Put your health first.

377
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:53,795
You even order herbal tea
at cafes instead of coffee.

378
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:56,735
It's too dangerous. Quit it.

379
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:58,666
Did you hear me?

380
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:01,665
- What?
- Did you hear me?

381
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,235
Let's stop digging in this case.

382
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:05,906
- Yes, okay.
- Good.

383
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:10,475
Hey.

384
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,616
As an insurance salesman,
is there a company you want to sign with?

385
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,116
A place you tried to get into
many times but failed.

386
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:20,485
- Manbae Electronics.
- Manbae Electronics?

387
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,896
Let's say I know
their Head of General Affairs very well.

388
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:28,556
So I pull some strings and get you in...

389
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:29,836
so you can sell policies to their staff.

390
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:31,636
Can you really do that?

391
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:34,065
No, I meant hypothetically.

392
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:35,305
Oh, okay.

393
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:38,136
Then would you give me business cards...

394
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:40,245
and let me sell policies for you?

395
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,576
- No.
- No, right?

396
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,676
You'd sell them yourself
or get your minion to do it, right?

397
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:48,146
- Right.
- Yes.

398
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:49,886
Exactly.

399
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:52,015
Jun Seo was an estate agent.

400
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,555
Even if he helped them
supply to Woonjong Medical Center,

401
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,725
does it make sense
he had a business card...

402
00:24:57,725 --> 00:24:59,295
and delivered them himself too?

403
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:00,896
He did what?

404
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:05,866
Hey.

405
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:08,066
This is weird, right?

406
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,465
(Keumhyung Pharmaceutical,
Park Jun Seo)

407
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:10,975
But what's weirder is that...

408
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:13,475
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical made
some bad medicine.

409
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:16,715
Why would Jun Seo go around apologizing
and keeping people's mouths shut?

410
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,606
Was that Jun Seo's fault?

411
00:25:18,606 --> 00:25:20,045
He wasn't even an employee there.

412
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:21,715
Says who?

413
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,255
Oh Chi Hyun.

414
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,032
Hey.

415
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:29,626
You said Hyun Woo saw me get abducted
and told you, right?

416
00:25:30,056 --> 00:25:31,126
Yes.

417
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:33,666
Okay, then I should meet with him first.

418
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,396
- Yoon Jin.
- Why?

419
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:38,366
Didn't you hear what I said earlier?

420
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,205
What?

421
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,266
Hey, we should stop
looking into this case.

422
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:45,006
If you keep chasing this story,
you might really get into big trouble...

423
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:46,205
and get badly hurt.

424
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:48,935
Then what use would
all that insurance money be?

425
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:50,015
Hey, Joo Song.

426
00:25:52,006 --> 00:25:53,086
Fine.

427
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,886
Thank you for saying that
out of concern for me.

428
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,655
But am I doing this
so that I can live well by myself?

429
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:00,915
I know, but...

430
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:03,555
Wanting to live with my own daughter.

431
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:05,396
Is that such a greedy thing to want?

432
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,896
Have you ever had your child
taken away right before your eyes...

433
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:11,596
in a divorce just because
you didn't make as much money?

434
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:17,405
Hey, that ex-husband of yours
isn't even making a living or anything.

435
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:19,435
Then, doesn't that mean
you can bring Ye Eun?

436
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,076
Am I any different?

437
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,475
At least he has some money saved up.

438
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,745
I really don't have anything.

439
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:29,586
I'm penniless.

440
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,356
If I bring Ye Eun here in my situation,

441
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,725
how can I be sure that I can raise her
better than in Canada?

442
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,896
I'm just saying it's dangerous.

443
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:40,525
Hey, don't worry.

444
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:43,965
I've been a reporter for 15 years.

445
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:46,906
Do you think my path has
always been flowery all that time?

446
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:52,336
I'm off to school.

447
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:53,705
All right.

448
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:11,896
I was coming outside
from grocery shopping,

449
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,995
and Jang Jae Gyeong,
Heo Joo Song, and Oh Yoon Jin...

450
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:16,166
came out of that alley.

451
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:17,896
There aren't that many houses up there.

452
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:19,336
Isn't it strange?

453
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:27,866
Who are you?

454
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,406
What?

455
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,616
Oh, are you...

456
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:42,416
a friend of Mr. Park Jun Seo's?

457
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,586
Oh...

458
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,225
- Yes.
- I see.

459
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:55,826
I heard that Mr. Park passed away.

460
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:57,866
Yes, that's right.

461
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:01,166
But how...

462
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,505
How did you know Jun Seo?

463
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:05,676
He came by often.

464
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:07,975
Oh, by any chance,

465
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:11,916
are there any surviving relatives
of Mr. Park's?

466
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:14,515
I wasn't able to go to the funeral.

467
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:17,856
He has a wife.

468
00:29:17,985 --> 00:29:19,055
Is that so?

469
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:20,816
So...

470
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,326
Oh, right.

471
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,255
Please wait just a little.

472
00:29:52,546 --> 00:29:53,626
Oh, my.

473
00:29:54,556 --> 00:29:56,955
Oh, well...

474
00:29:57,155 --> 00:29:59,326
I'm sorry, but... Here.

475
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,426
Couldn't you give it to her for me?

476
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,136
Gosh, please do that for me.

477
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:12,936
(Min Hyun Woo)

478
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:17,015
The market is really struggling right now,

479
00:30:17,346 --> 00:30:20,485
the value of our collateral
has gone down a lot.

480
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:22,215
So?

481
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:24,386
Well...

482
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:27,386
This may be a bit out of line,

483
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:29,826
but if you could make
a gesture to indicate...

484
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,856
that you'd pay out of pocket,

485
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:35,025
it'd be a good reason for me
to have a positive discussion...

486
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,065
when I meet with the bank's president.

487
00:30:37,395 --> 00:30:38,735
My personal funds?

488
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:42,265
We only say this to mean
that the symbolism is what's important.

489
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:45,205
Even if the amount you announce is
different from what you actually pay,

490
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,535
it doesn't matter.

491
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:48,005
You know that, don't you?

492
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,376
So, without the use of my personal funds,

493
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,346
we can't get any extra loans?

494
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:54,515
Well...

495
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,805
Have you not heard from CEO Won yet?

496
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,475
He's in front of me right now, sir.

497
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,076
Send him in.

498
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:32,715
What happened with your meeting
with Mayor Joo?

499
00:31:34,516 --> 00:31:36,755
(Keumhyung Group)

500
00:31:39,955 --> 00:31:41,025
Mayor Joo...

501
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:44,436
seems anxious
about our financial situation.

502
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:48,065
So, I plan on meeting with
the Vice President of Yigu Electronics...

503
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:50,576
and asking him to hurry along
with the confirmations of funding plans.

504
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:56,846
I saw the Vice President of Wonjin Bank
leaving just now.

505
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:58,715
What did the bank say?

506
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:01,485
Unless we get approval to do business
from Anhyun,

507
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,555
there's no possibility until then.

508
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:07,886
Do you think Chairman Han of Yigu
will make an investment?

509
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:10,025
Yes, I'll make him do so.

510
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:13,196
Don't worry, sir.

511
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:16,866
Twenty years ago,

512
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,235
as we turned 3.9 million square meters...

513
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:22,936
of land filled with pigsties
into Anhyun City,

514
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:26,406
the Keumhyung of today came to be.

515
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:29,775
This Pilo-dong project...

516
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:33,275
It may be our last chance
to get back on our feet.

517
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,485
If we fail at this, I as well as you...

518
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:41,555
might be dragged around
by creditors for our whole lives.

519
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,555
Yes, sir.

520
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:50,936
(Narcotics Unit)

521
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:13,055
Detective Park.

522
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:15,285
Did you perhaps get all the CCTV footage
from near the mill?

523
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,885
- Yes, sir.
- Then, was there a taxi...

524
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:20,455
among the cars that left the alley
around the time of the incident?

525
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:23,126
There weren't any identifiable taxis
that left the alley.

526
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,336
You have the videos, don't you?

527
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,465
Captain Jang.

528
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:27,635
Last time, I told you...

529
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,165
there wasn't anything worth noting
from the CCTV footage...

530
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:30,205
from near the construction site.

531
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:32,975
But you went to the scene,
and the mill owner got murdered.

532
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:36,876
I also think this case has
a connection to the prior ones.

533
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:38,606
I agree with what you think.

534
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:39,676
However,

535
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:42,886
I report to Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan.

536
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,416
And Inspector Yoo thinks otherwise.

537
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:49,255
You know why I'm telling you this,
don't you?

538
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:52,156
Yes, I understand.

539
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,096
Captain.

540
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:01,765
Come to the lounge in a little bit.

541
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,645
- Do you want to watch this with me?
- What is it?

542
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:16,045
The CCTV footage from around the time
the murder case happened at the mill.

543
00:34:16,245 --> 00:34:17,315
How did you get that?

544
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:18,755
Didn't Yoo Kyung Hwan make a fuss?

545
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,926
What time did the murder happen again?

546
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,906
It was between 5:12 p.m. and 5:15 p.m.

547
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,605
What are we looking for right now?

548
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:39,906
A taxi.

549
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:41,775
A taxi?

550
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:44,775
There was a resident who saw a taxi
on the day of the incident.

551
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:48,715
Circumstances point to the taxi driver
and the guest being accomplices,

552
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:53,116
or there is a high likelihood
that the taxi driver is the culprit.

553
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:57,596
If he came from that alley
and took a right turn,

554
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:58,825
we would've seen the car...

555
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:01,065
going past the crosswalk
and heading toward Hwansung.

556
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:02,866
But since we don't see it,

557
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,636
maybe it took a turn left?

558
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:07,005
Gosh.

559
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:08,766
Where is this?

560
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:10,735
It's the security camera
at the next intersection.

561
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:13,676
If they turned left earlier,
they should be on this camera.

562
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:15,045
I see.

563
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:18,076
We should look into all the taxis here.

564
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:20,915
It seems the Violent Crimes Division
looked into most of them.

565
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:24,116
I guess they use their brains too,
seeing as how they focused on the taxi.

566
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:25,585
I told them to.

567
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,326
Was there anyone suspicious?

568
00:35:31,785 --> 00:35:32,895
Not yet.

569
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:36,096
Was there another escape route?

570
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,065
It would've been hard to walk out.

571
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:40,766
Yes. The sun was still out,

572
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:44,136
and with the blood on their clothes,
it would've been difficult.

573
00:35:46,805 --> 00:35:48,246
- Soo Hyun.
- Yes?

574
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,715
Get all of the videos from Captain Jang,

575
00:35:51,176 --> 00:35:54,145
recheck all of the taxi numbers,
and make a table of them.

576
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:57,185
They're the taxis that were in service
around the time of the murder at the mill.

577
00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,415
Look into the criminal records
of the drivers as well.

578
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,615
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:02,755
If the culprit had really been
a taxi driver,

580
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:04,886
they would've tried to wipe the blood
from the hands or clothes...

581
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:06,696
as soon as possible.

582
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,095
So look into places...

583
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,266
they could've pulled over
to wipe their hands.

584
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:12,665
Look into the security cameras
in the area as well.

585
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:13,835
Yes, ma'am.

586
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,715
It belongs to us,
the people who know the passcode.

587
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:33,726
Give me a little more time.

588
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:36,926
It's not an easy decision for me either.

589
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:38,386
How about this?

590
00:36:38,386 --> 00:36:40,096
If they bring me ten million dollars...

591
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,266
and lower their head to beg me,
I'll think about it.

592

and the information stops there.

- Okay.
- Captain.

603

604
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:13,985
Should I try getting some of that?

Why would I pay back money for the beef?

670
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,217

for the emotional distress he caused...

00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,496
(Two days ago)

718
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:31,307
So, we had gotten a large prescription
for the painkillers she used to take.

719
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:33,677
The medication we supplied
to Woonjong Medical Center.

720
00:44:33,877 --> 00:44:35,517
How did you know
there was a problem with it?

721
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:38,217
Did you talk to them?

722
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,186
They hung up without saying anything.

723
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,257
And the phone has been turned off
ever since.

724
00:44:44,857 --> 00:44:46,616
That was why I went
all the way to Pilo-dong.

725
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:47,627
Just in case.

726
00:44:47,627 --> 00:44:50,326
The number 2-3-0-9-1-0 on top,
is that a date?

727
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:52,757
Yes. They don't give us
the customers' names,

728
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,367
so I save the numbers
with the delivery items and dates.

729
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:56,697
Hey, this date...

730
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:02,237
That was the day Ms. Park Bok Rye
got the wrong prescription drugs.

731
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:03,307
(Woonjong Medical Center's
medication error on Park Bok Rye)

732
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,706
But Jun Seo wasn't thoughtless enough...

733
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,847
to make a high school kid like you
deliver narcotic painkillers.

734
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:13,387
Did something perhaps happen
to Jun Seo that day?

735
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:17,186
His daughter was very sick.

736
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,786
It was a delivery he was supposed to do.

737
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:20,826
Is Yoon Hee still not doing well?

738
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:21,896
But he asked me to do it.

739
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:27,026
Did Park Jun Seo ever make you
deliver drugs after that?

740
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:28,496
No.

741
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:29,926
Just because he asked you
to do him a favor,

742
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:31,837
he paid for your school tuition
and opened up an office here?

743
00:45:31,837 --> 00:45:33,367
I don't think Jun Seo would've done that.

744
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,046
What did you do with the drugs?

745
00:45:39,377 --> 00:45:40,377
What drugs?

746
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:42,617
The drugs I told you to take
to Lorraine Hotel first.

747
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:44,217
Where did you sneak them off to?

748
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,086
- I didn't sneak them off anywhere.
- Tell me.

749
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:48,287
It's not too late. Tell me now.

750
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,456
I don't know. I delivered them all,
just like you told me to.

751
00:45:51,317 --> 00:45:53,126
You didn't come
straight from the hospital.

752
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:54,886
Where did you stop by?

753
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,456
I know everything. Hurry up and say it.

754
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,897
Who did you sell them to?
Hurry up and tell me!

755
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:00,637
I really don't know!

756
00:46:04,197 --> 00:46:05,267
This is your last chance.

757
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:07,106
Hurry up and say it.

758
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:08,976
Who did you sell them to?

759
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,507
Where are those drugs now?

760
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:14,646
- Hurry up and say it.
- Hyun Woo!

761
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:16,017
No.

762
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,576
What are you doing?

763
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:19,117
- Hyun Woo.
- Go back inside.

764
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:21,387
Oh, my.

765
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:23,557
Are you okay?

766
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:24,927
Goodness.

767
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:29,697
Oh, my dear Hyun Woo.

768
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:32,697
Hello?

769
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,926
Mr. Park, I heard you called.

770
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:37,166
- It's okay.
- We got the eight boxes of pills safely.

771
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:46,046
Do you still have those pills now?

772
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:49,646
You didn't prescribe them
to anyone, right?

773
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:54,057
What? I already prescribed them all.

774
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:55,387
Why?

775
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:01,526
I'll be right there.

776
00:47:34,956 --> 00:47:36,026
You're here.

777
00:47:51,277 --> 00:47:52,347
Did you apply some ointment?

778
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:56,847
How old are you?

779
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:59,246
Leave now
if you're done paying for the damages.

780
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:02,617
Your name is Hyun Woo, right?

781
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:05,626
I'm sorry.

782
00:48:08,056 --> 00:48:10,456
I'm an adult,
but I didn't even look into things.

783
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:13,666
Sorry.

784
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:15,936
Forgive me.

785
00:48:24,437 --> 00:48:26,307
That was the first time
an adult asked me...

786
00:48:27,176 --> 00:48:28,646
to forgive him.

787
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:33,387
Did Jun Seo keep coming by after that?

788
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:34,916
No.

789
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,086
I went to see him.

790
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:41,456
He said I shouldn't become close to him,

791
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,626
but there are times
when you need an adult.

792
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:47,367
I went to him at times like those.

793
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:52,166
Then, do you know what happened
with the bad pills...

794
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:54,706
out of the ones that got delivered
to Woonjong Medical Center?

795
00:48:54,837 --> 00:48:57,276
He never told me anything specific,

796
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:00,077
but I think the pills that I delivered to
Lorraine Hotel...

797
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:02,447
got switched with some other pills.

798
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,657
I slipped on the road because of the rain,
and the pills got mixed up.

799
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:11,586
And I think...

800
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:14,396
I put Mr. Park in
an awkward spot afterward.

801
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:17,126
So, the pills that should've gone to
Lorraine Hotel...

802
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:20,267
went to Ms. Park Bok Rye.

803
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:23,836
Do you know why...

804
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:26,836
Mr. Park committed suicide?

805
00:49:29,837 --> 00:49:31,077
Do you think it was because...

806
00:49:32,107 --> 00:49:34,146
his daughter died before he did?

807
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,376
I'm not sure.

808
00:49:37,717 --> 00:49:39,517
Do you think he was nice to me...

809
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:43,257
because he pitied me?

810
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:45,927
I'm sure that's not it.

811
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:50,396
Jun Seo was very lonely.

812
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,666
But he probably thought of you
as a friend.

813
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:55,637
I'm sure that's why.

814
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,166
Here.

815
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,376
What are these?

816
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:03,436
There you go.

817
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:05,476
They're Lee Myung Guk's work logs.

818
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,517
Read them over in detail by tomorrow
evening and come over to my place.

819
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:09,722
What's this?

820
00:50:09,746 --> 00:50:13,146
Are we forming some sort of
investigative team headquarters?

821
00:50:17,116 --> 00:50:18,487
Okay. See you tomorrow.

822
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:21,026
Give me a lift down the hill.

823
00:50:21,087 --> 00:50:22,157
Oh, okay.

824
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:23,327
My car is over there.

825
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:25,626
I'll give you a ride.

826
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,737
Well, I have something to tell you
on the way down too.

827
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:30,537
Okay, then.

828
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,666
I'll go with him.

829
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,436
Okay, get home safely.

830
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:38,077
What?

831
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:39,807
Bye.

832
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:40,976
Okay, bye.

833
00:50:46,616 --> 00:50:49,186
- Hey, that was smooth.
- What was?

834
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:52,157
You're taking me
to Youngryun Cold Storage, right?

835
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,827
There's somewhere we have to go first.

(Seodong Internal Medicine Clinic)

837
00:51:05,837 --> 00:51:08,436
You want me to go there now?

838
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,177
Yes.

839
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:12,807
Hey, I don't have any weight to lose.

840
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:16,717
No way.

841
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:21,117
You don't mean you want me to
act like a druggie, do you?

842
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,726
What can I help you with?

843
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:38,066
Oh, yes. Well, I...

844
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:44,677
I'd like to take
some appetite suppressants.

845
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:47,546
Could I get a prescription?

846
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:58,657
How many days' worth do you need?

847
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:02,956
What?

849
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,537
Gosh, there are so many.

850
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:10,967
Just get going.

851
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,066

Hello.

00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,291
I'm Jang Jae Gyeong...

from the Anhyeon Police Station.

860
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,192
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon Jin
from the Anhyun Economic Daily.

861
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:39,961
What brings you here?

862
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:41,371
What do you do here?

863
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:44,771
This is a freezer storage unit.

864
00:52:45,132 --> 00:52:46,271
Could we take a look?

865
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:49,371
I'm not sure
if I have the authority to do that.

866
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:51,411
Besides,

867
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:53,742
aren't you supposed to bring
a warrant or whatever...

868
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:56,351
to search inside?

869
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,382
Yes, you're right, sir.

870
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,952
But we're not trying to do a search.

871
00:53:00,252 --> 00:53:03,722
We'll just take a quick look
to see what's being stored inside.

872
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,291
Sir.

873
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:10,692
You must be tired.
Please have this drink.

874
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:15,101
You have to be quick.

875
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:16,271
Of course.

876
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:18,302
Thank you.

877
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:37,791
Only this part of the building
is used as cold storage.

878
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:40,161
They just store regular items in the rest.

879
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:46,702
- Is this all?
- Yes.

880
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:49,402

881
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:51,141

they would've moved it by now.

was going to deliver to Oh Chi Hyun.

00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,692
If Ms. Park Bok Rye died...

897
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:50,791
from taking the drugs
that were meant for Jong Soo,

898
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,431
that would be such a huge story.

899
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:55,802
Hey, where are you going?

900
00:54:56,431 --> 00:54:57,501
Hey!

904
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:11,952
This is security camera footage
around the time of the murder at the mill.

905
00:55:14,382 --> 00:55:15,652
What's going on?

906
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:17,222
Hey.

912

What is it?

913
00:55:34,102 --> 00:55:35,141
What is it?

914
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:37,971
(Pilo-dong construction)

915
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:39,242
Where is he going now?

(Redevelopment area, entry prohibited)

917

(Mill)

918
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:53,262
- Hello?
- Captain.

919
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:57,762
I took a look at the reports filed
around the mill on the day of the murder.

920
00:55:59,091 --> 00:56:00,832
Someone reported seeing a driver...

921
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,172
wiping blood off their hands
at a public restroom...

922
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:05,632
after parking the taxi
at Jungjidong Citizens Park...

923
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,271
immediately after the incident.

924
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:09,042
(Who is the Pilo-dong
development plan for?)

925
00:56:09,042 --> 00:56:10,341
But the person who made the report...

926
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:12,311
was the parent of the elementary schooler
who saw the driver.

927
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:15,452
Since they didn't see it themselves
and the kid wasn't harmed,

928
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:17,481
the local officers just ignored it.

929
00:56:18,681 --> 00:56:22,152
(We press our own oils.)

930
00:56:28,922 --> 00:56:31,161
This security camera
only shows the crosswalk.

931
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:38,871
- Did you see that?
- See what? What did I miss?

932
00:56:39,301 --> 00:56:40,402
This man here.

933
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,472
This man who was about to cross
this crosswalk at 5:15 p.m.

934
00:56:44,841 --> 00:56:46,342
He's avoiding something
while crossing the street.

935
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,052
Yes.

936
00:56:48,681 --> 00:56:49,782
A car.

937
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:57,021
The car passed the alley with the mill,
came out to the big road,

938
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,092
and went straight.

939
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,561
Not left or right, but straight.

940
00:57:06,462 --> 00:57:08,702
So where does the alley
this car entered connect to?

941
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:10,232
It's connected to the road...

942
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:12,402
in front of an old cold storage place
called Youngryun Cold Storage.

943
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:15,541
And they had to have driven
the opposite way on the one-way street.

944
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:17,512
If they had gone straight from there,
they would've reached the big road again.

945
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:18,812
If they had gone that way,

946
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:20,471
they would've been
on another security camera.

947
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:26,312
(One-way street, For sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage)

948
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:29,322
But there was a small road next to it.

949
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:33,321
At first, I wasn't sure
whether it could fit a car.

950
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:34,768
But I saw tire marks.

951
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,992
(One-way street, for sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage)

952
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,101
It was wide enough
for a car to pass through.

953
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:47,531
It was about 700m long.

954
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:53,772
(One-way street, for sale,
Youngryun Cold Storage, about 700m)

955
00:57:53,772 --> 00:57:55,042
And the end of that road...

956
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:57,741
connects to a big road that splits
into Jungji-dong and Join-dong.

957
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:03,391
(Join-dong, Jungji-dong)

958
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:09,991
(Jungji-dong three-way intersection)

959
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:11,702
Is that the security camera footage
we just received?

960
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:14,702
It's from the block
behind the one we had last time.

961
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:18,402
We couldn't check it
because it was quite far.

962
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:22,512
That alleyway connects to this place.

963
00:58:25,111 --> 00:58:26,911
(Jungji-dong three-way intersection)

964
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,722
A taxi.

965
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:39,081
It's 3-4-A-5-2-5-3.

966
00:59:39,511 --> 00:59:40,722
It's a private taxi.

967
00:59:41,622 --> 00:59:43,952
Yes, please look up
the taxi owner quickly.

968
00:59:44,422 --> 00:59:45,521
Yes.

969
00:59:56,402 --> 00:59:57,501
You.

970
01:00:00,102 --> 01:00:01,202
Who are you?

971
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,952
(Connection)

972
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:49,181
(Connection)

973
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:51,792
Are you getting revenge
for getting kicked out of college?

974
01:00:51,792 --> 01:00:52,792
Si Jung.

975
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:53,821
You're doing well.

976
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:55,561
Don't take more than two pills.

977
01:00:55,661 --> 01:00:59,862
What if they're trying to use you
to catch Won Jong Soo?

978
01:01:00,332 --> 01:01:03,072
We need to show them
we're the next owners of the company.

979
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:05,172
They were indirectly asking me
whether you had ordered that.

980
01:01:05,172 --> 01:01:07,742
If we get connected to the incident,
it's all over, Tae Jin.

981
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:09,742
I'm confident, Chairman Won.

982
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:10,942
You're crossing the line.

983
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:13,112
Aren't we in the same boat now?

984
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:15,481
If Park Tae Jin keeps feeling rushed,

985
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:18,112
there's a possibility
that she might reveal everything today.

986
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:21,252
He's going to make Choi Ji Yeon
tell him the password no matter what.

987
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:23,251
I said I would only do this
until we got 500,000 dollars.

988
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:24,721
- Jun Seo.
- Didn't you kill Jun Seo...

989
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:25,992
because of this?

990
01:01:26,852 --> 01:01:28,331
Are you sure
we weren't caught on camera there?

991
01:01:28,361 --> 01:01:29,361
This is in front of my house.

992
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:30,791
Jae Gyeong already knew.

993
01:01:31,192 --> 01:01:33,302
I think it's basically mine.

994
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:35,102
The insurance payout belongs
to whoever received it.

995
01:01:35,102 --> 01:01:36,632
- What did you say?
- Who are you...

996
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,501
calling shameless right now?

997
01:01:42,902 --> 01:01:44,981
