1
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:57,017
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:06,203
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

3
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:07,727
(Oh Chi Hyun)

4
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,968
Are you Jang Jae Gyeong?

5
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,707
Yes.

6
00:01:17,637 --> 00:01:20,538
Is everything
on your police report true?

7
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,523
Did you witness it yourself?

8
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:25,478
(Park Jun Seo)

9
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:27,277
Jun Seo.

10
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,188
You saw it. You should tell him.

11
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:33,088
Your report says...

12
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:36,628
Park Jun Seo witnessed it on-site.

13
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:38,427
Is that true?

14
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,097
Did you really witness it?

15
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:49,368
I didn't witness anything.

16
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,408
- Jun Seo.
- I...

17
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,208
didn't see anything.

18
00:01:58,377 --> 00:01:59,747
I didn't see anything...

19
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:14,098
That's not true.

20
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:15,344
Don't lie.

21
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,967
I didn't witness anything.

22
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:21,598
Don't lie...

23
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:27,077
That's not true.

24
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,308
I didn't witness anything.

25
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,824
Jun Seo.

26
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,387
(Connection)

27
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:46,258
(Monday, February 26, 2024)

28
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,667
(Episode 2)

29
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:59,278
Do you have any footage
of his whereabouts after the incident?

30
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,247
After he disappeared from the hallway,
he wasn't caught on camera.

31
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:07,648
(Captain Jang Jae Gyeong)

32
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:11,024
The phone is turned off.

33
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:13,464
Transferring to voicemail.

34
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:14,518
You will be charged.

35
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,163
- Please check that separately.
- All right.

36
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:19,257
Do it fast.

37
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,374
Is he really from the police?

38
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,437
Yes, he is.

39
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,168
Did you try contacting him?

40
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:28,573
What did he say?

41
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:31,013
It seems like he's unable
to talk on the phone right now.

42
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,078
I apologize.

43
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,708
What do you mean?

44
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,907
He disturbed the emergency room.

45
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,447
It's a major offense
to cause disturbance around patients.

46
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,877
On top of that, he's a detective.

47
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,323
Is the case closed
if you can't get in touch with him?

48
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,787
Please calm down.

49
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:46,657
I need to check what happened
before I can update you.

50
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:48,757
That's not right.

51
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,864
Are you protecting him
because you're also a detective?

52
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,928
We can't let him get away with it.

53
00:03:53,428 --> 00:03:55,567
Look. I got hurt because he pushed me.

54
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,844
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,573
I'll check and update you.

56
00:03:58,597 --> 00:03:59,738
I appreciate your patience.

57
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,338
He looked like he was addicted to drugs.

58
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,108
When you work in the emergency,

59
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:08,608
you see overdosed patients
from time to time.

60
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:10,907
His symptoms resembled them.

61
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,048
His breathing was unstable,
and his face was pale.

62
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,663
In my opinion, that detective...

63
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,247
Was that why you drew blood from me?

64
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:22,133
I never consented to drawing blood,

65
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,428
and there wasn't a warrant
to approve it either.

66
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:26,398
There were no injection marks on my arm.

67
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,804
Doctor Lee Young Woo.
Why did you decide to take my blood?

68
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:33,197
That's because people under the influence
of drugs come into the ER,

69
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,584
and it's common for us to take blood
with consent before the police come...

70
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,437
so they can be locked up.

71
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,654
They can get the warrant later on.

72
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:42,977
That's none of my business.

73
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,707
Which department are you with?

74
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:45,894
You don't look like an intern.

75
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,158
Are you a resident? Which year?

76
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:49,994
Why do you ask?

77
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,388
Is this a narcotics case?

78
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:52,633
From what I saw...

79
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:53,733
The symptoms you listed.

80
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:55,733
Are they proof to conclude
that this is a narcotics case?

81
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,703
Other than the experience
of your short stint as an ER doctor,

82
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,473
do you have objective proof?

83
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:00,858
I don't, but...

84
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,973
Why did you destroy
your blood that we'd taken?

85
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,214
Why wouldn't I?

86
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,614
It was my blood
taken without my consent.

87
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:10,668
It's illegal for you to run
all those tests on them.

88
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,978
- But...
- Detective Kim.

89
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:15,207
He says he thinks I'm on drugs.

90
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,324
I was on the drug squad
for over ten years...

91
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:22,024
and it must've made me a druggie.

92
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:24,423
I'm Inspector Jang Jae Gyeong...

93
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,834
of Anhyeon Police Station's
Narcotics Unit.

94
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:27,964
I'm not a drug addict.

95
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:29,728
I'm an inspector who catches them.

96
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,574
I felt dreadful earlier
because I had acute indigestion,

97
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,173
and you took my blood
without my consent, so...

98
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,997
I did that because I was angry, okay?

99
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:42,608
- I hurt you?
- Yes.

100
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,038
I'm very sorry.

101
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:45,108
Okay.

102
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:51,747
Bye, then.

103
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,293
Get a copy of the CCTV footage...

104
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:56,723
- and send it to us.
- Okay.

105
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,694
See if there's a clip of him
coming into the ER.

106
00:05:58,718 --> 00:05:59,718
Yes, sir.

107
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,767
(Inoculation Process)

108
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,538
Do you feel better now?

109
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:15,937
Yes. I'm fine.

110
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:18,884
Did you look up the number I gave you?

111
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:20,507
It was a burner phone.

112
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,853
- Did you track it?
- It was turned off.

113
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,957
I checked its last location
before it was turned off.

114
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,647
A call was made while on the move.

115
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,024
The red hair-clip woman...

116
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,368
Did you get the facial composite?

117
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:31,618
Her statement is inconsistent.

118
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,417
What about the face of the guy I chased?

119
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,617
We don't have that yet.
I'll send it to you when we do.

120
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:42,158
Why did you act like that in the ER?

121
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:45,668
I told you.

122
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,568
It was because they'd taken my blood
without my consent.

123
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,868
You'd made a proper mess.

124
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:53,553
I'm glad you talked your way out.

125
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:54,978
It could've been really bad.

126
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:59,218
I don't think you were here
because you felt ill.

127
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:01,817
Why did you come here?

128
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:03,817
You don't need to know.

129
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,637
Don't overdo it.

130
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,368
I'll say you went home
because you felt unwell.

131
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:24,368
Get some rest.

132
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,214
The door is opening.

133
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,707
The door is opening.

134
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:37,824
The door is closing.

135
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,358
The door is closing.

136
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,483
Nurse Lee. Can I have a word?

137
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,483
Yes.

138
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,507
(Ward 31)

139
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:10,687
Captain.

140
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,464
I need to talk to him.

141
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,928
Go and get a soda.

142
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:18,387
Well...

143
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,197
Okay, then.

144
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,007
(Jang Chul Gu)

145
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:38,447
You wanted to see me.

146
00:08:39,077 --> 00:08:40,077
Who, me?

147
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:44,218
As if I'd want to see your mug.

148
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:47,918
How do you know Park Jun Seo?

149
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,528
Park Jun Seo?

150
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:55,327
Yes. I get it.

151
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,274
You'll never walk properly again.

152
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,397
You must've been angry.

153
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:02,868
Did you want revenge?

154
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:06,478
You've seen this before, right?

155
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:16,017
No.

156
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,247
What are you on about?

157
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,257
What revenge?

158
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:22,028
Who did you send to do it?

159
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,697
Why?

160
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,628
Is someone harassing you?

161
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,498
Gosh, I'm grateful for that.

162
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,138
I'd love to get back at you
if only I could.

163
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,768
But this right here.

164
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,878
Will you do something about it?

165
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,008
Then...

166
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:44,548
I'll show you.

167
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,148
Why did you kill Park Jun Seo?

168
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,987
I guess that punk is dead.

169
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,097
I wonder who Park Jun Seo is.

170
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,628
How interesting.

171
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:05,498
Jang Jae Gyeong...

172
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,898
came over out of the blue...

173
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,607
to ask me about him?

174
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:17,947
Do you have a thing for guys?

175
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:20,518
You should've said so, then.

176
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,148
If I'd known your taste,

177
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:24,987
we wouldn't be in this situation now.

178
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:39,697
Oh, come on. What the heck?

179
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:42,668
What are you up to?

180
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,908
Hey.

181
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,038
I don't know that name.

182
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:48,477
Hey!

183
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,508
Captain Jang, I don't know him!

184
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:52,748
Hey, police! You punks!

185
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,918
Do something about him!

186
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,388
Hey, police! You outside!

187
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:00,018
Come in and stop him!

188
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,168
Don't move.

189
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:13,213
One wrong move
and you'll eat through a tube forever.

190
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,237
No.

191
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:15,597
It wasn't me!

192
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,713
Did you send the text
about the Jeonghoon Station delivery?

193
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:19,854
Or did you make Park Jun Seo send it?

194
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:20,984
Or did you make someone else send it?

195
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,088
Who was it? Give me a name.

196
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,808
It wasn't me.
I've never heard that name before.

197
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:27,117
I know you killed Park Jun Seo.

198
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:30,048
It wasn't me!
I said I'd never heard that name!

199
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:31,317
You did it.

200
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,487
You put everyone up to it.

201
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,397
This is your last warning.

202
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:37,357
One.

203
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,673
- Two.
- No!

204
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:43,104
No! It wasn't me!

205
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,798
It wasn't me!

206
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,317
I said it wasn't me, punk.

207
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:05,087
If it wasn't you, who was it?
Give me a name.

208
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,217
I don't know.

209
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:11,727
That drug!

210
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,058
I heard about that drug.

211
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,097
Who's distributing it?

212
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:19,837
CEO Yoon.

213
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:21,837
CEO Yoon?

214
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,138
Is he the Doctor?

215
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:25,107
I don't know that.

216
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,008
Does CEO Yoon distribute only?

217
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:29,477
Does he make it too?

218
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,308
He's just a distributor of this and that.

219
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,278
He brings in and sells
whatever makes him money.

220
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:36,187
Where can I go to meet him?

221
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,048
I don't know.

222
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,563
I really don't know. I swear!

223
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:42,587
I don't know!

224
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:59,107
He only distributes online.

225
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:01,678
I don't know his face or address.

226
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:04,378
He might be CEO Yoon today.

227
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:07,717
But tomorrow...

228
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:09,987
he could be CEO Kim or CEO Lee.

229
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,487
No one knows!

230
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,457
What about Park Jun Seo?

231
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:24,668
I really have never
heard that name before.

232
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,138
I would...

233
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:29,237
kill you before anyone.

234
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,278
Why would I kill someone like that?

235
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:14,347
Jin Wook.

236
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,264
You should go into hiding
instead of doing this.

237
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,963
What if the Doctor set this up
to hand us over to the police...

238
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:21,187
so he could deal directly with CEO Yoon?

239
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,558
Come on, Jin Wook.

240
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,717
It's been a while, CEO Yoon.

241
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:57,288
You must not be...

242
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,528
all that glad to see me.

243
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:02,697
What about the drugs?

244
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:04,727
I'm sure you've already heard,

245
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,343
but the supply of raw materials
isn't very smooth.

246
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:08,367
I think I might need some more time.

247
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:11,837
Mr. Gong Jin Wook?

248
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,378
CEO Yoon.

249
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:15,908
You know very well...

250
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:20,018
that if we make contact first,
the deal with the Doctor is over.

251
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,894
Why not wait a little longer
while you're already waiting?

252
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,224
It's not like there is...

253
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,357
a drug that can replace
Lemon Mulberry at the moment.

254
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:36,597
Can I trust that you're still making
direct deals with the Doctor?

255
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:38,567
Seeing how...

256
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:41,468
the Doctor isn't making
direct deals with you,

257
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:43,607
wouldn't that mean...

258
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,247
he's still willing to do business with me?

259
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,018
The wire is too short. I'll switch it.

260
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,058
Okay.

261
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,268
- I'll finish things up.
- Okay.

262
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:28,317
What are your plans from now on?

263
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,448
I'll get things ready by this week.

264
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:33,957
Let's make it tomorrow at midnight.

265
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,227
If you go past midnight,

266
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:39,063
I'll also stop dealing Lemon Mulberry...

267
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,628
and focus on going around to catch people.

268
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,898
And I'll make a reservation...

269
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:49,067
for this room under both of your names.

270
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:51,967
Please save me!

271
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,707
Go ahead.

272
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,678
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,663
Wasn't the Doctor going to
let go of that guy...

274
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,428
and deal with us directly?

275
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,538
That was the condition for us abducting
Jang Jae Gyeong and drugging him.

276
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,228
What kind of grudge does the Doctor have
against Jang Jae Gyeong?

277
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:28,189
Where should I drop you off
near Anhyun City Hall Station?

278
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:30,447
Oh, right.

279
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:36,418
Yes, just up there, please.

00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:51,628
(Anhyun City Hall)

281
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,417
If you had gotten here late last night,

282
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,008
you would've been spotted
while we did our nightly patrols.

283
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:18,164
You most likely came here
in the morning...

284
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:19,657
when the first trains operated.

285
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:21,717
Let's watch the footage from that time.

286
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:22,798
Okay.

287
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,887
We can't zoom in any closer.

288
00:18:48,988 --> 00:18:51,188
Please show me the footage
from near the elevators.

289
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:52,288
Okay.

290
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,968
Both of them are around 180cm in height.

291
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,438
Weight, over 80kg.

292
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,208
All right. Let me see.

293
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:12,407
What are they looking at?

294
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,317
Door 3-4.

295
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:17,748
Hang on.

296
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,333
Can we see this scene
caught on another camera?

297
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:21,988
Is there a camera from another angle?

298
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,327
One second.

299
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:34,298
This is all we have.

301
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:43,278
Please give me a copy of these files.

302
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:44,577
Okay.

00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,837
- Please send it to this email here.
- All right.

(Jeonghoon Station)

306
00:20:00,728 --> 00:20:02,968
Those guys knew that there would be
a drug toss...

307
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,427
at Door 3-4 of Jeonghoon Station.

308
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:10,907
Also, they hoped I'd get on the train
at that spot.

309
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,637
That means, they wanted me to arrest
the guy in the baseball cap.

310
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,347
Who is CEO Yoon, and who is the Doctor?

311
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,618
Is the guy in the baseball cap CEO Yoon?

312
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,758
Are they using me to get rid of
a competing gang?

313
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,664
The guy who sent this message...

314
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,157
hoping I'd show up at platform 3-4.

315
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,488
Also, the guy who abducted me
and drugged me.

316
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:40,837
Those two...

317
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:42,938
are one person.

318
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:44,407

319
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:46,907

322
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:54,018
One, eight, eight, two.

323
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:58,188
But...

324
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,558

(At the time of case closure)

327
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:11,097
Did you find a suicide note
or anything else?

328
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:13,768
No, all we found were his shoes
on the ninth floor.

329
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:17,138
If it's a construction site,
don't they work on Saturdays too?

330
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,337
Why was he only found on Monday?

331
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:24,407
Well, they couldn't work on the weekend
because of complaints.

332
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:29,118
They haven't done an autopsy yet, right?

333
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:30,417
Actually, they have.

334
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:33,718
I was surprised too,
but the autopsy is already done.

335
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,337
I believe he's in the morgue
at Anhyun University Hospital now.

336
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:38,964
Who was the prosecutor
who ordered the autopsy?

337
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:40,028
One second.

338
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,798
It's Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

339
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,309
He's the deputy chief prosecutor of
Criminal Division One.

340
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,538
What was the cause of death?

341
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:57,177
As you can see,
he fell from the ninth floor.

342
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,567
There is no way
he wouldn't be a total mess.

Oh, yes. Is that right?

346
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,768
Then, you can just handle it that way.

347
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:22,738
Okay.

348
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,107
Well, but...

349
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,877
The deceased, Park Jun Seo...

350
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:29,607
and Jang Jae Gyeong,
an inspector at our station...

351
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,248
It turns out that
those two were friends from high school.

352
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:35,577
Didn't you say you graduated from
Jeogang High School as well?

353

Well, you should go now.

- So...
- Come on!

359
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:58,938
Honestly speaking, it's not like...

360
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,278
we're in a situation
where we have to explain everything.

361
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:03,113
Since the victim was your friend,

362
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,907
we gave you this much. Isn't that enough?

Get going now. That's enough.

364
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:25,097
Hey, you! Grab him!

365
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:27,938
- Jang Jae Gyeong!
- Captain Jang!

366
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:29,667
You punk!

367
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,438
- Captain Jang!
- Out of the way.

368
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,548
Jang Jae Gyeong. Open up!

369
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:38,877
Open up, you crazy jerk!

370
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,208
Do you think
I'll let you get away with this?

371
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,323
(Oh Chi Hyun, Park Tae Jin, Won Jong Soo)

372
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:45,863
The estimated time of death is...

373
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,788
between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. last Friday.

374
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,133
Open up before I knock this down!

375
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:51,827
- Give it back now. Captain!
- Open up.

376
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,148
- Gosh, what do you think you're doing?
- Open up.

377
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:55,234
Captain Jang!

378
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:56,258
(Oh Yoon Jin)

379
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,498
Darn it!

380
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,468
Hey.

381
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,768
Get out here, you jerk!

382
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:08,808
You crazy jerk.

383
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,278
Do you think I'm being funny?

384
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:23,857
That crazy jerk.

385
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:26,387
You're here.

386
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,448
(Oh Chi Hyun, Park Tae Jin, Won Jong Soo)

387
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,328
It looks like you took your pill.

388
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:48,147
Chang Soo.

389
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,323
Do you remember the number
I asked you to check earlier?

390
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:51,724
- The burner phone.
- Yes?

391
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:53,694
I'll buy time,
so track its location right now.

392
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:54,718
Okay.

393
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,028
Who are you?

394
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,958
Hello. I need you to urgently track
the location of 010-0325-1533.

395
00:25:03,427 --> 00:25:04,843
Don't hang up.

396
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,427
- Please check now and tell me.
- Guess?

397
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,014
(How do you know...)

398
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:10,637
How do you know about 1882?

399
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:12,984
(-Guess?)
(- How do you know about 1882?)

400
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:14,607
Because it's me.

401
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:16,847
(Park Jun Seo...)

402
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:18,677
Park Jun Seo died.

403
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,177
I never said I was Park Jun Seo.

404
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:24,218
So where are you going to go next?

405
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:25,823
To Park Jun Seo's funeral?

406
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:29,058
Or maybe to catch that guy
you lost at the subway station?

407
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:32,704
(Or maybe to catch that guy
you lost at the subway station?)

408
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:34,174
(What's...)

409
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,073
What's the connection
between Park Jun Seo and the drug?

410
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:37,603
(What's the connection
between Park Jun Seo and the drug?)

411
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:39,228
Why did you drug me?

412
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:42,238
Got anything?

413
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:47,137
You'll find out sooner or later.

414
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,977
It'd make more sense to go
to the funeral if you're a good friend.

415
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,208
Have a good one.

416
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:54,117
Well?

417
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:57,123
They were moving while using the phone.

418
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:00,058
They were heading from Anhyun Stream
to Jungji-dong.

419
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:01,357
"Jungji-dong?"

420
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,164
The postmortem examination
was already done.

421
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,627
He must be in the morgue
of Anhyun University Hospital.

422
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,028
Anhyun University Hospital.

423
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,308
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

424
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,583
(Park Jun Seo)

425
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:21,877
He was handed over.

426
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:23,424
What?

427
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,048
He was handed over to his family
about an hour ago.

428
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,153
Without an autopsy?

429
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:30,694
Yes. The prosecutor said
they received the family's consent.

430
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:31,793
They didn't want an autopsy...

431
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,788
and decided to proceed with the funeral.

432
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,833
Which prosecutor conducted
the postmortem examination?

433
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,734
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

434
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:41,039
He's the deputy chief prosecutor
of Criminal Division One.

435
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:42,827
Okay.

436
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,438
(Sunghan Bank)

437
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,744
Please check your balance...

438
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:54,778
and select the service you want.

439
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:58,184
(Continue)

440

Checking your card information.

441

Please select the service you want.

442
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,063
Darn it.

443
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,087
(100 dollars)

444
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,427
You startled me. Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

445
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:16,974
(Oh Yoon Jin)

446
00:27:16,998 --> 00:27:19,238
What did you talk about with Park Jun Seo
on February 22?

447
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:20,813
What?

448
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,343
Don't you remember?
You spoke with him on the phone...

449
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:23,508
on Thursday, February 22.

450
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,287
I'm asking what you talked about
with Jun Seo the day before he died.

451
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,817
(Missed call: Park Jun Seo)

452
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:42,288
Yoon Jin.

453
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,198
I missed a call from him,
and then I forgot to call him back.

454
00:27:55,337 --> 00:27:56,337
You forgot?

455
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,238
A friend you never talk to calls you
and you forget to call him back?

456
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:03,808
It can happen.

457
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:07,147
Also, I'm not like you
who cut ties with people.

458
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:10,194
I wouldn't say we kept in close touch,

459
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,458
but Jun Seo and I talked on the phone
every month or two.

460
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,058
I mean it.

461
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:19,657
Hey.

462
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,357
Are you here to offer condolences
or interrogate?

463
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,504
I heard Jun Seo took his own life.

464
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,228
I'm already upset as it is.

465
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:29,498
And now you suddenly show up
and make a fuss.

466
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:33,467
(Late Park Jun Seo,
Spouse: Choi Ji Yeon)

467
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,847
Please retrieve your card.

468
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:40,893
What is this?

469
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,123
- Thank you for using our service.
- I have to do it all over?

470
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:46,347
(Rest in peace)

471
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,788
(Room 1)

472
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,568
Are you here to offer condolences?

473
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:09,508
Yes.

474
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:12,077
No one is around right now.

475
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,347
They're over there.

476
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,228
(Observation Room)

477
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:34,837
Hey, where are you going?

478
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,137
- What is this?
- Stop.

479
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:38,407
What are you doing?

480
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:40,938
Who do you think you are
to behave this way?

481
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:43,113
I'm a detective. Please let me go.

482
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:44,147
"A detective?"

483
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:46,347
Hey, it's Jae Gyeong.

484
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,117
Jang Jae Gyeong.

485
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:49,218
"Jang Jae Gyeong?"

486
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,877
Please stop with the shrouding.

487
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,518
We'll perform an autopsy.

488
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:29,458
We need to conduct an autopsy.

489
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:31,758
Several things are suspicious
about Jun Seo's death.

490
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:32,964
Please give your consent for an autopsy.

491
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:34,528
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

492
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,067
Who are you to order an autopsy?

493
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:39,138
Who do you think you are? Come here.

494
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:44,383
Park Jun Seo's estimated time of death...

495
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,637
is between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. on February 23.

496
00:30:47,837 --> 00:30:49,014
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong...

497
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,424
which led to a fractured skull
and damaged organs.

498
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:52,883
- Jae Gyeong.
- This is the strange part.

499
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:54,924
Jun Seo's shoes were found
on the ninth floor which was assumed...

500
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:56,377
to be where he jumped.

501
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,764
But the elevator on-site wasn't
on the ninth floor, but the first.

502
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:01,087
What's so strange about that?

503
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:15,337
Jong Soo.

504
00:31:33,718 --> 00:31:34,718
It's you, Jae Gyeong.

505
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,558
Long time no see.

506
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:38,887
It's me, Won Jong Soo.

507
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:45,827
Won Jong Soo at 10:10 p.m.

508
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,667
Has it been a while for you too?

509
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:51,738
Yes.

510
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:54,238
It has been 20 years
since our high school days.

511
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:55,607
I'm Tae Jin.

512
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:56,888
You remember me, don't you?

513
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:59,123
Last year, I joined the criminal division
of Anhyun's district prosecutor's office.

514
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:01,518
- We're finally meeting.
- Park Tae Jin at 10:18 p.m.

515
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,748
I guess people are bound to meet
if they're alive.

516
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,288
Oh Chi Hyun at 10:30 p.m.

517
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:17,937
Why did you perform
the postmortem examination?

518
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,167
What?

519
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,153
I had the time.

520
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:30,877
A deputy chief prosecutor had the time?

521
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:32,954
Are you sure it wasn't because
it was Park Jun Seo?

522
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,658
These days, even deputy chief prosecutors
must go when they're told.

523
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:37,117
By the way,

524
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:40,917
is it strange for a prosecutor
to go for a postmortem examination?

525
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,528
Fine. Let's forget about that.

526
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,438
What did you think during the examination?

527
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:50,603
Jang Jae Gyeong.

528
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:51,707
I said, what did you think?

529
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,508
Let's stop.

530
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,778
This is not the place for it.

531
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,714
What made you conclude it was a suicide?

532
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:05,877
Tae Jin is telling you to stop!

533
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:08,617
Yoon Ho.

534
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,363
We're sending our friend away.

535
00:33:13,387 --> 00:33:15,218
Do you need to make such a fuss?

536
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:18,034
Did you find any footprints
on the stairway to the ninth floor?

537
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:19,264
I was told no footprints...

538
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,504
on the construction site stairs matched...

539
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:22,558
the shoes Jun Seo was wearing.

540
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:25,498
What made you think
it was a suicide despite that?

541
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:28,337
Because the circumstances say so.

542
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,667
"Circumstances?"

543
00:33:29,998 --> 00:33:31,367
Jun Seo's daughter, Yoon Hee.

544
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,514
When she passed away
after he cared for her for six years,

545
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:34,837
he was broken.

546
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,583
He couldn't do anything.

547
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:38,248
Every day was torture for him.

548
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:42,577
He even went to a psychiatrist
to treat his depression.

549
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:44,317
That's enough, okay?

550
00:33:46,988 --> 00:33:50,157
You must be doing this
because you don't know his situation.

551
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,458
We're just as upset as you are.

552
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:57,167
He left in such a dire way.

553
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,748
There's no reason to cut him up.

554
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,867
Let's finish shrouding.

555
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,238
We can talk outside after.

556
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:05,784
Please continue.

557
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:06,944
Okay, everyone out.

558
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:08,177
Don't move!

559
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,448
Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong.

560
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:16,948
Hey.

561
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,117
You guys are a joke.

562
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,694
Didn't Jun Seo tell you
why he wanted to commit suicide...

563
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:24,788
before he jumped?

564
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,497
Are you really convinced it was suicide
based on the circumstances?

565
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:33,167
Think about it.
You're all talking about circumstances,

566
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:35,897
but why won't any of you
mention the most important thing?

567
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:37,808
Well?

568
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:42,478
The people Jun Seo talked to
before he died.

569
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:43,948
Won Jong Soo.

570
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:46,077
Park Tae Jin.

571
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:47,577
Oh Chi Hyun.

572
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,994
The suspected time of suicide
is between 11:30 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.

573
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,147
He talked to you three after 10:10 p.m.

574
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:55,988
If Jun Seo really took his life,
what would he have said?

575
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:58,867
Wouldn't something have sounded off?

576
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:02,927
When I asked earlier
why you were so sure he'd killed himself,

577
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:06,303
the first thing you'd have said
was that he had called you.

578
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:08,144
Why are you all trying to hide that?

579
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,967
Hey!

580
00:35:11,237 --> 00:35:12,244
What's your problem?

581
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:14,407
Why are you suddenly trying to be a cop?

582
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:15,608
Jeong Yoon Ho.

583
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:18,777
Stop it.

584
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:22,217
Why does that even matter right now?

585
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:25,463
Do you think there's something special
about Jun Seo calling us?

586
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:26,887
We...

587
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:30,157
We talked to each other
over ten times a day!

588
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:33,733
You got kicked out of school
trying to stab your friends in the back.

589
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,128
I can't believe you became a cop
only to act like you're invincible.

590
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:39,728
It's not "we."

591
00:35:40,427 --> 00:35:42,467
- What?
- He didn't call you.

592
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:47,038
What? Do you feel left out?

593
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,338
Darn you.

594
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:49,677
Hey.

595
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:53,077
Jeong Yoon Ho.

596
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:59,347
Someone could've drugged Jun Seo
and pushed him.

597
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:00,994
Even if that were not the case,

598
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:03,257
deaths like this require
an autopsy 100 percent.

599
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:04,628
Why won't you do it?

600
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:09,673
Why are you trying to rush the funeral
without an autopsy?

601
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:11,257
Did Jun Seo say something on the phone?

602
00:36:11,398 --> 00:36:13,204
What did he say that you're all like this?

603
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:14,467
Yes. He called.

604
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:18,343
I didn't know
he'd called Tae Jin or Chi Hyun.

605
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:19,668
He just asked how I was doing.

606
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:23,954
Since Yoon Hee's death,
he'd sounded so frail and glum,

607
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,277
and he did that night too.

608
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,523
I asked if I should buy him some tonic...

609
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:29,147
and told him to stay strong, that's all.

610
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,617
To me, that was the last chat...

611
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:35,788
with my friend Park Jun Seo.

612
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,633
I wanted to keep it to myself.

613
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,128
So I didn't mention it, okay?

614
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:42,358
Does that make sense?

615
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:45,367
Don't you think it's weird?

616
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:48,544
That one hour before taking his life,

617
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,867
Jun Seo called each of you
to ask how you were?

618
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,007
Who asked whom how they were doing?

619
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:55,753
Park Tae Jin, Oh Chi Hyun.

620
00:36:55,777 --> 00:36:57,577
Did Jun Seo call you to catch up too?

621
00:36:57,978 --> 00:36:59,007
Jang Jae Gyeong.

622
00:37:03,277 --> 00:37:04,487
Get a grip.

623
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:06,693
Hey!

624
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,058
Be quiet! Please!

625
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,588
Stop it, all of you.

626
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:17,597
What are you doing
next to your friend's dead body?

627
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,368
Do you still call yourselves his friend?

628
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,577
Jun Seo...

629
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:29,777
didn't call me.

630
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,277
Whether it was to say hi or catch up,
you all got a call at least!

631
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,018
I didn't even get that!

632
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:28,697
(Vault 1, Park Jun Seo, February 26, 2024)

633
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:41,688
Do you have to do that
to make yourself feel better?

634
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:44,818
What do you mean?

635
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:46,947
Goodness.

636
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:53,257
I don't even know
why I'm sitting here with you.

637
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,898
They're the Major Leaguers.

638
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:01,637
My pathetic life's always in the Minors.

639
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:05,668
Come this way.

640
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,208
What is it?

641
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:09,677
You'll barge in there for round two?

642
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,927
I must get her to agree to an autopsy.

643
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:15,947
Hey.

644
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,177
Those guys practically lived together...

645
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:20,318
with Jun Seo for the last 20 years.

646
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:24,228
Look at them with the armbands.

647
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:26,088
They're practically family.

648
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:27,498
Darn it.

649
00:39:28,197 --> 00:39:29,797
There's something you don't know.

650
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,367
The reason Jun Seo's daughter
lasted six years.

651
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:34,244
It was because Jong Soo
sent five grand a month...

652
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:36,068
for medicine and treatments.

653
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,438
Do you think that's a small sum?

654
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,507
So don't even mention...

655
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,308
an autopsy in front of them.

656
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,617
To be honest, I'm against it too.

657
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:51,717
He'll meet his daughter
when he crosses over.

658
00:39:52,117 --> 00:39:53,124
If you were him,

659
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,788
would you want to show up
with a Y-cut on your chest?

660
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,228
The guy who punched me
was Jeong Yoon Ho, right?

661
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:10,637
Yes. Next to him is Kang Si Jung.

662
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:12,938
The class decorator.

663
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,577
- Do you remember?
- No.

664
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:15,907
You wouldn't.

665
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:18,248
Yoon Ho and Si Jung are married.

666
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:20,317
They started dating in college.

667
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,978
On his other side is Jeong Sang Eui.

668
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,717
You remember him, right?

669
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:26,887
You wouldn't know anyone.

670
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:30,958
I guess...

671
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,458
you stayed in touch with them.

672
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:35,958
No. I didn't see them often.

673
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:38,573
I talk to Si Jung sometimes.

674
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:40,117
The others, I haven't seen in a while.

675
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,637
I don't go to the reunions.

676
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:45,438
Do you think so too?

677
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:49,007
That Jun Seo killed himself...

678
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,427
over the pain of losing his daughter?

679
00:41:01,617 --> 00:41:02,918
I think it's possible.

680
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:06,458
Now that I'm a mom,

681
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,858
I don't think I could live
if my kid died first.

682
00:41:16,538 --> 00:41:17,637
- Move over.
- Okay.

683
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,514
Jong Soo. Sit over here.

684
00:41:19,538 --> 00:41:20,684
- Hey.
- Sit here.

685
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,777
- Jong Soo.
- Hi.

686
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:23,838
Thanks for coming.

687
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,478
Hey, this isn't working.
I should be over there.

688
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:32,148
That's where I belong.

689
00:41:32,518 --> 00:41:34,148
I just dropped off a flower arrangement.

690
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,863
Leave it outside, then.

691
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:38,157
Can you sign for it?

692
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,157
Darn it.

693
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:46,128
Okay.

694
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:48,898
It's from Joo Song.

695
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:50,673
(Signed for by: Oh Yoon Jin)

696
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:51,713
(From Twostar Holdings, Heo Joo Song)

697
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:52,838
What is "Twostar?"

698
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:54,438
Is he a division commander?

699
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:01,394
He'll cling to and bother me
if he shows up.

700
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,447
Shoot.

701
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:05,518
- Hey.
- Long time no see.

702
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:08,318
Jong Soo, it has been so long.

703
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:16,797
Hey.

704
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:18,967
I'm sorry about earlier.

705
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,644
Could you consider...

706
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,697
- doing the autopsy...
- Are you going somewhere?

707
00:42:23,038 --> 00:42:24,068
Yes.

708
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,637
I'm going home to get some stuff.

709
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,978
I left in a daze and hurry earlier.

710
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:30,808
How will go get there?

711
00:42:31,277 --> 00:42:32,878
I'll take a taxi and make a quick trip.

712
00:42:35,878 --> 00:42:36,978
I'll drive you.

713
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,047
You shouldn't take a taxi today.

714
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,617
I didn't drink.

715
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:42,217
It's fine.

716
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:45,228
Well, we all have a reason
to want to leave.

717
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:49,058
If you see Heo Joo Song, tell him I left.

718
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:51,387
I'm not in the mood
to put up with his excitement.

719
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,597
Let's go.

720
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,128
(Ten dollars)

721
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,367
(March 2004)

722
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:34,677
Hey, Judo guy.

723
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:38,087
The teacher wants to see you
in the office.

724
00:43:39,308 --> 00:43:41,978
Are you adjusting to the new class?

725
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:44,987
Is anything hard
since you started 11th grade?

726
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:47,688
- No.
- I see.

727
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:53,527
Your father is
Education Officer Jang Tae Jung, isn't he?

728
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:55,058
Right?

729
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,068
The reason...

730
00:43:58,498 --> 00:44:01,668
why you were assigned to my class
since starting the 11th grade...

731
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:06,168
was because Education Officer Jang
has become your new father.

732
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:07,907
You know that, don't you?

733
00:44:08,737 --> 00:44:09,737
Right?

734
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:11,547
Also,

735
00:44:12,577 --> 00:44:17,354
everyone is dying to join Class Six,
you know?

736
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:19,447
You know that very well too, don't you?

737
00:44:20,248 --> 00:44:21,257
Let's get along.

738
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:23,188
- Good.
- Sir.

739
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,463
- Yes?
- I've gathered the student support fund.

740
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:27,487
Everyone paid, right?

741
00:44:27,588 --> 00:44:29,128
- Not yet.
- Who is it?

742
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:32,768
Everyone paid except for him.

743
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:37,443
Hey, you should've explained to him well.

744
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,467
He doesn't know
because it's his first time here.

745
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:44,784
In order to help students in need
continue their studies,

746
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:47,648
everyone in the class volunteered.

747
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,518
They volunteered to collect these funds.

748
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:53,928
You don't have to pay
if you don't want to.

749
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,887
You should collect money
like you're supposed to.

750
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,458
Sorry, sir.

751
00:45:02,427 --> 00:45:03,757
All right.

752
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:05,097
Good.

753
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:07,228
All right. Get going.

754
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:08,398
Yes, sir.

755
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:17,637
Today,

756
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,978
your school's principal
and homeroom teacher came to see me.

757
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:24,423
You've never once called me Father,

758
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:25,547
but I guess you said...

759
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,018
that I was your father at school.

760
00:45:29,288 --> 00:45:31,264
There's a kid in your class
named Won Jong Soo.

761
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:32,858
Be good friends with him.

762
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:36,327
Buy your friends some food too.

763
00:45:47,737 --> 00:45:51,753
In order to help students in need
continue their studies,

764
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:54,648
everyone in the class volunteered.

765
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:08,297
It's the class president.

766
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:10,474
He's suspended.

767
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:12,943
(Class 3-6, Park Jun Seo,
suspended for 1 week)

768
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:14,044
A week is a bit harsh.

769
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,568
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

770
00:46:15,597 --> 00:46:17,338
Among you,

771
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,367
someone...

772
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:21,677
sent an anonymous letter...

773
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:24,017
to the superintendent's office.

774
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,847
The student support fund
that you voluntarily collected...

775
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,148
is an act of bribery.

776
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,228
I guess that's what the letter said.

777
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:37,088
I won't make it long.

778
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:38,588
Now,

779
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,328
we won't be collecting
the student support fund anymore.

780
00:46:41,858 --> 00:46:44,128
Also, to take responsibility
for this incident,

781
00:46:44,257 --> 00:46:46,728
the class president has been suspended
for a week.

782
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,907
(Reduce food waste and increase recycling)

783
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:58,277
(Park Jun Seo)

784
00:46:59,507 --> 00:47:01,467
Do you have to do this too
when you get suspended?

785
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:08,818
Here.

786
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:14,887
Did you come to apologize or something?

787
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:17,943
Did you think one anonymous letter...

788
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:20,003
would get your stepfather fired
as an Education Officer...

789
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:21,547
and our homeroom teacher out of a job?

790
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:24,808
Did you expect that kind of happy ending?

791
00:47:30,878 --> 00:47:32,378
What will happen to you now?

792
00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:35,968
Is it hard for you to attend school
without the student support fund?

793
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,617
Hey, that student support fund
wasn't even that much money.

794
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:42,188
It's enough for me
to watch out for Jong Soo.

795
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:45,104
Having to mind all the other kids
just because I received that fund...

796
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,128
wasn't fun for me either.

797
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:50,458
I'm rather glad.

798
00:47:51,257 --> 00:47:52,417
You shouldn't mind it either.

799
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:55,998
Anyway,

800
00:47:56,768 --> 00:47:57,768
sorry.

801
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:01,227
I didn't know
things would end up like this.

802
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:03,438
Worry about your own future.

803
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:07,547
You must've been prepared
when you made things this bad.

804
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:14,017
Our homeroom teacher and Jong Soo
seemed to have their eyes set on you.

805
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,518
Will you be okay?

806
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:22,927
I'm off.

807
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:25,168
I'm rather glad too.

808
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,338
I'm a psycho who got a friend suspended.

809
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:31,538
Now, everyone knows that.

810
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:35,538
I doubt anyone would say anything to me...

811
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,598
just because
I don't tiptoe around somebody.

812
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:40,648
Crazy punk.

813
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:44,478
You seriously must be crazy.

Funeral Home)

815

This was a will written
by Mr. Park Jun Seo himself.

816

A will?

817
00:49:27,858 --> 00:49:28,858
Excuse me.

818

819

I'm Joo Song. Heo Joo Song.

820
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,777
- Hey.
- What on earth happened to Jun Seo?

821
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:43,637
Hey, Chi Hyun.

822
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:44,978
Right.

823
00:49:45,947 --> 00:49:46,947
Let's say our goodbyes.

824
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:14,713
I'll be back soon.

825
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:16,438
No, take your time.

826
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:29,034
(Visitors, please check in
at the security office.)

827
00:50:29,058 --> 00:50:32,157
Goodness. She already went up.

828
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:33,863
Who?

829
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:35,834
Yoon Hee's mother just went up, right?

830
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:36,858
Yes.

831
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:42,613
- Why?
- But there must've been a funeral.

832
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:44,438
I thought I saw her
wearing mourning clothes.

833
00:50:44,697 --> 00:50:45,907
Oh, yes.

834
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:48,737

My goodness.

838
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:00,148
By the way, what's this?

839
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:01,347
Oh, this?

840
00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:05,058
It's a registered mail that arrived
a few days ago.

841
00:51:05,288 --> 00:51:06,927
I haven't delivered it to them yet.

842
00:51:07,288 --> 00:51:09,458
Gosh, I think it was for Yoon Hee's dad.

843
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:10,977
She'll be back down soon, right?

844
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,027

She's...

848
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:21,108
pretty out of it right now.
I'll hand it to her.

849
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,014
Well, but still...

850
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,608

Yes.

- "As a friend?"
- Yes, as a friend.

By the way,

881
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,697
since when did Yoon Jin become...

882
00:52:57,498 --> 00:52:59,438
so materialistic?

I can't go into the details
since it's her privacy.

884
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:07,547
You knew she used to work
for Daehan Daily, right?

885
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:09,617
- Did she?
- Yes.

886
00:53:09,918 --> 00:53:12,347
She was new in the field,
but she received recognition.

887
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:15,458
But you know what she's like.

888
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,558
She didn't edit her story
like she was told...

889
00:53:18,827 --> 00:53:20,787
and just published it,
so she had to quit her job.

890
00:53:21,257 --> 00:53:25,228
The following year,
she married a Korean guy from Canada...

891
00:53:26,427 --> 00:53:29,398
who worked at a stock firm
and had her daughter Ye Eun.

892
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:31,374
And?

893
00:53:31,398 --> 00:53:34,038
Maybe two years or so
after Ye Eun was born, they divorced.

894
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:37,514
Her ex-husband took their daughter
to Canada.

895
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:38,577
But the problem is,

896
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:43,447
this jerk...

897
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:46,148
doesn't seem to be earning any money.

898
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:48,193
He seems to be living off...

899
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:50,717
of the child support
Yoon Jin sends every month.

900
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:52,688
- Why?
- How should I know?

901
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:54,558
Anyway,

902
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:58,058
Yoon Jin would do anything
if it was for Ye Eun.

903
00:53:58,797 --> 00:54:00,044
I think she knows what's going on,

904
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:02,228
but she's still trying to make more money
to send over.

905
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:05,237
But you and I both know
how much local reporters make.

906
00:54:16,248 --> 00:54:17,847
Jae Gyeong, hey...

907
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:21,217
Didn't Jun Seo come visit you recently?

908
00:54:24,188 --> 00:54:26,588
- He did, right?
- How did you know that?

909
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:28,597
I guess he did.

910
00:54:29,257 --> 00:54:31,257
What did he say?
Did he say anything in particular?

911
00:54:32,327 --> 00:54:34,867
Like what? What do you know?

912
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,637
I'm telling you this because it's you.

913
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:43,507
It's really uncomfortable to be here.

914
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,248
Why is that?

915
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:48,148
About a week ago,

916
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:50,217
Jun Seo came to see me.

917
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:53,527
He wanted to sign up for a life insurance.

918
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:55,617
Just a minute.

919
00:54:56,487 --> 00:54:58,487
Next week Wednesday?

920
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,288
Sure. I'll see you then.

921
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:05,058
One medical billing insurance
and one cancer insurance.

922
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,297
Thank you.

923
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:08,668
Bye.

924
00:55:11,168 --> 00:55:12,867
Let's see...

925
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:14,208
You look busy.

926
00:55:16,038 --> 00:55:17,077
What?

927
00:55:20,547 --> 00:55:22,248
- Life insurance?
- Yes.

928
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:26,717
He signed up for a few other packages
with me before,

929
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:29,494
but he suddenly visited me
and signed up for three life insurance.

930
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:30,918
But, under the name of his company.

931
00:55:30,987 --> 00:55:32,058
"His company?"

932
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,558
He told me he founded a company.

933
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,958
Darn him. He left in just a week.

934
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:39,268
Wait.

935
00:55:39,898 --> 00:55:42,237
He can't get any insurance money
if it's a suicide, right?

936
00:55:42,568 --> 00:55:43,597
Right.

937
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:45,467
I told him...

938
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:49,338
he wouldn't get any payment
if he committed suicide within two years.

939
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:55,347
But...

940
00:55:56,617 --> 00:55:58,347
this is where it gets really strange.

941
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:00,247
After signing up for the insurance,

942
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:02,558
he asked me to see a lawyer with him.

943
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:04,418
- "A lawyer?"
- Yes.

944
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:11,297
Please give me your attention
for a moment.

945
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:18,467
On behalf of Jun Seo's family,
I want to thank all of you...

946
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:21,208
for seeing Jun Seo off.

947
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:26,808
Before...

948
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,547
Jun Seo died,

949
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,318
he left a will.

950
00:56:34,248 --> 00:56:36,418
On February 16, 2024,

951
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:38,588
which was a week before Jun Seo's death,

952
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:41,208
he met with CEO Heo Joo Song
from Twostar Holdings...

953
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:44,188
to sign up for life insurance
with Jungho Life, Heungin Life,

954
00:56:44,628 --> 00:56:47,568
and Jangsoo Life for amounts
1 million, 2 million, and 2 million...

955
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,358
for a total of five million dollars...

956
00:56:51,268 --> 00:56:53,068

of his fully-owned corporation,

(Anhyun University Hospital, Park Jun Seo)

959
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:20,827
Darn it.

960
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,907
What is this?

961
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:32,208
"The insured: Park Jun Seo"

962
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,248
"Beneficiary..."

(Beneficiary: Audio File)

964
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,978
"Audio File?"

965
00:57:41,117 --> 00:57:42,117
Wait...

966
00:57:43,788 --> 00:57:46,027
(Amount insured: Two million dollars)

967
00:57:47,027 --> 00:57:48,058
"Two million dollars?"

968
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,068
(Beneficiary: Audio File, Park Jun Seo)

969
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:56,967

973
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,363
on this will,

974
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:22,998
he indicated the legatee
of his company's full shares...

975
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:27,597
and the beneficiary
of the five million dollars.

The students' creed.

988
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:40,113
One.

989
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:42,677
Be someone who performs one's duty.

990
00:59:43,007 --> 00:59:44,014
Two.

991
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,624
Be true to one's goal.

992
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:47,653
Three.

993
00:59:47,677 --> 00:59:50,518
Be a helping hand to a friend.

994
00:59:51,378 --> 00:59:53,188
All right. Come in.

995
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:02,757
They're our new transfer students.

996
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:04,927

I look forward to getting to know you.

1004
01:00:23,518 --> 01:00:25,688
Help them adjust, okay?

1005
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:26,918
- Okay.
- Okay.

1006
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:29,088
Okay, you two.

1007
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:31,958
That's our students' creed.

1008
01:00:33,558 --> 01:00:35,903
I'll check if you memorized them
by the end of the day,

1009
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:37,998
so make sure you get them down.

1010
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:39,498
All right?

1011
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:42,538
Now, your seats.

1012
01:00:43,668 --> 01:00:44,668
Sir.

1013
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:46,838
I have a question.

1014
01:00:47,507 --> 01:00:49,577
"Be a helping hand to a friend."

1015
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:51,677
Did you come up with this one?

1016
01:00:54,648 --> 01:00:56,518
- What?
- I find it strange.

1017
01:00:57,378 --> 01:00:59,447
Do all friends have to be helpful?

1018
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:02,133
Whether we're helpful
to one another or not,

1019
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,887
you should encourage us
to get along as friends.

1020
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:06,827
What?

1021
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:08,628
You agree with me, don't you?

1022
01:01:09,858 --> 01:01:12,168
If it's okay, should I change it?

1023
01:01:15,197 --> 01:01:16,237
Gosh.

1024
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:06,693
(Connection)

1025
01:02:06,717 --> 01:02:09,733
Why didn't you discuss it with me
if you knew there was a will?

1026
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:11,034
So it wasn't a suicide?

1027
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:12,628
Did someone kill my husband?

1028
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:14,403
- It's better to perform an autopsy.
- Hey.

1029
01:02:14,427 --> 01:02:16,003
Too many things are suspicious.

1030
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:17,474
Are you doing this
because you want the insurance money?

1031
01:02:17,498 --> 01:02:19,867
- Hey, Park Tae Jin.
- Don't you dare say my name.

1032
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,338
I'm here as a prosecutor,
not as your friend.

1033
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:26,014
What are you trying to hide
by going this far?

1034
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:27,684
It's a clear proof of murder.

1035
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,277
We won't last forever like this.

1036
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:30,454
"Lemon Mulberry?"

1037
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:31,478
It's that drug again.

1038
01:02:33,108 --> 01:02:34,584
You can't take me to a hospital.

1039
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:36,823
How could you use drugs?

1040
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:38,454
I can't do without it.

1041
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:39,758
Come to your senses, Jae Gyeong!

1042
01:02:40,018 --> 01:02:41,018
Open the door.

1043
01:02:41,847 --> 01:02:43,788
Wake up, Jang Jae Gyeong!
