1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,017
Did you drive to Pilo-dong

3
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,935
at around 11:20 p.m. on February 23rd?

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,521
Someone suddenly jumped out of the alley.

5
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,858
Park Jun-seo… Did you kill him?

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,859
No.

7
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,235
Then why did you go to Pilo-dong

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,864
at the time when Jun-seo died
on February 23rd?

9
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,532
Jun-seo said to come.

10
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,034
He told you to come?

11
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,744
Not just me.

12
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,205
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin,
and Oh Chi-hyeon.

13
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,290
He told us all to get there by 11:30 p.m.

14
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,792
How'd you know he was on the ninth floor?

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,793
The light was on.

16
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,044
Hey, Park Jun-seo!

17
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,587
THE FOUR TAKE THE ELEVATOR UP
TO FIND JUN-SEO

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,505
Let's go up to him.

19
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,798
So you went to the ninth floor

20
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,758
-and met Jun-seo there?
-First floor.

21
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,177
I met him on the first floor.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,095
You guys happened to be in the elevator

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,264
when Jun-seo jumped from the ninth floor?

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,891
The people in the elevator included

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:44,187
someone who could kill another
without getting blood on his own hands,

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,106
someone who would carry out
any task given to him,

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,567
and someone who could cover up
everything I just said.

28
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,653
While they were establishing their alibis,

29
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,280
they could've had someone else
push Park Jun-seo.

30
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,281
But then what are you?

31
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,741
I saw it.

32
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,202
His shoes.

33
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,954
He was wearing shoes.

34
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,914
JUN-SEO WAS WEARING
SHOES AT THE TIME

35
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,458
They came from KH Pharmaceutical.

36
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,877
I'm Oh Yun-jin
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

37
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,003
Is the director in?

38
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,213
She's not here right now.

39
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll wait. That's okay, right?

40
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,007
But…

41
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,551
We're going in right now.

42
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,845
Where the hell are we going?

43
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,804
Oh Chi-hyeon!

44
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,143
How did you know
there were issues with the drugs

45
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,853
we supplied to Woonjong Medical Center?

46
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,064
I knew I'd see you sooner or later,
so I prepared these envelopes.

47
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,152
After seeing the photos, I thought
I should both bribe and blackmail you.

48
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,780
In any case, I won't let this case slide.

49
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,741
Yun-jin was kidnapped today.

50
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,202
Where did Hyeon-u see Yun-jin?

51
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,914
I think he was originally following
Oh Chi-hyeon and not Yun-jin.

52
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,541
How does Hyeon-u know him?

53
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,877
-I've seen him once.
-Where?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,670
At Loraine Hotel.

55
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,380
Did Park Jun-seo send you on an errand?

56
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,339
Delivering drugs?

57
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,217
Deliver this first.
You know the Loraine Hotel in downtown?

58
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,177
Somebody will be waiting
in the first floor lobby.

59
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,598
After that, you'll take this box
that contains eight of these

60
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,224
and go to Woonjong Medical Center.

61
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,518
The drugs might've gotten switched
with others.

62
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,397
They got mixed up
when I slipped on the wet road.

63
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,108
So the drugs that should've gone
to Loraine Hotel

64
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,278
went to Ms. Park Bok-rye instead.

65
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,821
Where did you see
Oh Chi-hyeon two days ago?

66
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,656
A cold storage warehouse in Pilo-dong.

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,116
Why go there all of a sudden?

68
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,492
HYEON-U GOT A CALL
FROM JUN-SEO'S OLD NUMBER

69
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,244
Mr. Jun-seo?

70
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,163
They just hung up without a word.

71
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,540
The phone has been turned off since.

72
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,792
-What's the name?
-Yeongryun Cold Storage.

73
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,587
Right now, this is the only unit
being used for cold storage.

74
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,756
The rest contain general products.

75
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,299
What were you looking for?

76
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,676
A drug manufacturing lab?

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,762
SOMETHING CATCHES
JAE-GYEONG'S EYE

78
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:45,391
IT WAS THE AD BALLOON HE SAW
AT THE RICE MILL CRIME SCENE

79
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,227
JAE-GYEONG USES
THE AD BALLOON'S LOCATION

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,686
TO RETRACE
THE SUSPECT'S MOVEMENTS

81
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,272
This man who tried
to cross at the crosswalk.

82
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,690
He's trying to avoid something.

83
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,194
A car drove through the rice mill alley
and went straight!

84
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,320
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

85
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,822
It leads to a road in front of
an old cold storage warehouse.

86
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,950
There was a small side road there.

87
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,451
At the end of it

88
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,579
was a main road leading
to either Jeongji-dong or Join-dong.

89
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,830
JAE-GYEONG DISCOVERS
A CCTV CAMERA THERE

90
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,666
Is this the footage we just got?

91
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,752
THE CCTV FOOTAGE SHOWS
THE TAXI JAE-GYEONG SUSPECTED

92
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,630
It's 34A 5253.

93
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,967
You… Who are you?

94
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,889
APRIL 2005

95
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,015
Hey, Gyeong-tae!

96
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,559
Chae Gyeong-tae!

97
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,980
Hey, where's the ramyeon?

98
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,606
In the kitchen.

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,858
Check inside the cupboards.

100
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,610
Inside the cupboards?

101
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,330
Hey, it's not here!

102
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,957
Look carefully!

103
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,501
Come and look yourself. It's not here.

104
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,424
-It's right there.
-Where?

105
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,759
Oh, it's right here.

106
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,344
He can't even find ramyeon.

107
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,055
"Oh, it's right here."

108
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,807
Damn it.

109
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,768
You dummy.

110
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,854
You're so clumsy for spilling that.

111
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,564
It's your fault I spilled it.

112
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,523
Clean it up well.

113
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,444
Jeez, that stinks.

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,454
-Don't put too much water.
-I won't. Don't worry.

115
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,832
-Hey, No Gyu-min.
-What?

116
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,459
-Give me a lighter.
-A lighter?

117
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,626
Yes.

118
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,463
Here.

119
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,842
Okay.

120
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,847
Hey, I have to use the bathroom.

121
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,266
All done.

122
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,814
Jeez.

123
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,441
Hey, is the power off here?

124
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,569
The water and gas have been cut off.
Of course, there's no electricity.

125
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,821
Darn it.

126
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,741
It's rather quiet today.

127
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,909
No protests today?

128
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,078
He went to confront Won Jong-soo's father.

129
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,122
He'll get compensation if things go well.

130
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,792
Hey, Chae Gyeong-tae!

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,546
-What's going on?
-What?

132
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,049
What are you looking at, you bastard?

133
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,592
Why you!

134
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,928
Won Jong-soo?

135
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
Are you crazy?

136
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,855
You jerk!

137
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,735
Jong-soo, there's a fire!

138
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,903
Be quiet!

139
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,154
-Oh Chi-hyeon, get him up.
-Let go!

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,076
I said to know your place, Gyeong-tae!

141
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,600
TUESDAY, MARCH 5TH

142
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,367
Isn't today your day off?

143
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,494
Yes.

144
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,542
I'm going to Cheongun Temple.

145
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,294
Go back to sleep.

146
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,379
Yeong-eun, get the door!

147
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,888
Jung Yeong-eun!

148
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,728
Who is it?

149
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,574
What brings you here?

150
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,701
Is Yun-ho inside?

151
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,745
He's out.

152
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,830
But taxis don't operate today.

153
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,126
Yes, but he went to Cheongun Temple
for morning prayers.

154
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,461
Cheongun Temple?

155
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,796
It's located in Injeok Mountain.

156
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,465
It's on the road off Route 392
toward Hwanseong City.

157
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,552
Captain Jang, you stay there
while we go arrest Jung Yun-ho.

158
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,265
I'll send more people from the precinct,
so coax the family into cooperating.

159
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,351
And don't let them contact Jung Yun-ho.

160
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,355
Is it okay if I wait inside?

161
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,149
All right.

162
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,329
Whose car is this?

163
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,956
It's mine.

164
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,166
Why do you ask?

165
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,960
I just want to check it out.

166
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,432
The front and back license plates
of the compact car are taped over,

167
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,725
so we can't run them.

168
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,741
-Is the car open?
-I think so.

169
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,298
Hey, what's going on?

170
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,508
Is there a test taker at home?

171
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,634
What?

172
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,010
You said he went to morning prayers.

173
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,597
He goes and prays
for different things on his days off.

174
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,892
Come on in.

175
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,227
Goodness.

176
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,028
Daughter?

177
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,155
She's in the seventh grade.

178
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,324
Time flies, doesn't it?

179
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,245
When I raise my kids,
I think about our school days.

180
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,957
Back then, it was fun
just being with our classmates.

181
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,042
Right?

182
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,673
Mind if I sit down?

183
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,133
Go ahead.

184
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,281
Yun-ho…

185
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,701
Did he get in trouble?

186
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,205
Was it a car accident?

187
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,417
Or drunk driving?

188
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,629
I thought it was Yun-ho's day off today,

189
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,967
so I came early to arrest him

190
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,343
as quietly as possible.

191
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,846
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,724
By any chance…

193
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,103
Have the other detectives
gone to get Yun-ho?

194
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,449
You know Yun-ho is an ex-convict, right?

195
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,659
I just found out.

196
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,827
Don't tell me

197
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,247
he did the same thing as before.

198
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,833
It can't be.

199
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,836
He promised never to do
something like that again.

200
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,465
His friends mean the world to him.

201
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,135
Even now, he's hoping
for Jong-soo's business to succeed

202
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,971
and for Tae-jin
to become prosecutor general.

203
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,973
That's why he went to pray.

204
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,353
He cares more for his friends
than his own family.

205
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,896
We're still investigating.

206
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,397
I know.

207
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,942
So please do something about this.

208
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,862
You have the authority to do so.

209
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,657
You can do that much for a friend, right?

210
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,288
Jae-gyeong.

211
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,124
We're still investigating.

212
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,550
So are you saying…

213
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,554
you're determined to arrest Yun-ho?

214
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,395
You are.

215
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,606
I forgot who you were for a moment.

216
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,650
You're the bastard

217
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:24,530
who talked Jun-seo into selling out
your classmates to the police.

218
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,615
What is it?

219
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,703
Is this revenge
for getting kicked out of school?

220
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,788
You petty bastard.

221
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,706
Si-jeong.

222
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,875
You came to arrest Yun-ho quietly?

223
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,670
That's bullshit.

224
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,507
You came to arrest a father
whose daughter is leaving for school.

225
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,344
Don't you dare pretend
that you're being considerate.

226
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,013
You're just a no-good bastard!

227
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,681
Si-jeong…

228
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,978
Mom, I'm off to school now.

229
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,120
Hi, sweetheart.

230
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,622
Run.

231
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,124
You have to run.
The detectives are on their way there.

232
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,543
Don't come home.

233
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,212
Don't let them catch you, okay?

234
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,131
Don't you dare get arrested!

235
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,743
Please take this child to school.

236
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,037
She'll accompany you.

237
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,290
Come with me.

238
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,877
-Search the inside of the house.
-Yes, sir.

239
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,380
And call KCSI
to have them examine that car.

240
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,547
-Yes, sir.
-Understood.

241
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,473
Section Chief.

242
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,850
We're almost there.
Just three kilometers away.

243
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,437
Jung Yun-ho's wife called him
and warned him you were on the way.

244
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,273
What? What do you mean?

245
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,776
What happened? Why couldn't you stop her?

246
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,944
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,488
Fine.

248
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,621
Damn it.

249
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,252
What did the chief say, sir?

250
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,045
Does he want us to hand the case over?

251
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,965
Didn't I tell you
to examine each taxi carefully?

252
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,718
It turns out the suspect
was that taxi driver after all!

253
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,430
The entire case was
handed over to Jang Jae-gyeong.

254
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,392
Park Jun-seo, Lee Myeong-guk,
and even the rice mill owner's case!

255
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,478
Damn it.

256
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,031
Hello, sir.

257
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,825
Is now a good time to talk?

258
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,119
Did you find anything on the CCTV camera?

259
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,622
Jung Yun-ho was caught on camera
leaving Cheongun Temple.

260
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,124
After that?

261
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,251
He was caught on camera again

262
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,211
heading towards
Hwanseong City on Route 887.

263
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
We don't have anything after that.

264
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,508
From now on, we're in charge of
the rice mill murder case.

265
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,219
As you know, the suspect, Jung Yun-ho,

266
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,304
his wife, Kang Si-jeong,

267
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,598
are high school friends
of Senior Inspector Jang.

268
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,476
So I think Su-hyeon
should take charge of this case now.

269
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,019
Do you agree?

270
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,062
Yes.

271
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,482
You'll support Su-hyeon
while investigating the lemon pop case.

272
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,818
Look into possible hideouts first

273
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,279
and ask the precinct for help
securing nearby CCTV footage.

274
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,198
-Yes, understood.
-Yes, understood.

275
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,007
PARK JUN-SEO

276
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,020
You're doing well.

277
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
Remember not to take
more than two at a time.

278
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,816
CCTV IN OPERATION

279
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,111
Did you go there?

280
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,280
Yes. There was a delivery
just like you said.

281
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,739
How many pills?

282
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,994
Four pills. There's a note too.
Want me to read it?

283
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,328
No, thanks.

284
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,165
Did you take that medicine?

285
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
Yes.

286
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,752
So? Is it working?

287
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,548
I'm not sure yet.
I just took it for the first time.

288
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,134
Are you at the police station?

289
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,886
Yes, but I'm heading out now.

290
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,096
-To where?
-Why do you ask?

291
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,058
What if you go into shock
and collapse again?

292
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,977
I'm so touched by your concern.

293
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,688
Someone should stay near you
until we know it works.

294
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,565
Tell me where you're going already!

295
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,409
Today at 10 a.m.,
CEO Won will have a visitor.

296
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,661
Vice President Han Seong-hun of Igu Group.

297
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,163
Why is Han Seong-hun coming?

298
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,167
It has to do with Igu Group's regular
board meeting two days from now.

299
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,835
So what do you think?

300
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,171
Do you think Igu Group will invest?

301
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,506
It's hard to say
the board will pass the motion.

302
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,884
Those on the inside say it's fifty-fifty.

303
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,307
Who knew I'd worry about the outcome
of another company's board meeting?

304
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,685
Park Tae-jin…

305
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,523
Tell him to come out for dinner tonight.

306
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,277
PILO-DONG
HOUSING SITE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

307
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,448
Vice President Han Seong-hun
of Igu Electronics is here.

308
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,658
Send him in.

309
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,496
What more is there to say?
We just met a few days ago.

310
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,705
You could've just called.

311
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,337
-Are you coming from home?
-Where else would I be coming from?

312
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,422
I always take one day off a week.

313
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,591
So what did you want to talk about?

314
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,801
Have you lost your mind?

315
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,843
What?

316
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
There's a board meeting,
but you're slacking off at home?

317
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,972
Come on.

318
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,392
Even if I go to the board meeting,
it won't change the outcome.

319
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,978
If the motion is going to pass,
it'll pass even if I'm not there.

320
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,063
If not, then there's no point in trying.

321
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,482
-It won't pass anyway--
-Hey!

322
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,986
Go home right now,

323
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,363
change your clothes, and go to work.

324
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,616
Go there and do whatever you can.

325
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,660
Meet with those in favor
of a bio-industrial complex

326
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,328
and secure their votes.

327
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,039
If any of them are against it,
bribe them or threaten them.

328
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,750
Just make sure they pass the motion.

329
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,461
Hey, what's up with you?

330
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,381
-I already told you--
-Damn it, Seong-hun.

331
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,052
We have to put our necks on the line.

332
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,762
We have to show them

333
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,849
we're the future owners of our companies.

334
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,893
Every jerk around us
needs to see this happen, right?

335
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,355
I guess you're right.

336
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,607
I got it,

337
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,526
so calm down, and let's go have lunch--

338
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,361
I'm done talking to you, so leave.

339
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
Just go and…

340
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,785
Go and have lunch
with your board of directors.

341
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,247
Why are you flying off the handle
like that?

342
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,388
POLICE LINE
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

343
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,306
Are you saying

344
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,600
Jung Yun-ho was watching you
from over there?

345
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,980
But Jung Yun-ho didn't get a call
from Jun-seo that day.

346
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,982
Based on how he acted at the funeral,

347
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,817
I don't think he even came here.

348
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,110
That's the weird part.

349
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,281
At the funeral home, Won Jong-soo,
Park Tae-jin, and Oh Chi-hyeon

350
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,201
never mentioned coming to the site
on the day Jun-seo died.

351
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,410
Right.

352
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,704
So if Jung Yun-ho wasn't here that night,

353
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,332
why did he kill someone
to destroy that CCTV camera?

354
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,876
He wouldn't have been on it anyway.

355
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,379
Maybe the guys told him to do it.

356
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,965
Maybe they asked him
to destroy it just in case.

357
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,474
Yun-ho didn't come with a weapon on him.

358
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,061
He saw the CCTV camera
and killed the owner on an impulse.

359
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,450
What's with Jung Yun-ho?
Did he get arrested?

360
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,369
He got away for now.

361
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,829
But he'll get caught soon.

362
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,956
That damn idiot.

363
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,086
-Did you call him?
-His phone is turned off.

364
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,171
Just wait.

365
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,424
We're the only ones that can help him.
He'll call when he's in a safe place.

366
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,260
He may have called Si-jeong!

367
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,887
-Si-jeong is at the police station.
-What?

368
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,806
She's being investigated
for helping Yun-ho escape.

369
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,224
Was it Jang Jae-gyeong again?

370
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,275
Now what do we do?

371
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,653
We'll have to hide him for now

372
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,156
since we don't know
what proof Jang Jae-gyeong has yet.

373
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,407
Hey.

374
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,869
I just came from seeing
Vice President Han of Igu Electronics.

375
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,954
Their board meeting is in two days.

376
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,081
We're almost at the finish line,

377
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,209
but it'll be all over if we get caught up
in Jung Yun-ho's case, Tae-jin!

378
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,839
It's likely Yun-ho will contact you.

379
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,467
If he does,
tell him to go into hiding.

380
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,261
Okay.

381
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,763
The strange thing here

382
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:38,393
is how Jang Jae-gyeong identified Yun-ho
as the rice mill owner's killer.

383
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,062
I heard he suspected
a taxi driver from the start.

384
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,734
Do you think Jang Jae-gyeong,
had a copy of the footage this whole time?

385
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,445
Are you sure we're not in it?

386
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,573
Jae-gyeong already knew.

387
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:53,950
What?

388
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,244
He came to see me yesterday morning.

389
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,123
He knew we were all together

390
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,877
the night Jun-seo died
at the construction site.

391
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,337
So?

392
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,464
What did you tell him?

393
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,049
I told him the truth.

394
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,595
We went up on the elevator,
but Jun-seo jumped from the ninth floor.

395
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,805
Why are you just now
telling us this, you bastard?

396
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,433
You were preparing
for an important meeting.

397
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,911
Then what?
Did Jang Jae-gyeong believe you?

398
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,205
I couldn't figure him out.

399
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:44,125
But he tested me to see
if I had killed Jun-seo

400
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,461
on your orders, Jong-soo.

401
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,171
What?

402
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,757
So what did you say?

403
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,011
I told him that didn't happen
as far as I knew.

404
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,557
"As far as I knew"?

405
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,893
What made you guys

406
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,272
go to the construction site that night
without question?

407
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,358
What?

408
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,360
It was close to midnight.

409
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,030
You wouldn't come without question
just because Jun-seo asked you to.

410
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,617
Jong-soo…

411
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,203
It wasn't you, was it?

412
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,163
You bastard.

413
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,707
What are you saying?

414
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,917
Why would I kill Park Jun-seo?

415
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,127
In that case, what about you?

416
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,421
Why did you show up that night?

417
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,722
I killed Lee Myeong-guk.

418
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,274
You…

419
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,318
Why would you do that?

420
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,445
Did I ask you to kill Lee Myeong-guk?

421
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,654
No, I didn't!

422
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,031
Lee Myeong-guk

423
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,908
constantly threatened me about you.

424
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,786
He demanded 100,000 won per pill

425
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,371
for the natural drug component
he discovered.

426
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,372
If he didn't get it,

427
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,250
he said he'd go public

428
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,129
about you and Vice President Han
of Igu Group being drug addicts.

429
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,631
Sir!

430
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,261
Please get in.

431
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,888
Where are we going all of a sudden?

432
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,892
Let's be honest.
The amount you asked for is too much.

433
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,602
Just get in for now.

434
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,438
This isn't the right place for such talk.

435
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,482
I knew this would happen.

436
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,569
I knew you'd be suspicious,
so I came in a taxi.

437
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,989
Do you think I'd kidnap you with a taxi?

438
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,907
Get in, sir.

439
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,576
Come on. Just get in for now.

440
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,662
I was only going to scare him.

441
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,091
You bastard!

442
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,386
Bastard.

443
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,012
How dare you, you bastard?

444
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,139
Damn bastard.

445
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,990
Hey, push.

446
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,765
Are you telling me

447
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,351
you left Lee Myeong-guk's body

448
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,228
at Yeongryun Cold Storage?

449
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,814
Yes.

450
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,233
YEONGRYUN COLD STORAGE

451
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,861
Do you remember when we went
to Lee Myeong-guk's house?

452
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,281
We thought his body had been frozen

453
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,074
then buried somewhere recently

454
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,952
before someone dug up the body

455
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,121
and put it back at the house.

456
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,706
Did they leave

457
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,917
Lee Myeong-guk's body
frozen in here for seven months?

458
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,129
The moment we found the body at the house,

459
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,298
someone threw Molotov cocktails.

460
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,592
The person who did that was Yun-ho.

461
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,843
Yun-ho?

462
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,387
Why would Yun-ho do that?

463
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,641
Whoever moved Lee Myeong-guk's body
back into the house

464
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,477
probably told Yun-ho,

465
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,729
"You killed and buried Lee Myeong-guk,

466
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,774
but I dug him up
and put him back in his house."

467
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,651
So, Yun-ho killed Lee Myeong-guk too?

468
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,698
Yun-ho came to the house
to get rid of Lee Myeong-guk's body.

469
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:48,661
But there's no connection between
Jung Yun-ho killing the rice mill owner

470
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,996
and killing Lee Myeong-guk.

471
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,541
If you had to come
to Yeongryun Cold Storage

472
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,043
to pick up Lee Myeong-guk's body,

473
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,754
which street would you have taken?

474
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,467
These two streets

475
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,845
lead to the main road,

476
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,597
so probably this one.

477
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,557
To avoid the CCTV cameras on the road,

478
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,394
I'd go past the rice mill…

479
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,109
The CCTV camera.

480
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,323
The reason why Yun-ho
murdered the rice mill owner

481
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,158
and tried to destroy the CCTV camera

482
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,118
was because he thought

483
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,788
he got caught on
the rice mill's CCTV camera

484
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,416
on his way to Yeongryun Cold Storage
to pick up Lee Myeong-guk's body.

485
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,835
And it's likely

486
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,630
that Yun-ho wasn't
the only one in his taxi

487
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,342
when he drove by
in front of the rice mill.

488
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,886
When did you take him out
of Yeongryun Cold Storage?

489
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,847
Around 1:30 a.m. that day.

490
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,139
"That day"?

491
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,558
The day Jun-seo died.

492
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,645
Jun-seo called and said
if I didn't show up at 11:30 p.m.,

493
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,356
the police would find
Lee Myeong-guk's body

494
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,650
at Yeongryun Cold Storage
the next morning.

495
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,319
And that he'd tell them that we did it.

496
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,366
Does that mean Park Jun-seo had evidence?

497
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,742
He said he did.

498
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,079
That's why Yun-ho killed
the rice mill owner

499
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,790
and tried to destroy the CCTV camera

500
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,709
we got caught on.

501
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,253
Are you covering for him right now?

502
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,463
What about Lee Myeong-guk's body?

503
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,924
Who moved it back to his house?

504
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,759
I don't know.

505
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,136
Hey.

506
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,929
If you don't know, who does?

507
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,600
Who else knew that you and Yun-ho
were moving the body that morning?

508
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,768
No one.

509
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,438
No one else knows about that.

510
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,775
Stop saying that no one knows
and think about it.

511
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,985
Jang Jae-gyeong has been

512
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,529
prying into everything
since the body was found.

513
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,949
Don't make a mess in the first place,
or clean it up afterward.

514
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,702
I'm frustrated too!

515
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,706
If it's not one of us, then who is it?

516
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,291
Someone that day

517
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,794
followed you two.

518
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,006
That's how a buried body
was moved back to that house.

519
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,930
There were at least two people.

520
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,182
What?

521
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,351
Yun-ho and I were barely able to move it.

522
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,228
It's impossible to move it alone.

523
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,656
SAFE ANHYEON

524
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,204
You look better,
so the medicine must be working.

525
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,999
So should I get there by 7 p.m.?

526
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,543
Who do you think killed Park Jun-seo?

527
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,089
Based on what we know so far,

528
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,883
-I'd say Park Tae-jin.
-Why?

529
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,929
He went to the postmortem himself
and tried to stop the autopsy.

530
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,349
He's also having an affair
with Choi Ji-yeon.

531
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,852
Then did Park Tae-jin
get me addicted to drugs?

532
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,984
Park Jun-seo delivered
Won Jong-soo's drugs.

533
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,654
Then Jun-seo,
right before he was murdered,

534
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,948
sent me a tip about a drug deal
that included 1-8-8-2.

535
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,577
I was kidnapped the moment I got the tip
and got addicted to drugs.

536
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,454
So do you think

537
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,625
Won Jong-soo is
making lemon pop and selling it?

538
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,462
Right.

539
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,798
That's a possibility.

540
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,384
You're a Narcotics Unit detective,

541
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,095
and there's no way Jong-soo didn't know

542
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,347
you got a promotion
for good job performance.

543
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,267
If he made you an addict
and took you out of action,

544
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,855
he would've eliminated a big threat
to his lemon pop business.

545
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,816
The only thing is

546
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,318
after I became addicted,

547
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,196
he could've dumped me anywhere.

548
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,490
Instead, he had me moved
to the scene of the drug deal,

549
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,952
as if he wanted me
to catch the suspect. But why?

550
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,038
What if…

551
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,166
they're using you…

552
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,712
to get rid of Won Jong-soo?

553
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,299
What if they don't want
to get their hands dirty,

554
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,511
so they control you with drugs
to dismantle the lemon pop organization

555
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,222
and then corner and eliminate Won Jong-soo

556
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,101
who has been hiding behind all this?

557
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,273
No way.

558
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,480
Hello.

559
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,607
I started without you.

560
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,609
I'm sorry for being late.

561
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,529
A civil servant can't always be punctual.

562
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,322
-Take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,495
I'm sorry, sir.
I have to return to the office.

564
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,789
I see.

565
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,626
Okay.

566
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,173
The old woman who owned this place
passed away five years ago,

567
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,383
but the food tastes the same.

568
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,717
Goodness.

569
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,762
People's palates
are very fickle, you know.

570
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,766
It's amazing how the people who took over
managed to maintain the same good taste.

571
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,351
It's amazing, right?

572
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,769
Yes, sir. You're right.

573
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,689
Do you think Jong-soo

574
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,609
will follow in my footsteps and do well?

575
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,449
Why can't you answer me?

576
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,160
-Help yourself.
-Yes, sir.

577
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,916
The business plan looked good.

578
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,960
Thank you, sir.

579
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,919
But why are there

580
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,673
so many clauses attached
to the asset management company?

581
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,765
Igu Group will likely ask
for a loophole to withdraw funds,

582
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,475
-and KH Group will--
-And you?

583
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,150
Is that what you want in return
for designing this project?

584
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,947
To put in a loophole and steal funds
without Jong-soo or myself knowing?

585
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,288
I took care of you
and kept you close since you were young

586
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:52,210
because I thought you knew your place
and wouldn't cross any lines.

587
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,755
But now you keep crossing the line.

588
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,136
Sir, I'm confident I can do this.

589
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,055
I'll make sure this project succeeds.

590
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,806
Please trust me one more time.

591
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,727
Why are you doing this?

592
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,980
Twenty years ago,

593
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,775
when Anhyeon New City was being developed,

594
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,194
my father couldn't seize that opportunity.

595
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:22,657
He sold off his cows one by one
and lived off his meager land compensation

596
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,952
until he passed away as a nobody.

597
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,455
I don't want to end up like my father.

598
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,999
I'll take advantage of this opportunity

599
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,628
and use it as a stepping-stone to dedicate
myself to making Jong-soo the richest man.

600
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,005
Please let me be part of this project.

601
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,468
You're merely
a deputy prosecutor at the DPO.

602
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,804
I have other people I can call.

603
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,807
Chief prosecutors, Supreme Court justices,
cabinet ministers, national assemblymen…

604
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,101
I can call them
to make the impossible possible

605
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,894
and prevent a crisis from occurring.

606
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,606
If I'd wanted to waste you like that,

607
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,277
why would I have kept you
by Jong-soo's side all this time?

608
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:06,325
If you want to keep your promise
of making Jong-soo the richest man,

609
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,745
stay at the prosecutors' office
and don't take part in this project.

610
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,041
Continue fulfilling your duty as before.

611
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,253
It's better if you just do your job.

612
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,754
But…

613
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,673
You and I are in the same boat, sir.

614
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,721
Now I know

615
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,226
exactly what you're thinking.

616
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,899
You don't think you can be replaced,

617
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:40,860
do you?

618
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,614
You've been by my side and Jong-soo's
through thick and thin for over 20 years,

619
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:50,369
and we listened to your advice
when making important company decisions.

620
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,080
So what?

621
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,541
Do you think that makes you family?

622
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,460
That's not it, sir.

623
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:01,547
The moment you fail your duty,
you'll become nothing to me.

624
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,261
I expect you to continue your role
in a quiet…

625
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,184
and inconspicuous manner.

626
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,440
Hello.

627
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,443
I reserved an ice cream cake
under the name "Heo Joo-song."

628
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,236
How long will it take to get there?

629
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,571
About an hour.

630
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,532
Here you go, sir.

631
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,992
-Did you include the candles?
-Yes.

632
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,619
Thank you.

633
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,621
Thank you. Goodbye.

634
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,462
Yes, hello?

635
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,039
Hey, you're here early.

636
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,292
I had to prepare something.

637
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,376
What's that?

638
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,545
Seriously? It's Yun-jin's birthday today.

639
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,672
I can't wait to surprise her.

640
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,055
The candles won't go in
because the cake is too frozen.

641
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,058
Your balcony is cold, right?

642
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,603
I'll hide this out there
and bring it in later.

643
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,105
Help me out later with the lights, okay?

644
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,648
It'll be all up to you.

645
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,237
It's Yun-jin.

646
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,906
Why is she here so early?

647
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,240
Hold on.

648
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,035
I'll go hide outside on the balcony.

649
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,370
Give me a second.

650
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,830
Don't open the door yet!

651
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,165
Hold on!

652
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,792
Don't forget, okay?

653
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,924
Hey, there you are.

654
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,676
Yes.

655
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,348
One sec.

656
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,437
So? Did Choi Ji-yeon…

657
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,563
Wait, no.

658
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,358
Did Fairy come out?

659
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,319
Yes, and she's wearing full makeup again.

660
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,071
Damn it, those two…

661
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,781
Follow her.

662
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,576
Ms. Oh, can we please stop now?

663
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,954
All I do is follow people going to motels.

664
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,874
I'm starting to feel ashamed of myself

665
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,126
and wonder why
I signed up to be a reporter.

666
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,671
It's almost over. Just hang in there.

667
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,715
We need to find out the password
Park Tae-jin is looking for.

668
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,801
What if they go straight into the motel?

669
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,803
You can just leave then.

670
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,556
Hey.

671
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,267
I know we'll get somewhere today.

672
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,977
Things are shaping up that way.

673
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:49,858
If Park Tae-jin is getting desperate,
there's a chance he'll open up today.

674
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,903
That doesn't mean Fairy
will say the password out loud.

675
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,906
You're underestimating Park Tae-jin.

676
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,201
He'll do anything to get Choi Ji-yeon
to give him the password.

677
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,829
Even if we don't get the password,

678
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,873
there's a chance
Park Tae-jin will talk about

679
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,334
what kind of account it is
and how much is in it.

680
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,962
So stop complaining and record them.

681
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:10,921
Okay?

682
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,631
Got it.

683
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,092
Text me when they meet up.

684
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,940
What's going on?

685
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,775
Are you done with your call?

686
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,693
Yes.

687
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,486
Where were you?

688
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,988
I just got here.

689
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,656
Don't lie.

690
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,284
I saw your shoes and jacket
when I came in.

691
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,037
I was in the bathroom. My stomach hurts.

692
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,000
The bathroom? Okay.

693
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,918
Did you read Lee Myeong-guk's work logs?

694
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,003
-Of course.
-Of course.

695
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,021
You can read it again,
but you won't find much.

696
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,274
It's just basic
who-did-what-where information.

697
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,235
Right, so did you find
a phone or anything like that?

698
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,031
Yun-jin.

699
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,075
What does this Chinese character mean?

700
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,161
Shouldn't the head of a company know this?

701
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,998
It's "pil." It means "must."

702
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,625
It's pil, right?

703
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,919
That's what I thought,
but he scribbled it.

704
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,339
-Let's see.
-Hold on.

705
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,509
Look at this.

706
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,637
It's here too.

707
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,972
Hey, it's the same character.

708
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,766
MAY 18TH, 2023
7 A.M. LAB PIL

709
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,066
It's here too.

710
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,402
It says 9 p.m.

711
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,736
Did he work late that night?

712
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,323
So he was at the lab

713
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,575
either at 7 a.m. or at 9:30 p.m.

714
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,202
It says "pil" and "discuss."

715
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,580
Maybe it means "must discuss something"?

716
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,709
Jung Sang-ui.

717
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,294
What?

718
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,214
I think the word for "discuss"
refers to Sang-ui.

719
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,092
Jung Sang-ui worked
directly under Lee Myeong-guk

720
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,844
at KH Pharmaceutical.

721
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,513
What? Why didn't you tell me that before?

722
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,098
I'm telling you right now.

723
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,808
You didn't know? I did.

724
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,602
Hey, how am I supposed to know
about Jung Sang-ui?

725
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,355
Jeez, then what does all this mean?

726
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,692
"Whether it's at 7 a.m. or 9:30 p.m.,

727
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:40,529
I must meet with Sang-ui
for a meeting at the lab."

728
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,532
But are there meetings
where you don't necessarily meet?

729
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,077
Wait, do you think…

730
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,997
Hold on.

731
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,124
CHINESE CHARACTERS
FOR "PILO-DONG"

732
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,041
This is it.

733
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,669
Pil is also used in "Pilo-dong."

734
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:58,213
-Pilo-dong.
-Research lab. Pilo-dong.

735
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,257
And Jung Sang-ui. What does this mean?

736
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,968
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

737
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,887
I checked on my way here.

738
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,389
KH Pharmaceutical
owns Yeongryun Cold Storage.

739
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,352
But there were no offices there.
I didn't see anything when we were there.

740
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,564
We'll soon get a warrant
for search and seizure.

741
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,066
Okay. I'm coming with you.

742
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,695
16:00 REPORT TO CEO (OFFICE)
21:00 LAB PIL (DISCUSS)

743
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,713
Is this everything?

744
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,631
Yes.

745
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,591
They left right afterward.

746
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,303
Okay, thank you.

747
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,971
I'm going home now.

748
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,389
Yes, sir. Have a good night.

749
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,736
Why are they just
talking in the car today?

750
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,781
Go to a motel or something already.

751
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,449
I'm starving.

752
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,252
Who's that?

753
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,480
I have to take this call. Be right back.

754
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,363
The cake will melt.

755
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,157
Oh, right. Thanks.

756
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,993
What happened?

757
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,996
They didn't go anywhere
and just talked in the car today.

758
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,832
But Fairy just left
and is going somewhere.

759
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,250
By herself?

760
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,543
Yes.

761
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,502
Did they have a fight?

762
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,879
I was in the car, so I have no idea.

763
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:07,759
But the direction I'm heading in
is the complete opposite of Fairy's house.

764
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,886
Which direction is it?

765
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,555
Hold on.

766
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,181
Why? What is it?

767
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,975
She just entered an apartment complex.

768
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,394
Which apartment? Park Tae-jin's apartment?

769
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,646
I can't see, so I'm not sure.

770
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,399
That can't be it.

771
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,067
Park Tae-jin is married and has kids.

772
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,947
Maybe there's nobody home tonight.

773
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
Jeez.

774
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,077
These two have gotten bold.

775
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,925
She's at the apartment building entrance.

776
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,761
Is Park Tae-jin not there yet?

777
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,014
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.

778
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,975
-Follow her inside.
-I'll get caught!

779
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,728
You can at least check
the building and unit number!

780
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,521
Just a minute.

781
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,857
She's not on the first floor.

782
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,776
How many floors are there in total?

783
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,569
Three floors.

784
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,404
Just a second.

785
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,990
She's going to the second floor.

786
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,450
What?

787
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,036
What's the name of the complex?

788
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,122
Taegyeong Apartments.

789
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,792
Taegyeong Apartments,
Building 306, second floor.

790
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,354
-Hello.
-Hello.

791
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,563
Come in.

792
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,077
KEEP AN EYE ON FAIRY
TAKE PHOTOS AND RECORDINGS

793
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,286
What's going on?

794
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,541
Stand by.

795
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,501
TAEGYEONG APARTMENTS
BUILDING 306, UNIT 202

796
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,588
TAEGYEONG APARTMENTS

797
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:12,694
How did you know to come here?

798
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,497
I was wondering how to give this to you.

799
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,499
Then I heard you had a meeting today.

800
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,422
I don't know if this will help.

801
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,175
Oh, you got the results
for Safe Inheritance One-stop Service.

802
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,553
You could've just told us over the phone.

803
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,307
Jun-seo's account information

804
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,100
and insurance policies…

805
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,060
Account information?

806
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,979
I already knew most of this,
but there's one strange thing.

807
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,189
What is it?

808
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,192
One of the insurance policies listed here

809
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,945
includes a retirement annuity
he signed up for 11 years ago.

810
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,531
He took out this policy
before we got married,

811
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,032
but I had no idea about it.

812
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,160
When I asked the insurance company,

813
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,997
I found out an old woman in Boryeong
was receiving the pension payments.

814
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,374
In Boryeong, South Chungcheong?

815
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,418
Yes, but my husband and I
have no ties there.

816
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,753
Did you go there?

817
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,171
Not yet.

818
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,506
What about the address?

819
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,216
Have you looked into it?

820
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,342
Yes.

821
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,177
Can you tell me what it is?

822
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,059
Oh, well…

823
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,937
I thought you came to help us.

824
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,190
Let's go together.

825
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,317
All of us.

826
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,111
All of us?

827
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,243
Jun-seo's case

828
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,204
is still being investigated by the police.

829
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,165
The KCSI autopsy results
haven't come out either.

830
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,043
I know you're curious about
evidence that could reveal

831
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,463
Jun-seo's cause of death,
but let's have the police handle it.

832
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,174
If that's why you came,
it's a good thing you did.

833
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,305
I already told Mr. Heo about this,

834
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,099
but the life insurance benefits

835
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,518
that my husband left to you two

836
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,313
was just bait to help
uncover who killed him.

837
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,858
Bait?

838
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,778
Did you just say bait?

839
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,616
Where are you going?

840
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,618
You heard her.

841
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,494
She already told me about this.

842
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,415
Since I know what this is about,
you two should discuss it.

843
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,130
So?

844
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,507
If the payout is five billion won,

845
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,303
the premiums must have been substantial,
so where did that money come from?

846
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,680
My husband and I likely paid for it.

847
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,477
-So what?
-So…

848
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,438
that five billion won…

849
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,651
is mine as far as I'm concerned.

850
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,985
Wait a minute.

851
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,280
What kind of crap is that?

852
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,198
Yun-jin.

853
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,532
Look.

854
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,994
The payout belongs to the beneficiaries.
It doesn't matter who paid the premiums.

855
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,872
And if you think it's yours, just say it.

856
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,958
Why say, "as far as I'm concerned"?

857
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,001
I can't believe this.

858
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,920
He excluded all of his close friends,

859
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,589
and me, his only family member,

860
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,551
and left the payout to two people
whom he didn't keep in touch with.

861
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,679
You said yourself it was strange.

862
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,807
Have you no shame?

863
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,393
-What did you just say?
-Yun-jin.

864
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,531
Ms. Choi.

865
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,618
I'm a few years older than you,
so I'll drop the formalities.

866
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,247
I can tolerate everything else,

867
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:56,126
but I can't stand how the word "shame"
is coming out of your mouth.

868
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,422
What did you say?

869
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,508
You have no right to say I have no shame!

870
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,498
If you want to keep your promise

871
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,333
of making Jong-soo the richest man,

872
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,754
stay at the prosecutors' office
and don't take part in this project.

873
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,756
It's better if you just do your job.

874
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,846
The moment you fail your duty,

875
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,765
you'll become nothing to me.

876
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,350
I expect you to continue your role

877
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:58,313
in a quiet
and inconspicuous manner.

878
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:05,028
I'm afraid a day will come
when I will no longer think of you at all…

879
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,656
as my son's friend.

880
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,041
How can we go to Jeju Island
if you're so busy?

881
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:19,876
THE DAY OF PARK JUN-SEO'S DEATH

882
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,127
I already reserved everything.

883
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,129
Don't worry. I can go.

884
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,050
Doesn't your wife complain?

885
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,427
You go out every weekend.

886
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:31,971
What?

887
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,557
Oh, right.

888
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,902
PARK JUN-SEO

889
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,955
-Hey, Jun-seo. What--
-Are you with Ji-yeon?

890
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,630
At 11:30 p.m., come to the Pilo-dong
three-way intersection construction site.

891
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,009
Come through the back alley,
and you'll see an open entrance.

892
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,679
A construction site?

893
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,764
At this hour? Why?

894
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:17,892
Tae-jin.

895
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,561
I can't do this anymore.

896
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,522
I'm going to tell the others

897
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,651
-what we've done so far.
-Jun-seo.

898
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,945
I said I'd stop
after making 500 million won.

899
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,781
But you didn't listen to me.

900
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,616
And my daughter…

901
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,411
She ended up dying.

902
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,912
Now on top of that…

903
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,165
Jun-seo.

904
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:44,043
Let's not talk today.
Let's meet up separately.

905
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,962
-You're too emotional--
-No.

906
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,799
I'm more clearheaded now than ever.

907
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,178
I can see everything clearly now.

908
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,806
I'm scared too.

909
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,017
However,

910
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,646
if there's anything I can do
to set things right even now…

911
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,317
I have to do it.

912
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,487
-Jun-seo--
-When you come,

913
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,489
you'll learn new things

914
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,699
about the others.

915
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,910
See you later.

916
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,286
Park Jun-seo…

917
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,075
Yes?

918
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,540
Hello?

919
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,250
Tae-jin.

920
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,251
It's Yun-ho.

921
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,961
What is it? Where are you?

922
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,631
I'm still in Anhyeon City.

923
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,175
Why are you calling me? Hang up now.

924
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,677
I'm using a pay phone.

925
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,345
Tae-jin.

926
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,390
Please help me.

927
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,934
I can't help you if you call me like this.

928
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,478
I have nothing to say, so don't call me.

929
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,729
Jun-seo's wife.

930
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,857
Did Jun-seo know?

931
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,359
That she and you

932
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,779
-are doing it?
-What?

933
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,156
You met her today too.

934
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,492
What would Jong-soo say if he found out?

935
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,952
Oh, wait.

936
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,496
"Is this why you killed Jun-seo?"

937
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,914
Maybe that's what he'll say.

938
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,499
-Are you insane?
-Yes.

939
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,085
I'm insane. So what?

940
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,297
This is why you need to help me!

941
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,966
You can do that, right?

942
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,417
Can I leave the work logs here?

943
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,711
I'm leaving.

944
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,381
Yun-jin!

945
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,137
Happy birthday

946
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,431
To you

947
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:46,851
Happy birthday to you

948
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:51,773
-Happy birthday, dear Yun-jin
-Happy birthday, dear Yun-jin

949
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,569
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

950
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,991
What are you doing?

951
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,326
I'm sorry.

952
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,163
I didn't know things
would turn out this way, but…

953
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,832
But how could I just skip your birthday?

954
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,752
It's all melting.

955
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:17,173
Hurry and blow out the candles,
make a wish, eat some cake,

956
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,217
and cheer up before you go.

957
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,302
Satisfied?

958
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,274
Is today…

959
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,444
your birthday, Ms. Oh?

960
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,613
Yes.

961
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,596
Ms. Choi, what's wrong?

962
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,473
Are you okay?

963
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,809
Are you okay in there?

964
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,103
What's going on?

965
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,938
Ms. Choi.

966
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,565
Ms. Choi?

967
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,401
Does she have indigestion?

968
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,255
Please enter a four-digit password.

969
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,173
8 YEARS AGO

970
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,257
What should it be?

971
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,639
What's this number?

972
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,892
It's nothing.
I've used it for a long time.

973
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,059
-Really?
-Yes.

974
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,353
Shall we use this number from now on?

975
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,522
-Okay.
-Okay.

976
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,764
Are you okay?

977
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,073
Jeez.

978
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,497
-I'm leaving too.
-Already?

979
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,499
I blew the candles out.

980
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,292
And the cake melted.

981
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,630
This is the man who's been following
Park Tae-jin and Choi Ji-yeon for a while.

982
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,840
Something's off about him.

983
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,764
Isn't that Jung Yun-ho?

984
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:14,058
Jae-gyeong.

985
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:18,062
This is in front of my house.

986
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,566
Jae-gyeong!

987
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:25,611
Damn it.

988
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,683
Jung Yun-ho!

989
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,915
YOU'RE DOING WELL

990
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,833
REMEMBER NOT TO TAKE
MORE THAN TWO AT A TIME

991
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,274
The money won't matter to me
after this weekend.

992
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,194
-Oh Yun-jin.
-Whoever opens the box gets to keep it.

993
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,488
If someone had killed Jun-seo

994
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,114
and made it look like a suicide…

995
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,741
You're the only one who comes to mind.

996
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,327
Wait, it's Gong Jin-uk!
He gave out the orders.

997
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,121
Detective, take them away quietly.

998
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,206
Kim Chang-su!

999
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,290
What are you doing here?

1000
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,417
What's wrong with cops these days?

1001
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,252
One guy is an addict…

1002
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,212
Shut your mouth!

1003
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,171
They're both dead.

1004
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,215
The only one left is you, the user.

1005
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,592
Isn't the answer obvious then?
Did you tell them to kill both men?

1006
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,802
-Hey!
-Am I wrong?

1007
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,428
I killed Lee Myeong-guk.

1008
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,973
And I killed Park Jun-seo too.

1009
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:25,898
