1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,225
Lee Myeong-guk
regularly met with Jung Sang-ui

3
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,061
at the Pilo-dong lab and did something.

4
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,271
Are you saying they were making lemon pop?

5
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,232
At first, they probably made
small batches just for Jong-soo.

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,777
Lee Myeong-guk made it,
Park Jun-seo delivered it,

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,986
and Won Jong-soo took it?

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,197
Jun-seo isn't here anymore,

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,449
so who's delivering Won Jong-soo's drugs,

10
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,161
and who's running the lemon pop business
in Park Tae-jin's place?

11
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,206
Doctor, it's me. I killed CEO Yoon today.

12
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,166
Please get me on a ship to China.

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,793
I'm not asking for free passage.

14
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,212
I'm sending you two items
through a subway courier.

15
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,672
I trust you'll find those items
worth your while.

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,634
JUNG SANG-UI WAS DOCTOR

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,511
You're Doctor?

18
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,887
If you're curious, put your seat belt on.

19
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,849
SANG-UI TAKES THE TWO DEEP
INSIDE YEONGRYUN COLD STORAGE

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,309
AND SHOWS THEM THE LEMON POP LAB

21
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,727
I'm the one who made lemon pop.

22
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,479
I'm the one who got you
addicted to lemon pop.

23
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,024
What did I do to deserve
becoming an addict?

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,527
I thought since you were
so good at your job,

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,821
you could get revenge on Jun-seo's behalf.

26
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,031
You were supposed to catch Gong Jin-uk,
use him to get to CEO Yoon,

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,784
then find me, Doctor,
and finally Park Tae-jin.

28
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,994
That was my plan. With No Gyu-min.

29
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,330
The taxi driver who took Jun-seo
to the construction site?

30
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,165
Ask him yourself. You'll meet him soon.

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,750
Manpyeong Port at 4:00 a.m.
two days from now.

32
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,335
You can stop by Boryeong on the way.

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,795
The old lady receiving the pension?

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,131
-Let's do it.
-Yes, sir. Thank you.

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,508
Didn't I tell you it'd turn out fine?

36
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,926
You did well.

37
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,389
For the future chairman of KH Group,
there's no need for that now.

38
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,602
How can a drug-dealing punk
plan a future for KH Group?

39
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,398
The biggest risk factor in this project
isn't Mayor Joo or Jong-soo.

40
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,275
It's you.

41
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,359
This is the police.

42
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,528
THE POLICE WERE AFTER YUN-HO

43
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,575
The police have already identified
Jung Yun-ho as the murder suspect

44
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,826
of Lee Myeong-guk and the rice mill owner.

45
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,495
If the police keep looking into this,
all of you will get suspected.

46
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,331
Jung Yun-ho. We can't leave him like this.

47
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,541
A RECORDING OF TAE-JIN
PLOTTING HIS MURDER

48
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,710
HE SOON RECEIVES A TEXT

49
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,211
YUN-HO IMMEDIATELY
GOES TO JI-YEON

50
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,297
I was told there was evidence
proving you and Tae-jin

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,590
killed Jun-seo.

52
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,133
What are you talking about?

53
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,177
AT THAT MOMENT,
JAE-GYEONG AND THE POLICE ARRIVE

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,722
Jung Yun-ho took the emergency stairs.
Requesting precinct backup.

55
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,931
Jong-soo, please help me.

56
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,266
You need to scare Tae-jin.

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,934
What if I tell you that I can't do that?

58
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,980
I'll have to tell the world
how you ordered me to kill Lee Myeong-guk

59
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,608
when he started threatening you.

60
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,735
I heard what you said,
so let's talk in person.

61
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,236
Jong-soo--

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
BUT IT WAS A TRAP
SET BY JONG-SOO

63
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,158
Chi-hyeon!
Hey, Chi-hyeon. Don't do this.

64
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,144
What took you so long?
Where are the drugs?

65
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,209
Is it Jung Yun-ho?

66
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,169
Yes.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,380
Who called it in?

68
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,133
He didn't want to identify himself,
so he only gave the location of the body.

69
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,053
The voice belonged to someone
in his 50s or 60s.

70
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,472
-Did you trace the call?
-It came from a pay phone.

71
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,808
In this case,

72
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,810
he likely witnessed
the body getting buried.

73
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,437
He might've also seen the killer's face.

74
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,981
Check all the CCTV cameras in this area.

75
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,232
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:41,030
This isn't even a hiking trail,
so what was the witness doing here?

77
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,366
There's a shoe here!

78
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,388
Compare this shoe to the shoeprint
left at the rice mill murder scene.

79
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,472
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,311
What's that?

81
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,984
Isn't this how you collect mono maple sap?

82
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,071
This must be why the witness was here.

83
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,768
The biggest risk factor in this project
isn't Mayor Joo or Jong-soo.

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,936
It's you.

85
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,397
I took in the only son of a man

86
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,903
who couldn't even afford to buy feed
for the ten cows he raised.

87
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,448
I poured a lot of money into you
to make something out of you.

88
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,826
You really are something, aren't you?

89
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,414
WON JONG-SOO

90
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,507
Hey, Jong-soo.

91
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,175
Where are you?

92
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,344
I'm working out. Why?

93
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,721
You want to live long, don't you?

94
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,641
We should celebrate today with a drink.

95
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,393
I thought you were with Han Seong-hun.

96
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm not in the mood to celebrate with him.

97
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,148
Come to Pilo-dong.

98
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,319
I'll have to take a pass.
See you tomorrow.

99
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,403
Tae-jin.

100
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,824
Just come over.
I have something to tell you.

101
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,786
Okay. I'll be there.

102
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,346
Who do you think killed Jung Yun-ho?

103
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,641
It could be anyone at this point.

104
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,936
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin, Oh Chi-hyeonâ€¦

105
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,773
What's wrong with all your friends?

106
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,110
But I suppose

107
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,737
I'm not in a position to criticize you.

108
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,366
What should we do with Chang-su?

109
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,701
Let's look into him discreetly.

110
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
-Who?
-Have Su-hyeon do it.

111
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,581
Will that be okay?

112
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,499
Chang-su and Su-hyeon are close.

113
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,002
It'll be fine. She knows
how to maintain professional distance.

114
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,464
What about tomorrow's trip
to Manpyeong Port?

115
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,215
Will you take Chang-su?

116
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,303
The plan is for one of us
to stow away with Gong Jin-uk.

117
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,891
We need someone to go undercover
who Gong Jin-uk doesn't know.

118
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,142
Let's take him.

119
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,603
I just have a bad feeling

120
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,314
because I don't know what he's thinking.

121
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,107
We don't know anything for sure yet.

122
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,297
Hey.

123
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,553
What's going on?

124
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,810
You sold drugs behind my back?

125
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,979
You bastard.

126
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,237
I had no idea you had
such tricks up your sleeve.

127
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,365
Make him kneel.

128
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,497
I heard these lemon-yellow pills
were all the rage,

129
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,624
so I've been wanting to try them.

130
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,920
But it turns out
KH Pharmaceutical made them.

131
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,257
That bastard over there says

132
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,551
the main component's
the same as the pills I take.

133
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,845
Were you going to

134
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,848
give up the location
of the factory if you got caught

135
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,601
and save your own skin, you bastard?

136
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,814
We should've killed this punk
instead of Jung Yun-ho.

137
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,193
I thought

138
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,654
that since you came from a poor family,

139
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,825
you'd have a sense of justice
that I don't have.

140
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,495
But look at you.

141
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,708
What's in that head of yours
that made you pull something like this?

142
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,168
Hey.

143
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,295
Why do you think

144
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,463
I've done everything

145
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,675
that you told me to do

146
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,552
without any complaint?

147
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,096
Because we're friends?

148
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,224
You know better than I do that isn't true.

149
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,437
So?

150
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,230
Hey.

151
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,940
Other than the fact

152
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,403
you're the heir to KH Group,
you're nothing.

153
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,947
If it hadn't been for your father,

154
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,284
I would've made sure
a stupid, greedy bastard like you

155
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,287
would be too scared to look me in the eye.

156
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,252
Hey, Oh Chi-hyeon.
What are you doing here?

157
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,421
You were the biggest thug in Anhyeon City.

158
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,798
Why are you working for a punk like him?

159
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,717
Because you're best friends?

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,594
You're doing it for the money, right?

161
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,062
It hurts, right?

162
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,980
Does it hurt?

163
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,608
They say you can't breathe
if you get hit right here.

164
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,110
So does it hurt, you bastard?

165
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,862
I'll kill you.

166
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,365
So tell me.

167
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,117
Does it feel good to get this
off your chest after 20 years?

168
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,202
Tae-jin.

169
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,538
How does that
change anything, you bastard?

170
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,583
It changes nothing.

171
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
Does it change

172
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,587
how you sold drugs behind my back
or the fact that I'm rich?

173
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,632
Where's the money?

174
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,675
Where's the money you made
selling my drugs?

175
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,013
Zero, six, one, seven.

176
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,349
What?

177
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,434
Zero, six, one, seven.

178
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
Those are the first four digits
of the password.

179
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,482
I don't know the last four digits.

180
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,566
Why?

181
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,655
Because Park Jun-seo
didn't tell anyone before he died.

182
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,742
What are you saying, you bastard?
Tell me the truth!

183
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,035
That money?

184
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,830
Nobody can access it.

185
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,084
Unless Park Jun-seo comes back alive,
nobody will ever access it!

186
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,545
Do you understand?

187
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,342
Hey!

188
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,553
Is that bastard telling the truth?

189
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,764
Park Jun-seo was the only one
who knew the last four digits?

190
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,484
You and Jun-seo tried to be equals
out of friendship or whatever

191
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,027
and made a damn mess of things.

192
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,030
This is why people
need to know their place!

193
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,076
Why the hell would you split the password?

194
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,244
You damn idiots.

195
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,540
Are you laughing?

196
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,293
Jong-soo.

197
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,129
Whoâ€¦

198
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,882
do you think pushed him?

199
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,055
Go get the drugs.

200
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,390
What?

201
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,350
Those drugs you sold.

202
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,394
You sold them without knowing
what they could do to you.

203
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,939
You should've tested them
before selling them, you bastard.

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,941
Go get it right now!

205
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,487
Jong-soo, what are you going to do?

206
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,322
You're going to record him taking drugs.

207
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,741
You'll record his eyes
rolling back in his head

208
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,327
and how he crawls on all fours
begging for more drugs.

209
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,121
Then he won't try anything stupid again.

210
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,876
I said go get it.

211
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,922
Damn it.

212
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,012
The same goes for you.

213
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,517
You should've told me
about this from the start.

214
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,978
Why did you try to impress him
when I'm the one who pays you?

215
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,149
Let's have you sample
the drug you made too.

216
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,993
Hey, Tae-jin.

217
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,495
Just so you know,

218
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,832
if it hadn't been for my old man,
I wouldn't have befriended you either.

219
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,254
I hate smart guys like you

220
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,339
who are full of themselves.

221
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,718
"What did Tae-jin say?"

222
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,137
"Do as Tae-jin says."

223
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,764
"Be more like Tae-jin."

224
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,226
I was sick of it too.

225
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,562
But you know what?

226
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,605
I still tried

227
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,150
to get along with you no matter what.

228
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,780
It sometimes made me feel good

229
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,658
knowing I could order around

230
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,870
someone as smart as you.

231
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,540
But the last straw for me

232
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,334
was when you tried to become me.

233
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,339
Won Chang-ho has
only one son, and that's me!

234
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,262
That's why you ended up like this today.

235
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,017
It's in the classroom creed
that my father created.

236
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,439
"We will always fulfill our duties."

237
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,150
Did you forget that?

238
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,342
Jong-soo.

239
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
Jong-soo.

240
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,097
Jong-soo!

241
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,323
So what happens now?

242
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
They're all going down.

243
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,124
What about me?

244
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,753
You'll have to take me down, too,
if you want to be safe.

245
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,366
Give me your phone.

246
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,413
Hand it over.

247
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,407
Sang-ui.

248
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,576
I'll give you 12 hours.

249
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,080
If you have any photos or recordings,
destroy them and leave the country.

250
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,958
I'll call you when it's all over.

251
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,588
This isn't a threat.
It's your last chance.

252
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,182
Joo-song.

253
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,439
What is it? What's going on?

254
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,982
Youâ€¦

255
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,193
What?

256
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,653
Get in the car for now.

257
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,880
How could you hide that from me?

258
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,674
Why couldn't you trust me?

259
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,802
Hey.

260
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,263
It wasn't a matter of trust.

261
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,681
Would you say,

262
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:25,771
"Hey, I'm addicted to drugs.
Can you help me?"

263
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,274
I told you I found out by accident.

264
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,985
Still, you should've
told me from the start

265
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,446
so that we could find a solution together.

266
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,782
After all, that's what friends are for!

267
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,540
Thenâ€¦

268
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,544
Do you still have drug cravings and such?

269
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,046
No.

270
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,676
Then do you know
when you get hit with withdrawal symptoms?

271
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,512
It's not like the symptoms
call ahead and say they're coming.

272
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,680
Oh, I see.

273
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,015
Hey, do you want me to drive?

274
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,310
No, it's okay.
I'll let you know if I get tired.

275
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,082
Is anyone home?

276
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,964
Is anyone home?

277
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,426
They're not here.

278
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,595
Nobody's home.

279
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,361
Are you Ms. Yoon Seong-mi?

280
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,116
Yes.

281
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,659
Detective Jang Jae-gyeong.

282
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,997
Reporter Oh Yun-jin.

283
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,629
I'm Heo Joo-song.

284
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,755
Yes, hello.

285
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,425
My name is No Gyu-min.

286
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,971
Can you tell me who drove 35A 0233

287
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,474
on February 23rd?

288
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,226
It was Mr. No Gyu-min.

289
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,729
Are you the taxi driver
who dropped off Jun-seo

290
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,564
at the construction site?

291
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,275
Yes, that's right.

292
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,324
Are you Chae Gyeong-tae's mother?

293
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,204
I told her about what happened to Jun-seo.

294
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,082
Did Jun-seo come here often?

295
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:51,708
Wellâ€¦

296
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,419
He came once every couple of months.

297
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,673
Mr. No, how did you know
Gyeong-tae and Jun-seo?

298
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,260
I was close with Gyeong-tae.

299
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,136
Give me a lighter.

300
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,514
Here.

301
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,476
I met Jun-seo

302
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,687
after Gyeong-tae died.

303
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,355
Where?

304
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,482
Jun-seoâ€¦

305
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,567
Jun-seo came to see me.

306
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,989
It was over ten years ago.

307
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,284
I don't know how he found me.

308
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,286
Ma'am.

309
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,370
Youâ€¦

310
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,081
Aren't you

311
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,208
Gyeong-tae's friend?

312
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,504
Yes.

313
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,347
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,395
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,939
-He saidâ€¦
-It's okay.

316
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,900
He said he should've
prevented Gyeong-tae's death.

317
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,570
-I'm so sorry.
-But he couldn't.

318
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,823
So he stood there
and cried for a long time.

319
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,715
You must be hungry.
Let me bring you something to eat.

320
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,258
-No, ma'am.
-Please don't.

321
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,595
No, it's okay.
I'm feeling a bit hungry myself.

322
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,929
It's really okay, though.

323
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,100
Did Jun-seo say

324
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,271
anything else in the taxi
on the way to the construction site?

325
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,815
No, nothing.

326
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,193
Butâ€¦

327
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,621
He told me to give this to you and Ms. Oh
if you ever came here.

328
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,040
What's

329
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
on this?

330
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,639
This was a while back,

331
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,849
but some man came

332
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,519
and asked to see
the footage just like you.

333
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,021
He asked if he could make a copy of it.

334
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
So I told him to go ahead.

335
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,775
Jun-seo already knew

336
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,027
Oh Chi-hyeon and Jung Yun-ho
had killed Lee Myeong-guk.

337
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,904
That's why Sang-uiâ€¦

338
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,782
Lee Myeong-guk's body.

339
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,742
His body?

340
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,661
You're the one who moved it
back into his house?

341
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,913
All by yourself?

342
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,082
With No Gyu-min.

343
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,169
Did you move Lee Myeong-guk's body
with Jung Sang-ui?

344
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,384
I see you met with Sang-ui.

345
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,468
But how did you know

346
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,929
they were going to move
Lee Myeong-guk's body

347
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,389
out of Yeongryun Cold Storage?

348
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,685
Sang-ui said he heard
Jun-seo talk about it.

349
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,230
So we waited.

350
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,190
It was past 1 a.mâ€¦

351
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,525
THE DAY OF PARK JUN-SEO'S DEATH

â€¦when he said Jun-seo died
at the construction site

353
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,156
and asked me to return to the site.

354
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,160
I met up with Sang-ui there and waited.

355
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,830
Soon after, Jung Yun-ho's taxi
came out of the rice mill alley.

356
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,416
We saw it drive into
the Yeongryun Cold Storage alley.

357
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,710
When we got there,
Oh Chi-hyeon and Jung Yun-ho

358
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
had brought out Lee Myeong-guk's body.

359
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,842
So we followed them.

360
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh Chi-hyeon was there too?

361
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,345
Yes.

362
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,274
What do you think you're doing?

363
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,694
We have a search and seizure warrant
for Yeongryun Cold Storage.

364
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,362
Let's go in.

365
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,908
YEONGRYUN COLD STORAGE

366
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,420
There is a door leading to the basement
in the back of this room.

367
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,547
The passcode is 3-8-0-8.

368
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,344
It's a drug manufacturing site,
so I urge you to exercise caution.

369
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,428
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,818
Tae-jin is doing a search and seizure
of Yeongryun Cold Storage.

373
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,445
What?

374
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,616
And Yun-ho's body has been discovered.

Let's go to Father.

377
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,008
Prosecutor Park Tae-jin
isn't answering his phone.

378
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,595
I think it's because he's executing
a search and seizure of KH Pharmaceutical.

379
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,265
What does he think he's doing?

380
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,393
Have the PR team keep the press quiet.

381
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,188
Tell them to shut down the press
by using any means necessary!

382
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,273
Yes, sir.

383

Have you heard?

Tae-jin is executing
a search and seizure of our company.

386
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,867
Did something happen

387
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:19,995
between you two?

388
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,082
That bastard, Tae-jin,
was making drugs and selling them.

389
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,794
Father, the crazy bastard was
making and selling drugs at our company.

390
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,088
-Then what?
-You already knew?

391
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,589
Then what?

392
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,343
Then Iâ€¦

393
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,263
I called him andâ€¦

394
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,850
I wanted to drug him
and teach him a lesson.

395
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:42,934
Oh, no.

396
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,148
Why?

397
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,068
What do you mean?

398
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,197
I guess Jun-seo couldn't tell you.

399
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:02,412
I suggested that it might be safe to tell
Senior Inspector Jang and Reporter Oh.

400
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,290
But he kept putting it off.

401
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,543
He said he'd tell you
when the time was right.

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,007
What are you looking at, you bastard?

405
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,842
Why you!

406
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,847
Have you lost your mind?

407
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,477
It happened so suddenly.

408
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,687
The portable stove fell

409
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,690
while the guys were beating Gyeong-tae.

410
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,858
Oh Chi-hyeon. Get him up.

411
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,696

fulfill your duties!

-Hold on.
-Let go of me!

00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,124

-Wait a minute.

I gave it to Jun-seo.

But why aren't you asking me?

441
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,495
Shouldn't you ask me
why I didn't report it

442
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,207
despite having the name tag
and witnessing everything?

443
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,335
I thought you'd ask me,
Senior Inspector Jang,

444
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,378
since you had to transfer
because of that incident.

445
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,389
Goodness, I'll take that for you.

446
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,141
I got it.

447
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,479

451
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:31,663
Jun-seo must have felt devastated
after hearing the whole story from Mr. No.

452
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,249
This was never an accident.

453
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,377
Maybe it's too late,

454
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,755
but shouldn't we do whatever we can?

-Yes.

-Yes, why?

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,421
-Why did you come here?
-Because we missed you.

467
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,303
You came a long way.

468
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,033
Why come here without telling us?

469
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,329
Just because.

470
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,876
Do you feel better now that you're here?

471
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,296
Of course not.

472
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,758
To be honest,

473
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,178
when you came to your grandparents'â€¦

474
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,973
right after summer break started,

475
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,184
we all felt a bit hurt.

476
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,646
Jun-seo.

477
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,942
We're friends,
so we can tell each other anything.

478
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,152
Stop bottling everything up.

479
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,405
Park Jun-seo.

480
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,659
What did you seeâ€¦

481
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,705
that day?

482
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,170
That day,

483
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,715
Jun-seo told me
what had happened for the first time.

484
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,680
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin,
Oh Chi-hyeon, and Jung Yun-ho.

485
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,556
The four of them

486
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,476
just stood in front
of Gyeong-tae's burning house,

487
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,353
not knowing what to do.

488
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,149
I got angry when I heard what happened

489
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,152
and convinced him not to let it slide.

490
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,031
I said I'd file a report with him
at the police station.

491
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,369
But even after school started again,

492
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,706
Jun-seo didn't go to the police station.

493
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,749
So that's why you filed a report.

494
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,628
I knew everything too.

495
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,464
That dayâ€¦

496
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,093
I heard everything.

497
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,888
Gyeong-tae was inside the burning house,

498
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,766
but none of them tried to save him.

499
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,519
They were just standing there.

500
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,063
I just pretended to sleep

501
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,317
to give you and Jun-seo some time to talk.

502
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,153
I was curious too.

503
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,781
I could tell something
had happened to Jun-seo,

504
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,117
but he wouldn't tell me a thing.

505
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,956
I'm sorry.

506
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,419
After hearing everythingâ€¦

507
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,674
and after seeing you
getting transferred because of itâ€¦

508
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,597
I still couldn't find the courage.

509
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,977
After I became a reporter,

510
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,355
I tried to muster up the courage
I didn't have before

511
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,399
and gave it a few tries.

512
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,030
But I failed every time.

513
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,992
I mean,

514
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,703
how could someone like me
stand up to injustice?

515
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,540
Life is about brushing things off
and letting things go.

516
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,714
But I couldn't let go of the guilt
I felt toward you and Jun-seo.

517
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,734
What about you?

518
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,363
Didn't you hear them
when you were in the tent?

519
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
Were you asleep?

520
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,749
Like a baby.

Where's Chang-su, ma'am?

528
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,758
I told him to get a motel room and wait

529
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,635
because we can't all go running up there.

530
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,387
Did he say anything on the way here?

531
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,805
No.

532
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,725
If anything, I had a ton of questions,
but I held back.

533
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,020
But I couldn't help but think
on the way over here

534
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,355
that maybe Chang-su did what he had to

535
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,275
under the circumstances.

536
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,484
Think about it.

537
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,947
Captain Jang, go to the driver's seat.

538
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,073
Let's reenact this.

539
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,325
Hurry up.

540
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,122
So like thisâ€¦

541
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,290
Jeez.

542
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,584
So like this,

543
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,253
if Ko Gi-seong kicked you from behind,
what would you do?

544
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,048
I'd probably use
my right arm to block his kicks.

545
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,343
And pull over on the side of the road.

546
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,054
Right. You'd stop the car.

547
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,931
And I said this before,

548
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,683
but the body would shift
to the left if it gets kicked.

549
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,976
Here, kick me.

550
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,730
That hurts.

551
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,943
If that happens,
the wheel wouldn't turn to the right.

552
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,862
If the body moves to the left,
the wheel would also turn left.

553
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,030
Look.

554
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,365
Come over here.

555
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,200
What if I kicked you here?

556
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,454
And besides,

557
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,457
why would Chang-su
kill Ko Gi-seong anyway?

558
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,542
It's hard to find a motive, right?

559
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,878
I hope you're right.

560
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,423
-Let's head inside and get ready.
-Okay.

561
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,968
-You don't have to see us off.
-Goodbye.

562
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,052
Goodbye.

563
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,976
Damn it.

564
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,108
Hey, I always eat that in my car.

565
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,985
-Really?
-Yes.

566
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,861
-Do you want one?
-Sure.

567
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,123
It's nice to have
when you're craving coffee.

568
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,421
Gosh, it's so peaceful and quiet here.

569
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,131
I know, right?

570
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,844
I wish I could live with Ye-eun
in a quiet place like this.

571
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,055
The thought of going back
to that chaotic mess

572
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,975
makes my head hurt already.

573
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,067
I just can't figure it out.

574
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,235
What do you mean?

575
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,029
Jun-seo.

576
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,240
He knew there was a chance he could die.

577
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,160
That's why he took out
those policies under our names

578
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,829
and left that flash drive with No Gyu-min.

579
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,583
They were the best of friends,

580
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,752
but they killed Jun-seo

581
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,296
to hide their secret.

582
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,718
To be honest, when you told me
Jae-gyeong got addicted to drugs,

583
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,969
I resented Jun-seo.

584
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,764
Think about it.

585
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,225
Jae-gyeong became an addict
while investigating Jun-seo's death,

586
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,062
and you got kidnapped and almost died.

587
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,981
But coming here to Boryeong

588
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,651
made me realize he must've been so lonely.

589
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,280
He always seemed to have a lot of friends,

590
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,949
but after today,

591
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,744
I thought maybe we were

592
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,954
his only friends.

593
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,260
-Hey, U-seong.
-Where are you?

594
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,471
I'm on my way back to Seoul. Why?

595
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,515
It's crazy here right now.

596
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,812
The Prosecutors' Office
did a search and seizure of KH Group

597
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,313
and the Pilo-dong cold storage facility.

598
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,273
Really? So what happened?

599
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,360
They found a drug factory
in the cold storage facility's basement,

600
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,238
and rumor has it
that a lot of drugs were discovered.

601
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,408
But KH Group is keeping
the press from talking.

602
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,160
Those people have been here

603
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,371
arguing with the director
for over two hours.

604
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,374
Okay. Keep me posted.

605
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,293
What's going on?

606
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,215
Park Tae-jin has finally made a move.

607
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,057
You must be busy today.

608
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,184
What brings you here?

609
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,980
I think you've been busier
trying to stop the press from talking.

610
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,773
Hey, Park Tae-jinâ€¦

611
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,568
There are other ways

612
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
to handle this matter.

613
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,198
I think there's been a misunderstanding--

614
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,616
I don't think so, sir.

615
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,912
But I understand, Chairman Won.

616
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,165
I would've done the same.

617
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,208
Now that you have
the permit for this project,

618
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,171
you wouldn't have wanted to keep
an ungrateful brat like me around.

619
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,965
-That's the misunderstanding.
-Chairman Won.

620
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,925
It doesn't matter.

621
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,054
Give up Jong-soo.

622
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,057
-What did you say?
-I can't do that.

623
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,311
Brand it as Jong-soo's deviant behavior,
and the company will be safe.

624
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,646
I said no.

625
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,278
MAYOR JOO IN-SANG

626
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
You should answer that.

627
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,996
MAYOR JOO IN-SANG

628
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,419
This is Won Chang-ho of KH Group.

629
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,260
But Mayor Jooâ€¦

630
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,819
MAYOR JOO IN-SANG
SPEAKER

631
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,738
Mayor Joo.

632
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,949
This is Park Tae-jin of Anhyeon DPO.

633
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,325
Prosecutor Park Tae-jin?

634
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,286
But why are you answering--

635
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,706
I'm here to take
CEO Won Jong-soo into custody.

636
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,336
Is that so? Is everything true, then?

637
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:31,090
Did CEO Won Jong-soo
make, consume, and sell drugs?

638
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,384
What will you do now?

639
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,304
If you give up Jong-soo,
the Pilo-dong project will continue.

640
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,889
Shut up, you bastard.

641
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
Hello?

642
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,103
Prosecutor Park, what are you saying?

643
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,646
Prosecutor Park?

644
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,730
Sir.

645
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,484
I'll ask you one last time.

646
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,071
Will you choose Jong-soo

647
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,407
or KH Group?

648
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,415
Father.

649
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,875
Hello?

650
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,836
Who says the project will continue?

651
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,921
I'm withdrawing the permit.
Do you hear me?

652
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,549
-Sir.
-Father!

653
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,343
Father!

654
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,276
Jong-sooâ€¦

655
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,069
Noâ€¦

656
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,031
What are you doing, sir?

657
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,824
How can youâ€¦

658
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,909
You won't stay in there long.

659
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,995
Father, what are you doing?

660
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,247
Father, I'm your only son!

661
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,001
This isn't right, Father!

662
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,672
I'm your son, not this bastard!

663
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,383
How can you turn your back on me?

664
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:58,677
Make sure Jong-sooâ€¦

665
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,183
remains safe and sound.

666
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,854
-Of course, sir.
-Butâ€¦

667
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,272
Father.

668
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,399
Fatherâ€¦

669
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,568
Father, I'm sorry.

670
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,153
-I'll be good.
-Prosecutor Park?

671
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,946
What do you think you're doing?

672
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,823
I'm hanging up now.

673
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,743
You just made a big mistake as well!

674
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,536
Shut up and listen to me.

675
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,872
What? Have you lost your mind?

676
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,084
I just sent two photos to your phone.

677
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,628
I sent 2 out of 38 filthy photos
that I have on you.

678
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,631
The ones I sent
are the least embarrassing.

679
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,593
What?

680
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,521
There's no problem with the permit
for the bio-industrial complex.

681
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,732
And we never had this conversation.

682
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:56,693
Do we have an understanding?

683
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,197
Yes.

684
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,950
I believe we do.

685
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,842
Take him.

686
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,848
Come with us.

687
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:57,129
Act naturally if you see Gong Jin-uk
in front of the Manyang.

688
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,631
Right. Is that the boat
he'll be leaving on?

689
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,799
We don't know yet.

690
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,593
He might take another boat from there.

691
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,722
Can't we just arrest him
in front of the Manyang?

692
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,183
Do I have to get on the boat with him?

693
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,560
What nonsense is he saying right now?

694
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,395
We already told you.

695
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,148
There's a good chance
Gong Jin-uk has a gun,

696
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,193
so we can't provoke him
until he gets on the boat.

697
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,822
Civilians can get hurt
if we try to arrest him on land.

698
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,867
It'll be a problem if he goes into a store
and takes someone hostage.

699
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,452
Check out that line.

700
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,371
Once you get on the boat
and head out to seaâ€¦

701
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,873
Do you see the seawall there?

702
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,918
Once the boat passes the seawall,
the Coast Guard will seize it.

703
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,419
Then we'll arrest him on the deck.

704
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,795
That's the safest way.

705
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,631
You're right. There's nowhere to escape.

706
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,675
Put on your bulletproof vest.

707
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,427
And don't take any chances.

708
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,678
Yes, sir.

709
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,516
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR
OH SU-HYEON

710
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,313
Hey, what did you find out?

711
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,149
The van that Ko Gi-seong was inâ€¦

712
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,359
Yes?

713
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:03,153
There was a dashcam inside the van.

714
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,447
I thought they couldn't restore it.

715
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,326
They couldn't restore the audio.

716
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,621
But they recovered some footage,
so I just sent you some files.

717
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,331
You saw them.

718
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,376
What did you find?

719
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,589
I'll let you be the judge
after you look at the files, sir.

720
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,051
Okay, got it.

721
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,083
Where have you two been without me?

722
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,757
Where's your gun?

723
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,260
Here.

724
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,971
What are you doing?

725
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,808
Kim Chang-su, you're under arrest
for the murder of Ko Gi-seong.

726
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,184
Captain?

727
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,063
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to defend yourself.

728
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,315
Why are you doing this?

729
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,738
You have the right to request
a review of the legality of arrest,

730
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,865
and you have the right to remain silent.

731
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:30,949
Chang-su.

732
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,243
Why did you kill Ko Gi-seong?

733
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,080
Me?

734
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,416
Why would I kill Ko Gi-seong?

735
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,626
That day

736
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,045
when CEO Yoon died,

737
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,922
it wasn't your first time
seeing her, was it?

738
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,050
Yes, it was.

739
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,345
When would I have ever seen her?

740
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,263
What's the matter with you both?

741
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,848
Look carefully

742
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,308
at what you did.

743
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,730
Ko Gi-seong didn't attack you
like you claimed.

744
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,982
In case the door wouldn't open

745
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,194
when you went into the water,

746
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,237
you lowered your window beforehand.

747
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,278
Come in.

748
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,867
This is an undercover operation,

749
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,036
so please take him
to the precinct as quietly as possible.

750
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:01,998
Someone from Anhyeon Police Station

751
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,543
will come to take him into custody.

752
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,032
What should I say when I see Gong Jin-uk?

753
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,993
You haven't thought of that yet?

754
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,327
Maybe I'll say

755
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,165
I was a drug distributor in Seoul
but had to get out of the country.

756
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,249
Sounds good.

757
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,962
Gong Jin-uk might try to take you hostage.

758
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,132
So if anything happens on the boat,
you need to fall back.

759
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,384
The Coast Guard and I will arrest him,

760
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,845
so keep your distance from him.

761
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,181
Jeez, worry about yourself.

762
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,266
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

763
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,350
Say something.

764
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,686
Silly, crummy,

765
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,355
dummy Jang Jae-gyeong. Come in, over.

766
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,648
I hear you loud and clear.

767
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,863
Here.

768
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,158
I can't have that on me out there.

769
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,244
So hold onto it just in case.

770
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,652
Do you copy?

771
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,947
Yes, loud and clear.

772
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,582
MANPYEONG PORT

773
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,548
Have you found the Manyang?

774
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,591
Not yet.

775
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,264
Found it.

776
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,687
THE MANYANG

777
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,543
Gong Jin-uk.

778
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,120
Is this your first time?

779
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,123
What?

780
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,625
Stowing away.

781
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,212
No wonder you're not dressed warmly.

782
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,257
It's freezing this time of the year
out in the ocean.

783
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,801
Stowing away often
isn't something to brag about.

784
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,512
At least I have experience.

785
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,682
Can you speak Chinese?

786
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,767
No.

787
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,268
Can you?

788
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,437
Of course not.

789
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,628
You must be tired
coming all the way out here.

790
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,173
You two are going out
on the Manyang, right?

791
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,925
Who's calling?

792
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,844
STRAW

793
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,515
Yes.

794
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,270
-What?
-Sir, her cover has been blown.

795
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,816
Those guys found out
the police sent someone undercover.

796
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,694
They have to leave Korea no matter what,
so they'll go to a different port.

797
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,737
Which one of you is here because of Straw?

798
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,992
Nice to meet you. Let's go.

799
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:02,882
Get in now!

800
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,266
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. Give me some handcuffs.

801
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,559
Jeez, you scared me.

802
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,685
Go after them!

803
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,332
MANPYEONG PORT

804
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,678
CHARGING

805
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,680
ASSISTANT INSPECTOR
OH SU-HYEON

806
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,266
-Yes, Captain?
-Su-hyeon.

807
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,435
I'm chasing a suspect car
at Manpyeong Port.

808
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,895
Check for any nearby ports.

809
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:57,979
Just a moment, sir.

810
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,440
Hurry, Su-hyeon.

811
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,653
There's Ingok Port.

812
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,739
It's 15 kilometers north of where you are.

813
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,823
Ingok Port?

814
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,999
Request local backup

815
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,959
and tell the Coast Guard
to go to Ingok Port.

816
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,544
Yes, sir.

817
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,601
PUNGEO

818
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,751
Gong Jin-uk!

819
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,257
Jang Jae-gyeong.

820
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,928
You're under arrest for violating
the Narcotics Control Act.

821
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,930
You damn druggie.

822
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,033
-Come with me.
-Section Chief Jung!

823
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,452
Who are you calling a suspect?
Come with me.

824
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,163
You just want to believe
that Jun-seo wanted it.

825
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:08,331
I'm right, so shut up.

826
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,624
No, you shut up!

827
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,584
I'm publishing this article
no matter what.

828
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm going to kill you
as soon as I get out!

829
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,130
They should be our feat.

830
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,216
-You're unbelievable.
-You haven't changed at all.

831
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:21,010
Why haven't you come to your senses?

832
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,428
Park Tae-jin.

833
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,514
I'll do anything you want.

834
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,973
-Jong-soo.
-Hey.

835
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,308
Jong-soo killed him.

836
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,102
He said he was going to kill Jun-seo.

837
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,187
Did you say you'd help him, sir?

838
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,606
Of course, I tried toâ€¦

839
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,401
He leeched off his friends
and delivered drugs.

840
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,071
That was his pathetic life,
so get it together.

841
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,949
They found DNA
under Park Jun-seo's fingernail.

842
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,033
You know who he is, right?

843
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,452
The revenge you wanted to get for Jun-seoâ€¦

844
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,955
Maybe Jun-seo didn't want that.

845
