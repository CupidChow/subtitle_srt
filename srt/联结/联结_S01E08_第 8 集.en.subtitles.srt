1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,185
APRIL 2005

3
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,605
Come on, let's watch Crying Fist.

4
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,983
Innocent Steps just came out.
Let's watch that instead.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
Hey, Joo-song.

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,945
We just finished exams.
Watching Innocent Steps sounds silly.

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
Crying Fist, right?

8
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,991
Right. I want to watch Crying Fist too.

9
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,785
What about you?

10
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,245
I want to watch Kingdom of Heaven.

11
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,081
Hey, that comes out next week.

12
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,957
Really? But still.

13
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,751
Hey, let's decide when we get there.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,394
The class president went to see a movie
with Yun-jin and Jae-gyeong.

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,021
And he's not picking up.

16
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,898
PARK TAE-JIN

17
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
Sang-ui.

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,193
JUNG SANG-UI

19
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,404
Jung Sang-ui!

20
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,742
Chae Gyeong-tae.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,413
Did that bastard take your money again?

22
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,141
We'll go without Jun-seo.

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,821
FROM JANGHO-DONG
TO PILO-DONG

24
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,628
WON JONG-SOO

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,695
I arrived about ten minutes early,

26
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,447
but I wasn't the first to get there.

27
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,365
Who are you?

28
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,493
Jung Sang-ui?

29
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,787
Hey, Tae-jin.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,206
Did Jun-seo tell you to come too?

31
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,833
Yes.

32
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,588
That looks like a switch.

33
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,797
Can you turn it on?

34
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,507
Okay.

35
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,184
It worked.

36
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,658
What's this?

37
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,160
Did he tell you to come too?

38
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,998
And Park Jun-seo?

39
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,792
Where was he at the time?

40
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
Up.

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,256
Up?

42
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,425
Explain it to me.

43
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
When you guys arrived
at the construction site,

44
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,014
Park Jun-seo was
on the ninth floor, right?

45
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,849
Right.

46
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,351
How'd you know he was on the ninth floor?

47
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,520
The light was on.

48
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,232
What time is it now?

49
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,694
It's almost 11:30 p.m.

50
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,028
Hey.

51
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,199
He must be up there.

52
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
Hey, Park Jun-seo!

53
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
Are you up there?

54
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,746
Come down, you punk!

55
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,625
SEEING DANGER
IS THE BEGINNING OF SAFETY

56
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,835
Let's go up to him.

57
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,087
Hey, I can't take that up.

58
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,339
Jun-seo took it up there.

59
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,424
Hey!

60
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
Damn it.

61
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,511
I guess they were nervous
because no one said a word.

62
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,930
As we reached the fourth floor,

63
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,892
we were looking out at Pilo-dong
through the steel mesh grid.

64
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,226
But right then…

65
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,861
Did you see that?

66
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,663
We were all shocked
and looked down through the grid,

67
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,998
but we couldn't see well.

68
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,127
That's when Jun-seo fell?

69
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,047
Yes.

70
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,883
Are you saying he committed suicide?

71
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,308
You guys happened to be in the elevator

72
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,477
when Jun-seo jumped from the ninth floor?

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,438
I didn't say he jumped.
I said he was seen falling.

74
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,606
Are you…

75
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,526
Are you creating an alibi for them?

76
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,657
Who saw Jun-seo fall?

77
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,741
Did you see it too?

78
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,744
Jong-soo and Tae-jin saw him.

79
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
So you guys never made it
to the ninth floor?

80
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,249
Tae-jin hit the stop button.

81
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,127
Hey, Park Jun-seo! Are you up there?

82
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,131
Let's go down.

83
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,733
BEWARE OF FALLING OBJECTS

84
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,336
Who is it?

85
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,759
It's not Jun-seo, is it?

86
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,353
Is it Jun-seo?

87
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,564
Tell me who it is!

88
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,235
It's Jun-seo.

89
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,117
Did you check too?

90
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,661
Yes.

91
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,207
Did you see with your own eyes
that Jun-seo was dead?

92
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,958
Or did you just assume he was dead?

93
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,045
Tae-jin went over and checked his pulse.

94
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,880
Tae-jin did?

95
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,966
He said we had to leave quickly

96
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,636
because it wouldn't be good
if people found out we were there.

97
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,221
Tae-jin said that as well?

98
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,432
You're saying it was all Park Tae-jin?

99
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,393
You guys would be lost without him.
Then what happened?

100
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,231
Then we left the way we came in.

101
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,107
We got to the main road

102
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,693
and went our separate ways home.

103
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:54,992
You guys…

104
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,665
You did the same thing 20 years ago
with Chae Gyeong-tae.

105
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,417
You created alibis
and acted as witnesses for each other.

106
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,294
You think you can do that again this time?

107
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,506
It's up to you
whether you believe me or not.

108
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,132
If what you say is true,

109
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,635
Jun-seo wanted all of you
to come at 11:30 p.m.

110
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,136
to tell you something.

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,974
Before Jun-seo died, he came to see me
and said he would set things right.

112
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,351
After saying that,
do you think he'd kill himself

113
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,811
as you guys were in the elevator?

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,187
Does that make sense to you?

115
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,815
The people in the elevator included

116
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,111
someone who could kill another
without getting blood on his own hands,

117
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,030
someone who would carry out
any task given to him,

118
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,908
and someone who could cover up
everything I just said.

119
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,910
If any one of them

120
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,830
were to get in trouble
because of what Jun-seo wanted to say,

121
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,081
then it would make sense.

122
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,500
Because while they were
establishing their alibis,

123
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,169
they could've had someone else
push Park Jun-seo.

124
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,713
But then what are you?

125
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,927
A bystander who looked on
regardless of what they did?

126
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,095
Was that you?

127
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,648
You're the investigator…

128
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,902
so I assume you'll find out.

129
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,371
There's a rice mill
at the corner of the construction site.

130
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,874
Beneath the rice mill's awning,

131
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,335
there's a CCTV camera.

132
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,088
Did you know that?

133
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
No.

134
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,634
So including you,

135
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,221
none of you are seen in the footage

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,432
from before 11:30 p.m. to 11:40 p.m.

137
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,396
If you got out of a taxi
at the Pilo-dong main road

138
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,023
and walked to the site,

139
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,318
you wouldn't be on camera
because you came from behind it.

140
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,113
But how did the others
get inside the construction site

141
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,407
without once getting caught on camera?

142
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,826
I don't know how they got there.

143
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,329
But I do know

144
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,040
they all came through the alley
next to the rice mill.

145
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,460
After listening to you,
I'm more certain than ever

146
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,048
that one of the people who went there
killed Park Jun-seo.

147
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,008
And that person

148
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,678
thought they got caught
on the rice mill's CCTV camera

149
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,223
and killed the rice mill owner.

150
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,291
Sir, would you like to
step out for a bit and return later?

151
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,379
No, I'll just wait.

152
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,505
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,154
Hey.

154
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,281
Are you sure you made the appointment?

155
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,538
Hello, sir.

156
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,916
May I ask about
the mayor's current location?

157
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,668
Understood, sir.

158
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,504
He's almost here.

159
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,348
Hey, Mr. Oh!

160
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,939
Call him again.

161
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,024
Yes, sir.

162
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,160
I apologize for being so late.

163
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,537
Not at all, sir. Please have a seat.

164
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,757
It's nice to meet you, Mayor Joo.

165
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,759
Likewise.

166
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,720
You must be hungry.
I'll have them bring out the food.

167
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,139
-Please prepare the meal.
-Just a moment.

168
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,101
I'm sorry, but I've already eaten
at the previous meeting I attended.

169
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,898
I have another meeting after this,
so let's just have some tea today.

170
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,444
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,702
Since you're very busy,

172
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,454
I'll just get to the point.

173
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,874
I asked to meet with you
because I might have an opportunity

174
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,292
to help you.

175
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
Is that so?

176
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,465
I understand you want Anhyeon City
to become a bio-industrial complex city.

177
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,634
That's right.

178
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,054
To do that, you'll need to attract
major pharmaceutical companies.

179
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,265
You have four years left in your term,

180
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,310
so you'll need to produce tangible results
before the election, right?

181
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
Yes, I suppose so.

182
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,358
KH Group will take the lead

183
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,527
and develop a bio-industrial complex.

184
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,946
Upon the success of this project,

185
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,324
we hope to further assist you
as you achieve great things in the future

186
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,367
on a national level.

187
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,788
I am confident

188
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,542
that KH Group's network
can provide you with excellent assistance.

189
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,714
What was KH Group's revenue last year?

190
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,387
I understand what you're getting at--

191
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,139
I memorized some numbers

192
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,807
in preparation for our meeting.

193
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,854
The revenue was 3.22 trillion won,
which is 9.2% less than last year,

194
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,898
and the operating loss
was 62.2 billion won.

195
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,108
You've been in the red
for three years in a row.

196
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,112
I heard that banks are raising
their interest rates on existing loans

197
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,907
and not providing
additional loans for you.

198
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,786
So having such a company
spearhead this project

199
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
makes me a bit uneasy.

200
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
Right.

201
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,299
The reason why I mentioned
leading the project

202
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,092
was because KH Group,

203
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,594
Vice Chairman Han of Igu Electronics,

204
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,430
and those in Yeouido

205
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,766
are all offering their support--

206
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,684
Just this week,

207
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,313
I've had three people
approach me with plans

208
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,315
to develop Anhyeon City

209
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,651
in all sorts of different ways.

210
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,863
They all came to me
with the support of very powerful people.

211
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,157
Unfortunately,

212
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,868
I'm afraid I can't work with someone

213
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,997
who is so eager
to make promises about my future

214
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,792
during our first meeting.

215
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,505
-Mayor Joo--
-Now, if you'll excuse me…

216
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,717
Sir?

217
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,553
But…

218
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,451
Mr. Lee Myeong-guk.

219
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,413
He was your boss, right?

220
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,625
You've probably heard
his body was discovered.

221
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,502
Yes.

222
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,713
What did he do here?

223
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,842
He mostly researched generic drugs.

224
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,678
In your opinion,

225
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,888
what kind of person was he?

226
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,641
Was he the type to go missing suddenly

227
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,893
and then show up as a corpse one day?

228
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,854
Did he ever seem threatened?

229
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,651
How much do you know about Jun-seo?

230
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,361
What?

231
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,989
He was your close friend 20 years ago,

232
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,409
but you don't know
what he was thinking before he died.

233
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,287
That's why you're here.

234
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,376
Manager Lee…

235
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,421
He was my boss.
Nothing more, nothing less.

236
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,676
You don't know a person
or what their surroundings are like

237
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,096
unless they tell you themselves.

238
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
So…

239
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,615
What's your plan now?

240
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,366
I'll have to ask them why

241
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,036
they hid the fact they were at the scene.

242
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,997
Why?

243
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,210
You don't want them to know
what you told me?

244
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,340
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

245
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,302
Everything I told you today…

246
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Do you believe it all?

247
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,264
No.

248
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,560
What about you?

249
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,480
Do you think…

250
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,026
Jun-seo committed suicide?

251
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,278
No.

252
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,863
What's your reason?

253
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,075
Because I saw it.

254
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
But at the time,

255
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,456
none of them

256
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,917
saw it.

257
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,841
His shoes.

258
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,347
He was wearing shoes.

259
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,893
Jun-seo's shoes were on the ninth floor

260
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,562
where he supposedly jumped from,

261
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,148
but the elevator
was on the first floor, not the ninth.

262
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,907
KEUMHYUNG

263
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,913
Mr. Oh.

264
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,165
What is it?

265
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,249
Someone's inside.

266
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,256
KH GROUP CHIEF SECRETARY
OH CHI-HYEON

267
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,138
What brings you here?

268
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,307
I have a meeting soon.

269
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,398
You might be unable to attend
depending on how this goes.

270
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,737
What is it?

271
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,365
If you ever try to kidnap or bribe

272
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,743
Yun-jin or anyone else again,

273
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,827
I'll come after you.

274
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,871
You'll come after me?

275
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,706
Try me and find out.

276
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,960
Hey.

277
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,798
Why are you two
ganging up on me these days?

278
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,635
I admit I went overboard

279
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,553
to stop Yun-jin from causing trouble.

280
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,055
But I failed anyway.

281
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,599
She returned the money yesterday.

282
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,478
There was a good amount missing, though.

283
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,564
If that's what you came to say,
can we go now?

284
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,275
-That's okay, right?
-You…

285
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,737
Why did you kill Park Jun-seo?

286
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,531
What?

287
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,534
Remember February 23rd at 11:30 p.m.?

288
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,286
You were there.

289
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,216
Most people commit suicide
where nobody is around, right?

290
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,551
A construction site
is a good place for that.

291
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,263
But why were you there?

292
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,016
If someone is at the scene,
it's no longer considered a suicide.

293
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,770
Who told you I was there?

294
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,898
You should be asking
if I have any proof of you being there

295
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,733
instead of asking who told me.

296
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,236
What is it?

297
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,989
Do you suddenly remember someone

298
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,991
who can testify you were there?

299
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,663
Why did you kill Park Jun-seo?

300
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,625
Park Jun-seo committed suicide.

301
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,751
How so?

302
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,213
Jun-seo told me to come,
so I went to the site.

303
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,925
We were taking the elevator up
to where we thought he was

304
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,552
when Jun-seo jumped.

305
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,515
Or someone could've had him pushed off.

306
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,058
Was it Jong-soo?

307
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,476
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

308
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,688
Why so worked up? Is it out of loyalty?

309
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,231
Come on.

310
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,233
Jun-seo knew something about Jong-soo.

311
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,776
Jong-soo didn't like that.

312
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,403
And you follow Jong-soo's orders.

313
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:07,242
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin, Jung Sang-ui
were all there together.

314
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
You still won't say their names.

315
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,331
School bullies are known to be loyal.

316
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,499
I'm impressed with your loyalty.

317
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,543
You won't talk, will you?

318
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,964
How did you get in and out
of the construction site?

319
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,470
I parked on the main road
near Jeongji-dong

320
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,221
and walked into the alley

321
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,391
because it was difficult to park closer.

322
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,476
You came out the same way?

323
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,773
Hey, did you meet someone? Jung Sang-ui?

324
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,192
Did you know
there was a CCTV camera there?

325
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,945
No.

326
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,199
I thought you'd be surprised,
but you're not.

327
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,160
One more question.

328
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,121
Who checked to see

329
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,664
if Jun-seo was dead?

330
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,294
Why does that matter?

331
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,004
Someone should have checked

332
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,215
even if he was meant to die.

333
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,803
Tae-jin checked.

334
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,599
Was Jun-seo wearing shoes at the time?

335
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,685
I don't know. It was dark.

336
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,480
And I was too shocked that Jun-seo fell.

337
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,526
But didn't they find his shoes
on the ninth floor?

338
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,743
Oh, that's right.

339
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,662
Get back to work then.

340
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,206
Tell the others I came by to see you.

341
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,752
Don't forget to tell them
the questions I asked

342
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:41,962
so your stories add up.

343
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,423
I'll be back when I get more evidence.

344
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,686
It was good of you to return
the money to Oh Chi-hyeon.

345
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,062
Good job.

346
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,022
But let's drop this case now.

347
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,775
When I heard you got kidnapped,

348
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,777
my legs turned to jelly.

349
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,989
I thought I might go crazy.

350
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,116
Leave the investigation to Jae-gyeong

351
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,286
and focus on working for the paper.

352
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,954
I hope that's what you'll do.

353
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,873
And Woonjong Medical Center?

354
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,625
Didn't you have a sales rep
handling them already?

355
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,629
No, we didn't have a deal in place
with them before that.

356
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,048
Jun-seo got us the deal

357
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,177
by connecting with the director
at a social club.

358
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,639
That's why Jun-seo
went to all of those gatherings.

359
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,684
You need to take care of yourself.

360
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:42,063
You'd normally order herbal tonic
instead of drinking coffee.

361
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,899
It's too dangerous.

362
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,942
Did you hear what I said?

363
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,612
-What?
-Did you hear me

364
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,322
when I said let's drop the case?

365
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,116
-Yes.
-Good.

366
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,537
Hey.

367
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,499
Is there a specific company
you want to sell insurance to?

368
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,128
Was there a company
you tried to sell to but couldn't?

369
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,379
Manbae Electronics.

370
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,672
Manbae Electronics?

371
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,466
So what if

372
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,427
I'm on really good terms
with their head of general affairs,

373
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,848
and I open the door for you
to sell insurance to the employees?

374
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,516
Seriously?

375
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,102
No, I said what if.

376
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,562
Oh, right.

377
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:27,192
So would you make me business cards
and have me sell insurance there?

378
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,778
-Of course not.
-Right?

379
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,697
You'd either do it yourself
or have an employee do it, right?

380
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,823
Of course.

381
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,325
Damn it.

382
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,452
I knew it.

383
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,371
Park Jun-seo was a realtor.

384
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,791
Even if he helped
Woonjong Medical Center with sales,

385
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,253
why would he make his own business card
and deliver supplies himself?

386
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,963
What do you mean?

387
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,634
Hey.

388
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,053
This is weird, right?

389
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,388
KH PHARMACEUTICAL PARK JUN-SEO,
SALES TEAM 1 MANAGER

390
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,306
What's even weirder is this.

391
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,600
Why would Jun-seo
apologize to people and keep them quiet

392
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,645
about KH Pharmaceutical's defective drugs?

393
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,065
How was that Jun-seo's fault?
He didn't even work there.

394
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,942
Who told you this?

395
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,027
Oh Chi-hyeon.

396
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:13,989
Hey.

397
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,117
Hyeon-u saw me getting kidnapped
and called you, right?

398
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,493
Yes.

399
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,662
Okay. I'll need to see him first.

400
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,540
-Yun-jin!
-What?

401
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,417
Didn't you hear what I said to you?

402
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,419
What are you talking about?

403
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,379
I said let's drop this case.

404
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,090
What if you keep investigating
and something happens

405
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,842
and you get badly injured?

406
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,969
The insurance payout
won't mean a thing then.

407
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,053
Look, Joo-song…

408
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,181
Okay.

409
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,060
I appreciate the concern and advice,

410
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,646
but I'm not doing this to live it up.

411
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,981
I know, but--

412
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,026
All I want to do is live with my daughter.

413
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,402
Am I asking for too much?

414
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,822
Have you ever lost custody of your child

415
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,616
because of financial reasons
during a divorce?

416
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,497
Hey, you said your ex-husband
isn't making any money.

417
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,458
Doesn't that mean
you can have Ye-eun back?

418
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,126
I'm not that well-off either.

419
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,546
He still has savings.

420
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,758
I have nothing.

421
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,052
I'm totally broke.

422
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,554
If I bring back Ye-eun right now,

423
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,725
I can't guarantee she'll be better off
than if she were in Canada.

424
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,977
It's just too dangerous.

425
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,604
Hey, stop worrying about me!

426
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,982
I've been a reporter for 15 years.

427
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,943
My life hasn't been
a bed of roses, you know.

428
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,616
I'm off to school now!

429
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,700
Okay.

430
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,968
I had just gotten some groceries

431
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,804
when I saw Jang Jae-gyeong, Heo Joo-song,

432
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,139
and Oh Yun-jin coming out of that alley.

433
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,309
But there aren't many houses up there.
Weird, right?

434
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,617
MIN SEUNG-UK

435
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,794
Who are you?

436
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,425
What?

437
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,680
Oh, I see.

438
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,434
Are you one of Mr. Park Jun-seo's friends?

439
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,729
Oh…

440
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,317
-Yes.
-I see.

441
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,822
I heard Mr. Park passed away.

442
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,325
That's right.

443
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,369
So how…

444
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,538
How do you know Jun-seo?

445
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,124
He came here often.

446
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,126
By the way,

447
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,880
do you know if Mr. Park had any family?

448
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,591
I didn't get to go to his funeral, so…

449
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,886
He had a wife.

450
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,137
Is that so?

451
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,931
-Then…
-Yes?

452
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,390
Excuse me,

453
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,309
but can you wait a moment?

454
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,547
Goodness.

455
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,008
I was wondering…

456
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,386
I'm sorry to ask you this,

457
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,430
but could you please give this to her?

458
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,229
Thank you for doing this.

459
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,024
MIN HYEON-U

460
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,445
The current market conditions aren't good,

461
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,574
so our collateral value
has decreased significantly.

462
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,075
So what?

463
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,870
Well…

464
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,372
With all due respect, sir,

465
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,877
if you could show some gesture
of contributing your personal assets,

466
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,963
it would give me a good basis
to have a positive discussion

467
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,007
with the bank president.

468
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,217
My personal assets?

469
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,470
We're merely saying a symbolic gesture
can be just as important.

470
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,473
It doesn't matter
if the announced contributed amount

471
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,018
and the actual amount are different.
You know this, sir.

472
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,562
So, no personal asset contributions

473
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,398
means no additional loans?

474
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,482
Well…

475
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,924
Have you reached CEO Won?

476
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,635
He's here right now, sir.

477
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,178
Send him in.

478
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,729
How did it go with Mayor Joo?

479
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,488
Mayor Joo is uneasy

480
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,491
about our company's financial situation.

481
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,036
So I'm meeting the vice president
of Igu Electronics tonight

482
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,664
to persuade him
to finalize the funding plan quickly.

483
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,962
I just saw the vice president
of Wonjin Bank leaving.

484
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,713
What did he say?

485
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,633
Unless Anhyeon City approves the project,

486
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,594
there's no possibility.

487
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,889
Will Chairman Han
of Igu Electronics invest?

488
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,266
I'll make sure he does.

489
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,228
Don't worry, sir.

490
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,148
Twenty years ago,

491
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,151
a 1.2 million pyeong plot

492
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,029
filled with pig farms
was developed into Anhyeon New City,

493
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,408
and it made KH Group what it is now.

494
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,036
The Pilo-dong project

495
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,456
might be our last chance
to turn this company around.

496
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,627
If this fails, both you and I

497
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,673
might spend the rest of our lives
paying off debts.

498
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,675
Yes, sir.

499
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,474
NARCOTICS UNIT

500
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,288
Detective Park.

501
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,415
Did you get all the CCTV footage
near the rice mill?

502
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
Yes.

503
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,043
Was there a taxi that left the alley

504
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,378
at the time of the incident?

505
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,173
There's no specific taxi
that was identified leaving the alley.

506
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,508
-Do you have the footage?
-Captain Jang.

507
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,180
After I told you there wasn't much
on the cameras near the construction site,

508
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,974
you went to the scene
and then a rice mill owner was murdered.

509
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,976
I also believe that this case

510
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,103
is related to the previous ones.

511
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,731
I agree with you, Captain Jang.

512
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,026
But Senior Inspector Yoo
is my superior officer,

513
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,445
and he doesn't agree with you.

514
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,407
You know why I'm telling you this, right?

515
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,327
Yes, I understand.

516
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:45,958
Captain.

517
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,128
Come to the break room in a bit.

518
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,681
-Would you like to watch this together?
-What is it?

519
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,017
CCTV footage from the time
of the rice mill owner's murder.

520
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,686
How did you get that?
Didn't Yoo Gyeong-hwan make a fuss?

521
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,115
What time did the murder occur?

522
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,160
Between 5:12 p.m. and 5:15 p.m.

523
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,581
What are we looking for?

524
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,707
A taxi.

525
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,626
A taxi?

526
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,796
There's a witness who saw a taxi
on the day of the incident.

527
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,758
It's highly likely the taxi driver
and passenger were accomplices

528
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,138
or that the taxi driver is the suspect.

529
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,559
If it had turned right
after leaving the alley,

530
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,935
it would've been caught on camera

531
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,187
driving past the crosswalk
and going toward Hwanseong City.

532
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,981
But since we don't see it,

533
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,732
maybe it made a left turn.

534
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,193
Jeez.

535
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,695
Where's this?

536
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,780
It's the next intersection.

537
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,908
If it had turned left,
it would've been caught on camera here.

538
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,993
I see.

539
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,204
We'll have to look into
all of the taxis in this footage.

540
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,915
The Violent Crimes Unit
looked into most of them.

541
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,210
They're smarter than I thought
seeing how they identified the taxi.

542
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,753
I told them, of course.

543
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,384
Do any suspects come to mind?

544
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,886
No, not yet.

545
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,347
Was there another escape route?

546
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,308
It would've been hard to just walk away.

547
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes, it would've been hard
because it was still daytime,

548
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,230
and his clothes
would've been covered in blood.

549
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,481
Right.

550
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,068
-Su-hyeon.
-Yes?

551
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,196
Get this footage from Captain Jang,

552
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,199
check all the taxi license plate numbers,
and create a chart.

553
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,619
These taxis were operating
during the time of the rice mill murder.

554
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,371
-Run background checks on the drivers too.
-Understood.

555
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,874
If the suspect was really a taxi driver,

556
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,918
he would've cleaned
the blood off his hands

557
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,544
and clothes as soon as possible.

558
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,171
So check for places

559
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,882
where he could've parked
and washed his hands.

560
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,675
And check nearby CCTV cameras too.

561
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,760
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,153
It now belongs to us,
the ones with the password.

563
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,780
Give me more time.

564
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,991
It's not an easy decision for me.

565
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,119
I'll consider it
if they bring me ten billion won

566
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,457
and beg with their head down.

567
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,668
It's a race against time, got it?

568
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,220
JUN-SEO'S
FATHER'S BIRTHDAY: 1008

569
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,888
JUN-SEO'S
MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY: 0913

570
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,645
YUN-HUI'S BIRTHDAY: 1030

571
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,650
YUN-HUI'S BIRTHDAY: 1030

572
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,574
YUN-HUI'S BIRTHDAY: 1030

573
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,405
What happened with CEO Yoon's informant?

574
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,450
I met with him, but I didn't get
any meaningful information.

575
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,869
He says CEO Yoon is selling a new drug

576
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,997
but doesn't know CEO Yoon's whereabouts.
It seems like a dead end.

577
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,708
-Got it.
-Captain?

578
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,586
Remember that alternative drug, Etaphen?

579
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,088
Should I try and get you some?

580
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,215
You can't keep taking the other drug.

581
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,720
I'll take care of it, but thanks.

582
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,555
I'll keep asking around for CEO Yoon.

583
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,478
Senior Inspector Jang Jae-gyeong?

584
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,855
It wasn't us.

585
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,442
We gain nothing
by getting him addicted.

586
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,526
Don't you agree?

587
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,325
SEODONG INTERNAL MEDICINE CLINIC

588
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,579
Where do you get
a prescription for Etaphen?

589
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,956
In Seo-dong, Anhyeon City,

590
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,918
there's an old clinic
called Seodong Clinic.

591
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:42,755
If you ask for appetite suppressants,
they'll give it to you.

592
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,261
-Do I take this after a meal?
-Yes, 30 minutes after.

593
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,475
Captain Jang?

594
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,061
It really is you. Don't you remember me?

595
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,687
You arrested me last year.

596
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,814
Oh, right.

597
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,942
You caught me smoking pot
at a rest stop, remember?

598
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,652
That's right.

599
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,195
I got out last month.

600
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,031
Are you here to see a doctor?

601
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,616
Or to arrest someone?

602
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,076
No, I…

603
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,161
Are you here for Gyeong-hun? He's inside.

604
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,413
Want me to get him?

605
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,622
No, it's okay.

606
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,292
I was just passing by.

607
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,552
Hey, Hyeon-u!

608
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,387
Min Hyeon-u!

609
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,223
-Hello, ma'am.
-Goodness.

610
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,475
Mr. Heo, what brings you here?

611
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,354
I came to thank Hyeon-u
for something he did.

612
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,940
-And I missed you.
-Oh, goodness!

613
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,650
Thank you so much.

614
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,776
It's red ginseng.

615
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,570
Hey, you're home.

616
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,448
Here.

617
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,524
Where did Hyeon-u see Yun-jin?

618
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,737
I think he was originally following
Oh Chi-hyeon and not Yun-jin.

619
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,280
Oh Chi-hyeon?

620
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,531
How does Hyeon-u know him?

621
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,493
Yun-jin yelled, "Oh Chi-hyeon!"
while getting kidnapped,

622
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,120
and Hyeon-u heard her.

623
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,830
Where did he see Oh Chi-hyeon?

624
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,708
I don't know, and I didn't ask.

625
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,181
Why are you here?

626
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,955
Are you okay?

627
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,206
Yes.

628
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,250
I'm just out of breath.

629
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,502
Have you been eating?

630
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,630
Do you want one?

631
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,967
You returned the money
minus the cost of the beef.

632
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,219
Did you meet Oh Chi-hyeon?

633
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,804
Yes.

634
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,681
Why?

635
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,849
I had to ask him something.

636
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,726
Why would I give him money for the beef?

637
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,980
It was compensation for mental distress
due to being kidnapped.

638
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,482
Did he tell you
I took out the cost of the beef?

639
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,819
Jeez, he's such a petty guy.

640
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,112
I'm glad I didn't have any.

641
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,700
-Jeez.
-Give it to me.

642
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,789
This is really big.

643
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,042
Is anyone home?

644
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,671
-Hey.
-Goodness.

645
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,798
What brings you two here?

646
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,301
Why are you here?

647
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,928
-Here, I'll take that.
-No, it's okay.

648
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,222
I'll be back
after I take this down for her.

649
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,141
-Head inside.
-Go inside and wait.

650
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,768
Jeez.

651
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,774
Did you skip school today too?

652
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,568
I went this morning.

653
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,571
Do you know Oh Chi-hyeon?

654
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,620
It's this person.

655
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,624
Yes, I know him.

656
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,962
Do you recognize any of these faces?

657
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,802
No.

658
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,722
How do you know Oh Chi-hyeon?

659
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,433
-I've seen him once.
-Where?

660
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,560
At Loraine Hotel.

661
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,020
Why did you go there?

662
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,982
Did Park Jun-seo send you on an errand?

663
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,402
-Yes.
-What errand?

664
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,407
Delivering drugs?

665
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,410
Yes.

666
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,332
Was the name of that drug Xinopam?

667
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,085
XINOPAM

668
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,461
Xinopam?

669
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,672
Xinopam is a narcotic pain reliever,

670
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,466
but a defective batch was delivered
to Woonjong Medical Center.

671
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,385
Where did you see
Oh Chi-hyeon two days ago?

672
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,261
A cold storage warehouse in Pilo-dong.

673
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
What's the name?

674
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,431
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

675
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,183
Yeongryun Cold Storage?

676
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,144
Is that where you met Park Jun-seo
for drug deliveries?

677
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,396
Yes.

678
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,980
Why go there all of a sudden?

679
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,575
I got a call from this number
two days ago.

680
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,037
This is the number Mr. Jun-seo
first called me from.

681
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,632
So she received
a big prescription of painkillers.

682
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,926
How did you know
there were issues with the drugs

683
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,761
we supplied to Woonjong Medical Center?

684
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,472
Did you talk to them?

685
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,641
They just hung up without a word.

686
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,519
The phone has been turned off since.

687
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,772
That's why I went to Pilo-dong.

688
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,940
Just in case.

689
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,484
Is the 230910 at the top a date?

690
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,028
Yes, I don't get the name of the customer,

691
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,739
so I save the number
based on the delivery product and date.

692
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,032
Hey, this date…

693
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,619
That's the day Woonjong Medical Center

694
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,872
prescribed defective drugs
to Ms. Park Bok-rye.

695
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,958
But Jun-seo knows better

696
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,336
than to make a high school student
deliver narcotic pain relievers.

697
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,632
Did something happen to him that day?

698
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,386
His daughter was very ill.

699
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,306
He was supposed to go himself.

700
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,974
-Is Yun-hui the same?
-But he made me do it instead.

701
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,146
Did Park Jun-seo have you deliver
more drugs afterward?

702
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,439
No.

703
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,025
He wouldn't have paid your tuition
and opened his office here

704
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,527
just because you ran one errand for him.

705
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,282
Where are the drugs?

706
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,493
What drugs?

707
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,245
The ones I told you
to deliver to Loraine Hotel first.

708
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,623
-Where did you siphon them off to?
-I didn't take them.

709
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,459
Tell me. It's not too late,
so just tell me.

710
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,628
I don't know.
I delivered them like you told me to.

711
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,881
You didn't come
straight from the hospital.

712
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,090
Where did you stop by?

713
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,634
I know you did.

714
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,969
Who did you give them to? Tell me now!

715
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,888
I said I don't know!

716
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,601
This is your last chance.

717
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,436
Tell me now.

718
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,271
Who did you give them to?

719
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,649
Where are those drugs?

720
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,777
-Tell me now.
-Hyeon-u!

721
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,362
No.

722
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,613
Why are you doing this?

723
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,490
-Hyeon-u!
-Go back inside.

724
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,119
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

725
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,204
Are you sure?

726
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,875
Oh, my poor Hyeon-u.

727
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,128
Hello?

728
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,506
I heard you called, Mr. Park.

729
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,424
The eight boxes of drugs arrived safely.

730
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,308
Do you still have all of the drugs?

731
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,020
They haven't been prescribed yet, right?

732
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,022
What?

733
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,567
We've already prescribed them all.

734
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,651
Why do you ask?

735
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,824
I'll be right over.

736
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,317
You're home.

737
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,583
Did you treat the cuts?

738
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,087
How old are you?

739
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,798
You paid for my injuries,
so you can go now.

740
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
Your name is Hyeon-u, right?

741
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,971
I'm sorry.

742
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,726
I acted too rashly,
and it was immature of me.

743
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,979
I'm sorry.

744
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,273
Forgive me.

745
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,950
That was the first time

746
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,078
an adult asked me for forgiveness.

747
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,582
Did Jun-seo return after that?

748
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,250
No.

749
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,629
I went to him instead.

750
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,007
Mr. Jun-seo said
I shouldn't get close to him,

751
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,884
but sometimes you need an adult.

752
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,596
That's when I went to see him.

753
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,518
Then do you know
how Woonjong Medical Center

754
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,895
received a batch of defective drugs?

755
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:44,523
He never told me in detail,

756
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,317
but the drugs I delivered to Loraine Hotel

757
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,695
might've gotten switched with others.

758
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:56,034
They got mixed up
when I slipped on the wet road.

759
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,829
I think

760
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,540
it caused trouble for him afterwards.

761
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,418
So the drugs that should've gone
to Loraine Hotel

762
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,421
went to Ms. Park Bok-rye instead.

763
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,174
Do you know why

764
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,052
Mr. Jun-seo killed himself?

765
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,432
Was it because

766
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,351
his daughter had passed away before him?

767
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,729
I'm not sure.

768
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,773
Was he nice to me…

769
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,444
because he felt sorry for me?

770
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,029
I don't think so.

771
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,701
Jun-seo was a lonely person,

772
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,996
but he thought of you as a friend.

773
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,873
That's probably why.

774
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,253
-Take this.
-What's this?

775
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,714
Here.

776
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,383
Those are Lee Myeong-guk's work logs.

777
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,719
Read them carefully
and come by my place tomorrow evening.

778
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,928
What's this?

779
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,265
Are we forming
some joint investigation unit?

780
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,729
Okay. See you tomorrow.

781
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,356
Can I get a ride down the hill?

782
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,525
Sure. My car's over there.

783
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,986
I'll take you there.

784
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,863
I have something to tell you on the way.

785
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,699
Oh, okay.

786
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,868
I'll go with him then.

787
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,870
Okay. Take care.

788
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,290
What?

789
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,209
Go on.

790
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,460
See you.

791
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,384
-That was pretty smooth.
-What do you mean?

792
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,346
You want to go together
to Yeongryun Cold Storage, right?

793
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,975
We need to go somewhere first.

794
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:52,275
SEODONG INTERNAL MEDICINE CLINIC

795
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,987
You want me to go in there?

796
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,197
Yes.

797
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,950
But I don't have any weight to lose!

798
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,120
Don't tell me

799
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,500
you want me to pretend to be a druggie?

800
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,054
How can I help you?

801
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,392
Well, the thing is…

802
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,940
I was hoping to get a prescription

803
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,776
for an appetite suppressant.

804
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,996
How many days' worth do you need?

805
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,208
What?

806
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,377
MEDICINE

807
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:56,882
Gosh, there's a lot.

808
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,258
Just go already.

809
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,427
Thank you.

810
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,138
Put your seat belt on.

811
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:04,890
Fine.

Hello.

815
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,488
I'm Jang Jae-gyeong
from Anhyeon Police Station.

816
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,491
Hello, I'm Oh Yun-jin
from Anhyeon Economic Daily.

817
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,120
What brings you here?

818
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,580
What is this place?

819
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,000
It's a cold storage warehouse.

820
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,543
Can we see it?

821
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,588
I'm not sure if that's up to me to decide.

822
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,798
And I think

823
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,343
you're supposed to have a warrant

824
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,887
or something like that.

825
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,680
You're right about that, sir.

826
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,641
But we're not here to search it.

827
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:51,144
We'll just take a quick look
and see what's stored here.

828
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,774
Excuse me, sir.

829
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,859
You must be tired. Please drink this.

830
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:02,447
Just for a minute then, okay?

831
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,573
Yes, of course.

832
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,450
Thank you, sir.

833
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,303
Right now, this is the only unit
being used for cold storage.

834
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,722
The rest contain general products.

835
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,479
-Is this everything?
-Yes.

836
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,232
Do you mind leaving now?

837
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,400
I have to clock out.

838
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,902
Yes, sir.

839
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,953
Hey.

840
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,623
What do you think you're doing?

841
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,338
What are you doing?
You said you'd only look around.

842
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,133
Leave now.

843
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,217
Hurry up.

844
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,802
What in the world?

845
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,351
What were you looking for?

846
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,103
A drug manufacturing lab?

847
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,024
Even if there was one,
they probably moved it.

848
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:24,070
Hey, those drugs Jun-seo
tried delivering to Oh Chi-hyeon

849
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,948
were probably for Won Jong-soo, right?

850
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,369
Damn it, what do we do now?

APARTMENT SALES

852
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,124
If Ms. Park Bok-rye died
from taking the drugs

853
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,251
that were meant for Jong-soo,

854
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,920
that would be a huge exclusive.

855
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,466

Come on.

868
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,800
Where's he going now?

00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,100
RICE MILL

870
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,022
-Hello?
-Captain.

871
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,690
I reviewed reports
received in the vicinity

872
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,068
on the day
of the rice mill owner's murder.

873
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,196
Right after the incident occurred,

874
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,782
someone reported seeing a taxi driver
parked at Jeongji-dong public park

875
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:54,577
and washing blood off his hands
in a public restroom.

876
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:59,791
But the report came from the parents
of an elementary school student witness.

877
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:03,044
Since they didn't see it themselves,
and the child wasn't injured,

878
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,004
the precinct just brushed it off.

879

RICE MILL

880
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,935
This CCTV camera only shows the crosswalk.

881
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,649
Did you see that?

882
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:26,359
See what? What do you mean?

883
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,777
This man right here.

884
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,612
This man who tried to cross

885
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,282
at the crosswalk at 5:15 p.m.

886
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,783
He's trying to avoid something.

887
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,410
Oh, right!

888
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,995
It must be a car.

889
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,502
A car drove through the rice mill alley
and got to the main road…

890
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,508
and went straight!

891
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,261
He didn't turn left or right.
He went straight.

892
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,139
Where does the alley
the car entered lead to?

893
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,599
Yeongryun Cold Storage.

894
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,059
It leads to a road in front
of an old cold storage warehouse.

895
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,770
He had to drive the wrong way down
the one-way street to get there.

896
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,148
Going straight would've taken him
to the main road again.

897
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,401
Had he done that,
he would've been caught on camera.

898
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:13,698
YEONGRYUN COLD STORAGE

899
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,866
However,

900
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,951
there was a small side road there.

901
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,788
I wasn't sure
if a car could drive through,

902
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,165
but then I saw tire tracks.

903
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,009
It was wide enough
for a car to get through,

904
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,928
and it continued for about 700 m.

905
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,181
APPROX. 700 METERS

906
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,143
At the end of it

907
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:45,605
was a main road leading
to either Jeongji-dong or Join-dong.

908
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,983
JOIN-DONG, JEONGJI-DONG

909
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,946
CCTV

910
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,283
JEONGJI-DONG
THREE-WAY INTERSECTION

911
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,118
Is this the footage we just got?

912
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,163
This is footage from one block
behind the one we watched.

913
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,875
It was quite some distance away,
so we couldn't check it before.

914
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,921
The alley connects to this road.

915
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,259
JEONGJI-DONG
THREE-WAY INTERSECTION

916
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,013
The taxi.

917
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,745
CONDOLENCES

918
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,539
It's 34A 5253.

919
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,124
It's a private taxi.

920
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,794
Please check who the owner is immediately.

921
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,879
Yes.

922
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,766
You…

923
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,686
Who are you?

924
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,861
Is this revenge
for getting kicked out of school?

925
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,071
Si-jeong.

926
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,239
You're doing well.

927
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,865
Remember not to take
more than two at a time.

928
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,410
What if they're using you

929
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,120
to get rid of Won Jong-soo?

930
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,289
We have to show them
we're the future owners of our companies.

931
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,166
He tested me to see
if you ordered me to do it.

932
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,002
Tae-jin, it'll be all over
if we get caught up in this!

933
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,255
Sir, I'm confident I can do this.

934
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,381
You keep crossing the line.

935
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,174
You and I are in the same boat, sir.

936
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,844
If Park Tae-jin is getting desperate,

937
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,388
there's a chance he'll open up today.

938
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,808
He'll do anything to get Choi Ji-yeon
to give him the password.

939
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,727
I said I'd stop
after making 500 million won.

940
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,271
-Jun-seo…
-Is this why you killed Jun-seo?

941
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,690
-Damn it!
-Are you sure we're not in it?

942
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,067
-This is in front of my house.
-Jae-gyeong already knew.

943
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,570
It's mine as far as I'm concerned.

944
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,030
-The payout belongs to the beneficiaries.
-What?

945
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,950
You have no right to say I have no shame!

946
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:33,750
