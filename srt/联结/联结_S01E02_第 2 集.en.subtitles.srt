1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,907
Are you Jang Jae-gyeong?

3
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,366
Yes, sir.

4
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,538
Is everything in the police report
that you filed true?

5
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,374
Did you witness it yourself?

6
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,170
Jun-seo.

7
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,216
You saw it. Tell them what you saw.

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,301
The report states

9
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,846
that Park Jun-seo witnessed the scene.

10
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,181
Is this true?

11
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,142
Did you really witness it?

12
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,359
I didn't see anything.

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
Jun-seo!

14
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,695
I…

15
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,157
I didn't see anything.

16
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,702
I didn't see anything.

17
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,050
It's not true.

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,135
Yes, it is.

19
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,970
I didn't see anything.

20
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,766
You're lying.

21
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,895
Don't lie.

22
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,188
It's not true.

23
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,233
I didn't see anything.

24
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,902
Jun-seo…

25
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,970
Is there footage showing
where he goes after?

26
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,141
He doesn't appear on CCTV
after vanishing from the hallway.

27
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,520
CAPTAIN JANG JAE-GYEONG

28
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,982
The phone is turned off.

29
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,110
After the beep,
you will be connected to voicemail.

30
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,823
-Please check it.
-Yes, sir.

31
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,995
Is he really a police officer?

32
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,246
Yes, he is.

33
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,374
Have you contacted him? What did he say?

34
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,919
I can't contact him at the moment.

35
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,045
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,630
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,924
He became violent in the emergency room.

38
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,343
It's a felony to disrupt
a room full of patients.

39
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,053
On top of that,

40
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,138
you're telling me you can't contact him?

41
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,765
Please calm down for now.

42
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,851
I'll find out what happened
and get back to you.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,561
That's not right.

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,855
You seem to be covering
for a fellow officer,

45
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,191
but you can't just let this slide.

46
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,276
Look at this.
I got hurt when he pushed me.

47
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,861
I apologize.

48
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,364
I'll look into it and update you,
so please wait.

49
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,741
He looked like an addict.

50
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,245
When you're in the ER,

51
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,623
you come across people who have overdosed.

52
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,792
That's what he looked like.

53
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,087
His breathing was unsteady,
and he looked pale.

54
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,506
That police officer was definitely--

55
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,216
Is that why you drew my blood?

56
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,970
I never gave my consent,

57
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,430
nor did I get a warrant authorizing such.

58
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,724
I had no needle marks on my arm either.

59
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,602
Dr. Lee Yeong-u,
what made you decide to draw my blood?

60
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,981
When people on drugs come to the ER,

61
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,609
we ask for their cooperation
and get their blood samples

62
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,278
before the police arrive.

63
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:43,283
Whether they get a warrant afterward
is none of my business.

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,492
What's your department?

65
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,995
You don't look like an intern.
Maybe a resident?

66
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
Why do you ask?

67
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,207
Is this a drug case?

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,917
Based on what I saw--

69
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,586
Do those symptoms prove
that this is a drug-related case?

70
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,299
Aside from your short ER experience,
do you have objective proof?

71
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,883
No, I don't, but…

72
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,762
Then why did you
get rid of your blood sample?

73
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
Isn't it obvious?

74
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,598
You drew blood without my consent.

75
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,518
It's illegal for you to test it
however you want.

76
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,937
-But--
-Detective Kim.

77
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,106
He thinks I used drugs.

78
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,946
I guess ten years of working in Narcotics
have made me look like a drug addict.

79
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,156
Look here.

80
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,701
I'm Senior Inspector Jang Jae-gyeong
of the Anhyeon Police Narcotics Unit.

81
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,537
I don't do drugs.
I arrest the ones who do them.

82
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,625
I had sudden indigestion earlier,

83
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,045
so I got angry when you drew my blood

84
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,213
without my consent.

85
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,550
-You got hurt because of me?
-Yes.

86
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,885
I am so sorry.

87
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,053
Okay.

88
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,773
Send us a copy of the CCTV footage,

89
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,733
and check the ER footage
from when he entered.

90
00:05:58,816 --> 00:05:59,776
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,415
Do you feel better now?

92
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,958
Yes, I do.

93
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,753
Did you look into that phone number?

94
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,630
It's from a burner phone.

95
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,882
-Did you trace it?
-It has been turned off.

96
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,842
I checked its last location,

97
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,552
but the caller was on the move.

98
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,097
And the red hair clip woman?
Did you get a sketch?

99
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,599
Her statement is a bit inconsistent.

100
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,184
What about the guy I chased?

101
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,436
It's not done yet.
I'll send it to you when it is.

102
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,984
By the way, what was that in the ER?

103
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,655
I told you.

104
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,865
They took my blood without consent.

105
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,785
You created quite the mess in there.

106
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,789
You're lucky it turned out okay.
If not, you would've been in big trouble.

107
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,252
I don't think you came
because you were sick.

108
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,587
So why are you here?

109
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,048
None of your business.

110
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,897
Take it easy.

111
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,316
I'll say you went home because you're ill.

112
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,444
Get some rest.

113
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,363
The door is opening.

114
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,957
The door is closing.

115
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,015
WARD 31

116
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,350
Nurse Lee, can you come with me?

117
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
Yes.

118
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,406
Captain.

119
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,829
I need a word with him,
so go get something to drink.

120
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,166
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,969
JANG CHEOL-GU

122
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,851
You said you wanted to see me.

123
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,936
Did I?

124
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,065
Why would I want to see your face?

125
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,818
How do you know Park Jun-seo?

126
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Park Jun-seo?

127
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,284
I get it.

128
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,373
You'll never properly walk again,
so you were angry.

129
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,708
Is that why you wanted revenge?

130
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,337
You've seen this before, right?

131
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,305
No.

132
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,934
And what do you mean by revenge?

133
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
Who did you hire?

134
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
What is it?

135
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,608
Is somebody harassing you, Captain Jang?

136
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,572
I'd like to thank that person.

137
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,992
I'd get revenge on my own if I could.

138
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,618
But this here…

139
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,830
Do something about this, will you?

140
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,957
If you do,

141
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,417
I'll show you.

142
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,045
Why did you kill Park Jun-seo?

143
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,969
So he's dead?

144
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,225
I wonder who this Park Jun-seo is.

145
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,644
It's interesting to see

146
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:09,609
how you dropped by out of the blue
to ask about him.

147
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,867
Do you like men, by any chance?

148
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,703
Well, why didn't you say so?

149
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,455
Had I known,

150
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,957
we wouldn't be
in this situation right now.

151
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,555
Oh, come on.

152
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,475
What are you doing?

153
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,937
Hey, I don't know who he is.

154
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,733
Hey, I said I don't know
who that bastard is!

155
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,110
Hey, officers! You idiots!

156
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,779
Do something about this bastard!

157
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,238
Hey, officers!

158
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,909
Stop this bastard!

159
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,752
Don't move.

160
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,005
One wrong move,
and you'll be on a feeding tube forever.

161
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,256
No.

162
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,383
It wasn't me!

163
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,511
Did you send the text
about the Jeonghoon Station handoff?

164
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,971
Or did you have Park Jun-seo
or someone else do it?

165
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,515
Who was it? I want a name.

166
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,642
I've never heard of him before!

167
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,977
You killed Park Jun-seo.

168
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,897
No, I didn't!
I've never heard of that name!

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,315
It was you.

170
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,609
You gave the orders.

171
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,444
This is your last chance.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,071
One.

173
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,200
-Two.
-It wasn't me!

174
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,077
It wasn't me!

175
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,745
It wasn't me!

176
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,428
I told you it wasn't me, you bastard.

177
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,974
Then who did it? I want a name.

178
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,185
I don't know.

179
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,148
That drug!

180
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,150
I've heard about that drug.

181
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,235
Who's the distributor?

182
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,738
CEO Yoon.

183
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,949
CEO Yoon?

184
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,075
Is he Doctor?

185
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,286
I have no idea.

186
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,289
Does CEO Yoon only distribute drugs?

187
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,457
What about production?

188
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,167
Just distribution.

189
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,378
They'll sell anything
that will make them money.

190
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,088
Where can I meet them?

191
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,299
I don't know.

192
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,428
I swear! I really don't know!

193
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,944
They only distribute online.

194
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,906
I don't know their face
or where they live.

195
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,325
And they might be CEO Yoon right now.

196
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,536
But tomorrow,

197
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,914
they might be CEO Kim or CEO Lee.

198
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,791
Who knows?

199
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,294
And Park Jun-seo?

200
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,720
I swear I've never heard that name before.

201
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,139
If I could kill anyone,

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,058
I'd kill you first.

203
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,437
Why would I kill that bastard?

204
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,353
Boss.

205
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,147
You should be in hiding right now.

206
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
What if Doctor did that to give us up

207
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,068
to the police
and work directly with CEO Yoon?

208
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,491
Boss.

209
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,846
Long time no see,

210
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,972
CEO Yoon.

211
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,732
I can tell you're not happy to see me.

212
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,276
The drugs?

213
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,363
I'm sure you've heard of the difficulty
in obtaining raw materials,

214
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,240
so I'll need more time.

215
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,785
Mr. Gong Jin-uk.

216
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,412
CEO Yoon.

217
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,915
You're well aware

218
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,002
that the moment we contact them first,
the deal with Doctor will end.

219
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,546
Please wait a little longer.

220
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,175
It's not like there's another drug
that can replace lemon pop right now.

221
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,518
Can I trust that you still deal
with Doctor directly?

222
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,479
Seeing how

223
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,440
they're not directly dealing with you,

224
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,070
it must mean
they want to continue business with me.

225
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,082
The wire is too short,
so I came to switch it.

226
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,042
Okay.

227
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,511
I'll finish up now.

228
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,595
Okay.

229
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,112
What are your plans now?

230
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,447
It'll be ready by this week.

231
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,867
Have it ready by midnight tomorrow.

232
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,453
If you're late,

233
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,998
I'll stop distributing lemon pop

234
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,376
and focus on hunting down people instead.

235
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,920
And I'll make sure

236
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,091
to reserve this room
under both your names.

237
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,011
Help me!

238
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,679
Understood.

239
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,598
I'll see you tomorrow.

240
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,153
Wasn't Doctor going to drop him

241
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,321
and directly deal with us instead?

242
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,743
That's why we kidnapped
Jang Jae-gyeong and drugged him.

243
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,079
What's this grudge Doctor has
against Jang Jae-gyeong?

244
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,963
Where near Anhyeon City Station
should I drop you off?

245
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,090
Oh, right.

246
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,263
Over there is fine.

247
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,653
ANHYEON CITY HALL

248
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,550
If you came here late last night,

249
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,677
the night patrol officers
would've found you.

250
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,723
It's more likely you came early morning
when the trains start running.

251
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,683
Let's look at that time frame then.

252
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,768
Yes, sir.

253
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,039
I can't zoom in any more than this.

254
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,088
Show me the area near the elevator.

255
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,047
Yes, sir.

256
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,100
They both appear to be around 180 cm tall

257
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,977
and weigh over 80 kg.

258
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,771
Let's see here.

259
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,359
What is he looking at?

260
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,486
The door at platform 3-4.

261
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,781
Hold on.

262
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,242
Can we see this from a different camera?

263
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,869
Is there another camera angle?

264
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,203
Just a minute, sir.

265
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,339
This is it, sir.

266
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,221
ANHYEON CITY STATION
CCTV CONTROL CENTER

267
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,390
I'd like a copy of these files.

268
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,308
Yes, sir.

269
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,852
ANHYEON POLICE STATION
JANG JAE-GYEONG

270
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,395
Please send it here.

271
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,740
JEONGHOON STATION

272
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,243
Those men knew a handoff would take place

273
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,579
at Jeonghoon Station, platform 3-4.

274
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,918
And they wanted me
to get on the train from there.

275
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,672
Which means they wanted me
to arrest the man in the black cap.

276
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
Who is CEO Yoon?

277
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,510
And who's Doctor?

278
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
Is that man CEO Yoon?

279
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,768
Are they using me
to get rid of a rival gang?

280
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,523
Someone sent me this text
to get me to platform 3-4.

281
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,526
And someone kidnapped and drugged me.

282
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,781
Those two people

283
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,200
are one and the same.

284
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,326
Then…

285
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,828
One-eight-eight-two.

286
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,164
Jae-gyeong.

287
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,501
You still remember our SOS signal, right?

288
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
One-eight-eight-two.

289
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,173
But…

290
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,634
Park Jun-seo is dead.

291
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,936
Did he leave behind a suicide note
or anything?

292
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,398
All they found were
a pair of shoes on the ninth floor.

293
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,650
Don't they work on Saturdays
at construction sites?

294
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,278
Why wasn't the body found until Monday?

295
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,572
They couldn't work over the weekend

296
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,366
because of a civil complaint.

297
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,453
No postmortem yet, right?

298
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,664
Actually,

299
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,667
I was surprised to hear
the exam was already done.

300
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,211
The body should be
at the Anhyeon University Hospital morgue.

301
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,547
Which prosecutor did the postmortem?

302
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,923
Just a moment, please.

303
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,593
His name is Park Tae-jin.

304
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,554
He's deputy chief prosecutor
of Detective Division One.

305
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,479
What was the cause of death?

306
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,607
As you can see,
he fell from the ninth floor.

307
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,318
So there's no way to tell the cause.

308
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,122
PROSECUTOR PARK TAE-JIN

309
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,000
Hello, sir.

310
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,170
Is that so?

311
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,839
That's how we'll handle it then.

312
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,716
Yes, sir.

313
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,134
By the way,

314
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,304
it turns out the deceased Park Jun-seo

315
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,806
and Senior Inspector Jang Jae-gyeong
from our police station

316
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,559
went to high school together.

317
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,687
Didn't you say you graduated
from Jeogang High School as well?

318
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,523
You're all of the same age.

319
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,736
Excuse me?

320
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,240
Captain Jang.

321
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,702
It's time for you to leave.

322
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,288
I'll leave after I check a few things.

323
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,624
-So--
-Hey.

324
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,919
If I'm being honest here,

325
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,421
we shouldn't have to
explain every detail to you.

326
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,966
We only helped out
because you said he was your friend.

327
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,597
That's enough. Go now.

328
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,028
Hey, get back here!

329
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,448
-Jang Jae-gyeong!
-Get him!

330
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,658
Stop, you bastard!

331
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,787
Captain Jang!

332
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,122
Move over. Jang Jae-gyeong!

333
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,915
Open the door!

334
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,251
Open the door, you crazy bastard!

335
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,628
You think you'll get away with this?

336
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,171
PARK TAE-JIN

337
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,840
The estimated time of death

338
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,801
is between 11:30 p.m.
and midnight last Friday.

339
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,679
What are you doing?

340
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,680
Captain!

341
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,932
What do you think you're doing?

342
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,142
OH YUN-JIN

343
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,101
Damn it.

344
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,435
Damn it!

345
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,313
Why, you…

346
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,899
Come out, you bastard!

347
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,822
You bastard.

348
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,448
How dare you disrespect me?

349
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,004
That crazy bastard.

350
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,298
Hello, sir.

351
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,310
PARK TAE-JIN

352
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,401
Looks like you took the pill.

353
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,527
Chang-su.

354
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,280
Remember the number I asked you to trace?

355
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,489
-For the burner phone.
-Yes, sir.

356
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,491
I'll buy some time. Track down the phone.

357
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,576
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,038
Who are you?

359
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,124
This is an emergency request
for a phone location.

360
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,001
The number is 010-0325-1533.

361
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,253
I'll stay on the line until you…

362
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,588
Guess who.

363
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,634
How do you know about 1-8-8-2?

364
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,969
GUESS WHO?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT 1882?

365
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,804
Because it's me.

366
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,683
Park Jun-seo is dead.

367
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,353
I never said I was Park Jun-seo.

368
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,356
Where will you go next?

369
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,857
To Park Jun-seo's funeral?

370
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,985
Or to catch the guy
you lost at the subway station?

371
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,909
What's Park Jun-seo's connection to drugs?

372
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,162
Why did you make me an addict?

373
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,748
Anything?

374
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,212
You'll find out as you go.

375
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,673
As his friend,
shouldn't you go to his funeral first?

376
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,466
Bye now.

377
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,344
Did you get the location?

378
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,013
The caller was on the move again.

379
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,016
But they were heading toward
Jeongji-dong from Anhyeon Stream.

380
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,226
Jeongji-dong?

381
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,144
The exam was already done.

382
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,438
The body should be
at Anhyeon University Hospital morgue.

383
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,149
Anhyeon University Hospital.

384
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,368
ANHYEON POLICE
JANG JAE-GYEONG

385
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,412
DECEASED: PARK JUN-SEO

386
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,163
The body was handed over.

387
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,290
What?

388
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,875
It was handed over
to the family an hour ago.

389
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,919
Without an autopsy?

390
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,797
Yes, the prosecutor said
he got the family's consent

391
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,758
to forego an autopsy
and carry out the funeral immediately.

392
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,594
Which prosecutor did the postmortem?

393
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,638
His name is Park Tae-jin,

394
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,931
deputy chief prosecutor
of Detective Division One.

395
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,767
Thank you.

396
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,610

397
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,779

SEONGHAN BANK

399
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,993
Verifying your card information.

400
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,412
Please select the amount
you would like to withdraw.

401
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,004
Damn it.

402
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:11,921
100,000 WON

403
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,132
Jeez, you scared me.

404
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,258
Jang Jae-gyeong.

405
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,760
OH YUN-JIN

406
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,803
What did you and Park Jun-seo
talk about on February 22nd?

407
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,472
What?

408
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,350
Don't you remember talking to him
on Thursday, February 22nd?

409
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,854
What did you talk about
the day before Jun-seo died?

410
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,823
MISSED CALL:
PARK JUN-SEO

411
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,243
Yun-jin.

412
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,090
It was a missed call,
and I forgot to call him back.

413
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,299
You forgot?

414
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,095
A friend you don't keep in touch with
suddenly calls, but you forgot?

415
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,807
These things happen.

416
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,394
And you're the one
who doesn't keep in touch with friends.

417
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,105
It wasn't often,
but Jun-seo and I called each other

418
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,023
once every couple of months.

419
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,112
It's true!

420
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,531
Hey.

421
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,242
Are you here to pay your respects
or to interrogate me?

422
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,371
I'm upset enough as it is
after hearing he'd taken his own life.

423
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,499
Why are you making a fuss out of nowhere?

424
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,253
THE LATE PARK JUN-SEO
SPOUSE: CHOI JI-YEON

425
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,925
Please remove your card.

426
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,593
What?

427
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,971
-Thank you.
-Damn, I have to start over.

428
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,772
FUNERAL HALL 1

429
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,411
Are you here to pay your respects?

430
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,497
Yes.

431
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,000
Nobody is here right now.

432
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,211
They're over there.

433
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,312
SHROUDING ROOM

434
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,356
Hey, where are you going?

435
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,941
-What is it?
-Stop right now.

436
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,318
Who the hell are you?

437
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,737
How dare you make a scene here?

438
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,032
-I'm a police officer. Let go.
-A police officer?

439
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,242
Hey, it's Jae-gyeong.

440
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,702
Jang Jae-gyeong.

441
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,912
Jang Jae-gyeong?

442
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,695
Stop the shrouding process.

443
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,239
There will be an autopsy.

444
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,369
We need an autopsy.

445
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,788
Too many things are suspicious
about Jun-seo's death.

446
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,831
Please allow an autopsy.

447
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,415
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong.

448
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,085
Who are you to ask for an autopsy?

449
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,878
Who do you think you are? Get out.

450
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,384
Park Jun-seo's estimated time of death

451
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,720
is between 11:30 p.m. and midnight
on February 23rd, 2024.

452
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,805
He fell at a construction site

453
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,182
resulting in a skull fracture
and organ damage.

454
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,809
-Jang Jae-gyeong.
-What's strange is

455
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,145
Jun-seo's shoes were on the ninth floor
where he supposedly jumped from,

456
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,816
but the elevator
was on the first floor, not the ninth.

457
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,276
What's so strange about that?

458
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,206
Jong-soo.

459
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,101
Jae-gyeong.

460
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,519
It's been a long time.

461
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,813
It's me, Won Jong-soo.

462
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,904
Won Jong-soo at 10:10 p.m..

463
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
It's been long for you too, right?

464
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,409
Right.

465
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,287
The last I saw him
was in high school 20 years ago.

466
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,581
I'm Tae-jin. You remember me, right?

467
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,751
I now work for the Criminal Department
of Anhyeon District Prosecutors' Office.

468
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,003
Park Tae-jin at 10:18 p.m.

469
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,424
I didn't expect to run into you.

470
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,426
Oh Chi-hyeon at 10:30 p.m.

471
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,310
Why did you go to the postmortem?

472
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,021
What?

473
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,904
I had time.

474
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,199
A deputy chief prosecutor
attended a postmortem because he had time?

475
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,700
Not because it was Park Jun-seo?

476
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,078
Even a deputy chief prosecutor
should go if he's told to.

477
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,038
But is it strange

478
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,625
for a prosecutor to attend a postmortem?

479
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,630
Fine. Let's say that it's normal.

480
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,925
So how was it?

481
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,218
Jang Jae-gyeong.

482
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,469
I asked you how it was.

483
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,393
Let's drop it.

484
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,603
This isn't the right place
to talk about it.

485
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,481
What made you decide it was suicide?

486
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,775
Tae-jin just told you to drop it!

487
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,361
Yun-ho.

488
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,159
Must you cause a scene
at our friend's funeral?

489
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,912
Did you find footprints
on the stairs to the ninth floor?

490
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,667
They didn't find any matching
Jun-seo's shoes at the construction site.

491
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,336
So tell me why you're sure it was suicide.

492
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,172
There was circumstantial evidence.

493
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,424
Circumstantial evidence?

494
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,592
Jun-seo's daughter, Yun-hui.

495
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,721
He cared for her for six years
until she died, and he was devastated.

496
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,099
He said it was a struggle
to get through each day.

497
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,520
So he went to a psychiatrist
to treat his depression.

498
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,564
Hey, you guys. That's enough.

499
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,028
You didn't know
what Jun-seo was going through.

500
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,281
We're just as upset as you are.

501
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,578
He had it rough until he died.
Let's not add an autopsy to that.

502
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,789
Let them finish shrouding him.

503
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,207
And we'll go talk outside.

504
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,418
Please continue.

505
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,794
Next is--

506
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,337
Nobody move!

507
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,551
Hey, Jang Jae-gyeong!

508
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,929
Wow.

509
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,557
You guys are hilarious.

510
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,687
So he didn't tell you why he wanted to die
right before committing suicide?

511
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,939
You're sure it was suicide
based on the circumstances?

512
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,029
Come on.
You say the circumstances prove it,

513
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,865
but why won't anyone mention
the most important part?

514
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,408
Well?

515
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,538
The people Jun-seo spoke to last
on the phone right before he died.

516
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,456
Won Jong-soo.

517
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,209
Park Tae-jin.

518
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,418
Oh Chi-hyeon.

519
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,838
The estimated time of suicide
is between 11:30 p.m. and midnight.

520
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,466
The three of you
spoke to him after 10:10 p.m.

521
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,094
If he really committed suicide,
what would he have said on the phone?

522
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,222
Wouldn't you have sensed
something was odd?

523
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,934
When I asked what convinced you
that he died from suicide,

524
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,479
the first thing you should've mentioned
was the call you got from Jun-seo.

525
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,106
But why are you all hiding that fact?

526
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,274
Hey, you!

527
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,068
Who do you think you are?

528
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,237
Where do you get off
playing detective here?

529
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,196
Jung Yun-ho.

530
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,157
Stop.

531
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,370
Why does that matter right now?

532
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,915
It wasn't unusual for Jun-seo
to talk to us on the phone.

533
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,500
Did you know

534
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,086
that we called each other
a dozen times a day?

535
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,714
You got expelled after trying
to stab your friends in the back!

536
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,260
Then you somehow became a cop
and now act all high and mighty?

537
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,512
It's not "we."

538
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,013
What?

539
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,557
He didn't call you.

540
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,978
What is it? Do you feel left out?

541
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,354
You bastard.

542
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,647
Hey.

543
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,276
-Damn it.
-Jung Yun-ho.

544
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,240
Jun-seo could've been drugged and pushed.

545
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,783
Even if that didn't happen,

546
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,369
deaths like this
always require an autopsy.

547
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,537
But why refuse it?

548
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,584
Why are all of you
rushing his funeral without an autopsy?

549
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,210
Did he say something on the phone?

550
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,129
What did he say to make you act this way?

551
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,505
That's right. He called me.

552
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,594
I didn't know about Tae-jin and Chi-hyeon.
He just called to say hello.

553
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,471
After Yun-hui died,

554
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,932
he always sounded sad,
and it was the same that day.

555
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,895
I offered to get him some tonic
and told him to be strong.

556
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,857
Park Jun-seo was my friend.

557
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,860
That was my last call with him,

558
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,571
so I wanted to keep it to myself.

559
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,489
That's why I didn't say anything.
Satisfied now?

560
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,491
That makes no sense.

561
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,286
You don't think it's weird?

562
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
One hour before he committed suicide,

563
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,667
Jun-seo called to see
how each of you were doing?

564
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,212
Why would he call to see how you're doing?

565
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,548
Park Tae-jin. Oh Chi-hyeon.
Did Jun-seo ask how you were doing too?

566
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,883
Jang Jae-gyeong.

567
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,513
Get a hold of yourself.

568
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,975
-Hey!
-Stop it!

569
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,812
Everyone, please stop!

570
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:17,860
What are you doing
in front of your friend's dead body?

571
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,071
And you call yourselves his friend?

572
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,870
Yun-hui's father…

573
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,664
I didn't get a single call from him.

574
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,627
Whatever the call was about,
at least you got one from him!

575
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,545
I didn't even get that much!

576
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,848
PARK JUN SEO
STORED ON FEBRUARY 26TH, 2024

577
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,986
Did you really have to do that?

578
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,405
What do you mean?

579
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,456
I don't know why
I'm sitting with you here.

580
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,084
Those guys are
playing in the major league.

581
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,714
And I'm still stuck in the minor league.

582
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,718
Goodbye.

583
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,053
What is it?

584
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,555
Are you going to charge back in there?

585
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,767
I need consent for the autopsy.

586
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,020
Hey.

587
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,105
In the last 20 years,

588
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,524
they went through thick and thin
with Jun-seo.

589
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,278
They're wearing chief mourner armbands.

590
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,988
They're practically family.

591
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,573
Jeez.

592
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,825
You're not aware of this,

593
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,370
but Jun-seo's daughter lasted six years

594
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,246
because Jong-soo gave them
five million won a month

595
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,082
for medication and treatments.

596
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,501
Five million won is a lot of money.

597
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:44,298
So don't even mention
doing an autopsy in front of those guys.

598
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,468
I'm against that as well.

599
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,845
To put it bluntly,

600
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,014
knowing he'll see his daughter in heaven,

601
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,935
do you think he'd want her to see him
with his chest cut up?

602
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,320
Jung Yun-ho is the one
who punched me, right?

603
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,783
Yes, and that's Kang Si-jeong next to him.

604
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,911
She was in our class, remember?

605
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,788
-No.
-Of course, you don't.

606
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,249
Yun-ho and Si-jeong got married.

607
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,334
They dated in college.

608
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,295
Next to him is Jung Sang-ui.

609
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,630
You remember him, right?

610
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,882
Of course, you don't.

611
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,928
So it looks like

612
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,514
you've kept in touch with all of them.

613
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,100
It's not like I see them often.

614
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,812
Si-jeong and I talk sometimes,
but I haven't seen the others in a while.

615
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,690
I don't attend our reunions that much.

616
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,443
Is that what you think too?

617
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,321
Do you think Jun-seo
ended his life out of grief

618
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,533
after his daughter died?

619
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,043
I think it's possible.

620
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,505
Now that I'm a mom,

621
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,926
I don't think I'd survive
if my child were to die before me.

622
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,017
-Make some room.
-Okay.

623
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,478
Come sit here, Jong-soo.

624
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,021
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

625
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,439
Sit here.

626
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,195
This won't do.

627
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,905
I have to move over there.

628
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,114
That's where I belong.

629
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,492
A wreath has been delivered.

630
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,869
Just leave it out front.

631
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,287
Can you sign for it?

632
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,210
Damn it.

633
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,048
Hey, Joo-song sent this.

634
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,633
RECEIVED BY OH YUN-JIN

635
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,634
FROM TWOSTAR HOLDINGS
HEO JOO-SONG

636
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,968
What's "Twostar"?

637
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,553
Does he think he's a major general?

638
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,186
If he comes here,
he'll stick to me like gum on my shoe.

639
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,606
-Can I give you my card?
-Sure.

640
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,526
It's been so long, Jong-soo.

641
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,909
Excuse me.

642
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,286
I'm sorry about before.

643
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,121
Will you reconsider an autopsy--

644
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,706
Are you going somewhere?

645
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,791
Yes.

646
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,710
I have to get a few things from home.

647
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,963
I left in a hurry earlier.

648
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,798
How will you get there?

649
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,925
I'll take a taxi and be right back.

650
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,304
I'll drive you there.

651
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,390
You shouldn't take a taxi
on a day like this.

652
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,474
I didn't drink.

653
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,101
It's okay.

654
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,563
I have my own reasons
for wanting to leave too.

655
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,108
If you see Heo Joo-song, tell him I left.

656
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,318
I'm not in the mood
to deal with him today.

657
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,486
Let's go.

658
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,140
10,000 WON

659
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,393
MARCH 2004

660
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,528
Hey, judo boy.

661
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,740
The teacher wants to see you.

662
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,952
Are you adjusting well to your new class?

663
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,955
Any difficulties now that you're a junior?

664
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,749
No, sir.

665
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,505
Your father is
Superintendent Jang Tae-jeong.

666
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,174
Right?

667
00:43:56,592 --> 00:44:01,722
The reason why you were assigned
to my class for your junior year

668
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:06,101
is because Superintendent Jang
became your stepfather.

669
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,020
I'm sure you know that.

670
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,730
Right?

671
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,523
Also,

672
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:17,196
everyone is desperate to join Class Six.

673
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,406
You're aware of this, too, right?

674
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,241
Let's have a good year.

675
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,369
-Good.
-Sir.

676
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,121
I collected the student aid funds.

677
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,581
Everyone paid, right?

678
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,124
-Not yet.
-Who didn't pay?

679
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,711
Everyone paid except for him.

680
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,421
I see.

681
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,424
You should've explained it to him better.

682
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,551
He didn't know because he's new here.

683
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,807
To help students who need assistance
to continue their studies,

684
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,810
everyone in class helps to raise money

685
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,354
on a voluntary basis.

686
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,565
Don't pay if you don't want to.

687
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,738
You should've collected it properly.

688
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,532
I'm sorry, sir.

689
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,951
All right.

690
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,285
Good.

691
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,204
Okay, you can go now.

692
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,372
Yes, sir.

693
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,714
I got a visit

694
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,135
from your principal
and homeroom teacher today.

695
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,431
You've never called once
called me "Father,"

696
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,975
but I guess you did at school.

697
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,228
There's a kid named
Won Jong-soo in your class.

698
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,813
Get along with him.

699
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,191
And treat your friends to some food.

700
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,079
To help students who need assistance

701
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,582
to continue their studies,

702
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,002
everyone in class helps to raise money
on a voluntary basis.

703
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,100
STUDENT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE
RESULTS

704
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,145
JUNIOR CLASS SIX PARK JUN-SEO
1 WEEK SUSPENSION

705
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,354
One week is harsh.

706
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:17,483
Apparently,

707
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,610
one of you

708
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,945
sent an anonymous letter

709
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,031
to the superintendent's office.

710
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,785
It says the student aid funds
you voluntarily raised

711
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,121
falls under bribery.

712
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,081
That's what it claims.

713
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,085
I'll keep this short.

714
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,298
From now on,
there will be no student aid funds.

715
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,092
The class president
is taking responsibility for this

716
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,929
and has received a one-week suspension.

717
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,859
You must do this if you're suspended?

718
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,242
Here.

719
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
Are you here to apologize?

720
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,918
Did you think your letter

721
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,338
would get your stepfather
and our homeroom teacher fired?

722
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,550
Was that the happy ending you hoped for?

723
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,391
What will happen to you now?

724
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,394
Is it hard to attend school
without student aid?

725
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,606
It wasn't a lot of money anyway.

726
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,150
It's hard enough
walking on eggshells around Jong-soo.

727
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,113
I didn't want to do that with the others
for receiving that money.

728
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,409
I'm actually relieved now.

729
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,286
So just forget it.

730
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,956
In any case,

731
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,791
I'm sorry.

732
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,919
I didn't know this would happen.

733
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,380
Worry about yourself.

734
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm sure you prepared yourself
for the fallout.

735
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,932
Our homeroom teacher
and Jong-soo seem furious.

736
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,311
Will you be okay?

737
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,733
I'm off now.

738
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,985
I'm relieved too.

739
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,575
Everyone now knows I'm a crazy guy
who even got his friend suspended.

740
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:37,331
I'm sure nobody will care
if I don't do what everyone else does.

741
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,876
Crazy bastard.

742
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,755
You're insane, aren't you?

743
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,375
This is a will
written by Mr. Park Jun-seo.

744
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,126
His will?

745
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,757
Thank you.

746
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,765
Jae-gyeong, is that you?

747
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,142
-It's me, Joo-song. Heo Joo-song.
-Right.

748
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,728
I can't believe what happened to Jun-seo.

749
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,814
Chi-hyeon.

750
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,981
Hey.

751
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,983
Come pay your respects.

752
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,594
I'll be right back.

753
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,471
Okay. Take your time.

754
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,278
Oh, dear. She already went up.

755
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,655
Who do you mean?

756
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,782
Yun-hui's mother just went up, right?

757
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,867
Yes.

758
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,828
Why do you ask?

759
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,622
Did somebody pass away?

760
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,416
She was wearing mourning clothes.

761
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,084
Yes, well…

762
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,670
Yun-hui's father…

763
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,590
Oh, my goodness.

764
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,634
Yes, he passed away.

765
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,845
Oh, dear.

766
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,182
Excuse me, but what is this?

767
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,475
This?

768
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:05,187
It's some registered mail
that came a few days ago.

769
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,980
But I haven't given it to them yet.

770
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:09,691
I think it's for Yun-hui's father.

771
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,067
She'll be down soon, right?

772
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,235
Yes.

773
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,696
My goodness.

774
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,115
You can give it to me.

775
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:21,036
She has a lot on her mind right now,
so I'll give it to her.

776
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,829
But…

777
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,333
I'm a friend of Park Jun-seo,
Yun-hui's dad.

778
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,542
I see.

779
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,796
I'll leave it to you then.

780
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,964
Goodness.

781
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,302
It hasn't been long
since Yun-hui passed away.

782
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,678
My goodness.

783
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,727
May he rest in peace.

784
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,020
Thank you.

785
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,523
If you'll excuse me.

786
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,859
Goodness.

787
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,864
JEONGHO LIFE

788
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,332
One-eight-eight-two.

789
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,751
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT 1882?
BECAUSE IT'S ME

790
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,504
One-eight-eight-two.

791
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,756
Would you like some food?

792
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,966
Yes, please.

793
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,095
Did Yun-jin not come?

794
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,889
Jeez.

795
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,767
She was here,
but she took Jun-seo's wife home

796
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,477
to pick up a few things.

797
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,687
I see.

798
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,648
Hey, you don't look well.

799
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,692
Thank you.

800
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,693
You look pale.

801
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,904
It's just indigestion.

802
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,869
Do you still like Yun-jin?

803
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,453
Yes.

804
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:46,788
But as a friend.

805
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,415
As a friend?

806
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,083
That's right. A friend.

807
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,628
By the way,

808
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,257
what made Yun-jin become so obsessed

809
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,384
with making money?

810
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,514
I can't give you the details
because it's a private matter,

811
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,434
but you know she used to work
for Daehan Daily, right?

812
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,686
-Really?
-Yes.

813
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,522
She was well-known for a rookie reporter.

814
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,775
But you know how Yun-jin is.

815
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,820
She didn't edit an article
like she was told to do

816
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,280
and ended up quitting.

817
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,285
The next year, she met
a Korean-Canadian guy working in finance.

818
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,331
They got married
and had a daughter, Ye-eun.

819
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:30,957
But?

820
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,960
But two years after Ye-eun was born,
they got divorced.

821
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,422
Her husband took Ye-eun
to Canada to raise her.

822
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,548
The problem is…

823
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,470
It seems like

824
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,640
the bastard doesn't work at all.

825
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,644
I think he's just living off
Yun-jin's monthly child support payments.

826
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,396
-Why?
-Who knows?

827
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,981
In any case,

828
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,318
Yun-jin will do anything
when it comes to Ye-eun.

829
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:02,364
She knows what's going on
but continues to struggle to send money.

830
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,325
But you know local reporters
don't make much money.

831
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,629
By the way, Jae-gyeong…

832
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,675
Did Jun-seo happen to pay you a visit?

833
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,553
He did, didn't he?

834
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,763
How did you know?

835
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:28,640
So he did.

836
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,059
Did he say anything in particular?

837
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,896
Like what? Do you know something?

838
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,735
I'm going to be honest with you.

839
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,405
I feel really uncomfortable here.

840
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,740
Why?

841
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,201
One week ago,

842
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,328
Jun-seo came to see me

843
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,456
to take out a life insurance policy.

844
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,376
Yes, just a moment, please.

845
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,837
Next Wednesday?

846
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,464
That works. I'll see you then.

847
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,218
So one indemnity insurance policy
and one cancer insurance?

848
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,554
Yes, thank you.

849
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,638
Goodbye.

850
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,851
Let's see here.

851
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:13,768
You look busy.

852
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,105
Hey.

853
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,317
Life insurance?

854
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,444
Yes.

855
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,698
Jun-seo came to me
to take out a few policies before this.

856
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:30,660
Then he got three life insurance policies
under a company name.

857
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,037
A company name?

858
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,497
He said he started a company.

859
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,209
Why would he do that
only to end his life a week later?

860
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,294
But…

861
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,338
There's no payout if it's suicide, right?

862
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,465
Right.

863
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,592
So I told him

864
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,262
if he commits suicide within two years,
then there wouldn't be a payout.

865
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,768
But…

866
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,605
This is where it gets really strange.

867
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,356
After taking out those policies,

868
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,567
he asked me to meet a lawyer with him.

869
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,235
-A lawyer?
-Yes.

870
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,159
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

871
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:18,708
First, I'd like to thank everyone
who came to pay their respects to Jun-seo

872
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,294
on behalf of his family.

873
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,883
Jun-seo…

874
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,469
Before he died,

875
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,555
he left a will.

876
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,559
On February 16th, 2024,

877
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,812
one week before Jun-seo passed away,

878
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,439
he met with Mr. Heo Joo-song
of Twostar Holdings

879
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,651
and took out one policy each
from Jeongho, Heungin, and Jangsu Life

880
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,196
for one billion won, two billion won,
and two billion won, respectively,

881
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,240
for a total of five billion won

882
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,243
under the name Audiophile Corporation

883
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,913
of which Jun-seo was the sole owner.

884
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,421
ANHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
PARK JUN-SEO

885
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,437
Damn it.

886
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,821
What's this?

887
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,490
"The insured, Park Jun-seo."

888
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,367
"Beneficiary…"

889
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,120
"Audiophile Corporation"?

890
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,045
SUM INSURED: 2 BILLION WON

891
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,298
Two billion won?

892
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,054
DEATH BENEFIT BENEFICIARY:
AUDIOPHILE CO.

893
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,015
Audiophile?

894
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,109
DEATH BENEFIT BENEFICIARY:

908
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,552
These people will inherit.

909
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,658
Recite our classroom creed.

910
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,617
First.

911
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,870
-We will always fulfill our duties.

912
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:43,913

00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,339
Come on in.

917
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,932
These students just transferred.

918
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,892
Let's welcome them
with a round of applause.

919
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,523
Say hello.

920
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,109
Hi, I'm Oh Yun-jin.

921
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,694
Nice to meet you.

922
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,241
I'm Heo Joo-song.

923
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,410
Nice to meet you all.

924
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,788
Help them get adjusted, okay?

925
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:26,706
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

926
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,042
By the way, you two,

927
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,045
that's our classroom creed.

928
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,923
I'll check if you memorized it
at the end of the day,

929
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,176
so make sure to learn it by heart by then.

930
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,093
Understood?

931
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,680
Let's see where you can sit.

932
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,724
Sir?

933
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,851
I was just wondering…

934
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,604
"We will be helpful to our friends."

935
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,356
Is this what you think, sir?

936
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,026
What?

937
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,736
It seems a bit strange.

938
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,280
Does a friend always have to be helpful?

939
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,033
Regardless of whether they're helpful,

940
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,744
shouldn't you tell us to be good friends?

941
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,788
What?

942
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,748
Don't you agree, sir?

943
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,585
If it's okay with you, may I change it?

944
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,422
Jeez.

945
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,642
You should've come to me first
if you knew there was a will.

946
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,018
It wasn't suicide?

947
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,645
Then someone killed him?

948
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,230
-An autopsy is the right way to go.
-Hey.

949
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,357
It's too suspicious.

950
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,900
Is it because you want the payout?

951
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,986
-Hey, Park Tae-jin.
-Don't you dare call me by name.

952
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,280
I'm here as a prosecutor, not your friend.

953
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,908
What are you trying to hide? Tell me!

954
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,744
It'll prove that it's murder.

955
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,704
How will we remain friends like this?

956
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,414
-Lemon pop?
-It's the same drug again.

957
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,417
No hospital.

958
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,836
How could you do drugs?

959
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,337
I can't live without it.

960
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,505
Jae-gyeong, get it together.

961
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,715
Open the door.

962
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,634
Jae-gyeong, get a hold of yourself!

963
