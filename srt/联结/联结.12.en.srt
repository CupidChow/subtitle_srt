1
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:56,987
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

2
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,117
Do those pills no longer work now?

3
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:16,538
Tell me if you need more. I'll get them.

4
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,878
Even eight pills can't get
the job done now.

5
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,108
Eight?

6
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,693
Hey.
You can't take more than five at a time.

7
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:30,124
It'll ruin your liver.

8
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,148
I know.

9
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,188
How did you know to come here?

10
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,463
I was wondering
which punks were fighting at a hospital,

11
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:38,597
and it was you two.

12
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,804
Didn't you come here
after hearing Choi Ji Yeon's news?

13
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:42,868
"Choi Ji Yeon?"

14
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:44,868
Jeong Yoon Ho went to see Choi Ji Yeon.

15
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:46,898
And?

16
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:49,938
She's badly hurt,
but it's not life-threatening.

17
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:51,978
They need to run some more tests.

18
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:57,848
What's wrong with Yoon Ho?

19
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,187
Is he really the Yoon Ho we used to know?

20
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:05,857
Hey, this won't do.

21
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,417
Take a taxi and go home. Okay?

22
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:10,088
Get some sleep first.

23
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:12,228
I came here...

24
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:15,368
to see the doctor
who treated Jun Seo's daughter.

25
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,687
He's in emergency surgery,
and I can only see him in the morning.

26
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,198
I'll call if something happens to Ji Yeon.

27
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,607
I doubt Yoon Ho would show up here.

28
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:35,948
(Connection)

29
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,988
(Episode 12)

30
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:42,928
Hey.

31
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,303
We just parted ways.

32
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:45,833
Why did you call me over here again?

33
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,497
I'm meeting Mayor Joo tomorrow.

34
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,127
Do you think Yoon Ho was arrested?

35
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:56,208
Did you have Tae Jin tailed as I asked?

36
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:58,538
Yes.

37
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:06,618
Why am I back here?

38
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,717
What did Yoon Ho do now?

39
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:11,447
Jeong Yoon Ho.

40
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:15,527
He tried and failed
to kill Jun Seo's widow and fled.

41
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,564
Who tried to kill whom?

42
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:20,497
I don't know why, but he's out of control.

43
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:22,497
He won't take my calls.

44
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:26,437
This is why I said
we should deal with him quickly.

45
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,097
It's out of my hands now.

46
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:30,838
Are you blaming me
for what Yoon Ho's doing?

47
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:34,013
You think killing a friend is a joke?

48
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,318
How many times must I say
it's over if we miss the chance?

49
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,608
You should've been decisive
when it was required.

50
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,217
What will you do now?

51
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:42,847
If we let Yoon Ho loose,

52
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:44,793
he'll be caught in two days.

53
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:48,388
The darn lunatic.
This is such an important time for me.

54
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,027
Yoon Ho called me.

55
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,328
What? When?

56
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:57,997
About two hours ago.

57
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,338
The conversation we had earlier.

58
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,477
He sounded as if he'd heard a recording.

59
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:07,808
A recording?

60
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:09,777
From here?

61
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:12,947
You said you set something up
to block listening devices.

62
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:16,418
You told me to turn it off
because you hated the high-frequency buzz.

63
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,358
So what?

64
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:23,358
What did Yoon Ho say?

65
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:24,934
He said he knew we'd kill him...

66
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,958
and that he wouldn't go easily, but...

67
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,928
He said something weird.

68
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:32,937
That it was all you.

69
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:36,567
That you're manipulating us all.

70
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,467
What?

71
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:42,323
You lost your mind
because you're cornered.

72
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:43,347
Hey, you.

73
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,018
Is it true? Did you fool around
with Jun Seo's wife?

74
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:51,717
What?

75
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,157
Wait. You did what with whom?

76
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,828
What Yoon Ho said was true.

77
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,398
So you wanted him dead to cover it up?

78
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,127
Is that...

79
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,837
worth killing for just to cover up?

80
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,937
Yes, it's true.

81
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,707
I slept with Jun Seo's wife. So what?

82
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:18,947
Hey, you crazy...

83
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,678
What are you saying?

84
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,887
Did you really kill Park Jun Seo?

85
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:38,598
Hello?

86
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,538
Jong Soo, it's Yoon Ho.

87
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,178
Hello?

88
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,418
Speak.

89
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:54,817
Jong Soo.

90
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,048
Help me out.

91
00:05:57,718 --> 00:05:58,887
I need you...

92
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:01,218
to step up now.

93
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:03,988
What do you mean by that?

94
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,728
I felt really let down this time.

95
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,827
Park Tae Jin.

96
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:11,928
He's a really nasty punk.

97
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,197
Do you know he's trying to kill me?

98
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,668
What for?

99
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,507
To hide the fact
he slept with Jun Seo's wife?

100
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:21,978
You know about that?

101
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:24,377
Yes.

102
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:27,848
Those two got rid of Jun Seo.

103
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,348
I went to his place to find proof.

104
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:31,947
I haven't found it yet.

105
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,718
The police happened to rush in.

106
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:36,788
So what?

107
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,228
I need you...

108
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:39,957
to scare Tae Jin.

109
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,468
Tell him that you know everything.

110
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,774
Say you know he killed Jun Seo,

111
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:47,173
and he needs to help me out.

112
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,238
Oh, yes. Oh Chi Hyun.

113
00:06:49,707 --> 00:06:51,014
Don't tell him.

114
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,877
I think he's in on it with Tae Jin.

115
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:56,747
Really?

116
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,647
Yes, Jong Soo.

117
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,154
You can do anything. You're...

118
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:05,147
You're the future
Keumhyung Group chairman.

119
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,587
What can't you do?

120
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:12,127
What if I can't do that?

121
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:13,997
What happens then?

122
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,548
Then I'll be left with no choice.

123
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,517
I'll have to tell the world
you got Lee Myung Guk...

124
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:39,034
to make you a drug,

125
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,218
and when he blackmailed you,

126
00:07:41,358 --> 00:07:43,687
you got me to kill him.

127
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:47,473
When did I ask you to kill Lee Myung Guk?

128
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:48,627
Jong Soo.

129
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:51,098
Don't do this to a friend.

130
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:54,243
I can tell what you want...

131
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,437
from the look in your eyes.

132
00:07:57,337 --> 00:08:02,137
If we'd let Lee Myung Guk live,
he'd have dragged us down, you idiot.

133
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,447
Yoon Ho.

134
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:08,278
Can't you just go into hiding?

135
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:10,447
Do you have to do this?

136
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,488
I'm 40 years old, you know.

137
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,658
Where can I go to live in hiding?

138
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:17,457
What about Si Jung? And our kids?

139
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:18,858
I bought land...

140
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,957
because of the Pilo-dong business.

141
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,168
We're in this together!

142
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,668
Have you forgotten our students' creed?

143
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,538
"Be a helping hand to a friend!"

144
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,278
Where are you?

145
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,908
I got the point. Let's talk in person.

146
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:40,978
Shall we?

147
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:43,447
Yes, let's do that.

148
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,817
Text me a place.

149
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,718
I'll come over right away.

150
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,928
I'll be in touch. Keep your phone on.

151
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,733
Okay. Get back to me soon.

152
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:54,298
The police...

153
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,707
What he said.

154
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,978
How much of that is true?

155
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:15,988
I told you just now.

156
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,464
I did sleep with Jun Seo's wife.

157
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,488
That's it.

158
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,067
What?

159
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,437
Do you really think I killed Jun Seo?

160
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,437
If you guys actually suspect me,

161
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,008
I'd be so disappointed.

162
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,484
I'd accept the ridicule...

163
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,117
for sleeping with a friend's wife.

164
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:48,894
But don't you know me too little
if you'd think I'd kill Jun Seo...

165
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:49,987
over something like that?

166
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,124
Would I give it all up...

167
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,388
and betray you guys for a woman?

168
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,028
That's nothing.

169
00:09:58,528 --> 00:09:59,528
If it's not that,

170
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:04,327
why didn't you look into
Jun Seo's death yourself?

171
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:06,298
I think I would have.

172
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:07,967
Do you...

173
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:10,268
still think he killed himself?

174
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,408
There is a possibility he was murdered.

175
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,538
But why would I bother?

176
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,678
Jae Gyeong came to see you all.

177
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:22,418
He's doing all the hard work
to claim the insurance money.

178
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:31,888
Won Jong Soo.

179
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:36,004
Making Jun Seo work for you
for 20 years wasn't enough,

180
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:37,798
so you made him deliver drugs too.

181
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,038
Didn't you use the 5,000 dollars...

182
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,338
his daughter needed
for treatment to crush him?

183
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:45,707
I bet Jun Seo called you and said this.

184
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,207
"The drugs made
at Youngryun Cold Storage,"

185
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,678
"the fact that
you get a delivery every week,"

186
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,593
"and that you can't go three days
without a dose."

187
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,288
"I'll tell the whole world."

188
00:10:57,617 --> 00:11:00,158
That's why you came
to the construction site that night.

189
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:01,587
Jong Soo.

190
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:06,028
You honestly wanted Jun Seo dead.
Wasn't it you?

191
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:08,998
Shut your mouth.

192
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:10,028
Or...

193
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:12,638
was it you?

194
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:13,898
What?

195
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:16,567
Did it bother you to kill a friend?

196
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,977
So you got someone else to do it?

197
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,808
What nonsense is that?

198
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:23,648
Lee Myung Guk's murder...

199
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,823
Jun Seo said he'd tell the police.

200
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,163
That's why you came
to the construction site.

201
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,487
You said so yourself.

202
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:31,817
Are you denying that now?

203
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:33,457
You...

204
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,087
weren't even that close to Jun Seo.

205
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,487
What about you?

206
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,197
What were you doing there?

207
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,798
What did Jun Seo say to make you show up?

208
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,097
This is it.

209
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:48,597
What?

210
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,467
This is it.

211
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:55,713
This is what Jun Seo wanted
when he left...

212
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,083
the insurance money
to Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin.

213
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,793
He wanted us to fight, doubt,

214
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,278
threaten each other, and curse.

215
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:03,148
Guys.

216
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,947
All three of us...

217
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,617
had good enough reason
to want Jun Seo dead.

218
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:09,788
But so what?

219
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:13,928
What are you going to do?

220
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:15,658
What?

221
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,874
What do you want to do by fighting...

222
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,638
about figuring out who killed Jun Seo?

223
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:23,638
Get your acts together, you idiots.

224
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,713
The urgent matter on our hands isn't
Park Jun Seo, who's already dead,

225
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,207
but Jeong Yoon Ho.

226
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,508
Got it?

227
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,158
Where should I tell him to come to?

228
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,987
You should decide
wherever is convenient for you.

229
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,678
It seems like something
you'll have to take care of.

230
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,538
Jong Soo.

231
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:49,487
Jong Soo.

232
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,038
Chi Hyun!

233
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:39,437
What are you doing right now?

234
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,337
Hey, don't do this. Chi Hyun.

235
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,654
Hey, it was Park Tae Jin.
It was all his doing!

236
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,193
- Go quietly.
- Hey!

237
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,224
It was all Park Tae Jin's doing!

238
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:52,248
That's enough.

239
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,463
Chi Hyun, we can't do this between us.

240
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,827
We can't do this between us!

241
00:14:58,727 --> 00:14:59,758
I know.

242
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,028
That's why I told you to stay down.

243
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,014
Why do you always do things
that no one asked you to do?

244
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,038
I was trying to do what was right!

245
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,567
I wanted to do a good job.
You know, I had to do something.

246
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:13,937
That way, Jong Soo would take
one more look at me.

247
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:16,048
Save me. Please?

248
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,347
Save me! Chi Hyun.

249
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,918
Chi Hyun, what about Si Jung?

250
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:23,748
Hey, if I die, your nieces...

251
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,457
What about Young Eun and Young Ji?

252
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:27,593
Hey, what will you do about...

253
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:28,693
- Young Eun and Young Ji?
- Be quiet.

254
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:29,758
Turn your head.

255
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,128
You idiot!

256
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:35,158
Do you think
those guys consider you a friend?

257
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:36,567
They don't!

258
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,744
Those guys only call you...

259
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,697
whenever they need you, you idiot.

260
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,707
Hey, Chi Hyun.

261
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,008
You know,

262
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,278
I wanted to be like you.

263
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,008
They don't ask me to do anything.

264
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:54,418
They don't ask me to do anything!

265
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:56,947
If I worked hard,

266
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,788
I could get to visit
the place you gather in Pilo-dong...

267
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,234
and just hang out...

268
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,658
- You fool.
- With you guys!

269
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,058
Like back in the day, I wanted to...

270
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:07,857
Chi Hyun. I wanted to do that.

271
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,498
Chi Hyun, no!

272
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:17,107
Hello.

273
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:21,337
Is Dr. Park Eun Young finished
with surgery?

274
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:23,347
I was here yesterday.

275
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:26,117
Dr. Park.

276
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:30,148
(Ultrasound room)

277
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:34,288
In the letters,

278
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:37,963
it said that
Yoon Hee could've been treated in the US.

279
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:39,028
What was that about?

280
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,498
The medicine used
for Yoon Hee's condition...

281
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:44,467
was rather expensive
and not covered by insurance.

282
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:48,038
And it was only effective enough
to stop her symptoms from worsening.

283
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,514
But then,

284
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:53,678
I was contacted about wanting to use
a newly developed drug in the US.

285
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,008
But why didn't they go?

286
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,048
It was because of the costs.

287
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:02,447
How much would it have been?

288
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:05,648
It was 500,000 dollars.

289
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:10,058
Yoon Hee's dad told me that
he would come up with the money somehow...

290
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:13,357
and for me not to lose
that chance for her.

291
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:16,097
But Yoon Hee...

292
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,867
didn't wait for us.

293
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:49,798
You...

294
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,367
died here today.

295
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:56,708
Don't ever show up around us again.

296
00:17:57,968 --> 00:17:59,888
Don't think of seeing
Si Jung or the kids either.

297
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,208
You and me...

298
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:04,708
Our friendship ends here.

299
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,198
The students' creed!

300
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,498
One!

301
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:31,407
"Be someone who performs one's duty!"

302
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,877
Two!

303
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:40,718
"Be true to one's goal!"

304
00:18:42,877 --> 00:18:43,917
Three!

305
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,558
"Be..."

306
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:53,397
"a helping hand to a friend!"

307
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:56,968
All right.

308
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:01,738
Here we go.

309
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,008
(Anhyun Stream)

310
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:48,847
Hey, Detective Kim.

311
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,048
Is your arm okay?

312
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:52,958
Yes, it's fine.

313
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,817
That's good.

314
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:56,587
The Unit Chief...

315
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,758
got called to the Chief's office
again this morning.

316
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,597
She must've had an earful.

317
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,637
- You're here.
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:11,567
What did the doctor say?

319
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,113
I have a sprained wrist.

320
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:15,537
I have to watch out for a few days.

321
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,347
It's good it wasn't worse.

322
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,718
I'm sorry to cause you concern.

323
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:21,577
Forget it.

324
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,218
You see all sorts of things
when working as a cop.

325
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:28,417
Thanks to you, I almost got smacked
by the Chief of Police at this age,

326
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:30,357
but what can I do?

327
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,327
It's all because I lack virtue.

328
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,308
Where is the Captain?

329
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,638
He hasn't come in yet.
He won't answer his phone either.

330
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:48,837
- Is that so?
- Yes.

331
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:02,988
(Park Jun Seo)

332
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:26,308
What's the passcode?

333
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:28,347
- Zero.
- Yes?

334
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:29,577
- Five.
- Five?

335
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,817
Zero, two.

336
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,528
Jae Gyeong.

337
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:46,897
Jang Jae Gyeong.

338
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:49,597
Jae Gyeong!

339
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,607
Jae Gyeong, come to your senses.

340
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:53,337
Jang Jae Gyeong!

341
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,738
Jae Gyeong.

342
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:56,677
Come to your senses!

343
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:58,778
Oh, no.

344
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,877
Jae Gyeong. Darn it.

345
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:06,688
Drink some water.

346
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,188
Jae Gyeong!

347
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:14,228
Wake up. Please, wake up.

348
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,067
Drug...

349
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,028
Get rid of it...

350
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:22,567
Okay.

351
00:22:39,617 --> 00:22:41,337
There was
a Lemon Mulberry pill here, right?

352
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,664
There was no other way.

353
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,058
What will you do
if that situation happens again?

354
00:22:45,887 --> 00:22:47,097
Will you take it again?

355
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:49,728
Yes.

356
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,238
Hey, Straw. What is it?

357
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:06,048
Yes.

358
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:08,317
Okay.

359
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,087
All right, I got it.

360
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,087
Send me the details via text.

361
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:14,488
Okay, I got it.

362
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,528
Samsol Port in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do.

363
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:18,567
Jangju Port in Dangjin, Chungcheongnam-do.

364
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:20,958
Manpyeong Port in Seosan,
Chungcheongnam-do.

365
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:25,004
According to Straw,
at 4:00 a.m. two days from now,

366
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,043
people will be smuggled in
through one of these three ports.

367
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,573
They're far from each other,

368
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:30,613
so it'll be difficult to cover them
at the same time.

369
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:32,643
This must mean it's difficult
for Straw to get info now.

370
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,278
We had one of our men show interest...

371
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,278
in smuggling out as a new attempt,

372
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:39,298
but these guys must be extra cautious.

373
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:41,724
Ask the Coast Guard
for their cooperation...

374
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:43,153
and get some internal support as well...

375
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:44,694
to try and cover all three ports.

376
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:45,758
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

377
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,308
What happened?
What are you doing here?

378
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:20,657
Don't tell me...

379
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:44,757
How many hours did I sleep?

380
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:46,748
Maybe two hours?

381
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:48,317
What time is it now?

382
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,948
It's 2:30 p.m.

383
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:15,997
In front of Manyang Ferry...

384
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:17,758
at Manpyeong Port, two days from now.

385
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,147
At 4:00 a.m.

386
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:32,988
Hey, where are you?
Is everything okay?

387
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:34,258
Unit Chief.

388
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:36,274
Did you receive any information
from Straw?

389
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:37,298
I did.

390
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:39,944
But he gave me the names of three ports.

391
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:41,043
We don't know which one.

392
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,498
Is Manpyeong Port one of them?

393
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:46,038
Yes, it is. How did you know?

394
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:48,118
That's the place.
Two days from now at 4:00 a.m.

395
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:50,284
All right, we'll check.

396
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,308
Okay.

397
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:58,548
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:06,698
I know very well how hard you're trying
to hold out,

399
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:10,968
but I didn't know what else to do.

400
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,077
It's okay.

401
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:25,478
I'm sure you were torn in the moment.

402
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,347
What you decided on...

403
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:30,718
was probably in my best interest.

404
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:36,657
How's Jun Seo's wife?

405
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,728
Well... She's okay.

406
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,558
She seems to have a lot of regrets.

407
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,597
All she did was cry.

408
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,567
Right.

409
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:51,657
I'll forward you the address
of that grandma in Boryeong...

410
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,367
in a text.

411
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:54,978
You remember, don't you?

412
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:57,737
She's the one getting the pension
from the plan Jun Seo signed up.

413
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:58,808
Yes.

414
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,178
When do you want to go to Boryeong?

415
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:03,477
I think I have to head out for now.

416
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:04,617
Okay.

417
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,277
Are you going back to the station?

418
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,917
No.

419
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,563
I'm going to go see Jeong Sang Eui.

420
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,587
Sang Eui?

421
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:16,633
Park Tae Jin is a prosecutor,
and he's very cautious.

422
00:27:16,657 --> 00:27:18,097
It won't be easy to investigate him.

423
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,468
It might be a good idea to use Sang Eui
to get to Tae Jin.

424
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,607
Do you want to come along?

425
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:31,347
What's gotten into you?

426
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,377
Well, it's not so easy to drive either.

427
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:37,048
All right.

428
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,488
See me at Myeongeul Garden tomorrow
at 4:00 p.m.

429
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,083
Hello?

430
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:02,238
We found you a boat.

431
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:04,177
It departs...

432
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,468
from Manpyeong Port
at 4:00 a.m. in two days.

433
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:07,917
Thank you.

434
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:10,548
If you leave, you won't be able to return.

435
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,488
Aren't you curious about me?

436
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,218
Pardon?

437
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:20,127
I'm Park Tae Jin.

438
00:28:21,327 --> 00:28:23,007
Don't you remember me
from early last year?

439
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:26,643
Come on, we've met.

440
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,567
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin of Anhyun District
Public Prosecutor's Office.

441
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,954
(1 year ago in January 2023)

442
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,008
Mr. Gong Jin Wook.

443
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:39,053
You ran
an adult entertainment establishment...

444
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:40,917
two years ago
and were sentenced to six months.

445
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:43,638
You're back with the same charges.

446
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:51,688
What is this?

447
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:54,058
Take a look.

448
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,468
It's our second time making a deal
through a flash drive, isn't it?

449
00:28:59,298 --> 00:29:02,567
Didn't I help you get indicted then?

450
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,637
Thanks for the pictures in the drive.

451
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,853
Among your secret customers,

452
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:12,407
there are many individuals
who act strong and mighty.

453
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:14,847
Are you really...

454
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,587
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin?

455
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,488
That's right.

456
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,218
I'm the Doctor.

457
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:29,927
Jin Wook.

458
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:33,667
Didn't you ever wonder why
you were picked as the Doctor's dealer?

459
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,768
You never sold drugs before...

460
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:37,598
and didn't have the knack for it either.

461
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:43,954
People like CEO Yoon who had
a lot of experience in the field seemed...

462
00:29:43,978 --> 00:29:45,677
too difficult to handle.

463
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:49,948
It was somewhat too dangerous
for me to deal...

464
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:51,387
with CEO Yoon directly.

465
00:29:52,617 --> 00:29:55,518
That was why I needed someone
with a brain...

466
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:58,563
who was also loyal and strong.

467
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:00,157
That was why I scouted you.

468
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,597
It was more fun than running
an adult establishment, right?

469
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:08,198
Why are you telling me this?

470
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:11,607
I told you. I'm telling you
because you won't be able to return.

471
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,538
What? What is it?

472
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,778
Will you report me to the police?

473
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,748
But who's going to believe you
if you tell them I made and sold drugs?

474
00:30:20,647 --> 00:30:21,877
No...

475
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,248
That was not what I meant.

476
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:28,218
I'm just confused by it all.

477
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:30,087
I'm sure.

478
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:32,087
Anyway, take care.

479
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,133
Go to the dock at Manpyeong Port
and find Manyang Ferry...

480
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,397
at 4:00 a.m. two days from now.
Someone will show up.

481
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:41,113
Okay, Prosecutor. As for the drugs...

482
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,298
Thanks for all you've done.

483
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:07,204
- It's Jeong Sang Eui.
- What?

484
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:08,388
- Turn the car around.
- Okay.

485
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,018
I'll wait outside.

486
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:32,817
Hey.

487
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:35,218
Yoon Ho...

488
00:31:36,587 --> 00:31:37,788
Did he leave without a word?

489
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:41,458
Why does that matter now?

490
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:49,637
If a bioindustrial complex is built,

491
00:31:50,238 --> 00:31:53,414
Anhyun will turn
into an organic future-oriented city...

492
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,508
that is a blend of industrial
and residential.

493
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:56,978
I'm sure you saw my proposal,

494
00:31:57,778 --> 00:32:00,278
but we already have the funds secured
for this project.

495
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:01,978
I don't have any questions.

496
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:03,887
However,

497
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:09,857
you made things look like
you're doing the city a great service.

498
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:11,333
What you're saying is that...

499
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:13,657
you'll build us
a biotechnology complex...

500
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:16,373
if we give you the rights
to develop a Pilo-dong plot...

501
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,968
three times that size
into a private sector residential area.

502
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:22,474
Why would Yigu Group get involved...

503
00:32:22,498 --> 00:32:24,137
when they don't care for the city?

504
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,038
They're in it for the profit.

505
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,778
Let's do it.

506
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:33,748
Okay.

507
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:36,677
Thank you.

508
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:38,437
- Let's make it work.
- Thank you.

509
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:55,097
- Good job.
- Well done.

510
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,607
Didn't I tell you it would go well?

511
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:05,147
- Hey, look.
- Drive on.

512
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:06,677
Okay.

513
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,823
(Myeongeul Garden)

514
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:09,978
Turn and park here.

515
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:20,157
(Main building)

516
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,808
(Main building)

517
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,617
(Main building)

518
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,427
Wait here.

519
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,877
- What?
- The next room is occupied.

520
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:13,248
Let's go outside behind the rooms.

521
00:34:41,008 --> 00:34:43,238
Hey. It's Park Tae Jin.

522
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,147
Why are they meeting up?

523
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:48,917
The Lemon Mulberry business.

524
00:34:50,147 --> 00:34:53,147
Is Jeong Sang Eui
the one who replaced Jun Seo?

525
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,628
This door's closed,
so it'll be hard to listen in.

526
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:06,998
What's that?

527
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:10,398
Now do you know why my bag's so huge?

528
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:13,108
Do you always carry this stuff around?

529
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,378
Listen.

530
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:38,597
Is there something in China?

531
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:40,668
Yes, apparently.

532
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,637
Forget that.

533
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:45,708
Yesterday, when we all met at Pilo-dong.

534
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:48,108
Do you remember
I told you to wait outside?

535
00:35:49,677 --> 00:35:50,677
Yes.

536
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:53,308
Did you record our conversation?

537
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,447
- No.
- You didn't?

538
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,088
Then...

539
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:04,927
how did Yoon Ho know what we said?

540
00:36:05,387 --> 00:36:06,487
Chi Hyun said...

541
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:09,327
it sounded like
Yoon Ho had heard a recording.

542
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,197
There's no way...

543
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:15,168
we'd record our chat for Yoon Ho to hear.

544
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:16,713
Right?

545
00:36:16,737 --> 00:36:20,108
Are you saying you suspect me?

546
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:21,538
Someone told me...

547
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,978
to remember my place and act accordingly.

548
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:30,077
Sang Eui. Not all friends are equal.

549
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:33,748
Do you think you'd be in our group
if Jun Seo hadn't made you...

550
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,088
class secretary out of pity?

551
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:39,757
You always got beaten up,
you could never speak up,

552
00:36:40,228 --> 00:36:41,597
and you were so slow to catch on.

553
00:36:42,728 --> 00:36:44,367
That's what you were like.

554
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:46,427
You wouldn't have survived school...

555
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,498
if Jun Seo hadn't coddled you.

556
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:52,237
Do you think things have changed?

557
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:55,038
What will you do now?

558
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:57,277
Jun Seo is gone.

559
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,354
You should appease me,

560
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:00,624
but you're sticking
right beside Jae Gyeong...

561
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:01,748
and telling him everything.

562
00:37:03,547 --> 00:37:05,627
And now you're causing a rift
between me and Yoon Ho?

563
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:06,748
Hey.

564
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:08,358
It's not me.

565
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,117
Don't lie.

566
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:14,097
You made the burner phone I gave Yoon Ho.

567
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,027
We're the only two
who can contact him with it.

568
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,467
Sang Eui.

569
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:27,108
Do you have something against me?

570
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:29,838
I have zero feelings for you.

571
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:33,108
While the others bullied you,
I did nothing at all.

572
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,447
So why would you do this to me?

573
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:40,447
Do you also think I killed Jun Seo?

574
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:43,257
And this is you avenging him?

575
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:45,987
Jun Seo said...

576
00:37:47,257 --> 00:37:49,157
he'd only do it until
he'd made 500,000 dollars.

577
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:52,573
He said he'd quit
selling Lemon Mulberry once he had...

578
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:54,273
enough money to take Yoon Hee to the US,

579
00:37:54,297 --> 00:37:55,538
but he couldn't.

580
00:37:57,637 --> 00:37:58,808
Whose fault is that?

581
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:03,808
You're recording this, aren't you?

582
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,447
- What?
- Let's see it.

583
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,047
Give me your phone.

584
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:12,648
You cheeky thing.

585
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:16,617
Darn it.

586
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:18,558
Tae Jin.

587
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,458
Hey.

588
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:23,728
Tae Jin. I...

589
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:26,728
- You dirtbag.
- Sorry.

590
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:28,367
You'd record me?

591
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,608
Hey. Get up.

592
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,077
Stand up.

593
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:41,177
Sit down.

594
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:48,257
Park Jun Seo.

595
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:50,518
I didn't kill him, okay?

596
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:55,728
I don't know what you want to find out
by doing all this stupid stuff,

597
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,343
but if you do something like this again,

598
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:59,768
I'll make you pay dearly.

599
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:02,308
This is the last time I warn you verbally.

600
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,268
Sang Eui.

601
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:07,978
If we...

602
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,947
do our own thing well like we used to,

603
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:13,648
nothing will happen.

604
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:15,918
Okay?

605
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,217
Okay.

606
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:20,717
Let's eat.

607
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,657
I want to finish the meal.

608
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:33,967
What's this?

609
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:35,938
Have a look, and you'll remember.

610
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:55,717
Are you the Doctor?

611
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,334
What do you mean?

612
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:58,987
Did you make the Lemon Mulberry?

613
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:01,628
I don't know what you're talking about.

614
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:03,104
You and Lee Myung Guk.

615
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:05,398
You met often at Pilo-dong
outside work hours.

616
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:06,867
Youngryun Cold Storage.

617
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:08,697
That's the factory, right?

618
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:11,208
Did Lee Myung Guk make the drugs first...

619
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,708
and then you took over?

620
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,438
Darn it. Wait.

621
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:17,014
Jeong Sang Eui.

622
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:18,077
Jun Seo...

623
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,894
You said he wanted to take Yoon Hee
to the US to fix her...

624
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,718
and was going to make Lemon Mulberry
only until he had 500,000 dollars.

625
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,648
But he failed because of Tae Jin...

626
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:28,133
because he didn't share
his four digits to the password...

627
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,657
and Jun Seo couldn't withdraw the profits.

628
00:40:31,427 --> 00:40:32,458
Aren't I right?

629
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:35,697
You two.

630
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,497
One is an officer,
and the other is a reporter,

631
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:40,417
But you act pretty much the same.

632
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:43,467
- What?
- You must be so frustrated.

633
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:48,907
Do you have a suspicion
but no actual proof? Is that it?

634
00:40:52,608 --> 00:40:53,708
What are you doing?

635
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:57,023
What are you doing?

636
00:40:57,047 --> 00:40:58,727
Fasten your seat belt if you want to know.

637
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:27,617
It's fine.

638
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:47,128
Hold your breath.
Don't inhale the cold air.

639
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,757
Lemon Mulberry is made here?

640
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:50,498
Yes.

641
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:01,637
What about Jong Soo?

642
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:06,008
Does he also know that you made
and sold Lemon Mulberry?

643
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,494
What would Jong Soo get into
the drug business for?

644
00:43:10,518 --> 00:43:12,547
He can just take them
when he's having fun.

645
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:14,788
As you said,

646
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,987
Mr. Lee Myung Guk found
the drug's component.

647
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:21,558
And Jong Soo is still taking...

648
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:23,877
the drug that was
first developed from that.

649
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:25,898
But...

650
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:28,367
I made the Lemon Mulberry.

651
00:43:29,038 --> 00:43:31,338
I mean, I did use Mr. Lee's recipe a bit.

652
00:43:37,137 --> 00:43:38,378
So, why did you bring us here,

653
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:40,547
and why are you telling us this?

654
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,027
I was the one who got you hooked
on Lemon Mulberries.

655
00:43:47,217 --> 00:43:48,387
Hey, Jeong Sang Eui.

656
00:43:49,558 --> 00:43:50,558
Why?

657
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:54,958
Because I don't like you.

658
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,538
- Hey!
- Jae Gyeong!

659
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,577
- Hey, Jang Jae Gyeong!
- Why?

660
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:19,918
Let go.

661
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:39,237
(Keumhyung Group)

662
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:45,777
You worked hard.

663
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:49,777
I was so worried
whether you'd be able to do well.

664
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:52,847
But I underestimated my own son.

665
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,858
Mayor Joo In Sang just called.

666
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:02,797
He said he was persuaded by you.

667
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:06,597
Yes, Father.

668
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:10,338
Now, that seat...

669
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:12,137
is yours.

670
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,808
Don't be anxious anymore,

671
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:16,737
and be confident.

672
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,407
I've known...

673
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:22,547
that you've felt a sense of inferiority
compared to Tae Jin for a while.

674
00:45:25,018 --> 00:45:27,117
Now, you don't have to feel that way.

675
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:29,458
Tae Jin, or whoever it may be,

676
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:33,188
has existed for you.

677
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,434
Those guys can be replaced by anyone,

678
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,498
but not you.

679
00:45:39,128 --> 00:45:40,797
You're Won Chang Ho's son.

680
00:45:42,168 --> 00:45:43,168
This position...

681
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:47,108
isn't something someone can have
just because they covet it.

682
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:52,507
Come here.

683
00:45:56,777 --> 00:45:57,818
Sit here.

684
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:02,617
Slt.

685
00:46:12,398 --> 00:46:13,398
Now,

686
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:16,498
once the licensing issue is
finally confirmed,

687
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:19,897
let's get you some treatment.

688
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,407
Pardon?

689
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,878
The future chairman of Keumhyung Group...

690
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,918
can't rely on drugs for too long.

691
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:36,288
Yes, Father.

692
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:39,708
I'll hold onto this seat...

693
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:42,858
for just a little longer for you.

694
00:46:50,038 --> 00:46:51,838
I want to rest now too.

695
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:57,338
So, hurry up with getting treated
and come back.

696
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:01,478
Yes.

697
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:03,148
I will, Father.

698
00:47:10,717 --> 00:47:11,858
Prosecutor Park.

699
00:47:12,628 --> 00:47:14,108
Congratulations on your new position.

700
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,733
- Pardon?
- Didn't you see?

701
00:47:16,757 --> 00:47:18,437
The personnel appointment was just posted.

702
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:32,547
(Personnel Appointments, Park Tae Jin,
Ministry of Justice, Prosecution Bureau)

703
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:47,188
(Prosecutor Park Tae Jin)

704
00:47:59,507 --> 00:48:00,547
Is there something like...

705
00:48:01,268 --> 00:48:02,508
an antidote for Lemon Mulberry?

706
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:05,577
No.

707
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:09,018
Jae Gyeong. Stop.

708
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:11,987
I know you're angry. I do,

709
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,288
but what will you do to him now?

710
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:20,487
Were you also the one...

711
00:48:20,688 --> 00:48:23,297
who kept sending packages
of drugs to Jae Gyeong?

712
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,998
- Yes.
- And what about 1882?

713
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,287
I thought only you and Jun Seo
knew about that, Jae Gyeong.

714
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:32,737
So, how did you find that out?

715
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:37,808
Twenty years ago,

716
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:40,323
I got beaten up by someone,

717
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:42,378
and Jun Seo told me
that it was an SOS signal.

718
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,818
He said to call Jae Gyeong
when things were urgent.

719
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:50,117
What did I ever do to you?

720
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,257
What did I do to you
that you got me addicted to drugs?

721
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:58,668
Stop smirking and answer me!

722
00:49:05,137 --> 00:49:06,297
When we were in 12th grade...

723
00:49:07,538 --> 00:49:09,978
before Jun Seo started hanging out
with you guys,

724
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:14,677
I was the only true friend Jun Seo had,
and he was the same to me.

725
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:18,258
But after hanging out with you guys
for a while,

726
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,117
he didn't even care about me.

727
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:24,803
Like that,
you guys took Jun Seo away from me.

728
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:27,657
So, I really hated you guys.

729
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,657
Hey, what are you talking about?

730
00:49:30,257 --> 00:49:32,228
Who took what away from you?

731
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:33,728
We were all classmates.

732
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:35,867
Just hear me out.
It's not that long of a story.

733
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:41,883
Then, Chae Kyung Tae died,

734
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:43,753
and you transferred to another school,
Jae Gyeong.

735
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:44,777
Jun Seo.

736
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:48,794
And you, Yoon Jin,
split up with Jun Seo...

737
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:50,378
as the Audiophile clubroom got smashed.

738
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:54,617
For 20 years after that,
Jun Seo and I got along well.

739
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:56,918
We even got along well...

740
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:00,487
when Won Jong Soo, Park Tae Jin,
Oh Chi Hyun, and Jeong Yoon Ho...

741
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:01,597
(Xinopharm)

742
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:05,367
ordered Jun Seo around,
used him, and looked down on him.

743
00:50:06,728 --> 00:50:07,728
Good work.

744
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:08,967
We were just fine.

745
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,438
But these guys were taking things too far.

746
00:50:16,777 --> 00:50:18,224
Delivering drugs wasn't enough.

747
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,483
Park Tae Jin even made Jun Seo
sell drugs too.

748
00:50:20,507 --> 00:50:22,447
Let's stop now. I can't do this anymore.

749
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:25,557
Why are you doing this
when we've come this far?

750
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,463
If we just keep going,
you'll fix Yoon Hee's illness for sure...

751
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,794
and even live without worrying
about money your whole life.

752
00:50:30,818 --> 00:50:33,803
Hey, so trust me, and let's keep going
for a few more months.

753
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:34,827
Whatever.

754
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:36,628
Let's stop now.

755
00:50:36,858 --> 00:50:38,228
Pay me what I've made so far.

756
00:50:38,498 --> 00:50:39,474
Park Jun Seo!

757
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:40,998
I said we should stop, you punk!

758
00:50:50,478 --> 00:50:52,158
He even played around with Jun Seo's wife.

759
00:50:52,777 --> 00:50:53,753
So what?

760
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:54,847
Darn it.

761
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,547
What does that have to do with
you getting me addicted?

762
00:50:58,387 --> 00:51:00,394
Sure, as you said, after I transferred,

763
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:03,164
I didn't even talk to Jun Seo once.
So why would you do that to me?

764
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,788
You're the worst of them all!

765
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:12,068
Jun Seo went to see you ten times.

766
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:14,173
I told him not to.

767
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,374
I told him getting your forgiveness
was meaningless,

768
00:51:16,398 --> 00:51:17,438
but he still went.

769
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,737
He went to see you
because he wanted your forgiveness.

770
00:51:22,108 --> 00:51:23,108
Hey.

771
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:24,653
He even begged for your forgiveness...

772
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:26,437
the day before he died,
and what did you say?

773
00:51:26,478 --> 00:51:29,378
- Sang Eui.
- You're not any better!

774
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:31,588
Did you listen to Jun Seo?

775
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:33,318
Did you?

776
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:35,558
He wasn't like himself,

777
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,688
but did you ask him why?

778
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:43,498
That fool.

779
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,498
He signed up for insurance...

780
00:51:46,998 --> 00:51:49,343
thinking you two would be the ones
to dig the truth behind it...

781
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:50,538
if he ever died.

782
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:56,914
I was the one
who stuck around for 20 years,

783
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:57,978
so why you two?

784
00:51:58,347 --> 00:51:59,378
Why?

785
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:04,217
Why were you two the most important
in his heart instead of me?

786
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:09,458
So?

787
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:13,034
Was that why you hired CEO Yoon
the night Jun Seo died...

788
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:15,003
to abduct me and get me addicted
to Lemon Mulberry...

789
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:17,697
before leaving me at exit 3-4
of Anhyun City Hall Station?

790
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:20,268
So that I would try
to investigate this case?

791
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:22,697
Jun Seo...

792
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:26,057
was so happy to hear
about your special promotion.

793
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,547
I thought,
"Sure, Jae Gyeong is so great,"

794
00:52:32,677 --> 00:52:34,907
"he'll be able to avenge Jun Seo."

795
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:38,664
(From Doctor, 1882)

796
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:39,918
(Sending, Sent)

797
00:52:40,588 --> 00:52:41,593
But I had no idea that great detective...

798
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,863
would lose to Gong Jin Wook
right off the bat.

799
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:45,088
He even took your gun.

800
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:48,088
So,

801
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:51,233
I meant for you to arrest Gong Jin Wook
and then find CEO Yoon through him.

802
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:53,768
Then, you'd find me, the Doctor,
and then Park Tae Jin.

803
00:52:55,498 --> 00:52:56,737
That was my plan.

804
00:52:57,268 --> 00:52:59,308
But it got off on the wrong foot
with Gong Jin Wook.

805
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:01,007
Then,

806
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:05,447
how did you know
about the security camera at the mill?

807
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:07,007
I told you. I didn't know about it.

808
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:09,617
So how much
of this are you responsible for?

809
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,018
Lee Myung Guk's corpse.

810
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:18,527
"Lee Myung Guk's corpse?"

811
00:53:19,257 --> 00:53:20,858
Did you put it back in his home?

812
00:53:21,628 --> 00:53:22,697
By yourself?

813
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:27,327
- With No Gyu Min.
- "No Gyu Min?"

814
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:30,398
No Gyu Min...

815
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:33,383
is the taxi driver who drove Jun Seo
to the construction site, isn't it?

816
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:34,383
Yes.

817
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:36,137
What does he have to do with this case?

818
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:38,407
Ask him yourself.
I'm sure you'll meet him soon.

819
00:53:38,608 --> 00:53:39,624
What?

820
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:41,124
Manpyeong Port at 4:00 a.m.,
two days from now.

821
00:53:41,148 --> 00:53:42,868
You can make a stop
in Boryeong before then.

822
00:53:43,077 --> 00:53:44,347
Who's in Boryeong?

823
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:47,593
That grandma who is receiving the pension?

824
00:53:47,617 --> 00:53:49,588
Go and ask yourself.

825
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,797
Why did you bring Lee Myung Guk's corpse
back to that house?

826
00:53:59,697 --> 00:54:01,268
To make Jeong Yoon Ho take my bait.

827
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:06,338
Jang Jae Gyeong...

828
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,938
That would allow you
to arrest Jeong Yoon Ho,

829
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:12,577
followed by Oh Chi Hyun and Won Jong Soo.

830
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,717
I thought you'd figure out
who killed Jun Seo through it.

831
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:23,318
But Jae Gyeong, you're unpredictable.

832
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:24,918
You keep losing people.

833
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:26,527
Do you find this fun?

834
00:54:29,858 --> 00:54:31,097
I'm sure you had fun.

835
00:54:35,498 --> 00:54:37,467
You must've had fun manipulating me...

836
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:39,938
after getting me addicted to drugs.

837
00:54:40,808 --> 00:54:43,507
You said you did this
because we were bad and you hated us.

838
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:45,347
Then what about you?

839
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:47,148
How are you any better?

840
00:54:48,248 --> 00:54:50,648
You were around Jun Seo for 20 years,
but what have you done?

841
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:53,224
He was suffering
under Won Jong Soo and Park Tae Jin,

842
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,418
but what did you do for him?

843
00:54:55,757 --> 00:54:57,918
That's why I'm helping him now
by using you.

844
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:03,358
I'm helping Jun Seo get his revenge now.

845
00:55:03,597 --> 00:55:04,697
Are you serious?

846
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:06,797
You're out of your mind.

847
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:12,784
Fine.

848
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:15,878
Let's see if you can speak that proudly
at the station too.

849
00:55:17,378 --> 00:55:18,447
Park Tae Jin.

850
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,478
Are you sure you can arrest him?

851
00:55:23,978 --> 00:55:26,164
Do you have
a single piece of evidence that proves...

852
00:55:26,188 --> 00:55:28,124
Park Tae Jin killed Jun Seo
or that he sold drugs?

853
00:55:28,148 --> 00:55:30,858
How are you so sure he killed Jun Seo?

854
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:33,487
Can't you see?
All clues are pointing to it.

855
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:36,697
Park Tae Jin stopped them
from going up to the ninth floor.

856
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:38,667
He was also the one who checked the body.

857
00:55:38,697 --> 00:55:40,173
He did the postmortem examination...

858
00:55:40,197 --> 00:55:42,737
and pushed to omit the autopsy
until the very end.

859
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:45,637
But you have no evidence.

860
00:55:46,268 --> 00:55:48,653
He made sure to cut off any connection
between him and Jun Seo.

861
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:50,213
They never spoke about drugs on the phone,

862
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:52,518
and he handed over Gong Jin Wook
for Jun Seo to deal with.

863
00:55:55,677 --> 00:55:56,917
This is the deal with the case.

864
00:55:57,447 --> 00:56:00,963
Even if you dig further,
all you'll get is that I made the drugs...

865
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:03,088
and that Jun Seo sold them.

866
00:56:04,157 --> 00:56:05,157
And?

867
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,128
What do you have?

868
00:56:07,728 --> 00:56:11,027
Do you have proof
that Tae Jin killed Jun Seo?

869
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:16,137
I can help Park Tae Jin make
a mistake at least.

870
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:20,538
Hey.

871
00:56:22,538 --> 00:56:23,608
Jang Jae Gyeong.

872
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:27,407
I won't run away.

873
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,124
I schemed everything.
I'll accept the punishment I deserve.

874
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,288
Arrest me!

875
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:36,058
But, not now.

876
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,834
You can't prove anything
if you arrest me now.

877
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:41,157
So please wait until then. Okay?

878
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:45,604
This was why I brought you here today!

879
00:56:45,628 --> 00:56:48,128
I'll make sure that happens!

880
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:51,737
That's how...

881
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:55,038
That's how I'll get my revenge.

882
00:57:04,277 --> 00:57:06,387
Yoon Jin. Jae Gyeong.

883
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:09,088
I regret what I did.

884
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:15,998
I'm so sorry...

885
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,527
I made the drugs, Jae Gyeong.

886
00:57:20,427 --> 00:57:22,898
Please give me a chance.

887
00:57:23,637 --> 00:57:27,014
If you give me some time,
I'll get Park Tae Jin for you.

888
00:57:27,038 --> 00:57:28,677
Jang Jae Gyeong!

889
00:57:36,947 --> 00:57:37,978
Let's go home.

890
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,217
Send some gifts
to Mayor Joo In Sang's house.

891
00:57:42,818 --> 00:57:45,757
Nice oysters from Tongyeong would be good.

892
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:49,403
- Make sure to add a thank-you card.
- Okay.

893
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:51,197
The chairman's leaving right now.

894
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:53,927
It'll only take a moment. Is he inside?

895
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:01,308
(Chairman's Office)

896
00:58:03,907 --> 00:58:04,907
You can come along.

897
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:13,518
I know what you want to say...

898
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:16,918
but just follow my orders.

899
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:18,788
I don't like it.

900
00:58:20,827 --> 00:58:23,657
I don't like being a prosecutor.
I never liked being one.

901
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:26,588
I don't want to live a single day
as a prosecutor.

902
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:28,268
Despite that,

903
00:58:29,398 --> 00:58:30,967
I kept my place...

904
00:58:31,898 --> 00:58:33,268
just as you wished.

905
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,677
I wanted to become a businessman.

906
00:58:38,507 --> 00:58:40,677
I thought that suited me better.

907
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,378
I've been serving you from a young age,

908
00:58:44,617 --> 00:58:45,887
and I know Jong Soo well.

909
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:48,688
I believe I know what's best
for Keumhyung Group's future.

910
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:51,257
That's why I would like to work...

911
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,228
as a part of the company.

912
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:56,058
Same with the Pilo-dong project.

913
00:58:57,058 --> 00:58:59,027
I planned, polished, and edited it.

914
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:01,297
That was why...

915
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:03,898
it got to where it is.

916
00:59:08,007 --> 00:59:09,527
Please have my transfer appointment...

917
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,854
to Gwacheon's
Prosecution Bureau withdrawn.

918
00:59:11,878 --> 00:59:13,947
Also, please allow me...

919
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:16,947
to see to the end of this project.

920
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:19,117
If you would do that for me,

921
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:21,878
I'll make sure to build the future
of Keumhyung Group you...

922
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:23,688
- and Jong Soo dream of.
- How?

923
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,728
How are you going to do that?

924
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:30,427
- Well...
- You were a drug dealer.

925
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:33,527
How can you plan and construct
the future of Keumhyung Group?

926
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:36,097
Chairman.

927
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:40,237
The biggest risk this project has
isn't Joo In Sang or Jong Soo.

928
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:42,407
It's you.

929
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:47,447
When I first heard you were selling drugs,

930
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,717
I thought it would be temporary.

931
00:59:51,217 --> 00:59:52,217
Why?

932
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:57,518
Because you're someone
who believes you're smart.

933
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:01,264
Didn't we talk enough
at the soup place last time?

934
01:00:01,288 --> 01:00:02,998
I hoped you would've got my message.

935
01:00:03,427 --> 01:00:04,458
But what is this now?

936
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:08,498
Our company's fate depends
on the Pilo-dong project.

937
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:11,544
Yet you want
to bring in those filthy hands...

938
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:13,338
you used to sell drugs with?

939
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:15,208
How do you...

940
01:00:15,637 --> 01:00:17,378
No, let me ask this first.

941
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:21,224
Why did you work with Park Jun Seo...

942
01:00:21,248 --> 01:00:23,818
behind Jong Soo's back to make money?

943
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,328
Are you repaying my kindness with hatred?

944
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:30,318
Do you really not know?

945
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:36,358
Fine.

946
01:00:37,257 --> 01:00:39,974
You're right.
I worked with Jun Seo to sell drugs...

947
01:00:39,998 --> 01:00:41,768
so I could secure investment funds.

948
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:44,498
Is that so wrong?

949
01:00:47,237 --> 01:00:52,837
You forced companies
to go out of business...
59:59,400... > 01:00:02,570
and bought them for next to nothing
to make the Keumhyung Group today.

950
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:57,318
In the process,
you made eight people commit suicide.

951
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:00,688
Tell me.

952
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:04,034
Can you say
that the money you earned this way...

953
01:01:04,058 --> 01:01:06,418
is truly cleaner than the money I earned
from selling drugs?

954
01:01:08,058 --> 01:01:09,697
Would adding some of my money taint...

955
01:01:11,027 --> 01:01:12,998
the company more than it already is?

956
01:01:18,438 --> 01:01:20,838
All you merely had were ten cows.

957
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,253
Your family couldn't even afford
to feed them.

958
01:01:24,277 --> 01:01:25,878
I took their only son...

959
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:29,177
and poured my money into him
to turn him into a human.

960
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:31,577
But what is this?

961
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:34,447
What a work of art you've become.

962
01:01:55,577 --> 01:01:56,878
Is Sang Eui telling the truth?

963
01:01:57,838 --> 01:01:59,708
Is it okay to leave him like this?

964
01:02:00,808 --> 01:02:02,248
If I arrest him now,

965
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,748
I'll be able to prove that he made drugs
and that Jun Seo sold them.

966
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:08,887
Park Tae Jin, that jerk.

967
01:02:09,487 --> 01:02:11,518
What can we do to make him confess?

968
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,164
The case will face limits
if left as a narcotics case.

969
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,348
I won't be able to uncover
who sits above Park Jun Seo.

970
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,768
It'll only support their case
that Jun Seo committed suicide.

971
01:02:20,797 --> 01:02:22,967
That selling drugs led him
to kill himself?

972
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,608
So what can we do?

973
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:31,808
Sang Eui is psychotic.
Are we going to trust him and wait?

974
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:35,894
He drugged you for his revenge.

975
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,878
He's out of his mind.

976
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:49,228
Tell Sang Eui to bring me some new drugs.

977
01:02:49,628 --> 01:02:51,548
I don't want the usual stuff
on a day like today.

978
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:54,867
Come on, what's with the face?

979
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:57,068
Today will be the last.

980
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,737
I'm going to the US next month
to get treatment.

981
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,407
Don't be so shocked.

982
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:06,907
Anyway, that's the plan.

983
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,347
Let me just enjoy it tonight.

984
01:03:11,217 --> 01:03:12,217
All right.

985
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:13,347
Tell him to hurry.

986
01:03:26,728 --> 01:03:27,728
Hey, Sang Eui.

987
01:03:28,797 --> 01:03:30,637
Can you bring some drugs
to the Lorraine Hotel?

988
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:33,808
Would 30 minutes be enough?

989
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:37,237
Okay.

990
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:45,894
(I spotted Jeong Sang Eui leaving
with a man and a woman after...)

991
01:03:45,918 --> 01:03:48,288
(Park Sang Jin, Secretary's Office)

992
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,838
(Anhyeon Police Station)

993
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:17,418
Captain Jang.

994
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:20,788
We found...

995
01:04:23,387 --> 01:04:24,418
Jeong Yoon Ho.

996
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,188
Where?

997
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,538
(Connection)

998
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:21,577
(Connection)

999
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:23,494
I can't read him anymore.

1000
01:05:23,518 --> 01:05:24,947
It's not for sure yet.

1001
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:26,117
What's going on?

1002
01:05:26,987 --> 01:05:28,463
Did you sell drugs behind my back?

1003
01:05:28,487 --> 01:05:30,894
This is why hierarchy is important!

1004
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:33,164
That money! No one can get it out.

1005
01:05:33,188 --> 01:05:35,757
Park Tae Jin is finally on the move.

1006
01:05:36,257 --> 01:05:38,398
We'll seize
and search Youngryun Cold Storage.

1007
01:05:38,628 --> 01:05:39,628
Let's head inside.

1008
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:43,443
I was asked to pass this over...

1009
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:44,773
if you two ever came.

1010
01:05:44,797 --> 01:05:46,668
What's on it?

1011
01:05:47,268 --> 01:05:48,268
Gong Jin Wook.

1012
01:05:52,878 --> 01:05:54,224
It wasn't your first time
meeting CEO Yoon, was it?

1013
01:05:54,248 --> 01:05:55,478
What's wrong with all of you?

1014
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:57,717
Take a good look at what you've done.
