1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:04,923
(Connection)

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:09,944
(All characters, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,101
Is Yoon Ho home?

4
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:15,400
(Jae Gyeong goes to Yoon Ho's house)

5
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:17,445
Do you remember our visit
to Lee Myung Guk's place?

6
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,908
Molotov cocktails were thrown in.

7
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,434
And Yoon Ho was the one who threw them.

8
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,641
Why would he?

9
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,589
Whoever left Lee's body there...

10
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:24,619
must have told Yoon Ho...

11
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:25,889
that the man he killed and buried...

12
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:29,883
was dug back up and placed at home.

13
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:32,459
Yoon Ho showed up at that house
to get rid of Lee Myung Guk's body.

14
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,413
Captain Jang, we'll get Jeong Yoon Ho.

15
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:35,569
You stay there.

16
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,593
Did the other detectives go to get him?

17
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,789
(He misses Yoon Ho because of the interference of Si Jung)

18
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:40,622
Run away.

19
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,399
Get out of there.
Detectives are on the way.

20
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:44,346
You can't get caught!

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,784
- Yoon Jin.
- Yes?

22
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:47,155
What character do you think this is?

23
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,585
The character for "pil"
that means necessary...

24
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,641
is used in the name, "Pilo-dong."

25
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:53,264
I think this is referring
to Jeong Sang Eui.

26
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,640
Youngryun Cold Storage.

27
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:56,222
I checked on the way.

28
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,476
Keumhyung Pharmaceutical owns
Youngryun Cold Storage.

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,090
There was nothing there when we went.

30
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:02,940
Most of them, I already knew about.

31
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:04,016
But one of them is weird.

32
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,542
(Ji Yeon came soon after)

33
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,335
Which one?

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,931
There was a pension insurance
that Jun Seo got 11 years ago.

35
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:11,591
And an old lady in her 60s in Boryeong
has been receiving the pension.

36
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:12,700
Yoon Jin!

37
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:13,490
(When Joo Song was celebrating Yoon Jin's birthday)

38
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:17,953
<i>Happy birthday</i>

39
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:18,662
(Ji Yeon is flustered when she finds out Yoon Jin's birthday)

40
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:20,955
Is today your birthday?

41
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:21,408
(The password that Ji Yeon and Joon Seo used together)

42
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:22,294
What is that?

43
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:22,998
(The password that Ji Yeon and Joon Seo used together)

44
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,040
It's just the one I've been using
for a long time.

45
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:27,440
Should we use that from now on?

46
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:28,468
(The password that Ji Yeon and Joon Seo used together)

47
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:31,403
(It was Yoon Jin's birthday)

48
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:32,521
What is this text about?

49
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,581
(When Yoon Jin found out the password, she called Tae Jin out)

50
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:36,382
I'll put in the password myself.

51
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:40,344
Once you transfer half of the
money to the account I want,

52
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,456
I'll return all these pictures and recordings back to you.

53
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:52,536
(Yoon Jin enters the password in exchange for half of the money)

54
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,484
Oh Yoon Jin!

55
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,904
(Taejin angered, attacked Yoon Jin)

56
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,928
Die!

57
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:01,692
(Taejin angered, attacked Yoon Jin)

58
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:06,610
(Joo Song appeared just in time to save Yoon Jin)

59
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,082
The guy came.
Please head over right away.

60
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,331
(The shop owner calls Jae Gyeong)

61
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,721
(Following Yoon's henchman, entering the old shopping district)

62
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,227
(Chang Soo was passing by in front of Jae Gyeong)

63
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,190
Kim Chang Soo.

64
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:18,459
What are you doing here?

65
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:20,029
(Jae Gyeong was flustered by Chang Soo's apperance)

66
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:21,614
(A gunshot was heard)

67
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,782
(They came to the scene immediately)

68
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:27,096
(Jae Gyeong finds out the secret room where he was drugged.)

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,187
(Questioning CEO Yoon)

70
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,168
Do you know Park Jun Seo?

71
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:29,602
(Questioning CEO Yoon)

72
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:30,372
Did Park Tae Jin put you up to it?

73
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,390
(She died)

74
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,503
Hey. Did you get me addicted?

75
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:34,381
I'll gather the evidence,

76
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,733
and return to the station first
with CEO Yoon's man outside.

77
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,636
If you keep the fact
that you saw me last time...

78
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,445
a secret until you die,

79
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,469
I'll let you get out after a short stint.

80
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,316
What's wrong with detectives these days?

81
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,951
One's a druggie,

82
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,975
- and...
- Shut your mouth!

83
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:55,323
(Eventually, Chang Soo jumps into the river with the intention to kill Gi Sung)

84
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:55,680
(Jae Gyeong arrived at the scene)

85
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:56,357
Chang Soo!

86
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,097
It was my mistake.

87
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:00,121
I thought it would be okay
to transport him alone.

88
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,145
(Feeling a bit suspicious)

89
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,980
(Investigating the scene)

90
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:05,318
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

91
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,473
Did anyone touch the window
by the driver's seat?

92
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:07,823
(Chang Soo had opened the driver's window)

93
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:09,766
No, we just got it out of the water.

94
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,824
Does that mean he went in the water
with the window open?

95
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:12,896
In this weather?

96
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,565
Did Chang Soo...

97
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:30,633
(Call history: Gong Jin Wook)

98
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,226
(Gong Jin Wook)

99
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,739
Hello?

100
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:42,869
Doctor, it's me.

101
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,715
What is it?

102
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,839
Well...

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,339
Today,

104
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,578
I killed CEO Yoon.

105
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,078
What?

106
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:54,148
So for a while,
you won't be able to sell in Korea.

107
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:56,319
I doubt you can find someone else.

108
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,159
For a while,

109
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,188
no one will be willing to sell.

110
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,699
I'll go to China.
I have connections there.

111
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:07,998
So...

112
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:10,328
Keep supplying me.

113
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,169
In return...

114
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,209
I need you to get me on a boat to China.

115
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:18,009
Mr. Gong.

116
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,509
I'm not asking for a free ride.

117
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,948
I'll send you two items
via subway courier very soon.

118
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,349
I'm sending them believing
they'll be of some value to you.

119
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,049
That's...

120
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,319
all I have right now.

121
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,538
Put the items in the back seat.

122
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,278
The money's in the envelope.

123
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,478
Okay.

124
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,418
This much?

125
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:59,339
(Connection)

126
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,008
(Episode 11)

127
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,458
They didn't get access to the account?

128
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,059
It looked like it.

129
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,869
Will Tae Jin be okay?

130
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,239
I don't know
where I got the guts to do that.

131
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,839
Yoon Jin was in so much danger.

132
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,439
How did she figure out the password?

133
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:35,578
At your place, when Ji Yeon
was throwing up in your toilet.

134
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:39,418
Yoon Jin got into Ji Yeon's phone.

135
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:42,189
That's why as soon as
Ji Yeon left my place,

136
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,818
she met with Tae Jin...

137
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:46,319
and asked him about Jun Seo and Yoon Jin?

138
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,929
She must be in all sorts of shock.

139
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,258
What did the doctor say?

140
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,499
She might be like that for a while
and we should watch her.

141
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,339
Does she need to be admitted?

142
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:59,445
No.

143
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:00,698
Oh Yoon Jin!

144
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,608
Die!

145
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,858
Don't you think you should see a doctor?

146
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,458
This CCTV video.

147
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,499
Delete it.

148
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:28,369
What?

149
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,869
Delete everything.

150
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,268
Delete it?

151
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,669
Okay, sure.

152
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,179
Two, three.

153
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:47,218
Four.

154
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,419
Eight.

155
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,239
Open up.

156
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,479
Chew.

157
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,408
Does it taste okay?

158
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,919
Good for you.

159
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,888
Here. Open wide.

160
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,059
It's okay.

161
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,299
It was too big.

162
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:37,328
You can't open your mouth wide.

163
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:40,338
I should give you very little.

164
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,509
You're doing this
because you're embarrassed,

165
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:50,379
but I have lots of questions,
so let's quit.

166
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,649
If you don't stand at the count of three,

167
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:53,879
I'll pull out your chair.

168
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:55,388
One, two...

169
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,018
What is it?

170
00:08:57,618 --> 00:08:58,789
Do you need to pee?

171
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,059
Shall we go to the toilet?

172
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,658
What?

173
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:11,968
- Joo Song.
- Yes?

174
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,299
Next time,

175
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,539
add some kkakdugi sauce to my soup.

176
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,408
You kept feeding me bland broth...

177
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:21,949
and plain rice with nothing else.

178
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,679
Are you okay, Yoon Jin?

179
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,049
Can't you tell?

180
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,019
I only slightly sprained my neck.

181
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,789
Hey, was that an act? Darn you!

182
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,389
I was so worried about you!

183
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,528
I was embarrassed.

184
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,828
That's why.

185
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,569
- Sorry.
- Joo Song told me everything else.

186
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,499
What's the password for?

187
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,239
It can't be for a bank account.

188
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:51,338
It seemed to be
some kind of cryptocurrency.

189
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,708
Was it Thailand?

190
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,309
Did you check the site?

191
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,179
Yes.

192
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,749
They were weirdly funny.

193
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:04,588
The password is eight digits.

194
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,919
Tae Jin chose the first four,

195
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:09,929
and Jun Seo chose the last four.

196
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,528
They clearly didn't trust each other.

197
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,898
Does that mean
Tae Jin didn't kill Jun Seo?

198
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:17,629
He wouldn't have been so rash...

199
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,069
if he didn't have the password.

200
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,809
Tae Jin would've thought
he could get the code from Ji Yeon.

201
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,908
But what now?

202
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,879
There are zero clues
as to what the password is.

203
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,179
They only have one try left.

204
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,348
That money.

205
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:40,258
It's possible Jun Seo and Tae Jin
made it from selling drugs.

206
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:42,758
Were you going to...

207
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:44,729
make a deal with Tae Jin knowing that?

208
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:46,898
I know, right?

209
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,198
I'm remorseful, okay?

210
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,299
I'll let you scold me,

211
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,768
but will you let me at least finish...

212
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:58,338
my food?

213
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:04,919
Thanks. I was starving.

214
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,649
Someone called "Doctor" appears...

215
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,648
in the Lemon Mulberry investigation.

216
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,249
The manufacturer.

217
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,189
Do you remember Lee Myung Guk's logs?

218
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,789
He met Jeong Sang Eui
regularly at a lab...

219
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,828
in Pilo-dong and did something.

220
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,729
What they made then...

221
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,498
was Lemon Mulberry?

222
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,569
At first, they'll have made
small batches just for Jong Soo.

223
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,669
Then...

224
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,609
Lee Myung Guk manufactured it,
Jun Seo delivered it,

225
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:30,439
and Jong Soo took it?

226
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,979
I can follow that far.

227
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:35,049
But...

228
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:39,078
where does Tae Jin come in
when he's not in this picture?

229
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,988
Manufactures, delivers, and takes.

230
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:44,118
It's a simple picture
and Tae Jin's not in it.

231
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:45,988
Jun Seo was the courier.

232
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:49,628
Why did he switch roles
and start a drug business with Tae Jin?

233
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,998
Hey, that's sharp.

234
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,228
Thanks.

235
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:57,768
Because of who and what he is,

236
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,498
Tae Jin would've planned it
so he was never at the forefront.

237
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,468
He'd have used Jun Seo.

238
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,509
And Jun Seo who felt uneasy about it...

239
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:07,478
would've thought
he should have at least...

240
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,248
the last four digits of the code
to keep Tae Jin in check.

241
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,919
What about now that Jun Seo is dead?

242
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:15,988
Without Jun Seo,

243
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,618
who's delivering Jong Soo's supply,

244
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,459
and who's running
the Lemon Mulberry business...

245
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,559
Tae Jin used to?

246
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,019
Hey.

247
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:56,728
(Xinopharm)

248
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:58,399
Good job.

249
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,899
Thanks.

250
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:22,289
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

251
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,338
What brings you here at this hour?

252
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,009
I had something to ask you.

253
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,348
I met Oh Yoon Jin last night.

254
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,549
Why do you think...

255
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:33,588
I met with her?

256
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,689
I'm not sure.

257
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,189
Did you know?

258
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,659
Yoon Jin also knew...

259
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,628
the password.

260
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,738
Was it right?

261
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:52,878
Was it...

262
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,679
really the password?

263
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:26,838
Tae Jin.

264
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,909
Tae Jin!

265
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:10,189
(Jeong Sang Eui)

266
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,759
- What is it?
- Can you talk right now?

267
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,458
Go ahead. What is it?

268
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,299
Well, something big happened...

269
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,868
- Something big?
- Yes.

270
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,439
CEO Yoon, the person
who Gong Jin Wook did business with...

271
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,598
You idiot!

272
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:29,868
Don't you ever listen to what I say?

273
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,679
I told you not to talk about
this stuff over the phone, didn't I?

274
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,108
Oh, right. Sorry.

275
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,878
Sang Eui.

276
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,488
How much longer will you act
like such a dumb fool?

277
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:46,488
Hey, I'm sorry. It was so urgent that I...

278
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,728
Hey, then where should we meet?
Should I come to you?

279
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:00,598
Tomorrow at 4 p.m.
Come to Myeongeul Garden.

280
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:03,639
You remember
the place we had dinner last time?

281
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:05,509
Oh, okay.

283
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:25,659
(Yigu Group Han Sung Hoon)

284
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,998
Hey, how did it go?

285
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,399
For real?

286
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,738
Okay, got it. Good work.

287
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:53,988
What was it?

288
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,858
Did the board approve?

289
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,328
Yigu Group...

290
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,639
is giving us 500 million dollars.

291
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:08,785
You scared me.

292
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,169
We're all set, you punk!

293
00:18:16,008 --> 00:18:17,108
We're set.

294
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,878
Now, as soon as Mayor Joo In Sang
signs off on it,

295
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:21,819
this will all be ours, Chi Hyun.

296
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,289
Of course.

297
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,289
I'm sure Joo In Sang won't have
any reasons to oppose this.

298
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,488
Good work.

299
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:33,228
Seriously.

300
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:35,828
Gosh!

301
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,769
(Prosecution Service)

302
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,409
Is that so?

303
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:45,978
That's good news.

304
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,049
Congratulations.

305
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,848
Of course, I should be there too.

306
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:55,319
See you later.

307
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,289
Bye.

308
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:20,509
Have a seat.

309
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,179
What brings you all the way here?
You didn't even call.

310
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:31,319
I thought you wouldn't show up
if you were called in as a testifier.

311
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,189
What?

312
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,259
That's your number, right?

313
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,445
So?

314
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,299
This is a list of calls
Jeong Yoon Ho made...

315
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,238
from a payphone the night before last.

316
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,639
Why do you think Yoon Ho called you?

317
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:51,708
What do you think?

318
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:53,238
Park Tae Jin.

319
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,078
I'm asking because I'm curious too.

320
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,679
A friend from high school
who's wanted for murder...

321
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:01,319
called in the middle of the night
from a payphone.

322
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:02,889
What do you think we talked about?

323
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,889
It's obvious.

324
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:09,858
"On what grounds was I named
a murder suspect?"

325
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,399
"Couldn't you help me out somehow?"

326
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,228
So?

327
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:16,398
I told him to turn himself in.

328
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,628
Don't you think
you would've done the same?

329
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,668
Let me know right away
if Yoon Ho calls you again.

330
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,938
Don't make me find out first
and come looking for you.

331
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,509
- All right.
- Also,

332
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:31,449
what happened last night?

333
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:33,979
You nearly killed Yoon Jin.

334
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:37,719
You already deleted the CCTV footage
from the Internet cafe.

335
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:41,789
Did you kill Jun Seo?

336
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:53,168
I'm a prosecutor.

337
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,569
This kind of shock method...

338
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:00,938
might work on guys like
Jeong Sang Eui or Oh Chi Hyun.

339
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,378
But you must know
that it doesn't work for me.

340
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:06,279
You heard...

341
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,578
that we were there that night.

342
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:11,949
You must be confused.

343
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:16,259
You must be so sure that one of us
did that to Jun Seo,

344
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,699
but Jun Seo had to fall
when we were all inside the elevator.

345
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,069
You can't prove a direct murder, right?

346
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,938
You must've had to
use your brain a bit for this one.

347
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,138
But it's too bad...

348
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,408
that Jun Seo left without telling you
the password.

349
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,209
Judging by the scale
of the Lemon Mulberry business,

350
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,279
it must be worth
at least ten million dollars.

351
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,489
It must be such a waste.

352
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:46,289
Right?

353
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,088
Are you the Doctor?

354
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,128
Did you drag me into this?

355
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:01,898
"Drag you in?"

356
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,578
I have no idea what you're talking about.

357
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:08,509
Lemon Mulberry and what? The Doctor?

358
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:10,309
What is all that about?

359
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:12,719
That's right.

360
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:14,918
You'd have to say that you don't know.

361
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:20,388
I might be recording our conversation
right now.

362
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:23,158
I'm warning you.

363
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:26,358
Judging by my gut feeling,

364
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,729
I think I'm nearly there.

365
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:32,699
I think I could catch you
if I just reach my hand out.

366
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,039
From now on,
when you make your next move,

367
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,078
be extra careful.

368
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:42,449
At this rate,

369
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:45,648
you'll get caught by me.

370
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,238
(Chairman, Won Chang Ho)

371
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:08,338
Come in.

372
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,838
(Keumhyung Group)

373
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:15,709
Have you heard?

374
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,678
It's 500 million dollars.

375
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,418
I was hoping for 200 or 300 million...

376
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,249
at the most.

377
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:25,819
Doesn't 500 million dollars mean...

378
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:28,989
Yigu Group believes in this project?

379
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,358
I just spoke to Chairman Han on the phone.

380
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,128
He has high hopes for this project.
He looks forward to it.

381
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,729
I see.

382
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:39,638
We only need the business approval
from the city now.

383
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:41,638
When are you seeing Mayor Joo?

384
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,309
We're meeting for lunch tomorrow.

385
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,439
The situation is different
from the last time,

386
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,678
so I'll make sure to bring good news.

387
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:48,178
As you should.

388
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:53,749
What is it?

389
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:57,588
How are things between you
and Tae Jin these days?

390
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,088
Good. Why do you ask?

391
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:03,828
Tae Jin told me...

392
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:06,499
he'd like to join...

393
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,368
the Pilo-dong project as an investor.

394
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:11,969
Pardon?

395
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,739
Oh, that?

396
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,908
He mentioned it briefly before.

397
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,209
He must know a few people
who have money around him.

398
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,749
He must be talking about them.

399
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,779
I already checked.

400
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,989
How much longer will you rely on Tae Jin?

401
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,729
You should've figured this out already
and have it sorted out.

402
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:42,469
I told him not to get any ideas
and to remain a prosecutor,

403
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,799
but he already had his head in the clouds.

404
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,209
Act oblivious for a while.

405
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:53,178
Just quietly put a man on him.

406
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:56,049
Okay.

407
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,219
Should I give you two some privacy?

408
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,019
Yes. Thank you.

409
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:08,618
(Fragrant Express,
Number 1 in customer satisfaction!)

410
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:11,588
Did you capture all of them?

411
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:13,428
Yes, all thanks to you.

412
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:16,129
Unfortunately,
except for the main culprit,

413
00:25:16,129 --> 00:25:17,529
we caught everyone else.

414
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:18,928
I see.

415
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:20,838
Okay.

416
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:25,739
If you have something to say,
please go ahead.

417
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:30,578
Have you ever smuggled anyone out?

418
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:31,685
Yes, when I was young.

419
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,078
- To where?
- China.

420
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,648
You have the contacts
of other smugglers, right?

421
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,595
We lost contact a long time ago.

422
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,895
It was ages ago.

423
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,519
I'm sure you can easily find out
if you ask someone.

424
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:42,858
Hey.

425
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:45,459
Even if in this line of work,

426
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,398
people change jobs often.

427
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:50,229
The guys I used to know...

428
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,838
are either behind bars or dead now.

429
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,499
Just look into it.

430
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,878
One should live a clean life
from the beginning.

431
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,819
It's so hard...

432
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:11,848
when you try to switch over.

433
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,418
That's exactly my point.

434
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:24,269
You scare me.

435
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,539
- Young Eun.
- Mom!

436
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:31,838
How did you manage to come?

437
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,378
I thought the police wouldn't let you out.

438
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,009
I sneaked out.

439
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:38,848
I went to see Dad.

440
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,349
Mom!

441
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,719
He's well.

442
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,988
What if they catch you on your way back?

443
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:46,789
I waited for you
so we could go in together.

444
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:49,559
It'll be okay
if I go back with my daughter.

445
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,398
Is anyone there?

446
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:55,529
No.

447
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:57,269
Great. Let's go.

448
00:26:58,969 --> 00:27:00,168
What should we have for dinner?

449
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:01,868
I don't know.

450
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:05,168
Ms. Kang Si Jung.

451
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,678
Where have you been?

452
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:10,049
I went to meet my daughter.

453
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,108
Can't you tell?

454
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:16,388
We'll have to take you in.

455
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,289
Thanks for your hard work today.

456
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,258
Hey, you have no excuse to be tired.

457
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:28,158
Of course, I'm tired.
I worked hard to earn money today.

458
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,578
I can't understand it either.

459
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:48,749
I don't know why he used my birthdate
as the password.

460
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:52,388
We only dated briefly in high school...

461
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,489
You can barely call that dating
these days.

462
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,928
If I had been in your position,

463
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,098
I would've felt offended too.

464
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,139
I understand, but...

465
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:11,969
You're right. I was offended.

466
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,608
But I thought about it
upon returning home,

467
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,108
and they were all excuses I had made up
for myself.

468
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,449
To be honest,
the seven years of our married life...

469
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:26,418
Our dear Yoon Hee...

470
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:29,628
was sick ever since she was born,

471
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,388
but we were happy then.

472
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:37,168
Then Yoon Hee passed away.

473
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,168
I was lonely,

474
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:45,769
and Tae Jin approached me.

475
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,478
I was tempted for a while...

476
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,719
but believed it would soon pass.

477
00:28:56,189 --> 00:28:57,549
It somehow turned this way.

478
00:28:59,018 --> 00:29:00,688
Before Jun Seo died,

479
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:04,259
did he know...

480
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,358
about you and Tae Jin?

481
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:10,398
Yes.

482
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:19,239
(February 13, 2024)

483
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:51,168
Are you still up?

484
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,178
Why did you wait up?

485
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:05,789
I'm going to bed.

486
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,059
Ji Yeon.

487
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,259
When did it begin?

488
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,299
What?

489
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:17,569
Did it happen...

490
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:20,898
before Yoon Hee left?

491
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:23,239
Or after?

492
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:27,908
Does that matter?

493
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,779
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:37,918
I don't think it matters.

495
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,019
When was that?

496
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:10,949
About ten days before my husband died.

497
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:19,628
Tae Jin came to me this morning...

498
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:24,098
and realized that the password I had
was the same as yours.

499
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:26,138
He then turned around and left.

500
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:29,969
I had to part ways with Yoon Hee
and then Jun Seo.

501
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,138
I was scared
of having Tae Jin leave me too.

502
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:40,918
I wondered how he would act...

503
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:43,249
once I told him the password.

504
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,418
I was afraid he'd leave me.

505
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:51,588
I wasn't sure how I'd survive
in this world alone.

506
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:53,959
Yes.

507
00:31:56,768 --> 00:31:58,368
So this was where I ended up.

508
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,709
It's what I rightfully deserve.

509
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:08,878
That was the thought in my head.

510
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:14,949
(Anhyeon Police Station)

511
00:32:19,518 --> 00:32:20,618
Captain.

512
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:30,299
Kang Si Jung's most recent call
reached somewhere in Inju-dong.

513
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:32,469
The other person used a burner phone.

514
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:34,999
Can you track the location of that number?

515
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:36,168
Yes, it's possible.

516
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,309
Do you want me to go in instead?

517
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:44,509
I'll do it.

518
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:00,729
Is Yoon Ho well?

519
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:07,239
You went to Inju-dong this morning.

520
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,638
Is Yoon Ho there?

521
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:11,569
Si Jung.

522
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:15,209
Yoon Ho is in a dangerous state.

523
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:18,078
We don't know who he'll harm next.

524
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,749
We must get him to turn himself in.

525
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,219
Jong Soo, Tae Jin, and Chi Hyun.

526
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:26,519
They're not interested in helping him.

527
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:31,328
If you have hopes
that they'll help out, you're mistaken.

528
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,469
Even right now,

529
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,928
the only one who can save Yoon Ho...

530
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,668
is you.

531
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,418
He didn't even ask.

532
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,158
If the kids and I were doing okay.

533
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:05,428
If any of us had been scared.

534
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,328
Or how I'd found him.

535
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,199
He didn't ask any of that.

536
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:13,969
All he said was...

537
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:17,239
"Have you heard from Chi Hyun?"

538
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:20,678
"Why haven't you done anything?"

539
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:23,308
"You should've gone
to Jong Soo or Tae Jin."

540
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:24,979
"What were you doing at home?"

541
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:27,319
That's all he said.

542
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:31,449
I got upset...

543
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:35,319
and asked if he wasn't worried
about me or the kids.

544
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:40,298
He told me not to worry
because Tae Jin and Jong Soo...

545
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:41,529
wouldn't ditch him this time.

546
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:46,368
The moron.

547
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,569
Would they have let it come to this
if they were going to help?

548
00:34:52,538 --> 00:34:54,078
Do you know whose fault it was...

549
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:55,739
when Yoon Ho first went away for murder?

550
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,979
That was on Won Jong Soo too.

551
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:01,918
I went to him so many times...

552
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,148
and begged for his help.

553
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,259
I pleaded to him.

554
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:12,459
Only Chi Hyun and Jun Seo
visited him in prison.

555
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:17,868
Can you...

556
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:21,239
bring Yoon Ho in...

557
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:24,009
so he doesn't get hurt?

558
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:26,878
Can you give me your word?

559
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,118
Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

560
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:46,158
Pilo-dong murder suspect Jeong Yoon Ho.

561
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:48,158
He's hiding at Pine Motel in Inju-dong.

562
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:49,898
Send backup.

563
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:57,269
Your kids are home alone, right?

564
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,608
I'll get someone to drive you.

565
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,959
(Jeonghaejang Motel)

566
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,598
He checked out two hours ago.

567
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,039
What about his phone signal?

568
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,398
It's still in the neighborhood.

569
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,408
He'll have gone to another motel.

570
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:32,738
Send his description...

571
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:34,639
- to the patrol units.
- Okay.

572
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,749
We'll visit nearby motels.

573
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:38,608
- Get to it.
- I'll go this way.

574
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,989
This suspect's in the neighborhood,
so be on the lookout.

575
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:15,249
Hello, it's the police.

576
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:19,148
We won't enter the room.
We just want a peek.

577
00:37:19,148 --> 00:37:20,259
Excuse us.

578
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:25,858
Excuse us. Sorry.

579
00:37:28,628 --> 00:37:30,728
(A1 Motel)

580
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:34,599
(A1 Motel)

581
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:56,659
Sang Eui. Come on in.

582
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,159
Hey, Sang Eui.

583
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:00,429
You're in a coat?

584
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,759
Looking good.

585
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:07,498
Something great happened today,

586
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:10,069
so I called my friends
who suffered with me for a drink.

587
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:12,838
Sang Eui you were always researching,

588
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:15,838
manufacturing, and now delivering too.

589
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,648
- You were busy, right?
- Yes.

590
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:20,248
Take a seat.

591
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:22,679
I didn't say you could sit.

592
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:31,958
Sang Eui.

593
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:34,228
Did you meet with Jae Gyeong?

594
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,969
Yes.

595
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:41,599
I knew it.

596
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:44,369
You told Jae Gyeong...

597
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:46,909
we were all there...

598
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,978
the night Jun Seo died?

599
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,708
Yes, but I just...

600
00:39:01,858 --> 00:39:04,058
It's okay. You did great.

601
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,429
But you should watch what you say now.

602
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,329
Because of what you said,

603
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,668
Jae Gyeong came to me and strutted about.

604
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:16,469
Right. Sorry.

605
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,608
From now on, can you lot watch out...

606
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,079
so I don't have to put up with that again?

607
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:27,918
Especially you.

608
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:30,219
From now on,

609
00:39:30,389 --> 00:39:33,248
if Jae Gyeong says something,
talk right back at him.

610
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,688
Why worry when I'm behind you?

611
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,188
- Right?
- Yes.

612
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,168
Oh, Prosecutor Park. Welcome.

613
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,579
Our hidden mastermind.

614
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,009
Prosecutor Park Tae Jin.

615
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,208
You did well planning all this.

616
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,819
I'm sorry to be a party pooper.

617
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,489
When will you meet Mayor Joo?

618
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,349
You are a party pooper.

619
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:09,989
That name is banned in my house,
you know.

620
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:14,099
I'm meeting him for lunch tomorrow
with Vice President Han.

621
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:16,998
It won't be like last time.

622
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:18,228
I hope so.

623
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,938
Let's have a toast.

624
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,369
To the great success...

625
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,009
of the Pilo-dong venture!

626
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:31,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

627
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:40,558
Since I pooped on the party,
I'd like to speak with the group.

628
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:46,288
Hey, Sang Eui. Wait outside.

629
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:47,458
Okay.

630
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:54,668
(New recording)

631
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:56,239
What's this about?

632
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,838
I met Jeong Yoon Ho yesterday.

633
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,079
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

634
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,949
We met in a quiet place,
and I gave him some cash.

635
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,748
I told him to lie low
until things quietened down.

636
00:41:10,048 --> 00:41:12,489
Jang Jae Gyeong came to see me yesterday.

637
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,228
He got all excited, I see.

638
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:19,929
He came to see me today.

639
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,259
What did he say?

640
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,429
The obvious.

641
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,069
So what about Jeong Yoon Ho?

642
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,168
The police are pretty sure...

643
00:41:31,168 --> 00:41:34,579
he's guilty of murdering
Lee Myung Guk and the mill owner.

644
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:37,608
They have a car and CCTV tapes
that prove it was him.

645
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:39,279
Here's the problem.

646
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,819
Why he killed Lee Myung Guk,

647
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:44,449
where the body was kept frozen,

648
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:48,358
and why he killed the mill owner
and burned the CCTV server.

649
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:50,728
If the police keep digging,

650
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,288
eventually...

651
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:56,058
it'll lead to you.

652
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,739
What's the conclusion?
What do you want to do?

653
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:08,478
Jeong Yoon Ho.

654
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:12,478
He's too much of a risk.

655
00:42:14,418 --> 00:42:15,549
Then what?

656
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:18,549
Do you really want to kill him?

657
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,289
Park Tae Jin.

658
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:28,628
Do you have a better idea?

659
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:32,599
I'm getting tired, to be honest.

660
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:35,938
We'd barely make it
even if we worked as a team,

661
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:38,938
but you lot keep messing up.

662
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:42,208
If something goes wrong,
you ask me to clean up after you.

663
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:45,349
Guys. What more can I do for you?

664
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,319
Hey. That's not right.

665
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,748
What did we come this far for?

666
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,259
It was so we'd all do well.

667
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:56,259
- But Yoon Ho...
- Hey.

668
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,358
You have no excuses.

669
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:01,799
Why did you kill Lee Myung Guk?

670
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:05,998
- Hey, that was...
- Don't use Jeong Yoon Ho as an excuse.

671
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:08,398
Did you ever consult with us...

672
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:10,038
that you were being threatened
by Lee Myung Guk?

673
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:12,469
You just make trouble first
without thinking,

674
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:13,639
and now what?

675
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:15,708
Are you asking us to understand
since you did it for a friend?

676
00:43:16,238 --> 00:43:17,349
Oh Chi Hyun.

677
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,978
How many times is this already?

678
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:24,949
Did you perhaps...

679
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,588
use this chance
to do something to Lee Myung Guk...

680
00:43:26,588 --> 00:43:28,358
because you had something rotten
to cover up?

681
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:30,489
What? "Something rotten?"

682
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:31,688
I mean,

683
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:34,429
who knows if you smuggled
Jong Soo's pills?

684
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,668
Hey, what are you doing?

685
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:39,599
Say that again. What?

686
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,668
Hey, Oh Chi Hyun!

687
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,438
If we dawdle, we're all done for.

688
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,338
If the police find him before we do,
we're all done for!

689
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,008
- Jong Soo.
- Jong Soo, this isn't right.

690
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,478
What's not right?

691
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,449
If we keep doing this,
we're all done for!

692
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,679
Won Jong Soo.

693
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,519
Let's think about this a little more.

694
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:04,989
- Jong Soo!
- "Jong Soo!" Give it a rest!

695
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:06,998
What do you want me to do?

696
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:10,569
You always bring me one choice
and ask me to choose.

697
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:13,599
Hey, if you come up with the answers
and ask me to decide,

698
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,199
isn't that an order?

699
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,438
That's always your problem.

700
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,378
Just hang on a little longer.

701
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,579
See what the police are up to.

702
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,849
If we really get backed into a corner,

703
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,518
let's decide then.

704
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:39,958
Darn it.

705
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,549
(You have one new voicemail.
Press the Call button to listen.)

706
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,696
(Dialing, Restricted number)

707
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:21,226
The police are pretty sure...

708
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:24,696
he's guilty of murdering
Lee Myung Guk and the mill owner.

709
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:27,536
Why he killed Lee Myung Guk,

710
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:30,036
where the body was kept frozen,

711
00:45:30,306 --> 00:45:33,946
and why he killed the mill owner
and burned the CCTV server.

712
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:36,076
If the police keep digging,

713
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:37,616
eventually...

714
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,016
it'll lead to you.

715
00:45:39,346 --> 00:45:40,523
Jeong Yoon Ho.

716
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:42,247
He's too much of a risk.

717
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:45,156
Do you have a better idea?

718
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:49,127
(You have a new message.
Would you like to check?)

719
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,727
The proof that
Park Tae Jin killed Jun Seo...

720
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:57,067
is with that woman
who lives at Jun Seo's place.

721
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:04,707
Yes, this is Oh Soo Hyun.

722
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:07,047
Is that so? Which direction is it?

723
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:09,446
Past Namho-dong, towards the new town?

724
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:12,147
We just got a ping from
Jeong Yoon Ho's phone again.

725
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,186
He's moving past Namho-dong
and headed towards the new town.

726
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:15,286
Let's hurry.

727
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:46,647
Hello?

728
00:46:47,487 --> 00:46:48,587
It's me.

729
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:50,986
Hey, Jeong Yoon Ho.
Where are you right now?

730
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:53,457
Were you there too
when Park Tae Jin suggested killing me?

731
00:46:53,657 --> 00:46:54,657
What?

732
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:55,757
You were there too, right?

733
00:46:56,127 --> 00:46:58,797
Don't act dumb, you punk.
It sounded like he was talking to you.

734
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:01,567
How do you know about that?

735
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:02,997
Was Jong Soo there too?

736
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:05,167
No.

737
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:08,167
Jong Soo would've fallen
for Park Tae Jin again.

738
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:09,736
Hey, Yoon Ho.

739
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,676
Darn it. You traitors.

740
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:13,277
Hey, are you really my friend?

741
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:16,747
Are you really my friend?
It was all Park Tae Jin!

742
00:47:16,777 --> 00:47:17,777
What?

743
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:20,417
Park Tae Jin planned everything,
you dumb punks!

744
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:22,746
I caught Park Tae Jin getting together...

745
00:47:22,746 --> 00:47:24,257
with Jun Seo's wife. So, that's...

746
00:47:24,257 --> 00:47:26,187
That's why he's trying to kill me.
Do you even know?

747
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:28,486
Gosh, you utter fools.

748
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,157
You were played by Park Tae Jin
your whole life,

749
00:47:30,157 --> 00:47:31,997
but you don't even know a thing, do you?

750
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:34,527
Hey, Yoon Ho. First of all, calm down.

751
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:35,866
Where are you right now?
Tell me that first.

752
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:37,067
I'll be right there.

753
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:39,266
Why? So you can come and kill me?

754
00:47:39,596 --> 00:47:42,167
Forget it, punk. Crazy jerk.

755
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,007
Yoon Ho.

756
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:45,277
I'm going to reveal everything.

757
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,507
Okay?

758
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:49,377
The fact that Park Tae Jin
killed our Jun Seo...

759
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:50,947
I'll reveal all of it,

760
00:47:50,947 --> 00:47:52,516
even if I have to kill
that wench to do so.

761
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:53,616
Hey, Yoon Ho.

762
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,486
- Jeong Yoon Ho.
- Hey, Oh Chi Hyun.

763
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:57,957
Please deliver this message
to Mr. Park Tae Jin.

764
00:47:58,487 --> 00:47:59,917
I won't go down easily this time.

765
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,257
We'll all die together.

766
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:06,056
Or we'll all live together. Got it?

767
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,366
Jeong Yoon Ho!

768
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,366
Why do you keep calling my name?

769
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:28,187
Yes.

770
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:30,857
The signal stopped
near Oeseong-dong just now.

771
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:33,016
I've just sent you
the exact location via text.

772
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:38,297
Oeseong-dong.

773
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:43,297
Nain Apartment in Oeseong-dong. Hurry!

774
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:02,147
What?

775
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,886
What brings you by at this hour?

776
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,486
Hey, Ji Yeon.

777
00:49:08,886 --> 00:49:12,397
I have something to say to you
about Jun Seo.

778
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,596
One moment.

779
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:20,507
(Detective Jang Jae Gyeong)

780
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:23,636
Hello.

781
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:27,977
Hello.

782
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:33,647
My gosh. Let's go.

783
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,326
What did you want to tell me
about Jun Seo?

784
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:00,576
Do you miss Jun Seo?

785
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:03,917
Pardon?

786
00:50:06,677 --> 00:50:08,817
I miss Jun Seo.

787
00:50:10,147 --> 00:50:12,317
I married Si Jung.

788
00:50:13,587 --> 00:50:15,727
And Si Jung had a baby.

789
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,326
Our Young Eun.

790
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:22,766
But I hadn't found a job.

791
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:24,497
Then,

792
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:28,136
Jun Seo talked to Jong Soo,

793
00:50:28,136 --> 00:50:31,636
and he got me a job
at one of Keumhyung's subcontractors.

794
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:38,216
But the CEO there...

795
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,846
was talking smack about Jong Soo one day.

796
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:44,486
I kept listening...

797
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:47,757
but couldn't stand it anymore.

798
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:51,726
I had had a few drinks,
and I hit him in anger.

799
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:52,826
But...

800
00:50:54,266 --> 00:50:55,596
that man died.

801
00:50:58,697 --> 00:50:59,797
What...

802
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:09,707
It's late tonight. If you come back...

803
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:11,477
Then, I got out of jail.

804
00:51:11,846 --> 00:51:15,417
It felt as though the guys
were keeping their distance from me.

805
00:51:16,547 --> 00:51:18,786
Even then, Jun Seo looked out for me.

806
00:51:18,786 --> 00:51:20,317
He found me a job at the taxi company.

807
00:51:22,087 --> 00:51:23,286
Looking back,

808
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:25,957
Jun Seo was different from the other guys.

809
00:51:29,596 --> 00:51:30,696
I think...

810
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:33,596
he was a good friend...

811
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:36,136
to me.

812
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,007
Oh, I see.

813
00:51:39,436 --> 00:51:42,747
So... I understand what you mean,

814
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:44,877
but you should get going...

815
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:46,216
So why did you do it?

816
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:49,547
Why would you leave
a nice guy like Jun Seo...

817
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:52,156
and do that with Tae Jin?

818
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:02,127
You killed Jun Seo with Tae Jin,
didn't you?

819
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,636
No.

820
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:08,306
I know you did.

821
00:52:09,136 --> 00:52:11,406
I heard the evidence that shows
you killed Jun Seo with Tae Jin...

822
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,536
is here.

823
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:15,247
Where is it?

824
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:19,917
What do you mean?

825
00:52:23,147 --> 00:52:24,987
Tae Jin is trying
to put all the blame on me...

826
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,857
and is planning to kill me.

827
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:27,986
Ji Yeon.

828
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:31,257
I can't just sit and watch.

829
00:52:35,897 --> 00:52:37,027
Hand it over.

830
00:52:57,858 --> 00:52:59,518
- I'll take the stairs.
- Okay.

831
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:19,648
Choi Ji Yeon.

832
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:21,519
Choi Ji Yeon!

833
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:25,849
Thank you for your time.

834
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:42,869
- What is it at this hour?
- Park Tae Jin.

835
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:45,168
- You know Jun Seo's passcode, right?
- What?

836
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:47,208
Hurry up and tell me.
Ji Yeon is in danger.

837
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:48,708
What's the door's passcode?

838
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:51,278
It's 9-1-9-1.

839
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,918
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

840
00:54:00,588 --> 00:54:01,719
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

841
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,688
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon.

842
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:10,099
She's still breathing.
Call an ambulance right away!

843
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:13,968
I'm calling from Oeseong-dong's
Nain Apartment, Unit 503.

844
00:54:13,968 --> 00:54:15,499
There's a patient here. Please hurry.

845
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:32,818
Jeong Yoon Ho escaped
via the emergency stairs.

846
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:34,188
Request support
from the nearby patrol unit.

847
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:47,458
I don't need it. I can do this.

848
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:18,858
Captain, do you remember the guy
who had drugs on him...

849
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:20,629
out of the men we arrested yesterday?

850
00:56:20,629 --> 00:56:22,298
- Lee Jung Hoon.
- What about him?

851
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:25,599
He says he bought his drugs
from a guy named Kim Dae Sung,

852
00:56:25,729 --> 00:56:27,099
and Kim Dae Sung...

853
00:56:27,269 --> 00:56:30,099
is already under examination
by the Narcotics Unit.

854
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:33,209
So I wonder if we should ask them
to cooperate with us...

855
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:34,309
Hey.

856
00:56:36,408 --> 00:56:38,208
- Go and get this guy.
- Pardon?

857
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,219
The Narcotics Unit always steals
our cases.

858
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,278
We can't just sit and watch.

859
00:56:43,678 --> 00:56:46,119
Let's dig into this guy, Kim Dae Sung.

860
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:48,659
We'll find all the connections from him
from the ground up. Got it?

861
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:57,128
Take your grills out.

862
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:01,168
Take them out.
Chew with your real teeth.

863
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:05,708
What a joke.

864
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:11,909
Here. Have this too.

865
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:13,749
Enjoy your meal.

866
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:15,479
Eat slowly.

867
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:17,079
- Thank you.
- Sure.

868
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,548
By the way,

869
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,289
that captain of the Narcotics Unit...

870
00:57:24,459 --> 00:57:26,159
is really something.

871
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,059
Who? Jang Jae Gyeong?

872
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:31,028
Yes...

873
00:57:31,169 --> 00:57:34,028
Can't you read the room?

874
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:36,369
Keep your mouth shut and eat.

875
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:38,039
Punk.

876
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:41,039
What is it? Tell me?

877
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:43,979
What's so great about him?

878
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:48,079
That thing is really strong,

879
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:52,889
so it's not easy for an ordinary person
to stay sober with that drug.

880
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:55,588
And?

881
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,219
Drug?

882
00:57:57,758 --> 00:57:58,958
What drug?

883
00:58:00,428 --> 00:58:01,898
The day I was arrested,

884
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:04,129
Geun Ho drugged that detective...

885
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:06,429
with the new drug, Lemon Mulberry.

886
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:10,199
Geun Ho did it to check
if he was a detective or not.

887
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:12,869
He took in the full dose.

888
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:16,979
If you're not a druggie
and it's your first time,

889
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:19,449
most people faint.

890
00:58:19,649 --> 00:58:22,949
But he threw me on the floor right away.

891
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:24,488
I totally respect him for that.

892
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:30,659
Hey, tell us more.

893
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:36,829
(Ambulance)

894
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:45,338
Are you getting a signal?

895
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:47,469
I think the phone is turned off.

896
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:50,208
We're searching the area
with the patrol unit.

897
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:53,008
Why did Jeong Yoon Ho come here?

898
00:58:54,048 --> 00:58:56,918
Is there a reason for him
to kill Park Jun Seo's wife?

899
00:58:57,818 --> 00:58:59,219
Do you have a hunch?

900
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:02,619
I also can't understand it.
The scene looked strange too.

901
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:06,159
He turned the place upside down
as if he was searching for something.

902
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:09,229
Also, if he really had wanted to kill her,

903
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:12,099
he could've done it in a flash
like the mill owner.

904
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:14,738
Aside from her head wound,
we didn't find anything else.

905
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:17,139
All the knives were untouched too.

906
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:21,608
Maybe he heard the siren...

907
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,639
and couldn't finish her off
before fleeing.

908
00:59:24,649 --> 00:59:26,679
Maybe he staged it
like a robbery on purpose.

909
00:59:27,508 --> 00:59:29,818
Which hospital is that ambulance heading?

910
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,519
To Anhyun University Hospital. Why?

911
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,458
I will drop by the hospital...

912
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:38,329
and check on the victim
before I head back.

913
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:41,599
Let me know if you find
Jeong Yoon Ho's whereabouts.

914
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:42,929
I will.

915
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:46,628
Captain. Do you want a ride?

916
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:47,999
I'm okay.

917
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:51,469
Ms. Oh!

918
00:59:52,568 --> 00:59:54,479
- Hello.
- Why are you so busy these days?

919
00:59:54,479 --> 00:59:55,938
You're never home.

920
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,008
I have a lot of work these days.

921
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,608
- Is everything well?
- Of course.

922
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:02,679
Here.

923
01:00:03,419 --> 01:00:05,988
- What is this?
- You left your coat with me, remember?

924
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:07,789
The black one.

925
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:09,488
This was in the inner pocket.

926
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:11,700
(From Anhyun University Hospital,
Park Eun Young, To Park Jun Seo)

927
01:00:14,795 --> 01:00:17,362
(From Anhyun University Hospital,
Park Eun Young, To Park Jun Seo)

928
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,579
- Sorry for the long wait.
- Not at all.

929
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:39,412
(Dear Ma'am and Sir,)

930
01:00:41,282 --> 01:00:42,382
Thank you.

931
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:08,722
Ms. Choi Ji Yeon's guardian?

932
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:12,192
Yes?

933
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:13,352
(Emergency Medical Center)

934
01:01:13,352 --> 01:01:15,321
We ran through all emergency tests...

935
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:17,122
and aside from her head contusion,

936
01:01:17,122 --> 01:01:19,332
she has a light concussion.

937
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,091
It's not life-threatening, is it?

938
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:24,701
No. But we'll run a few other tests
just in case.

939
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:27,031
We have an empty room,
so we'll move her there.

940
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:29,378
It'd be best to keep her here
until tomorrow.

941
01:01:29,402 --> 01:01:30,502
I understand.

942
01:01:31,141 --> 01:01:34,472
You look pale. Are you all right?

943
01:01:34,812 --> 01:01:36,211
Your eyes are red.

944
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,542
I'm fine.

945
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:39,312
I'm just tired.

946
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:41,482
I see.

947
01:01:58,272 --> 01:01:59,372
How is she doing?

948
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,202
Is it life-threatening?

949
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:05,912
Did you put him up to it?

950
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:08,412
Did you order him to kill Choi Ji Yeon?

951
01:02:08,482 --> 01:02:09,582
Are you out of your mind?

952
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:14,511
What is it that you want?

953
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:16,852
How far do you have to go?

954
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:20,091
Which one of us do you need dead
for you to be happy?

955
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:21,522
What?

956
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:26,591
Did you sell drugs with Jun Seo?

957
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:32,431
You made Lee Myung Guk make drugs
in Youngryun Cold Storage.

958
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:34,332
But when he stopped listening,
you killed him,

959
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:35,642
and then you killed Park Jun Seo.

960
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,611
You ordered Jeong Yoon Ho
to kill the owner of the mill.

961
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:39,841
But that wasn't enough.

962
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:42,982
Now you're trying to kill the woman
you're having an affair with.

963
01:02:44,082 --> 01:02:45,651
Do you call yourself human?

964
01:02:45,812 --> 01:02:47,781
What nonsense are you spewing?

965
01:02:48,022 --> 01:02:49,122
Why?

966
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:53,352
Why me? Why did you drag me into it?

967
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:54,792
What?

968
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:55,961
What are you trying to get from it?

969
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,821
You punk!

970
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:00,732
Darn it.

971
01:03:03,502 --> 01:03:04,602
How dare you hit me?

972
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:07,901
What's wrong with you?

973
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,171
Are you on something?

974
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:12,241
Why would I kill Choi Ji Yeon?

975
01:03:13,442 --> 01:03:15,741
Why would I kill Lee Myung Guk
or Park Jun Seo?

976
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:17,082
For what?

977
01:03:17,852 --> 01:03:20,611
Hey. Stop deluding yourself.

978
01:03:20,852 --> 01:03:22,722
Do you think I had an affair with her...

979
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:24,622
because of the password?

980
01:03:25,622 --> 01:03:27,622
She doesn't even have a clue!

981
01:03:29,591 --> 01:03:30,691
Hey.

982
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:31,832
Hey.

983
01:03:33,031 --> 01:03:34,191
Look at me straight in the eyes.

984
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:36,801
You accuse me of distributing drugs.

985
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:38,801
Do you have any proof?

986
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:43,401
Can you back anything you said?

987
01:03:44,841 --> 01:03:45,941
Darn you.

988
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:48,511
You don't know anything.

989
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:52,281
If you dare touch me again,

990
01:03:52,652 --> 01:03:54,651
I'll make sure the police let you go.

991
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:56,381
Try me again if you dare.

992
01:03:57,221 --> 01:03:58,722
You're no game for me.

993
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,832
You almost choked me to death,
remember?

994
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:09,702
You only care about yourself, don't you?

995
01:04:13,002 --> 01:04:15,142
Jang Jae Gyeong, are you all right?

996
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:32,192
(Connection)

997
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:34,221
He must have caused trouble.

998
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:35,321
Exactly.

999
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:38,192
(Jang Jae Gyeong,
forced to transfer schools)

1000
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:42,502
(Science Lab 2)

1001
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:45,972
Jang Jae Gyeong kept his back on us,
so I had him get transferred.

1002
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:48,872
What about Jun Seo?

1003
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:51,441
What should we do with him?

1004
01:04:52,341 --> 01:04:53,542
But Jun Seo chose...

1005
01:04:55,482 --> 01:04:56,582
our side.

1006
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:57,741
Hey.

1007
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:00,812
If my father hadn't threatened his dad...

1008
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,921
to turn Jun Seo's mind around,

1009
01:05:03,382 --> 01:05:05,252
would he have chosen us?

1010
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,432
I doubt it.

1011
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:14,531
He should've never hung out
with Jae Gyeong, Yoon Jin, and Joo Song.

1012
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:16,832
It was his fault. Don't you agree?

1013
01:05:16,832 --> 01:05:18,772
Jae Gyeong must know what happened...

1014
01:05:19,502 --> 01:05:21,301
at Kyung Tae's house...

1015
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:24,202
because Jun Seo told him.

1016
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:27,111
Jun Seo is the root cause of this problem.

1017
01:05:27,212 --> 01:05:28,312
Still...

1018
01:05:29,011 --> 01:05:32,312
- He's the class president.
- Enough with the class president!

1019
01:05:32,882 --> 01:05:36,051
The class president was the one
who ruined everything, Yoon Ho!

1020
01:05:36,681 --> 01:05:38,691
I think we should still accept him
as our friend.

1021
01:05:39,622 --> 01:05:41,421
I think he regrets it.

1022
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:43,191
Let's do that, Jong Soo.

1023
01:05:46,761 --> 01:05:48,332
What do you think, Tae Jin?

1024
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:51,502
Let's wrap it up
with having Jae Gyeong transfer.

1025
01:05:52,071 --> 01:05:53,472
There's no reason to blow this up.

1026
01:05:54,272 --> 01:05:55,372
He's right.

1027
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:56,602
Let's do that.

1028
01:06:01,741 --> 01:06:02,841
Fine.

1029
01:06:04,312 --> 01:06:06,011
We'll let Jun Seo back in the group.

1030
01:06:08,152 --> 01:06:09,352
Is that enough?

1031
01:06:13,192 --> 01:06:14,622
Jun Seo and Yoon Jin...

1032
01:06:16,321 --> 01:06:17,491
They're still dating.

1033
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:19,232
Then what can we do?

1034
01:06:21,931 --> 01:06:24,102
We'll have to make him end it on his own.

1035
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:29,702
Come to Audiophile's club room right now.

1036
01:06:30,172 --> 01:06:31,972
I have to tell you something
about Jun Seo.

1037
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:42,952
Hey, Park Jun Seo!

1038
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:47,892
What are you doing?

1039
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:49,297
Leave.

1040
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:51,091
- Jun Seo.
- I said, leave.

1041
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:52,461
Go!

1042
01:06:52,962 --> 01:06:55,662
Go! I said, go!

1043
01:06:57,332 --> 01:06:58,972
Don't ever call my name...

1044
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:04,241
or talk to me.

1045
01:07:05,942 --> 01:07:07,042
Jun Seo.

1046
01:07:10,212 --> 01:07:11,412
Hey! Park Jun Seo!

(Connection)

1049
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:14,248
I want my share
of what we earned up to now.

1050
01:08:14,272 --> 01:08:15,281
Park Jun Seo.

1051
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:16,781
I'm telling you we should stop!

1052
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:19,482
Is it true? Did you fool around
with Jun Seo's wife?

1053
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:21,325
Did you really kill Park Jun Seo?

1054
01:08:22,951 --> 01:08:25,091
I'm Park Tae Jin. I'm the Doctor.

1055
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:27,591
You're sticking right beside Jae Gyeong
and telling him everything.

1056
01:08:27,622 --> 01:08:28,722
It's not me.

1057
01:08:29,062 --> 01:08:30,162
Don't lie.

1058
01:08:30,562 --> 01:08:32,491
You were a drug dealer.

1059
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:35,002
How can you plan and construct
the future of Keumhyung Group?

1060

Chairman.

1061
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:37,201
It sounds like a job for you to wrap up.

1065
01:08:41,402 --> 01:08:42,502
Wake up.

1066
01:08:42,502 --> 01:08:43,671
Drug...

1067
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:48,381
What have I done to you
for you to drug me?

1068
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:50,441
Stop smiling and answer me!
