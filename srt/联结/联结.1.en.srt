Drug-related crimes are on the rise,

4
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,451
and the government declares
a war against drugs.

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,891
Grand-scale crackdowns have been
in the works since last year,

6
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,662
but drug activity has only been spreading
from Seoul and its surroundings.

7
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,061
This morning in Anhyun,

8
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:27,201
a woman in her 30s was found driving
after using drugs...

9
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,631
and was arrested.

10
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,432
These are the drugs confiscated
within Anhyun in the last month.

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,901
It's worth 20 million dollars,

12
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:35,741
and the amount is enough
for 20,000 people to use at once.

13
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:38,311
Anhyun is the first
out of local self-governments...

14
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,512
claiming to advocate a drug-free city.

15
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,781
They held a ceremony
to declare a war against drugs.

16
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,421
We'll eradicate all drug organizations
in Anhyun...

17
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,991
so they never set foot in our city again.

18
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:58,332
There they are!

19
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,472

20
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,701
We're from the police!

21
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,741
Don't move.

22
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:10,772
Stop right there.

23
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,612
Hey, arrest every one of them.

- How about a song?

25
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,321
At Anhyun Nightclub, we apprehended...

26
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,791
the Five Spider Gang's dealer.

27
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,261
Next, we'll go after the treasurer.

28
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,041

29

Run!

Darn it.

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,302
They got shut down.

33
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,062

- Let go of me!

Darn it.

188
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,150
Gosh, I give up.

189
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,061
I give up. You won.

190
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,561
Darn it.

191
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,260
Look, my hands are empty.

192
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,630
You can't hit me, all right?

193
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,030
Okay?

194
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,601
Hey.

195
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,841
Take me in.

196
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,170
I'm cold, okay?

197
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,910
Out of the way!

198
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,481
Myung Ho.

199
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Don't do it.

200
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,821
Jang Chul Gu. Don't do it.

201
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:51,861
Myung Ho!

202
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,930
Myung Ho!

203
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,471
(1 month later)

204
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:41,170
Please state your department and rank.

205
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,441
Anhyun Police Station, Criminal Affairs
Division Two, Narcotics Unit.

206
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,750
Lieutenant Jang Jae Kyung.

207
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,221
This investigation is to hear
from the officer involved...

208
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,790
in the possible misuse of firearms
on the night of January 22, 2024,

209
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,020
when apprehending Jang Chul Gu,
who was wanted...

210
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,520
as the head of the Five Spider Gang,

211
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,491
a drug cartel active in
southern Gyeonggi Province,

212
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:00,930
on the rooftop of Sujeong Motel
in downtown Anhyun.

213
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,430
Please describe the situation
on the rooftop at the time.

214
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,371
In the report by your partner,
Sergeant Kim Chang Soo,

215
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:10,241
he stated that he heard gunshots
before he arrived at the scene.

216
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:13,371
So, the only statement regarding
what happened on the rooftop...

217
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,170
is from you, Lieutenant Jang.

218
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,241
But Mr. Jang Chul Gu,
the man who was shot, says otherwise.

219
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:20,150
I stand by what I said
in the statement I submitted beforehand...

220
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,650
and what is stated in the analysis report.

221
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,321
Jang Chul Gu was shot
in the left Achilles tendon.

222
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,750
The analysis report states that
he was shot from quite a close distance.

223
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Is that correct?

224
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Yes.

225
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:34,861
I will get straight to the point.

226
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,160
Approximately one month prior
to Jang Chul Gu's arrest,

227
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,430
on December 11 of last year,

228
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,871
Sergeant An Myung Ho's Achilles tendon
was severely injured...

229
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,471
while trying to apprehend the suspect,
ending up with a severed Achilles tendon.

230
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,241
I heard you were quite fond of him
as a junior officer.

231
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,241
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

232
00:14:50,241 --> 00:14:51,410
Was it perhaps something like that?

233
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,250
Take me in.

234
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,331
Act on the Performance of Duties
by Police Officers, Article 10-2.

235
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:16,400
To arrest an offender in action
or one who commits a crime punishable...

236
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,170
by imprisonment with or without labor
for a maximum of at least three years,

237
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,441
a police officer may use a firearm.

238
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,140
I shot two blanks as per regulations,

239
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,851
and in a situation where the offender was
charging with a weapon in hand,

240
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:28,111
I shot one round of live ammunition
to the lower extremities.

241
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:30,721
I did not aim
for any particular body part,

242
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,050
and I was in no situation to do so.

243
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,821
That is all.

244
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,530

(Special Promotion Ceremony
of Inspector Jang Jae Kyung)

247
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:53,341
Good work, sir.

248
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,510
(Certificate of Appointment)

249
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,750
- Hey.
- Jang Jae Kyung.

250
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,880
Inspector, congratulations
on your special promotion.

251
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,491
- Congratulations.
- It's all thanks to you.

252
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:07,790
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

253
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:11,520
Looking good.

254
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,231
I got some good rest, sir.

255
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,630
I'm starting physical therapy next week.

256
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:17,101
I'm glad to hear it.

257
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,371
Taking too long of a break
will become a habit.

258
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:22,231
Congratulations
on your special promotion, sir.

259
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,640
Thank you.

260
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Also,

261
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,341
thank you.

262
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,241
See you back at work soon.

263
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:35,680
(Oh Soo Hyun, Kim Chang Soo)

264
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,081
Gosh, these guys.

265
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,050
You're making me feel all ticklish
on the inside on such a nice day.

266
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,020
How much did you get as a special bonus?

267
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,591
It's enough to buy us some beef, right?

268
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,130
I haven't checked,
but it should be enough, right?

269
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,290
How nice.

270
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,361
You should at least buy him some beef
as you say something like that...

271
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,971
for our dear Myung Ho to feel like,

272
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,231
"I should really get back to work soon."

273
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:57,270
You only like to sound cool. Ridiculous.

274
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,471
I know this place...

275
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:02,380
that slaughters a whole cow
with a single phone call.

276
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,441
Shall I call them now?

277
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,380
Sounds good. Let's go, then.

278
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,351
- Chief! Here comes the chief.
- Hey.

279
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,021
Congratulations, Inspector Jang.

280
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,490
Thank you for coming
when you must be busy.

281
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,890
Gosh, don't say that.

282
00:17:14,021 --> 00:17:15,220
Jang Jae Kyung is
getting a special promotion.

283
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,291
Of course, I should come.

284
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,791
Gosh, of course.

285
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,630
If it hadn't been
for Inspector Jang Jae Kyung,

286
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,331
what reason would
the Police Commissioner have...

287
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,160
for patting our chief on the shoulders?

288
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,601
Where was it? Right here?

289
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,400
- Here?
- Hey, don't touch.

290
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,440
How dare you try to dirty up
the spot the Commissioner touched?

291
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,670
Well, why not just have
your uniform preserved...

292
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,940
and hang it up somewhere?

293
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,841
That's enough joking around.

294
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:39,751
Anyway, our Narcotics Unit is
the pride of Anhyun Station.

295
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:41,511
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir.

296
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,880
I'll put together a nice dinner
sometime soon.

297
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:46,321
Let's feast on some meat!

298
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,960
- Why don't we take a picture?
- Yes, let's do that.

299
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Hey, Yoo Kyung Hwan!

300
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,591
Come and take a picture for us.

301
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:55,390
- Hey, Inspector Yoo.
- Yes, Chief.

302
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,430
Please.

303
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,071
Here. Come this way.

304
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:00,601
I'm an inspector now too.

305
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,470
You can speak casually now.

306
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,571
On the count of three,

307
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,640
how about
"Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung?"

308
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:07,841
- Nice.
- All right.

309
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,041
One, two, three.

310
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,910
- Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung!
- Go, Inspector Jang Jae Kyung!

311
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,251
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

Stop by Myung Ho's house.

316

in person earlier?

Congratulations on the special promotion.

328
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,551
I saw it in the papers.

329
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:09,150
You started as a constable
and made it all the way to an inspector.

330
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:11,361
I hear that's not an easy feat.

331

to see you...

335
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:23,301
before it was too late.

336
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,970

I don't understand how you can be
even more late than that.

340
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,730
If it's about that again, please leave.

341
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Yes, you're right.

all these years.

345
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,371
I should've listened to you then.

346
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,081
Things would be different...

347
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,541
between us if I had.

348
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:09,720
I'm sorry, Jae Kyung.

349
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,450
Back then,

350
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,791
I was foolish.

351
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,091
I was a coward too.

352
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,130
So if it's not too late...

353
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,101
You're right.

354
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:25,361
You were foolish and cowardly.

355
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:27,531
On top of that,
you were blinded by greed.

356
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:29,101
- Jae Kyung.
- I understand.

357
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,200
I saw countless people like you
while working in this field.

358
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,210
Foolish, cowardly, and greedy.

359
00:22:35,341 --> 00:22:37,210
- Jae Kyung...
- But they all served their time.

360
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,410
What about you?

361
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,450
Aren't you still hanging around

What's the matter?

364
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,051
Does it still bother you?

365
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:01,630
If you're asking for forgiveness
so that you can get peace of mind,

366
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm afraid I can't forgive you.

367
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,511
Consider it your sentence.

368
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,430
I know I'm late.

369
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
However,

370
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:33,101
I'm going to keep trying.

371
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:36,101
I came to tell you that.

372
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,740
I'll put everything back in order.

373
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,710
I'll get going.

374
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,331
Are you Jang Jae Kyung?

375
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,930
Yes.

376
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:08,071
Is everything
on your police report true?

377
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,140
Did you witness it yourself?

378
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,801
(Jang Jae Kyung)

379
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,170
(Park Jun Seo)

380
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:14,511
Jun Seo.

381
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,380
You saw it. You should tell him.

382
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,710
Your report says...

383
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:23,251
Park Jun Seo witnessed it on-site.

384
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,551
Did you really witness it?

385
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,561
That's not true.

386
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,660
I didn't witness anything.

387
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:37,531
- Jun Seo.
- I...

388
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:40,071
didn't see anything.

389
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Park Jun Seo.

390
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,200
Aren't we friends?
Why are you hiding it from me?

391
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,210
It's not true!

392
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,251
(I love Mom. I like Mom.
Mom is the best.)

393
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,730
Come on, I'm almost done.

394
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,071
Seriously...

395
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,501
(Kim Woo Sung)

396
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:20,410
They can't even prioritize the stories
in the right order.

397
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,111
They don't deserve their paychecks.

398
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:24,210
I'm almost done,

399
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,611
so tell them to keep their mouths shut
and stop badgering me.

400
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:28,351
They told you to return.

401
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:32,251
Why?

402
00:25:32,351 --> 00:25:34,220
I don't know the reason.
They just asked you to return.

403
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,190
Well...

404
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,430
They told me
they couldn't stand the sight of me...

405
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,630
and told me to assist
with editorial at home.

406
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:44,561
What's the reason?

407
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:47,670
Are they having trouble selling ads
now that I'm not around?

408
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,670
The director met with Doseong Chemicals
and the head of PR...

409
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,940
and sorted everything out.

410
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
He said you should return to your post.

411
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:01,511
I can't bear to hear all the flattery
from him.

412
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,950
Okay.

413
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,021
Let him know I'll be in soon.

414
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:11,761
Yes!

415
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,331
Yes.

416
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,390
Okay. Hold on.

417
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,331
I saw on the news
that it snowed a lot in Toronto.

418
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:22,271
I heard all the schools closed.

419
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,001
Did Ye Eun go to kindergarten?

420
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:25,470
What is she doing right now?

421
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,670
Is she sleeping already?

422
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,811
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,420
- Mom!
- Hi, Honey.

424
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,480
Come here.

425
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
Bye!

426
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,950
I'll get going.

427
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,021
Take care.

428
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,021
Bye!

429
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,220
Take care.

430
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,490
- Bye!
- Bye.

431
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,630
- Mom!
- Yes?

432
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,930
I'll be going now.

433
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,331
- Take care.
- Bye.

434
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,400
I got it. Please stop scolding me
about child support.

435
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:59,101
You didn't keep all the promises
you made when we divorced either.

436
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:03,680
Ye Eun looked like she lost weight
in the last photo you sent.

437
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,841
I know you're feeding her burgers...

438
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,751
and heated-up frozen pizza
because you're tight on time.

439
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,950
Keep that up and I'll...

440
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,650
Excuse me!

441
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,261
Darn it.

442
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,690
Hello?

443
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,230
Hello?

444
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,970
Excuse me.

445
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:31,400
Look.

446
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,341
My screen shattered thanks to you.
What are you going to do?

447
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:36,410
Are you serious?

448
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,541
Hey, lady.

449
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
What is that?

450
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Hey, lady...

451
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,801
Mom.

452
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,410
What?

453
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
Are you all right?

454
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,121
Hey!

455
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:43,710
Your phone's screen was damaged,

456
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,281
so you followed her with the aim...

457
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,210
of getting compensation.

458
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,821
Detective.

459
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Yes?

460
00:28:51,321 --> 00:28:52,521
Was that an illegal drug?

461
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,521
Is it a new type of drug?

462
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:58,091
Well...

463
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,460
We're still investigating.

464
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,190
I see.

465
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,831
It must be a new type...

466
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,801
if a narcotics detective
couldn't identify it right away.

467
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:11,771
It has to be a new kind.

468
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:14,940
It must be really strong.

469
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:17,940
She took it the moment she got it.

470
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Here.

471
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,160
Her name is Yoo Young Mi.

472
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:39,771
She's 36 years old and a homemaker.

473
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:42,571
She was out to greet her daughter
for a kindergarten drop-off...

474
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,970
when she got the drug delivered
and consumed it right away.

475
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,170
She ran after being witnessed...

476
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,910
and was hit by a delivery truck
where she died on the spot.

477
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Did you inquire about the drug components?

478
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,581
Soo Hyun just put in the request.

479
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
What is this now?

480
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,581
There's no end.

481
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:57,121
That woman looks familiar.

482
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:59,680
- Yes?
- Come out for a minute.

483
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,021
Captain,
doesn't that woman look familiar to you?

484
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,730
Where did I see her?

485
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,430
- Yes, Captain?
- Hey.

486
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
The witness is a reporter
for the Anhyun Economic Daily.

487
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,331
- Take caution.
- Right, pork head meat.

488
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:17,501
Don't answer everything she asks...

489
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,740
or she'll write a story
with your name on it.

490
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,140
Yes, sir. I'll be careful.

491
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,041
- Let's go to the site. We'll be back.
- Okay.

492
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,611
All right. Hey.

493
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,111
Don't forget our appointment later.

494
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Yes, sir.

495
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:31,220
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

496
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,791
Why are you so late?

497
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,890
Didn't I call you hours ago?

498
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,890
I have my reasons.

499
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,460
- Follow me.
- Okay.

500
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:43,831
(Anhyun Economic Daily)

501
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh Yoon Jin, are you out of your mind?

502
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,331
Do you know what time it is?

503
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:49,331
Hold on.

504
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,801
I already know what you want to say.

505
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,210
I promise to listen to your story...

506
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,041
about how you brought me back later.

507
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,410
For now,

508
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,251
please listen to what I have to say.

509
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:08,690
I think...

510
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,890
I was born to be a reporter.

511
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,021
Today...

512
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,160
I don't know how they knew
this was my first day back after a month,

513
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:20,400
but someone took drugs
right before my eyes and then died.

514
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,670
It's something new
that the police have no info on.

515
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:29,440
It's as if someone we can't see...

516
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,611
is feeding me an exclusive.

517
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,920
Gosh, this sound.

518
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,021
It sounds nothing like pork, right?

519
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:42,621
Let me pour you one.

520
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,190
Are you sure this was slaughtered today?

521
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:45,690
It doesn't taste good
on the day of slaughter.

522
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,990
It needs to rest a while.

523
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,291
You said it would be slaughtered today.

524
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:51,130
Why do you take every word at face value?

525
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:55,331
"Slaughtered today"
was a figure of speech.

526
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:57,670
Can you even investigate properly?

527
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,601
Do you investigate properly?

528
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,511
- Water for Myung Ho.
- Thanks.

529
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,210
Fill your glasses.

530
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,811
Let's toast.

531
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:10,751
Let's celebrate
Jae Kyung's promotion to inspector!

532
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:15,950
And wish Myung Ho a speedy return!

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

534
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,890
Down that, Myung Ho.

535
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,890
- Down your water.
- Bottoms up.

536
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,190
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

551
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:20,751
- You, punk.
- Round two.

552
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,321
Get back home early.

No, I missed him. Who was that woman?

644
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,888
I think she's a cash carrier.

645
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:15,118
She claims it was a part-time gig
to make 300 dollars...

646

in return for taking a backpack
and putting it in a public locker.

just called...

to say that they retrieved
the drugs that fell on the street.

for you to hurry back.

- Hi.

Yes.

00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:27,269
I reside in Building 102, Unit 315.

687
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:31,609
You know the person who died in
a car accident out front a few days ago?

688
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,948
I heard it was someone in my building.

689
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,218
Do you know which unit?

690
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:37,419

What, did the police tell you that?

692
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:42,089
Well, not the police, but...

693
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:44,859
The resident representative said so.

694
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:45,959
The resident representative?

695
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:48,698
My gosh, seriously?

696
00:48:49,198 --> 00:48:52,129
The resident rep doesn't have the right
to boss you around.

697
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:55,569
A resident rep isn't the president.
You know what I mean?

698
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:56,569
My goodness.

699
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:58,569
Here, you should drink this
while it's warm.

700
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,238
Goodness, you didn't have to.

701
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:06,379
So?

702
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:08,749
Come on, which unit?

703
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:10,519
I heard it was Unit 215.

704
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,118
It's the unit right below mine.

705
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,919
This is why they say...

706
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,629
you don't even know if a neighbor dies
in an apartment, right?

707
00:49:19,629 --> 00:49:20,629
That's right.

708
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:22,828
But...

709
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:25,899
do you know the family pretty well?

710
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:28,299
Goodness.

711
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:33,769
Just a moment.

712
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:37,408
Hey, Si Jung. It's been a while.

713
00:49:37,948 --> 00:49:40,109
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.

714
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:43,919
What?

715
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:48,019
Who died?

716
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,269
That man took your gun.

717
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:17,178
I have no signs of hallucinations.

718
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:20,589
It's nauseating, and I'm dizzy.

719
00:50:21,258 --> 00:50:22,288
My hands are shaking.

720
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:26,488
Is this an adverse reaction to the drug?

721
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,058
Who could it be?

722
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:32,399
Who did this to me?

723
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:39,709
Jang Chul Gu...

724
00:50:40,368 --> 00:50:41,479
Yes, it has to be Jang Chul Gu.

725
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:43,379
He's trying to avenge me.

726
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:46,408
Jae Kyung.

727
00:50:46,408 --> 00:50:47,408
"One, eight, eight, two."

728
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:51,718
"One, eight, eight, two."
What about Park Jun Seo?

729
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:08,169
(Jang Jae Kyung)

730
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:27,848
No one can find out for now.

731
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:30,959
Not yet. No one can find out...

732
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:59,218
- Where's Inspector Jang?
- He'll be here soon.

733
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,618
So why did you go to that place?

734
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:05,258
Captain Jang sent me
a text late last night.

735
00:52:05,258 --> 00:52:06,258
Here.

736
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:08,529
(Meet me at car exit 3-4 at 7:20 a.m.
at Anhyun City Hall Station.)

737
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:09,729
Who is this "Doctor?"

738
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:11,269
Captain Jang doesn't seem to know either.

739
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:12,629
What does "1882" mean?

740
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:14,229
I'm not sure about that either.

741
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,198
So what do you know?

742
00:52:21,678 --> 00:52:22,678
(Interrogation Room)

743
00:52:22,879 --> 00:52:24,008
- Inspector Jang.
- Here he is.

744
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:25,908
What's with your face?

745
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:27,709
What happened to your arm?

746
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,319
Did you find out anything else?

747
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:30,848
No, I've already informed you
of all the findings.

748
00:52:31,078 --> 00:52:32,988
But someone must have ordered
the bag to be placed in the locker.

749
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:34,189
We could come up
with a facial composite at least.

750
00:52:34,189 --> 00:52:36,258
We're waiting
for the forensic sketch artist to arrive.

751
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,089
Who is the informant?

752
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:43,158
What does "Doctor" mean,
and what is this "1882?"

753
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:44,769
I'm not sure yet.

754
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,769
I just texted you a phone number.

755
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:48,169
Look it up and let me know
when you find out who it is.

756
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,169
I will.

757
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,638
Also, Five Spider Gang's Jang Chul Gu.

758
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:51,908
Which hospital is he at?

759
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,269
He's on the third floor
of the Sunkwang General Hospital.

760
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,319
What should I do with this?

761
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:12,689
- Did you get all the fingerprints?
- I did.

762
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,359
Keep it for now.

763
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:16,499
I was shocked.

764
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:17,729
Why?

765
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:20,269
I've never seen a prosecutor move so fast
to conduct an autopsy.

766
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:22,868
So is it a problem
even when prosecutors work fast?

767
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:24,368
You know how it is.

768
00:53:26,138 --> 00:53:28,109
In most cases,
they send new prosecutors...

769
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:29,538
for the autopsy.

770
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,749
A deputy chief prosecutor ran over
as soon as we called.

771
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:34,249
I know the deputy chief prosecutor well.

772
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:35,819
Do you?

773
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,479
They're a good person
who is good at their job.

774
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:38,519
What?

775
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,288
- What is it?
- This phone isn't locked.

776
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:42,919
I can open it right away.

777
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:45,158
That's good.

778
00:53:46,288 --> 00:53:47,288
Hey.

779
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,029
Inspector Jang.

780
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:52,428
Congratulations on your special promotion.

781
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:55,468
We have the same ranking now, don't we?

782
00:53:57,138 --> 00:54:00,269
The inspection team dropped by, right?
Is everything sorted out?

783
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:02,979
(Park Jun Seo)

784
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,848
Yes.

785
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:11,149
What?

786
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:12,649
What is it?

787
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,218
(Jang Jae Kyung)

788
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:15,658
What is this? Pick it up.

789
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:18,888
- Park Jun Seo.
- Hello?

790
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,928
Where are you right now?

791
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:23,828
Park Jun Seo!

792
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:25,828
Jun Seo!

793
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:27,299
Captain Jang.

794
00:54:46,657 --> 00:54:48,758
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong and passed away.

795
00:54:49,427 --> 00:54:50,898
The estimated time of death...

796
00:54:50,898 --> 00:54:53,767
is between 11:30 p.m.
and 12:00 a.m. last Friday.

797
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:12,818
Hey.

798
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:27,128
Please take me
to Sunkwang General Hospital.

799
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,438
Sunkwang General Hospital...

800
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:35,677
No...

801
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:40,307
Our SOS. Do you remember it?

802
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:43,648
One, eight, eight, two.

803
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:48,818
Captain.

804
00:56:25,787 --> 00:56:26,787
No.

805
00:56:27,727 --> 00:56:29,727
They must not find
any narcotics in my blood.

806
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:35,267
Take care.

807
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,918
(Sunkwang General Hospital)

808
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:11,168
Did you eat?

809
00:57:11,168 --> 00:57:12,568
I did. Did you?

810
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:23,577
I'm here.

811
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:28,887
(Medical Area A)

812
00:57:45,537 --> 00:57:46,938
I'm sorry,
but patients aren't allowed in here.

813
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:49,637
Are you all right?

814
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:53,378
Excuse me, please open the door.

815
00:57:55,577 --> 00:57:57,218
Excuse me? Sir?

816
00:57:57,218 --> 00:57:58,287
Open the door.

817
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:00,718
Excuse me, please open the door.

818
00:58:01,657 --> 00:58:02,657
I must find it.

819
00:58:04,057 --> 00:58:05,188
I have to find my blood.

820
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:07,887
Hello?

821
00:58:12,128 --> 00:58:13,227
(Jang Jae Kyung, 36)

822
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,767
(Jang Jae Kyung, 36)

823
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:24,208
Excuse me.

824
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:28,148
Please open the door!

825
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:31,177
Gosh.

826
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:32,947
Please open this door.

827
00:58:35,088 --> 00:58:36,088
Hello?

828
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:39,588
- Is it locked?
- Yes.

829
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:41,188
Please open the door.

830
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,028
Tell them to hurry over.

831
00:58:44,697 --> 00:58:45,727
Excuse me!

832
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,367
Hello?

833
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:51,267
Please hurry up and open it.

834
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:55,037
Sir, please open this door.

835
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:59,577
If you don't open this door,
we'll call the police.

836
00:59:08,387 --> 00:59:09,758
(Don't try so hard. Take your pill,
and I'll see you soon. From Doctor)

837
00:59:11,787 --> 00:59:12,787
(Jang Jae Kyung)

838
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:14,188
You should be more careful from now on.

839
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:16,258
I must get through this.

840
00:59:16,628 --> 00:59:18,898
He fell from a construction site
in Pilo-dong and passed away.

841
00:59:19,398 --> 00:59:20,767
I came to tell you that.

842
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:23,697
I'll put everything back in order.

843
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:24,697
Sir?

844
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:25,708
I can do it.

845
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:28,537
We'll call the police.

846
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:30,977
Hello?

847
00:59:40,488 --> 00:59:41,488
Open the door!

848
00:59:41,718 --> 00:59:43,287
Here's the key.

849
01:00:04,878 --> 01:00:07,447
(Connection)

850
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:09,517
(March, 2005)

851
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:11,077
"Classroom. 1882"

852
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:12,188
(Jang Jae Kyung)

853
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,798
Hey, what is it? Why did you call me?

854
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:28,468
How did you get here so fast?

855
01:00:29,738 --> 01:00:30,938
It only took you three minutes.

856
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:33,838
Park Jun Seo.

857
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,137
I told you not to use 1882 all the time.

858
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:37,508
- Hey.
- You...

859
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:40,008
How are you so strong?

860
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:41,447
You're going to get it.

861
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:49,818
What are you listening to
when I'm right here?

862
01:00:51,057 --> 01:00:52,057
What did you say?

863
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:53,927
I said, what are you listening to?

864
01:00:55,758 --> 01:00:56,758
Do you want to listen to it too?

865
01:00:56,758 --> 01:00:57,758
No, thanks.

866
01:00:57,858 --> 01:00:59,227
It would make me cringe.

867
01:01:00,068 --> 01:01:02,338
We're getting a transfer student tomorrow.

868
01:01:03,338 --> 01:01:04,767
I don't care.

869
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,267
I went to the faculty office earlier...

870
01:01:07,738 --> 01:01:08,977
and saw her picture
on our teacher's desk.

871
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,677
She's from Seoul, and she's pretty.

872
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:16,218
You'd love anyone from Seoul.

873
01:02:50,977 --> 01:02:53,901
(Connection)

874
01:02:53,925 --> 01:02:55,666
Do all friends have to be helpful?

875
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:57,266
Is that what you think too?

876
01:02:57,795 --> 01:03:00,195
That detective looked like
he was addicted to drugs.

877
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:02,206
I'm not a drug addict.

878
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:03,866
I'm an inspector who catches them.

879
01:03:03,866 --> 01:03:05,275
Who abducted me...

880
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:06,275
and drugged me?

881
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:07,275
The postmortem examination
was already done.

882
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,005
He must be in the morgue
of Anhyun University Hospital.

883
01:03:09,005 --> 01:03:09,894
We need to conduct an autopsy.

884
01:03:10,005 --> 01:03:12,076
Several things are suspicious
about Jun Seo's death.

885
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:14,116
It's you, Jae Kyung. Long time no see.

886
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:17,045
The people Jun Seo talked to
before he died...

887
01:03:17,746 --> 01:03:18,755
Hey!

888
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:20,016
Those guys practically lived together...

889
01:03:20,016 --> 01:03:22,355
with Jun Seo for the last 20 years.

890
01:03:22,355 --> 01:03:24,886
I'm asking what you talked about
with Jun Seo the day before he died.

891
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:25,895
Just give it to me.

892
01:03:25,895 --> 01:03:27,255
I'm Park Jun Seo's friend.

893
01:03:27,255 --> 01:03:29,226
He left a will before he passed.

894
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,726
Get him!

895
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:33,766
I know you killed Park Jun Seo.

896
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:35,835
This is your last warning.

897
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:41,536
