anything on their dashboard cameras.

118
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,868
It would've been hard
to move the body alone,

119
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:03,392
so there must be a trace.

120
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:08,701
The killing, freezing,
and burying of the body...

121
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:11,177

would be someone else.

that made you suspect it was him?

142
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:05,652

as an exclusive on a murder?

143

- Instead of mentioning a source.
- No way.

150

151
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,782

that you didn't have enough.

00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:11,652
I think...

187
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:16,498
Chang Soo viewed the security footage
but didn't sign in either.

188
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,498
(CCTV Footage Access Ledger)

189
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,522
Why?

190
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:22,191
Does he know I'm addicted to drugs?

191
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,191
You told me to be here by 7:20 a.m.

192
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:29,802
My phone shows
I texted Chang Soo on Sunday night,

193
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,571
but I have no memory of that.

194
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,978
It's very possible
to access my phone with my print...

195
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,211
and fake a text.

196
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:40,481
What if someone used my phone
to text Chang Soo...

197
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,358
and had him come not to Jeonghoon...

198
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,087
where the delivery was scheduled...

199
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:46,831
but to Anhyun City Hall,
the station before?

200
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,621
Who was it?

201
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:53,097
Who on earth left me at car exit 3-4...

202
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,392
at Anhyun City Hall Station?

203
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:57,032
And why did they call Chang Soo?

204
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,731
Did he know everything...

205
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:01,562
before he came to wake me at 7:20 a.m.?

206
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:04,731
Also,

207
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,118
the only person I told that I'd found
a body at Lee Myung Guk's...

208
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,142
was Chang Soo.

209
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,611
Write down this address.

210
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:14,282
Inhyun-ro, Jangsoo-dong, Anhyun.

211
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:17,252
It's 63-38, 973.

212
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,052
Shortly after the call with Chang Soo...

213
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:22,052
the Molotov cocktails flew in.

214
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,622
It was the master bedroom too.

215
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,451
Right where I happened to be.

216
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,457
Captain.

217
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:53,728
- Hey.
- Do you need something?

218
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,752
No.

219
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,038
(Anhyeon Police Station)

220
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,582
(5:10 p.m., Monday, February 26, 2024)

221
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:16,018
(5:10 p.m., Monday, February 26, 2024)

222
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,441
(Medical Area A)

223
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,242
You still haven't found anything?

224
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,562
Why is it taking so long to see
if there was a medical accident...

225
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:35,142
at Woonjong Medical Center last year?

226
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:38,361
Yoon Jin.

227
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,032
Do you think that little of me?

228
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,908
What is it now?

229
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:44,447
You told me to be thick-faced...

230
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,748
and scared me into
finishing the investigation by today.

231
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,341
And today, you suddenly want me
to drop it to do something else.

232
00:16:49,512 --> 00:16:50,672
If you keep this up,

233
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,882
I'll burn out sooner than expected.

234
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,782
Who will you work with if I quit?

235
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,981
I'm sorry, okay?

236
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,621
What's going on?

237
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:02,221
Give me a reason I can understand.

238
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,292
This morning...

239
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,221
I met Seo Eun, the couple's daughter.

240
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,932
Let's do something else.

241
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,101
Of the medical accidents
at Woonjong Medical Center,

242
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:22,941
the most recent one was three years ago.

243
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,561
The patient is someone else.

244
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,241
Then the accident from last September.

245
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,441
Only we know about it?

246
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,392
Hello.

247
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,491
Hello.

248
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,932
- Who are you?
- Is this...

249
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,201
where Park Bok Rye lives?

250
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,312
That's my mother.

251
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,712
I see.

252
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,442
When she was being treated
at Woonjong Medical Center,

253
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:05,052
I heard there was an accident
with her medication.

254
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,121
Said who?

255
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,728
You don't need to know who told us.

256
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,198
We'd like to talk to you about it.

257
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,238
Could we go inside...

258
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:15,562
I don't know about that.

259
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:17,331
Go away.

260
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:20,708
Your mother might have passed,

261
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,002
but don't you feel wronged?

262
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:26,641
- Hey.
- Wait.

263
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,478
Can't you tell us about it?

264
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:31,472
If we run the story,
the hospital will compensate you...

265
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,611
Should we have bought some snacks?

266
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,512
Is he upset we came empty-handed?

267
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,252
Let's ring the doorbell again.

268
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,022
We should change tactics.

269
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:55,708
What?

270
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,178
Yoon Jin. What are you up to?

271
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,371
I'm working.

272
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,772
Speak fast. I'm busy.

273
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:02,317
Are you free at 5:30 p.m. today?

274
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,418
No.

275
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,012
Ji Yeon called at around lunchtime today.

276
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:09,557
Choi Ji Yeon?

277
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,151
She wanted to ask me something
and invited me to her place.

278
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,321
She told me to come at 5:30 p.m.

279
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,928
It would be weird
to visit her alone at that time.

280
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:19,522
The sun sets pretty early nowadays.

281
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,361
If she called you,
it'd be about the insurance.

282
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,762
Go on your own.

283
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,567
I asked if it was about the insurance
and she said no.

284
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,101
Still, you should go
and hear what she has to say.

285
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,248
This just means that
you don't seem that threatening enough...

286
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,202
to call you even when she's alone.

287
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,472
Just think of it as a compliment.

288
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,147
Okay.

289
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:39,171
Bye.

290
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,181
- Let's go.
- Okay.

291
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,022
Who did you get the pills from at first?

292
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,222
At first,

293
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,492
a friend's senior gave them to me.

294
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,331
What's this senior's name?

295
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,391
I don't know his name.
He just told me to call him Senior.

296
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,131
- And your friend?
- My friend?

297
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,702
My friend went back to America.
That punk is American.

298
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,381
You have that senior's number, right?

299
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,617
Yes, sir.

300
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,641
You have Kang Min Ho's phone, right?
Give it to me.

301
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,042
Here you go.

302
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,212
Call him.

303
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:18,771
Say that you need pills now.

304
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,811
Let's see that senior's face.

305
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:25,452
Well...

306
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,522
I don't think he'd answer...

307
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:30,532
my call.

308
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,992
Call him until he does.

309
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:35,402
You'll have to prove if that senior
really gave you the pills.

310
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,431
If I prove it,

311
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:39,431
you really have to help me.

312
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:40,742
Okay.

313
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,678
Gosh, you're lying.

314
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,382
You didn't even give me
the pill last time.

315
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:45,712
What does this guy look like?

316
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,581
Something like his height
or any characteristics.

317
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:49,952
Senior?

318
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,482
There's nothing much that stands out.

319
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,752
He's just about average height.

320
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,361
He had a tattoo on his finger.

321
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,302
A tattoo of what?

322
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:24,411
Jin Wook.

323
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,651
That Doctor guy is so weird, isn't he?

324
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:30,261
How does he know to release the pills
right before people start to croak?

325
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:35,091
It was going to be released like this,
but I got so scared.

326
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:43,631
It's not the Doctor.

327
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:45,901
What?

328
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,972
I couldn't hold back and called first.

329
00:21:49,302 --> 00:21:50,312
Doctor.

330
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:51,841
It's me.

331
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,488
I'm sorry I called first...

332
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:57,432
It must've been bearable for everyone,
seeing how you're only calling now.

333
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,022
Let's start selling again.

334
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:01,752
How much do you need now?

335
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,452
I need 1,000 by today.

336
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,292
Fine.

337
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,137
(End call)

338
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,641
The altered voice was the same,
but the speech pattern changed.

339
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:15,238
And it seems like he didn't know...

340
00:22:15,262 --> 00:22:17,822
that I went against the rule
that I'm not supposed to call first.

341
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:21,341
Then,

342
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:23,442
what happened here?

343
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:27,991
We'll have to wait and see.

344
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,151
(Oh Soo Hyun)

345
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:43,232
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

346
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:03,212
- Captain.
- Yes.

347
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,387
I got the CCTV footage from
around Lee Myung Guk's house.

348
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,528
- Where do you want to watch it?
- Let's watch it at my desk.

349
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,552
Okay, just a moment.

350
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,331
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

351
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:21,232
The kids who were brought in yesterday.
There was one Lemon Mulberry pill left.

352
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:23,772
- Yes?
- It disappeared.

353
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,702
Look for it again.

354
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:29,518
I put it in my desk drawer
for a brief moment...

355
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,742
while writing up their case reports.

356
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,018
Are you sure?

357
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,081
Well, so... You can't leave
evidence in your desk drawer.

358
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:37,488
Darn it.

359
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:39,282
I know. What should I do?

360
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:41,281
I'd be dead if Captain finds out, right?

361
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,468
Did you draw blood from those kids
and ask for the analysis?

362
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,052
Yes, we're waiting for the results.

363
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,091
Come here.

364
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,262
So, Captain.

365
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:54,831
Yes?

366
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,082
There's something we have to tell you.

367
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,502
What is it?

368
00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:01,781
You know those kids yesterday?
The ones fighting over the Lemon Mulberry.

369
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,047
Yes?

370
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:04,547
Soo Hyun was writing up
the report on them,

371
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:07,712
and it was a hassle to take it to and from
the evidence locker.

372
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:10,332
So, she put it in her desk drawer,
but it disappeared.

373
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:15,081
I thought you came here because you knew.

374
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:16,921
Lieutenant Kim Chang Soo was here.

375
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,462
Kim Chang Soo, what are you trying to do?

376
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,631
It disappeared?

377
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:25,962
What does that mean?

378
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:27,502
I'm sorry, sir.

379
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:32,407
It'd be one thing
if it got crushed up and disappeared.

380
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,418
That's an illegal drug.

381
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,202
If it just disappeared,
it could be abused.

382
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,671
Why did you manage it like that?

383
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,581
- That's true, but...
- No. No "buts."

384
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:50,972
Did you look through the CCTV footage?

385
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:56,222
No, sir.

386
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,091
I didn't either. Sorry, sir.

387
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:01,202
Did you get blood from the suspects?

388
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:02,678
I did.

389
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,272
And I requested for blood analyses.

390
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,442
Then,

391
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:14,312
change the records
so that it says there was no evidence.

392
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,728
We can't hand it over
to the prosecution...

393
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,792
saying we lost something
that exists in the records.

394
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:22,522
Is there any other way?

395
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:24,952
- No, sir.
- Be careful from now on.

396
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:27,801
I'll report this to the Unit Chief myself.

397
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:29,421
Sorry, sir.

398
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:31,331
I'll make sure this never happens again.

399
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:32,962
Soo Hyun, you can go.

400
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,601
- You wanted to watch the CCTV footage.
- Oh, right.

401
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:43,611
Turn it on.

402
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:45,512
Yes, sir.

403
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:56,052
Couldn't he just be pretending
not to know?

404
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,312
In case it puts me in an awkward spot,

405
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:01,851
he could just be letting it slide
as if he doesn't know.

406
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:04,942
The cars that left from near the house
around the time of the fire...

407
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,202
was this compact vehicle and this SUV.

408
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,802
The car in the back is my friend's car.

409
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,671
And I was riding in it.

410
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:14,478
Yes, sir.

411
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:18,411
Aren't you curious why I escaped
in a hurry from that crime scene?

412
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:19,841
I am curious.

413
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,162
I called because I was curious,
but you didn't answer.

414
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:24,611
I just assume you must have
some reason for it.

415
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:27,321
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

416
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:31,452
Did you perhaps get CCTV footage
from Sunkwang General Hospital?

417
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,591
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

418
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:37,131
Just as a formality.

419
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,601
But how did you know that, Captain?

420
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:47,071
(Jang Jae Gyeong)

421
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,171
I called them
because I wanted to take a look too.

422
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,872
But they said they sent it to you.

423
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:56,982
Yes, sir.

424
00:26:57,752 --> 00:26:58,752
Go on.

425
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:00,782
Yes, sir.

426
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,252
If you watch,

427
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,121
the compact vehicle in front
has tape over the license plates.

428
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:08,342
It's hard to track it down.

429
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:09,992
No.

430
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:11,692
It's not right.

431
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:14,692
Circumstances are too weird
for him to be covering up for me.

432
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:17,122
Could he have been bought out recently?

433
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:19,371
If so, who was it?

434
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,601
I think the driver was aware of the CCTV
as he drove home.

435
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:24,942
There is a CCTV from another angle.

436
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:28,681
From there,
we can see the vehicle clearly,

437
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:30,621
but it's also hard to see the driver.

438
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:33,651
Which way is he driving towards?

439
00:27:34,752 --> 00:27:36,081
It connects to Yanghoon-ro.

440
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,752
Then, check the CCTVs from
near Yanghoon-ro...

441
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,661
and keep tracking where that car
is heading to.

442
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:44,631
Yes, but the time period is rush hour.

443
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,877
Still, Yanghoon-ro would have
lots of CCTV cameras.

444
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,938
If we check from several angles,
we'd be able to track the movements.

445
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:50,278
That's true,

446
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,347
but these are black-and-white cameras,
and headlights in the dark...

447
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:53,871
Just do as you're told!

448
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,272
- You're here.
- Yes, hello.

449
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:28,242
- Come in.
- Okay.

450
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:29,801
I bought these on my way here.

451
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,518
Oh, thank you.

452
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,111
- Do you like oranges?
- Yes.

453
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:36,357
I'm sorry to call you over
when you must be busy.

454
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,381
No.

455
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,688
I just had a meeting end
right around here.

456
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:40,998
I came too early, didn't I?

457
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:43,052
No, I got home early today too.

458
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,552
Oh, would you like some tea?

459
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:49,192
Yes, anything is fine.

460
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:55,502
Goodness.

461
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,272
My husband used to love listening
to music.

462
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:35,901
Right.

463
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,518
We were
in the same music listening club...

464
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,542
when we were in high school.

465
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,611
I see.

466
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,881
Right. Why did you call me?

467
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:46,252
It's about my husband.

468
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:51,151
I'm not familiar with his finances,
accounts, or insurance.

469
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,921
I heard there was a way
to review all of them at once.

470
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,192
Yes, there is.

471
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,867
It's called One-stop Service
for Safe Inheritance.

472
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:58,361
All you have to do is apply.

473
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,861
Do you have a laptop?

474
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,307
You can do it right now.

475
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,647
Yes. My husband's laptop must be around.

476
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,532
Good.
Why didn't you just ask me over the phone?

477
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:08,571
The ward office can do it for you too.

478
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:12,772
I actually have more to discuss with you.

479
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:14,181
Go ahead.

480
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:16,442
Actually,

481
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:20,212
it was too hectic during the funeral
for me to realize,

482
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:23,151
but I thought about it,

483
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:24,682
and this is about my husband,

484
00:30:25,022 --> 00:30:26,321
not some stranger.

485
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:28,198
Right.

486
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,861
If he signed up for insurance,
he must have paid it too.

487
00:30:31,562 --> 00:30:34,401
When you think about it,
that money comes from us.

488
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:36,702
Yes.

489
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:39,431
I don't know the reason,

490
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:41,847
but he left his life insurance money...

491
00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:43,671
to Jae Gyeong and Yoon Jin instead of me.

492
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:45,671
I think his purpose is clear.

493
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,341
One of them is a detective,

494
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:51,151
and the other is a reporter.

495
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:53,921
My husband must have left some bait...

496
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:56,621
hoping someone would uncover
the truth behind his death.

497
00:30:57,921 --> 00:30:58,992
"Bait?"

498
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,421
I heard he wasn't that close
to the two of them.

499
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:08,401
He left them five million dollars
instead of me.

500
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:10,101
It's definitely a bait.

501
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,472
In the end, I feel like he's leaving
the money to me.

502
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:20,581
That's why I can't just sit and watch.

503
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:23,341
I should know how it progresses.

504
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:25,581
Unlike them,

505
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,651
there is no conflict of interest
in your case.

506
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:31,722
If you find out anything,

507
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:33,992
please let me know.

508
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:35,522
Sure.

509
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:38,867
I'll go grab the laptop.

510
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:39,891

when I told you to.

and he was found as a corpse.

- What?

to worry about?

Lee Myung Guk being found dead...

538
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,351
is not as bad as compared
to having him missing.

539

To put it bluntly,

540
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,591
this can be much cleaner...

00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,292
than having him suddenly show up
without notice.

542
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:51,792
It's simple.

543
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,302
A fire kills a researcher
from Keumhyung Pharmaceutical.

544
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,702
That's it.

545
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,972
Don't worry about it.

546
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:12,911
What is it?

547
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:14,722
Take a look.

548
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:23,091
(Pilo-dong Development Plan
Development Project Overview)

549
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:25,331
The view is always so nice here.

550
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:30,748
(Type of project: Land development)

551
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:32,272
To me and the rest of us,

552
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,601
turning you into the chairman
of Keumhyung Group is our priority.

553
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,542
Jun Seo is gone,

554
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:40,341
but our friendship will never die.

555
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:43,952
I also have full trust
in you becoming the chairman.

556
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:47,621
So, Jong Soo.

557
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:52,067
Don't let this petty incident
get us anxious...

558
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,492
or upset.

559
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:08,971
How is it going...

560
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,518
with the funding?

561
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,222
I'll have to discuss this with Yigu Group.

562
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:13,641
Keumhyung can't handle it alone.

563
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,652
I'll announce it this Friday
at the board meeting...

564
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:18,581
and wrap up the funding plan.

565
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,781
It sounds like
you might need additional funding...

566
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,851
from external organizations
or private investors.

567
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,621
Why do you ask?
Do you have someone in mind?

568
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:30,632
Well, I think someone might be interested.

569
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:32,991
Hey.

570
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,438
They need to invest ten million dollars
at the minimum.

571
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:39,108
Are you thinking
of your senior prosecutors...

572
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,572
whose wives come from rich families?

573
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:42,502
Come on, Tae Jin.

574
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,822
When it comes to a project like this,

575
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:48,217
only those who can afford
to lose ten million dollars can play...

576
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,511
such a betting game.

577
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:52,712
Someone needs to tell them their place.

578
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:54,757
They should focus
on working for the state...

579
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,252
instead of wasting their time.

580
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,051
I wasn't referring to them.

581
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:01,597
If someone has ten million dollars
in cash,

582
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:04,021
I thought you might include them
regardless of who they were.

583
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,091
I was only asking
if you might be interested.

584
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:07,402
Don't overact.

585
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:09,632
Is that so?

586
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:15,141
How about this?

587
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,042
If they bring me ten million dollars...

588
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,772
and lower their head to beg me,
I'll think about it.

589
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,022
Detective Park.

590
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,097
Did you manage to get the CCTV footage...

591
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:34,041
from around the building
where Park Jun Seo died?

592
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,062
- I did.
- May I look at them too?

593
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,732
Please ask Inspector Yoo Kyung Hwan first,

594
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,031
and I'll show them to you.

595
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,301
Detective Park.

596
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,331
Don't you find it strange too?

597
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,108
The prosecutor was against conducting
an autopsy.

598
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:49,277
Inspector Yoo is also uninterested
in investigating the case.

599
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:51,301
- It's not because of the insurance...
- Excuse me!

600
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:53,911
I don't know anything about this...

601
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:55,942
nor do I care.

602
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,281
We couldn't find anything.

603
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:08,542
You couldn't find anything
from the construction site's cameras?

604
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:09,592
Detective Park!

605
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:12,391
Detective Park.

of the subway drug dealer.

607
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:27,818

00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,531
Yes.

611
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,002
Turn on the computer.

612
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,542
Type your date of birth.

and put them in the electronic wallet.

614
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,281
The drugs will be shipped the next day.

615
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,981
Collect the payment
for yesterday's shipment.

616
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:46,792
Show the address to ship to.

618
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:53,491
That's all. Take care.

619
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,601
Wait. Just a moment, Doctor.

620
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,331
Yes.

621
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:00,402
May I...

622
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,342
contact you at this number?

623
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,241
If there's an emergency like last time.

624
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:10,482
You can call me...

625
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:12,882
just once after midnight.

626
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:14,322
I understand.

627
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:00,862
I told you not to come...

628
00:40:10,002 --> 00:40:11,011
Tell me.

629
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:13,172
What's the password?

630
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,112
I'll ask you just one more time.

631
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,551
Tell me the password now.

632
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,592
What's the password?

633
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:27,661
Tell me right now!

634
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:49,712
Ji Yeon. Tell me quick.

635
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:55,121
That's how you and I both
can escape this situation.

636
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,721
What situation?

637
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,792
That we were in it together?

638
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,391
What?

639
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:06,092
Do you want me gone now?

640
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:08,902
Your group of friends.

641
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:12,172
You thought you were
the best and closest there were.

642
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,502
Look at you now.

643
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:16,101
The money might go to someone else now.

644
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:18,588
Why did you ask for an autopsy?

645
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,772
You shouldn't have taken me
to the police station.

646
00:41:37,292 --> 00:41:38,391
Give me a million dollars.

647
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,962
- What?
- Give me a million dollars,

648
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:45,101
and I'll tell you.

649
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:51,692
You don't want your friends to know...

650
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:53,971
that we slept around.

651
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:56,712
Would they let you off?

652
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,987
So many of them adore Jun Seo...

653
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:00,712
and still call him "class president."

654
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,391
You slept with your friend's widow.

655
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:09,292
Who knows?

656
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,831
What if that's why Jun Seo died?

657
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:15,402
- Shut your mouth!
- Don't shout!

658
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,471
You said you wouldn't
leave your wife for me.

659
00:42:22,601 --> 00:42:24,842
Give me something
if you want to silence me.

660
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:27,511
Isn't that how things work?

661
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,822
(Pilo Town House Construction Site)

662
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:58,672
Why was it this construction site?

663
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:02,157
There are two construction sites...

664
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,281
within 500m of Jun Seo's home and work.

665
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:08,721
They weren't by large roads
and would've been easier to sneak into.

666
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:13,652
Why would he avoid cameras
just to come here?

667
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,531
Hello.

668
00:43:21,661 --> 00:43:22,831
It's pretty cold.

669
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:24,541
I'm from Anhyeon Police Station.

670
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,902
Where's the site manager?

671
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:30,842
I'm the site manager.

672
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,371
The police investigated
and cleared the site.

673
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,741
I'm aware of that.

674
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,911
I'm looking into it again.

675
00:43:37,812 --> 00:43:39,851
Do you have cameras around the site?

676
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,181
We don't.

677
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,351
You have cameras everywhere
in case people steal building materials.

678
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:47,721
We have a camera at the gate for that.

679
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:50,592
There's no room for cameras
at the actual site.

680
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,522
Let's see the footage
for the camera at the gate, then.

681
00:43:53,962 --> 00:43:55,902
Where do I go? Can I see that here?

682
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:57,871
Well...

683
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:13,482
Where's the other entrance?

684
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:15,851
We have just this one gate.

685
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:17,827
So many people...

686
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:20,951
steal scrap metal and wires
from construction sites these days.

687
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,462
We made sure
not even a rat could sneak in.

688
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:26,161
Was the main gate locked
the day the body was found?

689
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,562
Yes. I unlocked it myself
the next morning.

690
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:31,572
How did the dead guy get in, then?

691
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:34,672
- What?
- You said not even a rat could sneak in.

692
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:36,077
If the gate was locked...

693
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,312
and the camera showed
no one went in or out,

694
00:44:38,471 --> 00:44:40,011
how did the dead guy get in?

695
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:42,781
How would I know?

696
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,858
The police said it looked like
he came in through the building next door.

697
00:44:45,882 --> 00:44:48,882
Do people scale walls to sneak into
a building next door to kill themselves?

698
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,351
When the police were here,
did they actually watch this footage?

699
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:55,522
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

700
00:44:56,022 --> 00:44:57,237
- What?
- Come to the station.

701
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,491
Let's write up another report
and investigate again.

702
00:45:01,761 --> 00:45:03,632
Why are you doing this, detective?

703
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,471
- Can I drink this?
- Yes, of course.

704
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:11,077
We had to stop working for days
because of that investigation.

705
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:13,141
We're having a really hard time right now.

706
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:17,002
There's another entrance, isn't there?

707
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:21,088
(No to redevelopment)
(Don't plunder our private property!)

708
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:23,781
We'd made a small entrance
so the workers...

709
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,922
could come and go at mealtimes.

710
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,621
I guess he came in through here.

711
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:31,232
Not many people know this place.

712
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:35,502
Can I go now?

713
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:37,137
(Construction in progress)

714
00:45:37,161 --> 00:45:38,172
Yes.

715
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:44,712
(No to redevelopment)
(Don't plunder our private property!)

716
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:47,712
That's blocked now.

(Mill and Rice Cakes)

718
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:01,891
So you're a policeman.

719
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:04,962
Did people use that entrance often?

720
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,367
You bet.

721
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,661
Everyone used it at lunchtime.

722
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:10,862
But something happened a few days ago.

723
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:14,272
They blocked it up after that.

724
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:17,402
- How much do I owe you?
- Just ten dollars.

725
00:46:17,871 --> 00:46:19,042
Here you go.

726
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,542
- Did the police come by?
- No.

727
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:25,652
I thought they didn't see the need
since it was a suicide.

728
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:28,252
But you're here now.

729
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,752
Where is that camera?

730
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:34,522
Under the eaves.

732
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:49,801
(Chukbok Mill and Rice Cakes)

733
00:47:03,781 --> 00:47:05,491
Can I see the footage from the camera?

734
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,292
From February 23 if possible.

735
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:08,962
It's your lucky day.

736
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,692
I was going to delete the old stuff.

737
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:32,681
- Yoon Jin.
- Where are you?

738
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:34,411
I'm on the way home.

739
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:36,621
What?

740
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,322
You said you'd be at Jun Seo's
at 5:30 p.m.

741
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:41,391
I left because we were done.

742
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,902
I hurried over
to see how Ji Yeon was doing.

743
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,548
Then I'll come back.

744
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,172
No, don't bother. Why would you do that?

745
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:56,442
Why did she...

746
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:58,172
want to see you?

747
00:47:59,842 --> 00:48:02,157
She asked about
Jun Seo's insurance and inheritance.

748
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:03,681
- She...
- Wait.

749
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,382
I'll call you back.

750
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:18,862
Shoot.

751
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,322
Darn it.

752
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:15,281
Darn it.

753
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,491
(A happy change, a new Anhyun)

754
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:38,212
Please stop for a second.

755
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:42,081
I'll take a photo of the license plate.

756
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:48,721
Please play it again.

757
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,391
One second.

758
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:09,502
Jun Seo, why on earth did you come here?

759
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:20,612
What do you have to do with drugs?

760
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:28,522
Could you play it once again?

761
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:36,002
That was at 10:56 p.m.

762
00:50:37,031 --> 00:50:40,248
The estimated time of death was
between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.

763
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:42,301
But he arrived
at the scene 30 minutes earlier.

764
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:44,172
Why?

765
00:50:45,072 --> 00:50:46,442
Would you like to watch more?

766
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:48,382
Yes.

767
00:50:51,812 --> 00:50:52,812
Yes, that part.

768
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:13,548
Are there any other CCTVs
besides that one outside?

769
00:51:13,572 --> 00:51:17,201
No, I think that's the only one
around here.

770
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:26,482
I'll look through the rest thoroughly
after I get a copy.

771
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:42,931
My gosh.

772
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:45,201
Are the cats making trouble?

773
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:25,411
Oh, gosh.

774
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:43,661
Well, this is...

775
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:45,538
- I'll take some rice cakes.
- All right.

776
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,292
There's not much storage space on here,

777
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:49,701
but there is some footage on here
that I had backed up.

778
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,331
You can take this and use it too.

779
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:52,608
No, it's fine.

780
00:52:52,632 --> 00:52:54,077
I think I'll have to get
a copy of everything.

781
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,471
I'll be right back.

782
00:52:56,301 --> 00:53:00,217
I mean, the construction workers
kept parking here illegally,

783
00:53:00,241 --> 00:53:01,741
so I got this CCTV to catch them.

784
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,312
But it's more popular than I thought.

785
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:10,121
- What?
- It was a long time ago,

786
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,398
but some guy came...

787
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,092
and asked to watch
the CCTV like you, detective.

788
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:17,391
He asked if he could get a copy.

789
00:53:17,522 --> 00:53:19,132
So, I told him to go ahead.

790
00:53:19,562 --> 00:53:20,592
When was this?

791
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:21,862
Was he a police officer?

792
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:23,962
No, he wasn't a police officer.

793
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:26,608
I'm not exactly sure when it was,

794
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:29,172
but I think it was about six months ago,
at least.

795
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,518
Didn't that man leave
some contact information or anything?

796
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,911
I'm not sure.

797
00:53:34,241 --> 00:53:35,241
Oh, right.

798
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,681
After I made a copy for him,

799
00:53:37,942 --> 00:53:40,482
he came back in a few days to thank me.

800
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,022
Here. He came and gave me this.

Is that man in this photo?

805
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:02,572
I'm not sure if I'd be able to remember
since it has been a while.

806
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,241
Hang on.

807
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,911
It was this guy.

808
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:12,887
Oh, right.

809
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:15,751
This was the man who got out of
the taxi in the CCTV footage too, right?

810
00:54:16,121 --> 00:54:18,391
I knew I had seen him somewhere before.

811
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,092
It was this man.

asked me out.

I told him we should remain friends,
but he didn't want to.

852
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:48,292
Even if I date Jun Seo,
it won't come between us, right?

853
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:51,721
We're all friends, so I'm worried...

854
00:58:52,092 --> 00:58:54,792
that dating him might distance us.

Why are you asking me?

You can go out with him
if that's what you want.

863

How can I trust you?

892
01:02:20,502 --> 01:02:23,148
You shouldn't get involved in this case
just because of the insurance money.

893
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:25,987

if you keep going around with me.

01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:38,867

Why were you so inconsiderate
of Jun Seo's situation?

to Park Jun Seo's case.
