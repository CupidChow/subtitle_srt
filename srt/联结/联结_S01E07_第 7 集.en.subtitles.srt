1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,435
JAE-GYEONG TRACES
THE SUSPECT'S MOVEMENTS

3
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,188
It had to be there.

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,482
The suspect parked in that dead-end alley

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,649
and watched me.

6
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,277
I was wondering if a different car
was parked here this afternoon.

7
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,321
Yes, it was parked here.

8
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,822
You didn't come out to check?

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,990
It was a taxi.

10
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,116
A taxi?

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,993
-It was silver.
-It was a different taxi.

12
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,164
Can you tell me
who drove 35A 0233 on February 23rd?

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,749
It was Mr. No Gyu-min.

14
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,294
He said he was moving two days ago
but was gone when I checked this morning.

15
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,046
Twenty-five minutes passed
after Jun-seo got out.

16
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,964
Why did that car suddenly stop there?

17
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,634
Black SUV. Plate number 83P 3234.
Please run the plate.

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,596
Yesterday, there was a murder at a rice
mill near the site where Jun-seo died.

19
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,181
We've waited 20 years.

20
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,266
Tomorrow's board meeting
is the first step, but…

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,559
The chairman has arrived.

22
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,145
Let's begin.

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,939
Won Jong-soo. Show them what you've got.

24
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,858
Show them you're more than capable
of leading this project.

25
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,444
What Mayor Joo wants
is a bio-industrial complex.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,196
I can give Mayor Joo what he wants.

27
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,364
Was it Tae-jin's idea?

28
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,368
I noticed his speech patterns
in the business plan.

29
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,370
And in the presentation.

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,789
JONG-SOO EXHIBITS
STRANGE SYMPTOMS AND COLLAPSES

31
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,415
Wake up, Jong-soo.

32
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,835
Get out!

33
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,503
RIGHT THEN,
SOMEONE ENTERS THE ROOM

34
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,255
I said no one's allowed in here!

35
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,798
Give this to him now.

36
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,091
SANG-UI GIVES JONG-SOO
AN UNIDENTIFIED DRUG

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,926
It's about that company
Jun-seo established.

38
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,136
Audiophile Corporation.

39
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,554
I found out its address.

40
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,763
He said you'd come.

41
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,432
If a man comes, it's Jang Jae-gyeong.
If a woman comes, it's Oh Yun-jin.

42
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,685
There's a motorcycle outside.
Do you deliver drugs too?

43
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,895
They're yellow. You never delivered any?

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,397
I said I haven't.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,149
Call me if anything happens.

46
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,360
The hospital gave her
a big prescription of painkillers.

47
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,862
Xinopam?

48
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,698
She couldn't turn on her side on her own,
but I found her waking me up.

49
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,950
-But?
-She passed away that night.

50
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,451
Did hospital officials
take away the medicine?

51
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,870
They came from KH Pharmaceutical.

52
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,246
IT WAS PARK JUN-SEO

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,664
He responded.

54
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,625
The meeting location is in Ohyeon-dong.
It's in the old Anhyeon shopping mall.

55
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,335
Nice to meet you two.

56
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,546
This is just protocol,
so I hope you understand.

57
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,175
Just relax and take it easy.

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,969
I'm trying to make you feel good.

59
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,763
Let's take off your jacket.

60
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,067
This is new. It's diluted lemon pop.

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,278
Did you know
it's more effective if you inject it?

62
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,238
Here's a sample.

63
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,991
They're sticking a needle
in Captain's arm, right?

64
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:23,119
They're checking to see if he's a cop.

65
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,203
What?

66
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,457
Addicts keep still,
but cops are afraid of getting addicted,

67
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,000
so they instinctively pull their arm away.

68
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,210
Then what about Captain?

69
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,546
Should we move in?

70
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,342
We don't know if that's a real drug
or just saline.

71
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,429
If we suddenly move in, and it's not real,
it'll all be for nothing.

72
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,057
Captain Jang is keeping still
because he knows this.

73
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,894
Okay then.

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,438
I'm pushing it in now.

75
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,253
You passed the test. Come over here.

76
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,257
That bastard's a cop!

77
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,512
-What?
-Boss.

78
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,891
-Something happened.
-What is it?

79
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,854
We were making a deal with a customer
when Dae-seong got arrested by the cops.

80
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,231
What? When?

81
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,316
Just now.

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,444
But Dae-seong doesn't know where you live,

83
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,945
so you don't have to worry.

84
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,531
But he knows where you live!

85
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,992
-Where are you right now?
-I'm outside.

86
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,078
I won't go to your house.

87
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,246
I'll go into hiding for a few days.

88
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,500
Okay.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,710
Don't contact me for now.

90
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,504
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,588
But…

92
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,217
Our next transaction
with CEO Yoon is in three days.

93
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,303
But we haven't collected payment
from the previous deal yet.

94
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,014
Find a place to hide in for now.

95
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:31,974
I'll call you later.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,601
Okay.

97
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,073
The interrogation will now begin.

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,201
What is the actual name
of the senior you were with?

99
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,371
I just call him "Sir."

100
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,164
Mr. Kim Dae-seong.

101
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,666
I'll ask you again.

102
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,710
What is the name
of the senior you were with?

103
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,673
I told you I don't know, damn it.

104
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,801
In addition to the 80 pills
Kang Min-ho tried to run off with,

105
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,387
we also found
120 lemon pop pills in your car.

106
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,516
This means we caught you violating
the Narcotics Control Act.

107
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,351
Lemon pop?

108
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,477
What's that?

109
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,604
I don't go near drugs.

110
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,648
And…

111
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,233
That car doesn't belong to me.

112
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,614
SECTION CHIEF JUNG YEON-JU

113
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,116
Come to the observation room.

114
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,997
Yes?

115
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,170
VEHICLE TRACKING REPORT
NAME: UHM SI-JONG

116
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
"Uhm Si-jong"?

117
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,506
That name sounds familiar.

118
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,924
Isn't this Straw's real name?

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,843
Where is he these days?

120
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,638
I heard he opened an office
in Anhyeon Market not too long ago.

121
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,682
-Get there before he goes underground.
-Right.

122
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,311
And about the needle

123
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,313
they put in your arm…

124
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,399
It didn't show up at the crime scene.

125
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,610
Maybe the punk who ran away took it.

126
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,278
Did you see him take it or not?

127
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,531
I think he did.

128
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,577
Okay. Got it.

129
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,966
-Was it you?
-What do you mean?

130
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,593
Did you do this to me?

131
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,930
No, all I did was find out
that you're addicted.

132
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,014
When?

133
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,974
When and how did you find out?

134
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,477
The day Lee Myeong-guk's body was found.

135
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,105
When I returned to the police station,

136
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,483
you had already collapsed on the floor.

137
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,986
I thought it was strange at first, but…

138
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,531
But?

139
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,409
You'd already taken the pill.

140
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,170
Did you tamper with the CCTV footage?

141
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,005
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,216
Did you move me into the restroom?

143
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,634
Yes, sir.

144
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,345
Why didn't you tell anyone?
You could've reported me.

145
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,723
I thought you had a good reason
for doing what you did.

146
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,726
"Someone got Captain addicted to drugs."

147
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,479
"He's doing whatever he can
to catch that person."

148
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,607
"I'll pretend not to know anything
until he approaches me first."

149
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,942
That's what I thought.

150
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,197
Does anyone else know?

151
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,909
No.

152
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,039
Then did you really take this?

153
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,719
I'm meeting someone tomorrow
who has information on CEO Yoon.

154
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,722
How do you know him?

155
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,100
CEO Yoon used to sell pot
on the outskirts of town.

156
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,603
This guy used to work for them back then.

157
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,606
I'll meet with him
and let you know what comes up.

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,374
WOONJONG MEDICAL CENTER

159
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,466
KH PHARMACEUTICAL
PARK JUN-SEO, SALES TEAM 1 MANAGER

160
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,720
Who came and took the medicine?

161
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,975
-Were they hospital officials?
-No, they came from KH Pharmaceutical.

162
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,897
They said they had to collect
the medicine to examine it.

163
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,900
This is the business card
the employee gave me that day.

164
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,780
WOONJONG MEDICAL CENTER
ON-SITE PHARMACY

165
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,199
-Excuse me. May I ask you a question?
-Yes?

166
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,993
Is KH Pharmaceutical
one of your suppliers?

167
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,912
Who are you?

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,209
Was this person the sales rep
for KH Pharmaceutical?

169
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,213
-Why do you ask?
-I'm Mr. Park Jun-seo's friend.

170
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,384
He died not too long ago,
so I wanted to retrace his steps.

171
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,469
I see.

172
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,932
I met him a few times
when he delivered the drugs.

173
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,017
I didn't know he passed away.

174
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,644
If you'll excuse me…

175
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,198

Do you have an appointment?

179
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,204
No.

180
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,288
I see.

181
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,499
She's not here right now.

-But…

Somebody will be waiting
in the first floor lobby.

Go straight there.

-Yes.

Damn.

Excuse me.

I'm Jang Jae-gyeong

No one here goes by that name.

240
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,960
What's going on?

241
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,253
This is the right place, sir.

242
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,546
Hold on.

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,971
Is there a private elevator?

Yes, please have it ready.

248
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,102

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
Why are you here?

00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,788
Shall we leave?

252
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,252

00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,920
Let go, damn it.

Please call the police!

00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,428
Where are you taking me?

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,059
Hey, this is kidnapping.

258
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,941
Hey, what are you…

259
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,986
Damn it.

00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,832
Hey.

00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,876
Where the hell are you taking me?

263
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,502
Hey, Oh Chi-hyeon!

264
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,879
Someone help me!

265
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,464
These people are kidnapping me!

-Yes, sir?

267
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,537
Why don't you go for a walk?

Okay, sir.

Hello, sirs.

270
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,132
How have you been?

271
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,092
It's so nice to see you again.

272
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,552
What happened to your dialect?

273
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,221

MAY I CALL YOU BACK LATER?

277
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,317
Why did you change your name?

278
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,611
My mother thought it would help

279
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,322
to prevent me from going to prison again.

280
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,449
It was her last wish.

281
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,826
Is that what your fortune teller told you?

282
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,745
Yes… Hold on, how did you know?

283
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,872
How did you set this up
right out of prison?

284
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,541
I started it with the insurance payout
from my mother's policy.

286
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,297
Do you own this car?

287
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,632
Where's this car right now?

288
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,300
-Is it yours?
-Yes.

289
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
We found drugs in it.

290
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,180
Sirs, they're not mine!

291
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,349
You know me. I've never touched any drugs!

292
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,726
Yes, I thought it was strange too.

293
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,020
That doesn't change the fact
we found drugs in your car.

294
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,022
That bastard, Park Jin-hwan!

295
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,524
Park Jin-hwan? Who's that?

296
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,775
He's my hometown friend.

297
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,819
He said if I rented a car under my name,

298
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,988
he'd rent it out and give me
three million won a month.

299
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,573
That's illegal.
I can't believe you fell for that.

300
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,410
Who knew someone
would scam the great Straw?

301
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,412
Listen to me, sirs.

302
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,248
I swear, it's not me.

303
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,500
My delivery guys have clean records,

304
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,129
and my secretary
actually majored in secretarial studies.

305
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,797
I hired her myself.

306
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,758
I understand, but given the circumstances,

307
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,262
you'll need to go out yourself
and look for the person who took your car.

308
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,681
-What?
-You need to prove your innocence.

309
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,311
What was the point of changing my name?

310
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,899
Then…

311
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,903
Can I handle things
the way I used to before?

312
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,238
Of course.

313
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,325
But don't hurt them too much.

314
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,203
Okay, sir.

315
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,663
I'll be in touch soon.

316
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,923
What floor is
Chief Secretary Oh's office on?

317
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,217
The reason for your visit, sir?

318
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,887
I'm a high school friend,
and I need to see him.

319
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,847

-Hey!
-What are you doing?

324
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,781
Yun-jin!

325
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,407
Don't let go of him!

326
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,456
Yun-jin.

327
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,335
My apologies.

Are you okay, Yun-jin?

Yun-jin?

330
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,690
Do you want to go home for now?

331
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,655
What on earth happened?

332
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
Why did that bastard,
Oh Chi-hyeon, kidnap you?

333
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,869
Joo-song.

334
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,954
Yes?

335
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,127
Do you want to eat beef barbecue?

336
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,183
Will you be okay, sir?

337
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,270
What choice do I have?

338
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,315
I can't take any more drugs.

339
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,693
I have to bear it somehow.

340
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,864
See you tomorrow.

341
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,711
-Hey.
-It's me.

342
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,714
-Yun-jin was kidnapped today.
-What?

343
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,009
Yun-jin was kidnapped by Oh Chi-hyeon.

344
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,135
Where are you right now?

345
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,143
Who goes out to make a phone call
in the middle of eating barbecue?

346
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,936
I called Jae-gyeong.

347
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,146
He's on his way.

348
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,192
Did you tattle to Jae-gyeong again?

349
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,695
Damn it.

350
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,531
Talk to me already.

351
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,702
Tell me why that bastard,
Oh Chi-hyeon, kidnapped you,

352
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,371
and tell me why
I'm grilling beef right now.

353
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,624
I can't enjoy this food
if I don't know anything.

354
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,550
How did you know I was taken there?

355
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,135
Hyeon-u told me.

356
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
Hyeon-u?

357
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,680
The high school student
living at Audiophile's address.

358
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,599
And how did he know?

359
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,476
I'm not sure.

360
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,021
In any case, he called and said
you got kidnapped by some men

361
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,857
and that you were taken
to KH Pharmaceutical.

362
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,026
Did you really get kidnapped
by Oh Chi-hyeon?

363
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,404
What happened in there
that we're now eating beef barbecue?

364
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,623
Are you insane?

365
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,167
-What do you want?
-What?

366
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,711
You guys leave and send in two coffees.

367
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,714
I don't want any, you bastard!

368
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,807
I've been reading your articles.

369
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,393
What? Where's this coming from?

370
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,646
How did you know
there were issues with the drugs

371
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,733
-we supplied to Woonjong Medical Center?
-How is that important right now?

372
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,736
You kidnapped a reporter.

373
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,530
I won't let you get away with this.

374
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,991
Let Jun-seo rest in peace.

375
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,747
KH PHARMACEUTICAL
PARK JUN-SEO

376
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,667
Why did a realtor
carry a business card like this?

377
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,419
How are you going to explain this?

378
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,886
KH Pharmaceutical is a test for Jong-soo.

379
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,179
What?

380
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,348
To become the next chairman of KH Group,

381
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,934
KH Pharmaceutical has to go
from constantly being in the red

382
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,019
to becoming profitable.

383
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,354
If he can't do that,

384
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,565
becoming chairman won't be guaranteed.

385
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,567
What does that have to do
with Park Jun-seo?

386
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,569
We were friends.

387
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,782
Park Jun-seo, Park Tae-jin,
Jung Yun-ho, and myself.

388
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,368
We gave him our full support.

389
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,164
We wanted to help Jong-soo
become the chairman,

390
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,834
so we reached out to everyone we knew

391
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,879
and used every single connection we had

392
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,465
to get KH Pharmaceutical up and running.

393
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,967
To do that,

394
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,053
we needed business cards.

395
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,346
And Woonjong Medical Center?

396
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,724
Didn't you have a sales rep
handling them already?

397
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,686
No, we didn't have a deal in place
with them before that.

398
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,022
Jun-seo got us the deal

399
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,733
by connecting with the director
at a social club.

400
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,821
That's why Jun-seo
went to all of those gatherings.

401
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,035
I'll find out if you're telling the truth
when I investigate this.

402
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,373
In any case, I won't let this case slide.

403
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,709
Now that you've kidnapped me,

404
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,045
is it time for me to go missing?

405
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,311
KH GROUP CHIEF SECRETARY
OH CHI-HYEON

406
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,237
What's this?

407
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,907
I knew I'd see you sooner or later,
so I prepared these envelopes.

408
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,244
Now that I know how determined you are,
one won't be enough.

409
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,829
So I'm using both.

410
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,124
Goodness.

411
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,502
You're violating a lot of laws today.

412
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,129
What's this?

413
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,839
A bribery attempt?

414
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,676
That won't be enough, right?

415
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,191
I think you've got me all wrong.

416
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,372
After seeing the photos, I thought
I should both bribe and blackmail you.

417
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,085
Every time your photo was taken,
you were eating.

418
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,045
Which place had the best food?

419
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,093
Joo-song.

420
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,220
What is it?

421
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,889
For some reason…

422
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,103
I really miss my daughter today.

423
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,024
What's the matter with you?

424
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,985
Stop drinking.

425
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,030
Hey, Jae-gyeong.

426
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,039
Sure, sit there.

427
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,671
When did I fall asleep?

428
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,633
During the summer break…

429
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,762
Where was it again?

430
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,056
Jun-seo's grandmother's place, I mean.

431
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,600
-Busan.
-Right, Busan.

432
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,352
After Busan…

433
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,733
-What did she talk about after Busan?
-The reason she broke up with Jun-seo.

434
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,029
Right. That's when you fell asleep.

435
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,283
Did he eat beef with us too?

436
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,081
He didn't even touch his chopsticks,

437
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,543
saying he didn't want to eat beef
bought with questionable money.

438
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,131
He's heartless.

439
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,465
Heartless.

440
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,806
Hey, Jae-gyeong! Stop the car!

441
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,808
Hurry, stop the car!

442
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,602
Hey, Yun-jin!

443
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,020
Hang in there.

444
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,104
Hey.

445
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,272
You…

446
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,524
Are you okay?

447
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,320
Let it all out.

448
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,117
I need some tissue.

449
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,370
Hey, can I get some tissue--

450
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,002
Are you okay?

451
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,512
Jun-seo visited me too.

452
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,183
He was in front of my house.

453
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,144
Yun-jin.

454
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,079
Are you feeling better now?

455
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,333
About Yun-hui, I mean.

456
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,842
I know she's in a better place.

457
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,929
Yes.

458
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,899
We were there for ten minutes.

459
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,860
Or maybe less than that.

460
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,408
He just sat there
without saying much and left.

461
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,953
Who knew I'd never see him again?

462
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,124
Later, when I heard Jun-seo had died…

463
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,213
I wondered what he had wanted to tell me.

464
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,425
What was it

465
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,469
that he couldn't bring himself to say?

466
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,851
I had all sorts of thoughts.

467
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:45,189
I wonder if that punk knew
before he died…

468
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,901
Hey.

469
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,778
Jun-seo's wife, Choi Ji-yeon…

470
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,906
She's sleeping with Park Tae-jin.

471
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,953
They go to a different motel
in Anhyeon City every night.

472
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,956
How did you find out?

473
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,958
I just found out somehow.

474
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,003
She should've at least waited
after an appropriate mourning period.

475
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,546
That's just human decency.

476
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,631
Who else knows about this?

477
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,425
I don't know.

478
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,428
I don't think the others know.

479
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,266
Do you think Park Tae-jin
killed Park Jun-seo?

480
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,770
He's been acting weird since the funeral.

481
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,481
Hey, can't you arrest him
and investigate him?

482
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,107
I'm sure you'll find something.

483
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,860
I can't arrest a prosecutor
for having an affair without any proof.

484
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,112
What good would that do?

485
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,949
What are you saying?

486
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,536
Tae-jin killed Jun-seo?

487
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,624
It's late. Let's go.

488
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,922
Hey, I'm part of the team.

489
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,383
But why don't I know anything?

490
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,593
Talk to me!

491
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,102
Excuse me?

492
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,647
The most important thing
is to keep them quiet.

493
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,608
Yes. Call me when you take care of it.

494
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,322
Yesterday afternoon,
Vice Chairman Won went into shock

495
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,825
during a talk
at KH Pharmaceutical research center.

496
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,661
I ordered the research center
to keep the employees quiet.

497
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,204
Where is he now?

498
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,997
He's resting at home.

499
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,933
Damn it.

500
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,822
Father.

501
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,950
I've never been happy…

502
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,705
to have you as my son.

503
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,956
Not even once.

504
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,627
Even if your mother
came from a poor background,

505
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,088
since half of my blood
runs through your veins,

506
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,216
I hoped you'd take after me
at least a little bit.

507
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,845
I was wrong.

508
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,686
Your flight leaves this afternoon.

509
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,028
Go there.

510
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,907
-And don't come back.
-But…

511
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,159
Father!

512
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,243
Father.

513
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,536
I'm sorry.

514
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,622
I'll do better.

515
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,792
I'll quit using drugs
and do better, Father.

516
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,046
I have to be here to help Tae-jin

517
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,589
to successfully finish the project.

518
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,258
I might not be a good leader,

519
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,429
but you know
that I'm a great backer, Father.

520
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,558
So please don't send me to the US.

521
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,477
Please, Father.

522
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,647
Meet with Mayor Joo In-sang

523
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,651
and get the permit quickly.

524
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,153
Your role ends there.

525
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,724
Hey.

526
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,687
Have you been promoted
from being Won Jong-soo's driver?

527
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,981
I was worried you brought him here.

528
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,775
What brings you here?

529
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,194
What you got yesterday wasn't enough?

530
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,948
You're right. It wasn't.

531
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,449
Here.

532
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,412
Take it already.

533
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,541
There's some missing.

534
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,793
I bought these comfortable sneakers

535
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,713
and ordered the latest laptop
to replace the one you destroyed.

536
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,259
And since the money came from a friend
who wished me well as a reporter,

537
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,470
I had beef barbecue and soju too.
That's okay, right?

538
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,726
And about those photos…

539
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,272
Go ahead and send them to whomever.

540
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,942
I'm known for asking people
to treat me to meals,

541
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,360
so nobody will care.

542
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,780
Hey.

543
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,534
It's a newsworthy story
if a giraffe eats meat,

544
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,120
but who cares if a wolf has some meat?

545
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,247
See you later. You freaking gorilla.

546
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,924
-You're here.
-Yes.

547
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,137
That punk is so arrogant.

548
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,306
He didn't give us anything useful, did he?

549
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,390
No.

550
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,185
Jeez, seriously.

551
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,484
Do you want one too?

552
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,653
Thank you.

553
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,246
Did you learn anything new?

554
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,916
No, he keeps playing dumb.

555
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,131
Captain.

556
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,510
I just sent you
the vehicle tracking results.

557
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,889
-I got it.
-Okay.

558
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,648
83P 3234 YOO SEONG-EUN

559
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,441
FINECLASS APT.
HEUNGAN-RO, JOIN-DONG

560
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,821
RICE MILL

561
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
83P 3234

562
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,528
Who is it?

563
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,906
I'm the apartment security guard.

564
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,950
What do you--

565
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,078
-Excuse me.
-Who are you?

566
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,414
I'm Jang Jae-gyeong
from Anhyeon Police Station.

567
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,543
Did you drive to Pilo-dong
at around 11:20 p.m. on February 23rd?

568
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,463
-What?
-Last Friday night.

569
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,676
Did you drop off someone at the site
near Pilo-dong three-way intersection?

570
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,969
No.

571
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,637
Think carefully.

572
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,184
Did you say last Friday night?

573
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,895
Well…

574
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:25,566
Are you talking about the alley
with the rice mill near the intersection?

575
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,693
-Yes.
-Yes, I was there.

576
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,236
Why did you go there?

577
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,821
My mother lives there.

578
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,742
There's a dead-end alley
after you pass the rice mill.

579
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,369
My parents own
the tiled-roof house at the end of it.

580
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,787
But it was almost midnight.

581
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,539
Is that a crime?

582
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,041
Why did you go there?

583
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,878
I went there
after a fight with my husband.

584
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,047
But why did you stop there?

585
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,216
-Stop where?
-In front of the rice mill.

586
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,843
You stopped for about five seconds.

587
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,303
Didn't you drop someone off?

588
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,305
Oh, right then?

589
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,225
Someone suddenly jumped out of the alley.

590
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,603
I was about to make a right turn,
but they came out of nowhere.

591
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,230
I was startled, so I stopped.

592
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,489
-I'll return this after checking it.
-When?

593
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,907
Within a few days.

594
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,033
Okay.

595
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,581
-Sir!
-Goodness.

596
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,083
I was so startled.

597
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,485
Don't be hasty.

598
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,445
You didn't put in enough.

599
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,909
Seriously.

600
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,122
Of course.

601
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,249
Don't worry. I'll give it to you.

602
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,501
-And the insurance payout?
-Okay.

603
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,503
Oh, right.

604
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,338
Is the next deal two days from now?

605
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,715
Yes, that's right.

606
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,134
Okay. Have it ready.

607
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,302
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

608
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,139
Police. Don't move.

609
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,733
Don't move.

610
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,461
Detective Kim,
how did you know about this place?

611
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,765
Just stay right there.

612
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,147
I wonder what brings you here,
Detective Kim.

613
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,942
Why did you get
Senior Inspector Jang addicted?

614
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,653
Senior Inspector Jang?

615
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,282
What do you mean he's addicted?

616
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,744
I already know everything,
so let's not waste time.

617
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,245
Why did you do it?

618
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,749
It seems you don't know everything.

619
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,543
So…

620
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,463
How is Senior Inspector Jang doing?

621
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,924
Is he in the hospital?

622
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,258
CEO Yoon.

623
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,261
It wasn't us.

624
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,225
We gain nothing
by getting him addicted. Don't you agree?

625
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,476
Are you telling the truth?

626
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,191
Tell me the source of the lemon pop.

627
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,612
Gong Jin-uk is the bulk supplier.

628
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,781
Doctor is the one who makes it,

629
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,449
but I've never seen him.

630
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,910
Where's Gong Jin-uk?

631
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,287
I don't know that either.

632
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,623
CEO Yoon.

633
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,418
This isn't what we agreed on.

634
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,421
Didn't you promise not to bring

635
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,799
drugs into Anhyeon City
in exchange for us wiping out Ogeomi Gang?

636
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,554
That's not how I remember it.

637
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,475
That wasn't a promise.

638
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,601
It was a deal.

639
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,522
If it had been a promise,
it would've been for free.

640
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,898
I gave you what I had,

641
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,819
and you got everything you wanted.
Don't you agree?

642
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,576
We'll take care of our own matters.

643
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,787
It's not good for a detective
to know too much

644
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,955
about our line of work.

645
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,168
Jang Jae-gyeong was too careless.

646
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,922
I don't have anything else to tell you.

647
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,716
Since you're here,
give me something in return.

648
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,302
Do you know Kim Dae-seong?

649
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,305
He was arrested while dealing lemon pop.
Is he one of yours?

650
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,766
He works under Gong Jin-uk.

651
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,851
A little guy.

652
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,148
Locate Gong Jin-uk by this week
and let me know.

653
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,111
Kim Chang-su.

654
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,422
Here's this month's business expenses.

655
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,761
And finding Gong Jin-uk is your business.

656
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,722
Not mine.

657
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,978
Let's keep in touch
and help each other out when we can

658
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,980
and not just when we need something.

659
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,660
I forgot to ask him.

660
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,245
Excuse me?

661
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,789
That night…

662
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,001
when Doctor called.

663
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,757
I got excited
when he said he'd deal directly

664
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:28,595
and forgot to ask him why
he wanted me to drug Jang Jae-gyeong

665
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,557
and leave him at the subway station.

666
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,830
RESIDENTS DID NOT CONSENT
WE OPPOSE REDEVELOPMENT!

667
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,048
Jung Sang-ui.

668
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,852
It's me.

669
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,145
What is it?

670
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,398
KCSI tried to restore the server
that was found

671
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,525
at the rice mill murder scene,

672
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,694
but they couldn't.

673
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,281
They weren't able to find anything.

674
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,407
That's good.

675
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,036
I'm meeting with Mayor Joo
later this evening.

676
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,120
What?

677
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,913
Today?

678
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,418
Why so suddenly?

679
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,253
It just happened.

680
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,048
That jerk kept saying
there's no time, so…

681
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,720
What should I say to him?

682
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,597
What time are you meeting him?

683
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,223
At 8 p.m.

684
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,647
Okay, I'll get to Pilo-dong
at around 5 p.m.

685
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:03,940
Okay.

686
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,748
PROSECUTOR PARK TAE-JIN

687
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,214
What's all this?

688
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,716
They're photos of the taxis
that were in the alley

689
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,885
when the rice mill owner was murdered.

690
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,806
-Taxis?
-Yes, sir.

691
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,141
I was going to tell you before,

692
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,185
but I forgot to mention something.

693
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,521
On the day of the murder,

694
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,899
Jang Jae-gyeong said something to me.

695
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,819
He said the suspect must be a taxi driver

696
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,154
or that the accomplice is a taxi driver.

697
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:57,035
-What?
-I don't know what made him say that,

698
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,787
but he seemed very certain.

699
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,874
I'm not here
just because Jang Jae-gyeong said--

700
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,460
Isn't it important to know
why he said that?

701
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,213
Yes, sir.

702
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,297
So?

703
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,717
Are you done investigating?

704
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,468
Nothing particular came up.

705
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,182
Senior Inspector Yoo,
did you come here to chat?

706
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:24,104
I thought I should report everything
related to Jang Jae-gyeong.

707
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,776
Jang Jae-gyeong said

708
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,698
a taxi driver is the culprit
or at least an accomplice?

709
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,533
Yes, sir.

710
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,788
DRUG-FREE CLEAN CITY
ANHYEON CITY

711
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,417
Why not just tell me
instead of printing stuff out?

712
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,543
What if someone sees this?

713
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,086
It's a habit.

714
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,466
Mayor Joo graduated from Seoul University

715
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,510
and got his PhD from Stanford
on a government-funded scholarship.

716
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,512
He was also a professor
at a national university.

717
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,932
He entered the political arena in 2010
thanks to Assemblyman Jang Jeong-ho.

718
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:05,103
The center party regards him
as an expert in the bio sector.

719
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,939
They say he's ambitious
and has good administrative skills.

720
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,775
And his family background?

721
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,028
There's nothing worth mentioning.

722
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,198
-Any weaknesses?
-Nothing stood out.

723
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,158
But if I had to choose one…

724
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,494
Mayor Yoo Ui-jae of Hwanseong City

725
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,412
also wants to develop
a bioindustrial complex.

726
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,708
Unfortunately, they were in the same major
at the same university

727
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,918
and don't get along.

728
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,129
Our main strategy will be

729
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,756
to capitalize on their rivalry.

730
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,970
Does he like money?

731
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,223
Who doesn't?

732
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,936
How did it go with Vice President Han
of Igu Electronics?

733
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,272
He said he'd talk to his father.

734
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,567
Then don't reveal all your cards today.
Let's see how he reacts first.

735
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,820
Okay.

736
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,204
What is it?

737
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,497
Why are you here?

738
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,501
I told him to come.

739
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,217
KEUMHYUNG IS OUR SOLUTION
FOR TOMORROW

740
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,007
Park Jun-seo…

741
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,343
Did you kill him?

742
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,973
No.

743
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,936
But it looks like you know who killed him.

744
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,524
-I don't know.
-Then why did you go to Pilo-dong

745
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,736
at the time when Jun-seo died
on February 23rd?

746
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,740
It looks like you know I was there.

747
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,414
Then why haven't you arrested me?

748
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,250
Is it because you're not sure

749
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,586
that I killed Jun-seo?

750
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,129
I'm not in the mood for games.

751
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,424
Why did you go there?

752
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,384
Jun-seo told me to come.

753
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,011
He told you to come?

754
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,139
No.

755
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,808
Not just me.

756
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,437
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin,
and Oh Chi-hyeon.

757
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,357
He told us all to get there by 11:30 p.m.

758
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,526
What?

759
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,362
What…

760
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,406
What did this bastard just say?

761
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,241
You heard him.

762
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,118
Jung Yun-ho killed

763
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:08,954
the rice mill owner.

764
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,083
You…

765
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,251
Are you insane?

766
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,754
Are you insane, you bastard?

767
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,965
Jong-soo…

768
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,299
I had no choice.

769
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,969
-There was a CCTV camera--
-Why you!

770
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,474
Jong-soo!

771
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,017
Jong-soo.

772
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,896
Hey, Oh Chi-hyeon, I told you to make sure
he didn't cause trouble.

773
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,898
Is this what you call taking care of him?

774
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,276
Oh Chi-hyeon, you lied.

775
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,904
You knew, didn't you?

776
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,448
That he killed him.

777
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,790
Did you know?

778
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,751
Why didn't you tell me, you bastard?

779
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,463
You heard what he said today.

780
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,882
If this doesn't work,
it won't just be the end of me.

781
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,885
Do you think Won Chang-ho
will stop after he's done with me?

782
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,847
It'll be over for all of you idiots too!

783
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,685
How could you make such a mess of things?

784
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,062
And you guys call yourselves my friend?

785
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,230
Answer me.

786
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,190
Jong-soo, calm down.

787
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,358
You get over here.

788
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,029
Jong-soo!

789
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
You damn…

790
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,783
This won't change anything, so calm down.

791
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,493
And what did you do, you bastard?

792
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,788
Why did you let things get to this point?

793
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,415
Jong-soo…

794
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,916
Hey, just kill this bastard.

795
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,712
Kill him and bury him
so that nobody finds out.

796
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,796
Got it?

797
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,841
Let's do that.

798
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,388
Let's kill him.

799
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,478
The thing I was afraid of the most

800
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,646
was whether we were caught on that camera.

801
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,900
Regardless of whether
he knew what he was doing,

802
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,110
the server was burned completely.

803
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,154
When I checked with the police,

804
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,449
they didn't have any evidence
pointing at Jung Yun-ho.

805
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,284
But…

806
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,871
The biggest cause
of our anxiety still remains.

807
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,707
So let's kill him.

808
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,005
You're right.

809
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,757
Burying him is the best way.

810
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,552
After all, dead men don't tell tales.

811
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,638
Right?

812
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,602
I won't say anything.

813
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,062
I swear!

814
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,940
Tae-jin,

815
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,235
I'll live so quietly
that you won't even know I'm alive.

816
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,988
Jong-soo.

817
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,074
I swear I'll live like that.

818
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,118
You won't even know I'm alive.

819
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,455
-Jung Yun-ho.
-Yes?

820
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,587
I was just kidding.

821
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,841
Get up.

822
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,759
Hey, it's not easy to kill a friend.

823
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,845
And Si-jeong shouldn't become a widow.

824
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,054
Right?

825
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,767
By the way,

826
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,935
Yun-ho…

827
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,147
I'm going to keep an eye on you.

828
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,526
So let's call it a day
on this matter, okay?

829
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:28,945
Okay.

830
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,030
Got it.

831
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,451
Hey.

832
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,620
Make sure I never see this bastard again.

833
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,415
Don't even bring up his name. Got it?

834
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,959
Got it.

835
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,254
Get lost, you bastard.

836
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,645
So, Jun-seo's call history

837
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,231
with Won Jong-soo,
Park Tae-jin, and Oh Chi-hyeon

838
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,776
were calls telling them to meet him
at that spot at 11:30 p.m.?

839
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,195
Yes.

840
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,489
But why didn't he call you?

841
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,741
I didn't see your name.

842
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,244
Why did you go there
when you weren't invited?

843
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,332
I was there when Jun-seo
made his last call to them.

844
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,708
You were next to him?

845
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:28,588
Then did you hear what he said
to those three guys?

846
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,716
No.

847
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,053
He made the call outside,
so I don't know exactly what he said.

848
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,721
But I know he called those three.

849
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,991
What are you going to do?

850
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,702
What's there to say after all this time?

851
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:03,039
I want you to be there at 11:30 p.m. too.

852
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,126
They won't just sit back and watch.
It's too dangerous.

853
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,753
I still have to do it.

854
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,589
This might be

855
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:13,758
my last chance.

856
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,558
That's why I went there at 11:30 p.m.

857
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,018
There was nowhere to park,

858
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,020
so I took a cab
and got off at the main road.

859
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,293
I arrived about ten minutes early,

860
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,044
but I wasn't the first to get there.

861
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,963
Who are you?

862
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,049
Jung Sang-ui?

863
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,343
Hey, Tae-jin.

864
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,762
Did Jun-seo tell you to come too?

865
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,973
Yes.

866
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,185
That looks like a switch.

867
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,312
Can you turn it on?

868
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,063
Okay.

869
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,324
It worked.

870
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,589
What's this?

871
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,091
Did he tell you to come too?

872
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,929
And Park Jun-seo?

873
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,723
Where was he at the time?

874
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,228
-Up.
-Up?

875
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,398
He was on the ninth floor.

876
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,109
So you went to the ninth floor
and met Jun-seo there?

877
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,782
First floor.

878
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,037
I met him on the first floor.

879
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,491
BEWARE OF FALLING OBJECTS

880
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,993
But at the time,

881
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,162
none of them

882
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,247
saw it.

883
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,971

888
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,859
Salute the teacher.

889
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,611
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

890
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,324
That punk, Gyeong-tae…

891
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,034
-Class president!
-Yes, sir?

892
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,537
Tell Gyeong-tae
it doesn't matter if he's suspended

893
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,874
and that he should at least
come to the teachers' office!

894
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,959
At any rate, he needs to graduate!

895
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,795
Doesn't he want to graduate?

896
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,671
Understood, sir.

897
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:25,426
And you have midterm exams next week.

898
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,971
You'd better be well-prepared!

899
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,097
Got it?

900
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,265
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

901
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:34,894
Jeez, Gyeong-tae that punk…

902
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:39,857
I like studying in the club room
because it feels like studying at a café.

903
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,734
You're staying until 10 p.m. again, right?

904
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,444
That's the plan,

905
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,780
but I can't focus because of the music.

906
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:46,948
Do you want earplugs?

907
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,869
-Hey, Jun-seo.
-Hey.

908
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,622
My tutor said to come over today
to review the key points for the exam.

909
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,460
Let's go together.

910
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,297
I've made plans to study
in the club room with these guys.

911
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,715
Jun-seo.

912
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,593
-I'll go next time.
-Okay.

913
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,929
Let's go.

914
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,568
There's a witness who saw a taxi
on the day of the incident.

915
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:08,487
We'll have to look into
all of the taxis in this footage.

916
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,574
Are we forming
some joint investigation unit?

917
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,326
Are you saying

918
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,245
you want me to pretend to be a druggie?

919
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,914
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

920
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,832
Do any suspects come to mind?

921
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,585
Someone reported seeing
a taxi driver washing blood off his hands.

922
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,337
Park Jun-seo committed suicide.

923
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,547
Are you creating an alibi
for your friends?

924
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,675
Why did Jun-seo go out of his way
to apologize and keep people quiet?

925
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,344
I asked who you are!

926
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,970
-Jung Sang-ui!
-Tell me now!

927
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:34,680
I really don't know!

928
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,183
This is your last chance. Tell me now.

929
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,436
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin,
and Jung Sang-ui were all together.

930
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,688
Did you know
there was a CCTV camera there?

931
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,315
Why did you kill Park Jun-seo?

932
01:05:44,398 --> 01:05:45,983
I'm sorry. I really am.

933
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,777
Forgive me.

934
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:55,868
