1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,973
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,979
Has the medicine stopped working?

3
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,659
Let me know if you need more,
and I'll get you some.

4
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,748
I take eight pills now,
but it doesn't help.

5
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,458
Eight pills?

6
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,588
Hey, they say you can't take
more than five pills.

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,881
It'll ruin your liver.

8
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,132
I know.

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,969
How'd you know I was here?

10
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,806
I was wondering what fools
would fight in a hospital,

11
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,057
but it was you two.

12
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,184
You didn't come for Choi Ji-yeon?

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,644
Choi Ji-yeon?

14
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,729
Jung Yun-ho went to see Choi Ji-yeon.

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,648
What happened?

16
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,068
She sustained injuries,
but they're not life-threatening.

17
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,820
But she needs more tests.

18
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,951
What's wrong with Jung Yun-ho?

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,995
Is he the same guy we knew before?

20
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,251
Hey, you shouldn't be here.

21
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,753
Take a taxi and go home for now.

22
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,255
Get some sleep.

23
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,715
I came to meet the doctor

24
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,385
who treated Jun-seo's daughter.

25
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,138
She went into emergency surgery
and won't be done until morning.

26
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,266
I'll call if anything happens
to Choi Ji-yeon.

27
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,686
I'm sure Yun-ho won't show up here.

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,079
Hey.

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,623
Why did you call me here
when we just saw each other?

30
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,333
I'm meeting Mayor Joo tomorrow.

31
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,253
Yun-ho can't have been arrested, right?

32
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,134
Did you get someone to follow Tae-jin?

33
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,219
Yes.

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,769
Why did you call us here again?

35
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,563
What did Jung Yun-ho do?

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,482
Jung Yun-ho

37
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,403
tried to kill Jun-seo's wife but failed,
and now he's on the run.

38
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,323
He tried to kill whom?

39
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,408
He's out of control for some reason.

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,619
He won't answer my calls either.

41
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,289
This is why I said
we should take care of him.

42
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,124
It's out of my hands now.

43
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,877
Are you saying it's my fault
Jung Yun-ho is acting like this?

44
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,838
Is killing a friend
and burying him a joke to you?

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,382
I told you it'd be over
if we missed this chance.

46
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,551
Drastic times call for drastic measures.

47
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,304
What now?

48
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,931
If we leave Jung Yun-ho like this,

49
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,766
he'll get caught in two days.

50
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,517
That damn bastard.

51
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
This is a crucial time for me!

52
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,857
I got a call from Yun-ho.

53
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,277
What? When?

54
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,321
About two hours ago.

55
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,324
But he talked as if he'd heard a recording

56
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,370
of our conversation earlier.

57
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,747
A recording?

58
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,958
From inside here?

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,253
You said you set up a device
to prevent that from happening.

60
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,422
You told me to turn it off
because of the high-frequency sound.

61
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,302
So?

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,179
What did you two talk about?

63
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,890
He knew we wanted him dead
and refused to go down alone.

64
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,975
But you know,

65
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,936
Yun-ho said something weird.

66
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,730
He said it was all you.

67
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,401
And that we were getting played by you.

68
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,403
Youâ€¦

69
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,115
He's lost his mind now that he's cornered.

70
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,199
Hey.

71
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,869
Did you really have an affair
with Jun-seo's wife?

72
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,666
What?

73
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,002
Wait a second.

74
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,045
You had an affair with whom?

75
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,007
It looks like Yun-ho's right.

76
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,301
Did you want him dead to cover that up?

77
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,221
But is that something

78
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,725
worth killing a person over
just to cover it up?

79
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,813
That's right.

80
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,607
I was with Jun-seo's wife. So what?

81
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,776
Hey, you bastard.

82
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,696
What are you saying?

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,699
Did you really kill Park Jun-seo?

84
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,504
Hello?

85
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,506
Jong-soo, it's me. Yun-ho.

86
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,887
Hello?

87
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,102
Go ahead.

88
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,729
Jong-soo.

89
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,939
Jong-soo, please help me.

90
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,110
There's no other choice.
It's all up to you now.

91
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,946
What do you mean?

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,699
I felt really let down too.

93
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,910
Park Tae-jin.

94
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,870
That bastard is a really bad guy.

95
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,330
Did you know that?

96
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,249
Did you know
that bastard's trying to kill me?

97
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,169
Why would Tae-jin do that?

98
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,630
To cover up his affair
with Jun-seo's wife?

99
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,048
So you already know.

100
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,258
That's right.

101
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,929
That bitch
and that bastard killed Jun-seo.

102
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,223
I went to his house to get proof,

103
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,266
but I couldn't find it

104
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,769
because the police showed up
right at that moment.

105
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
So?

106
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,857
You need to scare Tae-jin.

107
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,235
Tell him you know everything.

108
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,487
And tell him you know he killed Jun-seo

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,073
and to help me get out of this somehow.

110
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,200
Right, Oh Chi-hyeon.

111
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,868
Don't tell Oh Chi-hyeon.

112
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,913
I think that bastard is
working with Park Tae-jin.

113
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,541
Is that so?

114
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,876
That's right. Look, Jong-soo.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,963
You can do anything.

116
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,216
You're the future chairman of KH Group.

117
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,594
There's nothing you can't do.

118
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,766
What if I tell you that I can't do that?
What happens then?

119
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,533
Then you leave me with no choice.

120
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,372
I'll have to tell the world
how you ordered Lee Myeong-guk

121
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,875
to make the drugs you're taking

122
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,043
and how you ordered me to kill him

123
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,838
when he started threatening you.

124
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,383
When did I ever tell you
to kill Lee Myeong-guk?

125
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,843
Jong-soo.

126
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,053
We've been friends for a long time.

127
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:56,267
I can just tell by the look in your eyes
what it is you want.

128
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,519
You dumb bastard.

129
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,315
If I hadn't killed Lee Myeong-guk,
he would've kept you on a leash.

130
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,399
Yun-ho.

131
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,776
Can't you justâ€¦

132
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,654
Can't you just go into hiding?

133
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,364
Do you really have to do this?

134
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,742
I'm 40 years old, you punk.

135
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,535
How am I supposed to go into hiding?

136
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,663
What about Si-jeong and my kids?

137
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,000
I bought some land
because of the Pilo-dong project.

138
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,085
We're all in the same boat, you punk!

139
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,547
Did you forget the classroom creed?

140
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,468
"We will be helpful to our friends!"

141
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,264
Where are you?

142
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,976
I heard what you said,
so let's talk in person.

143
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,145
Shall we?

144
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,564
Okay, let's do that.

145
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,066
Tell me where to go,

146
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,652
and I'll be there right away.

147
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,904
I'll get back to you,
so don't turn off your phone.

148
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,573
Got it. Get back to me right away, okay?

149
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,408
The police--

150
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,591
Just how much

151
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,803
of what Yun-ho said is true?

152
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,930
I just told you.

153
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,225
I admit to having an affair
with Jun-seo's wife. That's it.

154
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,987
What is it?

155
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,323
Do you really think I killed Jun-seo?

156
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,453
If that's what you guys think,

157
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,415
I'm disappointed in you.

158
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,377
I'd understand if you cursed me out
for having an affair with a friend's wife.

159
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,796
But you should know me better
than to think I'd kill Jun-seo

160
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,880
over something like this.

161
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,924
Would I choose a woman

162
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,260
over everything else to start over with?

163
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,053
Why would I do that?

164
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,557
If that wasn't it,

165
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,228
then why didn't you get involved
in Jun-seo's investigation?

166
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,355
That's what I would've done.

167
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,067
You don't still believe
it was a suicide, do you?

168
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,362
You're right. It could've been murder.

169
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,323
But why should I bother?

170
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,659
Jang Jae-gyeong has
already talked to all of you.

171
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,330
He's investigating for me instead
to get that insurance payout.

172
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,422
Won Jong-soo.

173
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,926
As if bossing Jun-seo around
for 20 years wasn't enough,

174
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,762
you made him deliver drugs too.

175
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,306
You baited him with five million won
for his daughter's medicine

176
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,183
and made him hit rock bottom.

177
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,853
Jun-seo probably called you
and said he'd tell everyone

178
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,230
about the drug manufacturing
at Yeongryun Cold Storage,

179
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,608
the weekly drug deliveries
you made him do,

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,403
and how you can't go
more than three days without drugs.

181
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,238
He said he'd tell the whole world.

182
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,493
That's why you came
to the construction site that night.

183
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,577
Jong-soo.

184
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,915
Be honest. You wanted to kill Jun-seo.

185
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,793
Shut up.

186
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,877
Orâ€¦

187
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,589
-Was it you?
-What?

188
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,926
I guess you couldn't
bring yourself to kill a friend

189
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,804
seeing how you made someone else do it.

190
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,847
Stop talking nonsense.

191
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,682
You said Jun-seo
was going to tell the police

192
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,727
that you killed Lee Myeong-guk.

193
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,021
That's why you went
to the construction site.

194
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,565
You said it yourself.
Are you going back on your words?

195
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,985
You weren't even close to Jun-seo either.

196
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,115
What about you? Why did you go there?

197
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,700
What did Jun-seo say to make you show up?

198
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,789
This is it.

199
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,416
What?

200
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,127
I said this is it.

201
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,797
This is what he wanted
when Park Jun-seo died

202
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,050
and left the payout
to Jang Jae-gyeong and Oh Yun-jin.

203
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,429
He wanted us to get suspicious
and be at each other's throats!

204
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,013
Hey.

205
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,224
The three of us here

206
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,601
have plenty of reasons
to kill Park Jun-seo.

207
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,478
So now what?

208
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,983
What should we do?

209
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,192
Tell me.

210
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,738
What's the point of fighting each other
to find out who killed Jun-seo?

211
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,617
Get it together, you bastards.

212
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,704
Jung Yun-ho is
the fire we need to put out.

213
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,372
It's not Lee Myeong-guk or Park Jun-seo!

214
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,458
Do you understand?

215
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,725
Where do I tell him to come?

216
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,564
It should be somewhere convenient for you

217
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,025
since you have to take care of it.

218
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,903
Jong-sooâ€¦

219
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,348
327Y 5739

220
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,203
Jong-soo--

221
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,959
Chi-hyeon!

222
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,712
What are you doing?

223
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,089
Hey, Chi-hyeon. Don't do this.

224
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,510
It's Park Tae-jin. It was all him!

225
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,095
-Just die quietly.
-Hey!

226
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,432
It was all Park Tae-jin!
It was Park Tae-jin!

227
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,310
Chi-hyeon, you can't do this.

228
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,979
This isn't right.
We can't do this to each other.

229
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,232
This is why

230
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,151
I told you to stay put.

231
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,696
Why do you keep doing things
I never told you to do?

232
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,032
I was just trying my best to help!

233
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,326
I wanted to help.

234
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,619
I had to do something

235
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,829
to get Jong-soo's attention!

236
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,291
Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.

237
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,710
Chi-hyeon.

238
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,837
Chi-hyeon, what'll happen to Si-jeong?

239
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,881
What'll happen to my kids if I die?

240
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,425
What about Yeong-eun and Yeong-ji?

241
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,135
-What about Yeong-eun and Yeong-ji?
-Be quiet.

242
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,637
Turn your head.

243
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
Keep still!

244
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,017
Hey, do you think those bastards
consider you a friend?

245
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,477
You know they don't!

246
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,479
Those bastards

247
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,607
only call you when they need something!

248
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,193
Come on, Chi-hyeon.

249
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,278
Chi-hyeon,

250
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,280
I wanted to be like you.

251
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,950
They never asked me to do anything.

252
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,370
They never asked me to do anything!

253
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,122
So I thought if I tried hard enough,

254
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,708
I could go to the Pilo-dong hideout.

255
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,960
I just wanted

256
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,712
-to be part of the gang!
-You stupid bastard.

257
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,090
I just wanted it to be like

258
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,509
back in the old days, Chi-hyeon.

259
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,512
Chi-hyeon, please don't!

260
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
Hello.

261
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,647
Is Dr. Park Eun-yeong out of surgery now?

262
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,440
I came by yesterdayâ€¦

263
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,859
Doctor!

264
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,326
In the letter,

265
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,538
you said Yun-hui
could've been cured in the US.

266
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,331
What did you mean by that?

267
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,542
The medication Yun-hui was on

268
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,294
was expensive
and not covered by insurance.

269
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,090
At best, it only prevented
the symptoms from getting worse.

270
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,342
Then I got a call from the US

271
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,512
saying they wanted to try
a recently developed new drug.

272
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,890
Why didn't they go?

273
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,144
Because of the costs.

274
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,521
How much was it?

275
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,899
Five hundred million won.

276
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,487
Mr. Park said he'd put together
the money no matter what

277
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,240
and begged me to stall
for a chance at the treatment.

278
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,076
But Yun-hui

279
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,746
couldn't hold on that long.

280
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,777
Youâ€¦

281
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,362
You died here today, got it?

282
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
Don't ever show your face again.

283
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,620
Don't even think about
seeing Si-jeong and the kids.

284
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
This is where

285
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,625
our friendship ends.

286
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,560
Classroom creed!

287
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,605
First!

288
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,527
"We will always fulfill our duties!"

289
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,904
Second!

290
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,786
"We will stay true to our goals!"

291
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,956
Third!

292
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,919
"We will be helpful

293
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,715
to our friends!"

294
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,682
Here we go.

295
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,930
ANHYEON STREAM

296
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,729
Sir?

297
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,023
Is your arm okay?

298
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
Yes, it's fine.

299
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,943
That's such a relief.

300
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,698
Section Chief Jung got called in
by the senior superintendent this morning.

301
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,617
I think she got chewed out.

302
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,583
-You're back.
-Yes, ma'am.

303
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,376
What did the doctor say?

304
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,088
He said I sprained my wrist
and to take it easy for a few days.

305
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,174
You're lucky.

306
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,593
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

307
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,595
Don't worry about it.

308
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,556
You go through
all sorts of things as a cop.

309
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,518
Thanks to you,
I almost got hit by the chief,

310
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,604
but it is what it is.

311
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,439
It's because I'm lacking.

312
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,118
Where's Captain?

313
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,454
He's not back yet
and isn't answering his phone.

314
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,705
-Really?
-Yes.

315
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,928
PARK JUN-SEO

316
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,326
What's the passcode?

317
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,744
Zero.

318
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,037
-Okay.
-Five.

319
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,163
-Five?
-Zero, two.

320
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,379
Jae-gyeong!

321
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,888
Jang Jae-gyeong.

322
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,391
Jae-gyeong!

323
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,727
Jae-gyeong, snap out of it.

324
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,312
Jang Jae-gyeong!

325
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,396
Jae-gyeong.

326
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,732
Get it together!

327
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,110
What do I do? Jae-gyeong.

328
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,825
Drink some water.

329
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,288
Jae-gyeong.

330
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,082
Please pull it together.

331
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,918
The pillâ€¦

332
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
My walletâ€¦

333
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,507
Okay.

334
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,901
There was lemon pop here, right?

335
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,402
I had no other choice.

336
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,030
What will you do if it happens again?

337
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,907
Will you take more?

338
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,618
Yes.

339
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,088
Hey, Straw. What's going on?

340
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,967
Okay.

341
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,345
Right.

342
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,097
Got it.

343
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,015
Text me the details.

344
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,434
Okay, thanks.

345
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,728
Samsol Port in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi.

346
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,355
Jangju Port in Dangjin, South Chungcheong.

347
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,982
Manpyeong Port in Seosan,
South Chungcheong.

348
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,736
Straw says someone will be smuggled out
from one of these three ports

349
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,863
at 4 a.m. two days from now.

350
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,448
It'll be hard to cover them all at once

351
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,908
because they're far apart.

352
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,452
Straw can't get
any more information, right?

353
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,412
Even though one of our people

354
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,624
leaked information
about wanting to stow away,

355
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,126
they seem very cautious.

356
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,503
Ask the Coast Guard
for cooperation for now

357
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,046
and receive internal help

358
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,549
-to cover all the ports.
-Yes, ma'am.

359
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,159
What happened? Why are you here?

360
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,250
Did youâ€¦

361
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,649
How long did I sleep?

362
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
Two hours.

363
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,111
What time is it now?

364
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,656
It's 2:30 p.m.

365
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,474
Manpyeong Port in front of the Manyang.

366
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,100
Two days from now at 4 a.m.

367
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,114
Where are you? Is everything okay?

368
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,117
Ma'am, did Straw send you any information?

369
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,202
Yes, he did.

370
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,789
There are three ports,
but I don't know which one.

371
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,374
Is Manpyeong Port one of them?

372
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,919
Yes. How did you know?

373
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,796
It's that one. Two days from now at 4 a.m.

374
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,048
Okay. Let me look into it.

375
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,216
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,598
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,228
I know

378
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,564
how hard you tried to hold outâ€¦

379
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,777
But I didn't know what else to do.

380
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,953
It's okay.

381
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,333
It must've been a tough call to make.

382
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,588
I'm sure you made
the best decision you could for me.

383
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,553
How's Jun-seo's wife?

384
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,931
She's okay.

385
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,517
She seemed to regret what she did.

386
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,436
She couldn't stop crying.

387
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,398
I almost forgot.

388
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,192
I'll text you the address

389
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,653
of the old lady living in Boryeong.

390
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,946
You remember her, right?

391
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,365
The one receiving
Jun-seo's pension payments.

392
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,575
Yes.

393
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,744
When shall we go to Boryeong?

394
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,371
I'll have to step out first.

395
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,497
Right.

396
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,125
Are you going to the station?

397
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,877
No.

398
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,255
-I'm going to see Jung Sang-ui.
-Sang-ui?

399
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,342
Park Tae-jin's a prosecutor.

400
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,386
It'll be hard to investigate him
because he's too cautious,

401
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,431
so I want to try going through
Jung Sang-ui to get to Park Tae-jin.

402
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,686
Do you want to come with me?

403
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,149
What gives?

404
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,486
I'm a little nervous about driving.

405
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,988
Okay then.

406
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,496
Meet me at Myeongeul Garden
tomorrow at 4 p.m.

407
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,887
Hello?

408
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,305
I got you passage on a ship.

409
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,267
It leaves two days from now
from Manpyeong Port at 4 a.m.

410
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,769
Thank you.

411
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,897
If you leave now,
you won't be able to return.

412
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,399
Aren't you curious about me?

413
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,025
Excuse me?

414
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,198
I'm Park Tae-jin.

415
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,784
Don't you remember me
from early last year?

416
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,704
Come on, you saw me.

417
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,541
I'm Prosecutor Park Tae-jin
of Anhyeon DPO.

418
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,754
1 YEAR AGO
JANUARY 2023

419
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,964
Mr. Gong Jin-uk.

420
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,510
You served six months two years ago
for running a hostess business.

421
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,513
You're here on the same charge again.

422
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,312
What's this?

423
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,606
Take a look.

424
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,445
This is our second time
making a deal through a flash drive.

425
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,741
Didn't I decide not to prosecute you
and let you go that last time?

426
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,578
I saw all the photos on the flash drive.

427
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,748
I noticed many of your secret clients

428
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,250
include powerful and arrogant people.

429
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:14,794
Are you really

430
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,505
Prosecutor Park Tae-jin?

431
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
Yes, that's right.

432
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,302
I'm Doctor.

433
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,480
Mr. Gong, did you ever wonder
why you were chosen as Doctor's seller?

434
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,815
After all, you'd never sold drugs before

435
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,442
nor had the skills to do so.

436
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,865
I figured it would actually be
more difficult to control

437
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,617
an old hand like CEO Yoon.

438
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:50,079
That is, it might have been
too risky for me to deal

439
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,581
with CEO Yoon directly.

440
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,875
So that's why

441
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,086
I decided to recruit someone like you

442
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,340
who was smart, loyal,
and not afraid to use some muscle.

443
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,551
At least it was more fun
than running a hostess business, right?

444
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,097
Why are you telling me this, sir?

445
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,768
I said it's because once you leave,
you won't be returning.

446
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,645
Why? What is it?

447
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,814
Do you want to report me to the police?

448
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,901
But who will believe
that I made and sold drugs?

449
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,778
No, I justâ€¦

450
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,280
It's not that, sir.

451
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,368
Everything's confusing right now.

452
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,537
I'm sure it is.

453
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,038
Anyway, take care of yourself.

454
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,000
Go to the Manpyeong Port docks
two days from now at 4 a.m.

455
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,253
Wait in front of the Manyang,
and someone will come for you.

456
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,964
Yes, Prosecutor Park.
What about the drugs--

457
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,298
It was good doing business with you.

458
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,900
KH GROUP

459
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,073
-It's Jung Sang-ui.
-What?

460
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,283
-Turn the car around.
-Okay.

461
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:30,972
I'll be outside.

462
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,640
Hey.

463
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,184
Yun-hoâ€¦

464
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,812
didn't say much before he died, right?

465
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,357
It doesn't matter anymore.

466
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,033
If a bio-industrial complex is built,

467
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,286
Anhyeon New City will transform
into a future-oriented city

468
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,496
that integrates industry and housing.

469
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,040
As you've seen in the proposal,

470
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,126
we've already secured
the funds for this project.

471
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,086
I don't have any questions.

472
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,880
However,

473
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,259
the proposal was presented
as if you had made a great decision

474
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,011
for the good of Anhyeon City.

475
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,723
But what you're really saying is
in exchange for a bio-industrial complex,

476
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,225
you want permission to develop
Pilo-dong into a housing site

477
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,062
which is three times
the size of the complex.

478
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,607
Why else would Igu Group care enough

479
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,317
to invest in Anhyeon City?

480
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,069
It's because they gain something from it.

481
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,781
Let's do it.

482
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,826
Yes, sir.

483
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,829
Thank you.

484
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,373
-I look forward to it.
-Thank you, sir.

485
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,223
Well done.

486
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,685
I told you it'd turn out fine.

487
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,441
-Hey, over there--
-Straight ahead.

488
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,943
Okay.

489
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,695
MYEONGEUL GARDEN

490
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,946
Turn around and park over here.

491
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,572
Stay here.

492
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,837
-What is it?
-The room next door is occupied.

493
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,342
Let's go outside and go around the back.

494
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,206
Hey, that's Park Tae-jin.

495
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,625
Why are those two meeting here?

496
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,920
Do you think Jung Sang-ui

497
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,049
took over Park Jun-seo's role
in the lemon pop business?

498
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,515
The windows are closed,
so it'll be hard to eavesdrop.

499
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,813
What's that?

500
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,441
Now do you know why I carry a big bag?

501
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,610
Do you always have this on you?

502
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,736
Listen.

503
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,886
Does he have connections in China?

504
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes, that's what he said.

505
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,473
Never mind that for now.

506
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,977
Remember when we met up in Pilo-dong,

507
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,020
and I asked you to step out for a bit?

508
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,690
Yes.

509
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,192
Did you record our conversation?

510
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,155
No.

511
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,739
Really?

512
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,992
But then

513
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,745
how did Yun-ho know what we talked about?

514
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,747
According to Chi-hyeon,

515
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,500
Yun-ho called as if he had heard
a recorded conversation.

516
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,211
There's no reason why

517
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:16,007
we would record our conversation
and let Yun-ho listen to it, right?

518
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,011
Are you suspecting me of doing that?

519
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,512
Someone once said

520
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,932
we should always fulfill our duties.

521
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,062
Sang-ui, not all friends are equal.

522
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,774
If Jun-seo hadn't felt sorry for you
and made you class secretary,

523
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,902
we never would've even talked.

524
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,655
You always got beaten up,
didn't speak well,

525
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,699
and couldn't read the room at all.

526
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,452
That's the type of kid you were.

527
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,412
If Jun-seo hadn't protected you,

528
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,665
do you think you would've
made it through school?

529
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,335
Are things different now than before?

530
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,046
What will you do now?

531
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,757
Jun-seo isn't here anymore.

532
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,175
You should be good to me,

533
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,802
but instead, you're telling
Jang Jae-gyeong everything.

534
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,473
And now you're pitting
Jung Yun-ho against me.

535
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,351
Hey, it wasn't me.

536
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,727
Don't lie.

537
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,940
You got me the burner phone
that I gave Jung Yun-ho.

538
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,943
Who else can call that number
other than us two?

539
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,447
Sang-ui.

540
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,953
Do you have a problem with me?

541
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,997
I don't have any feelings toward you.

542
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,000
I didn't do anything
when everyone else bullied you.

543
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,419
So why are you doing this to me?

544
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
Is it because you think I killed Jun-seo?

545
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,177
Are you getting revenge for him?

546
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,930
Jun-seo said

547
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,183
he'd stop after making 500 million won.

548
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,436
Once he made enough
to take Yun-hui to the US,

549
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,063
he said he'd stop selling lemon pop.

550
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,648
But he couldn't in the end.

551
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,693
Whose fault is that?

552
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,614
You're recording this too, right?

553
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,409
-What?
-Give it to me.

554
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,911
Give me your phone.

555
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,415
You punk.

556
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,669
Heyâ€¦

557
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,337
Tae-jinâ€¦

558
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,173
Hey.

559
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,801
Tae-jin, Iâ€¦

560
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,096
-You bastard.
-Tae-jin.

561
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,347
How dare you record me?

562
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,522
Hey, get up.

563
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,982
-I said get up.
-Okay.

564
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,152
Sit down.

565
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,369
I didn't kill Park Jun-seo. Satisfied?

566
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,791
I don't know what it is
you're trying to find out,

567
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,670
but if you do something like this again,
you won't get away with it.

568
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,089
This is my last warning.

569
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,177
Hey, Sang-ui.

570
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,803
Look.

571
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,391
As long as we continue to work hard
and do our part like we've always done,

572
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,768
everything will be fine.

573
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,895
Got it?

574
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,189
Yes.

575
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,775
Okay. Let's eat then.

576
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,735
We should finish our meal.

577
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,579
What's this?

578
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,873
Take a look at it.
You'll remember what it is.

579
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,518
You're Doctor?

580
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,729
-What do you mean?
-Did you make the lemon pop?

581
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,482
I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,277
You and Lee Myeong-guk
often met up after work near Pilo-dong.

583
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,781
Yeongryun Cold Storage
is the factory, right?

584
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,325
If Lee Myeong-guk
used to make the lemon pop,

585
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,910
are you making it now?

586
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,746
Damn it. Hold on.

587
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,914
Hey, Jung Sang-ui.

588
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:20,668
Jun-seo wanted to take Yun-hui
to the US for treatment.

589
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,337
He said he'd stop selling lemon pop
after making 500 million won.

590
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,756
If he failed because of Tae-jin,

591
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,050
it means Tae-jin didn't tell him
the other four digits,

592
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,719
so he couldn't get the cash
made from the drug sales.

593
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,388
Am I wrong?

594
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,683
You guys

595
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,185
are a reporter and a cop,

596
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,104
but you act the same.

597
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,482
-What?
-You must be really frustrated.

598
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,612
You have suspicions
but no real proof, is that it?

599
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,200
What are you doing?

600
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,829
I said what are you doing?

601
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,330
If you're curious, put your seat belt on.

602
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,568
They're with me.

603
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,004
Hold your breath.
Don't breathe in the cold air.

604
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,732
Is this where you make lemon pop?

605
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,401
Yes.

606
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,620
And Jong-soo?

607
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,749
Does Jong-soo know
you made lemon pop and sold it?

608
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,629
No, there's no need for him
to get into the drug business.

609
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,590
He just needs it
for recreational purposes.

610
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,758
Like you said,

611
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,012
Manager Lee Myeong-guk
discovered the drug property,

612
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,932
and Jong-soo is still taking the drug

613
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,475
that was first made from it.

614
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,978
Butâ€¦

615
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,439
I'm the one who made lemon pop.

616
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,150
Well, I did use Manager Lee's recipe.

617
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,367
Why bring us here and tell us all this?

618
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,579
I'm the one who got you
addicted to lemon pop.

619
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,250
Hey, Jung Sang-ui.

620
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,044
Why?

621
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,798
Because I don't like you.

622
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,434
-Why?
-Jae-gyeong!

623
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,437
-Jang Jae-gyeong!
-Why?

624
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,823
Let me go.

625
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,308
You did well.

626
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,895
I was worried about
whether you could pull it off,

627
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,898
but I underestimated my own son.

628
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,904
Mayor Joo In-sang just called me.

629
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,658
He said you convinced him.

630
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,453
Yes, Father.

631
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,499
That seat

632
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,501
now belongs to you.

633
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,753
So don't be nervous anymore

634
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,214
and be confident.

635
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,424
I'm well aware

636
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,428
that you felt inferior to Tae-jin.

637
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,224
You don't need to feel that way now.

638
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,476
Tae-jin and everyone else

639
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,188
have existed only for you.

640
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,192
They can be easily replaced,

641
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,944
but not you.

642
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,612
Being the son of Won Chang-ho

643
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,031
isn't a position

644
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,952
you can have just because you want it.

645
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,207
Come over here.

646
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:57,754
Sit down.

647
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,593
Sit.

648
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:04,970
Yes, sir.

649
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:16,482
Once the permit is finalizedâ€¦

650
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,610
let's get you some help.

651
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,654
Excuse me?

652
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,866
The future chairman of KH Group

653
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,912
can't continue to depend on drugs.

654
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,210
Yes, Father.

655
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,796
For now,

656
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,883
I'll look after this seat for you.

657
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,808
I'm ready to take a step back now.

658
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,523
So get your treatment and return soon.

659
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,195
Yes, Father. I'll do that.

660
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,162
Sir.

661
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,997
Congratulations on your promotion.

662
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,708
-Excuse me?
-You haven't heard?

663
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,126
Personnel appointments
were just announced.

664
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,263
PERSONNEL TRANSFER LIST

665
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,683
PARK TAE-JIN
CRIMINAL AFFAIRS BUREAU

666
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,337
Is there an antidote for lemon pop?

667
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,340
No.

668
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,885
Jae-gyeong, that's enough.

669
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,180
I know you're angry.

670
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,224
But there's no point in going after him.

671
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,564
Are you the one

672
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,191
who has been delivering drugs
to Jae-gyeong?

673
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,945
-Yes.
-What about 1-8-8-2?

674
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,698
You said only you
and Jun-seo knew about it.

675
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,701
So how did you find out?

676
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,831
Twenty years ago,

677
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:42,252
after I'd gotten beaten up,
Jun-seo told me it meant SOS.

678
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,840
He said to use it in an emergency
to call Jae-gyeong.

679
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,093
What have I ever done to you?

680
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,389
What did I do to deserve
becoming an addict?

681
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,769
Stop smiling and answer me!

682
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,068
Our senior year,

683
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,821
before Jun-seo started
hanging out with you guys,

684
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:14,660
I was Jun-seo's only true friend,
and he was mine.

685
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,497
But after hanging out
with you for a while,

686
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,998
he just ignored me.

687
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,084
That's how

688
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,795
you guys took Jun-seo away from me.

689
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,547
And that's why I really hated you guys.

690
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,633
Hey, what are you talking about?

691
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,260
We didn't take anyone away.

692
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,595
We were all classmates.

693
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,681
Let me finish talking. I'm almost done.

694
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,812
When Chae Gyeong-tae died,

695
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,647
Jae-gyeong got transferred.

696
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,731
Jun-seo.

697
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:50,028
You and Jun-seo broke up
after the Audiophile club room incident.

698
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,658
After that, Jun-seo and I
got along great for over 20 years.

699
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,202
Despite how

700
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,497
Won Jong-soo, Park Tae-jin,
Oh Chi-hyeon, and Jung Yun-hoâ€¦

701
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,581
XINOPAM

702
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,127
â€¦had ordered around Jun-seo
and looked down on himâ€¦

703
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,671
Thanks.

704
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,172
â€¦we got along well.

705
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,303
But those guys kept pushing.

706
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,140
Delivering drugs wasn't enough.

707
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,100
Park Tae-jin made Jun-seo sell it.

708
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,352
Let's stop. I can't do this anymore.

709
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,397
We've come this far. You can't stop.

710
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,358
If we do this a little longer,
not only can you cure Yun-hui,

711
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,736
you'll never have to
worry about money again.

712
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,613
Trust me on this, and let's do it
for a few more months.

713
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,698
I don't care.

714
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,783
Let's just stop.

715
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,118
I want my share of the money we've earned.

716
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,286
Park Jun-seo!

717
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,996
We need to stop!

718
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,007
He even had an affair with his wife.

719
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,592
So what?

720
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,676
Damn it.

721
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,554
What does that have to do
with you getting me addicted?

722
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,307
You're right. After I transferred schools,

723
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,101
I didn't keep in touch with Jun-seo,
but why did you--

724
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,061
You were the worst of them all!

725
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,152
Jun-seo went to see you ten times.

726
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,029
I told him not to go.

727
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,406
I told him it wasn't important
to get your forgiveness.

728
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,574
But he still insisted

729
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,577
and went to ask for your forgiveness.

730
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,038
Hey.

731
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,208
He even begged you
the night before he died.

732
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,459
Hey, Sang-ui.

733
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,377
You were just as bad!

734
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,546
Did you listen to Jun-seo?

735
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,256
Tell me.

736
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,634
You saw how Jun-seo wasn't himself.

737
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,594
Did you even ask him what was wrong?

738
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,600
That damn idiot.

739
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,895
In case he died,
he took out insurance policies

740
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:50,524
and said you two were the only ones
who'd uncover the truth.

741
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,198
I stood by his side for 20 years,
but why did he choose you two?

742
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,366
Why?

743
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,577
Why were you two
Jun-seo's most important friends

744
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,496
and not me?

745
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,459
Then what?

746
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,878
After Jun-seo died,

747
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,881
you had CEO Yoon kidnap me,
get me addicted to lemon pop,

748
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,801
and leave me at platform 3-4
in Anhyeon City station?

749
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,470
Because doing that
would force me to solve this case?

750
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,639
Jun-seo was so happy

751
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,851
when you got promoted.

752
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,482
So I thought since you were
so good at your job,

753
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,860
you could get revenge on Jun-seo's behalf.

754
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,530
TRANSACTION AT JEONGHOON STATION
FROM DOCTOR, 1882

755
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,865
SENDING TEXT MESSAGE

756
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,660
But who knew this bastard
would lose Gong Jin-uk from the start?

757
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,287
He even had his gun taken.

758
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,248
You were supposed to

759
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,167
catch Gong Jin-uk,
use him to get to CEO Yoon,

760
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,795
then find me, Doctor,
and finally Park Tae-jin.

761
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,715
That was my plan.

762
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,217
But you screwed up
from the start with Gong Jin-uk.

763
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,969
Thenâ€¦

764
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,348
How did you know
the rice mill had a CCTV camera?

765
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,975
I told you I didn't know.

766
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,686
Then what exactly
was your part in all this?

767
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,984
Lee Myeong-guk's body.

768
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,778
Lee Myeong-guk's body?

769
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,031
You're the one who moved it
back into his house?

770
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,866
All by yourself?

771
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,495
-With No Gyu-min.
-No Gyu-min?

772
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,290
Is No Gyu-min

773
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,959
the taxi driver who took Jun-seo
to the construction site?

774
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,044
Yes.

775
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,129
What does No Gyu-min
have to do with this case?

776
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:39,299
-Ask him yourself. You'll meet him soon.
-What?

777
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,967
Manpyeong Port at 4 a.m.,
two days from now.

778
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,636
You can stop by Boryeong on the way.

779
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,304
Who's in Boryeong?

780
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,390
The old lady receiving the pension?

781
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,517
I said go ask him yourself.

782
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,733
Why did you put
Lee Myeong-guk's body back?

783
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,279
I set it as bait for Jung Yun-ho.

784
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,451
Damn it, Jang Jae-gyeong.

785
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,205
You would've been able
to arrest Jung Yun-ho.

786
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,666
Then Oh Chi-hyeon and Won Jong-sooâ€¦

787
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,754
I thought you'd eventually figure out
who killed Jun-seo.

788
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,385
But you didn't do anything
the way I'd expected.

789
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,136
All you did was lose them.

790
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,346
Was it fun?

791
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,226
I suppose it was fun.

792
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,482
You must've had a lot of fun

793
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,026
turning me into an addict
and controlling me.

794
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,571
But you're saying you did this
because Yun-jin and I were bad friends?

795
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,281
Then what about you?

796
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,075
How are you better?

797
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,370
You stood by Jun-seo for 20 years,
so what did you do?

798
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,164
When Won Jong-soo and Park Tae-jin
used Park Jun-seo,

799
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,332
what did you do?

800
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,711
I'm doing something right now
by using you two.

801
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:03,383
Don't you see I'm getting revenge
for Jun-seo right now?

802
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,676
Are you serious?

803
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,803
You're out of your mind.

804
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,434
Fine.

805
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:15,937
Let's see if you can repeat this
down at the police station.

806
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,314
Park Tae-jin.

807
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,443
Can you arrest Park Tae-jin?

808
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,156
Do you have any evidence that Park Tae-jin

809
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,782
killed Jun-seo or sold drugs?

810
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,702
What makes you so sure
Park Tae-jin killed Jun-seo?

811
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,580
Isn't it obvious?
Everything points to him!

812
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,708
Park Tae-jin stopped us
from going to the ninth floor.

813
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,543
Park Tae-jin was the one
who checked the body.

814
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,046
And Park Tae-jin was the one
who did the postmortem

815
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,797
and refused to allow an autopsy!

816
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,967
But there's no hard evidence

817
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,470
because he made sure Jun-seo
couldn't be traced back to him.

818
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:52,348
He never talked about drugs over the phone
and got Jun-seo to handle Gong Jin-uk.

819
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,644
All you'll find out

820
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,689
by investigating this case

821
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:03,068
is that I made the drugs,
and Jun-seo was the one who sold them.

822
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,736
So?

823
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,322
Do you have any proof?

824
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:11,034
Do you have any real proof
that Tae-jin killed Jun-seo?

825
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,997
At the very least,
I can make Park Tae-jin slip up.

826
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,376
Hey.

827
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,338
Jang Jae-gyeong.

828
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,550
I'm not going to run.

829
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,095
I planned all this.

830
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,722
I'll pay for what I did, so arrest me!

831
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,601
But not right now.

832
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,645
If you arrest me now,
we can't prove anything.

833
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,106
So I'm asking you to wait until then.

834
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,610
That's why I brought you guys here!

835
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,321
I swear I'll get you the proof you need!

836
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,658
That wayâ€¦

837
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,161
That way, my revenge will be complete.

838
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,506
Yun-jin. Jae-gyeong.

839
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,759
I'm so sorry for what I did.

840
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,099
I'm sorry for making this drug.

841
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,476
I'm sorry, Jae-gyeong.

842
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,398
Just give me some time.

843
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,901
If you give me some time,
I'll bring you Park Tae-jin.

844
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,736
Please, Jang Jae-gyeong!

845
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,787
Hey.

846
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,291
Send a gift to Mayor Joo In-sang's house.

847
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,920
Maybe some fresh oysters from Tongyeong.

848
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,424
-Make sure to include a thank-you card.
-Yes, sir.

849
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,259
The chairman is leaving right now.

850
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,012
It'll only take a moment.
He's inside, right?

851
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,856
Let's leave together.

852
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,531
I know what you're going to say.

853
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,993
But just do as I tell you.

854
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,536
I don't like it, sir.

855
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,624
I don't like being a prosecutor.

856
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,917
I never did,

857
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
and I can't stand it even for another day.

858
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,254
Despite that,

859
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,965
I did as you wished

860
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,468
and stayed at this job.

861
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,721
I wanted to go into business.

862
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,642
I thought it suited me better.

863
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,479
I've attended you since I was young

864
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,730
and know Jong-soo well.

865
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,775
And I think I know better than anyone
what KH Group should do.

866
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,402
That's why I want to join the company

867
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,155
and work there.

868
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,199
This Pilo-dong project

869
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,910
was planned, refined, and improved by me.

870
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,287
That's why

871
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,790
it has come this far.

872
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,714
Please withdraw my appointment
to the Gwacheon Prosecutors' Office.

873
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,883
And please allow me

874
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,844
to see this project through.

875
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,264
If you do,

876
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,891
I promise to create a future for KH Group

877
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,726
-that you and Jong-soo--
-How?

878
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,688
How will you make that happen?

879
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,608
-That's--
-How can a drug-dealing punk

880
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,528
plan a future for KH Group?

881
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,030
Sir.

882
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:40,285
The biggest risk factor in this project
isn't Mayor Joo or Jong-soo.

883
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,412
It's you.

884
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,542
When I first heard you were selling drugs,

885
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,087
I thought it was just a phase.

886
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,171
Why?

887
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:57,385
Because I knew you were a smart person.

888
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,804
And I thought

889
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:03,224
I had gotten through to you
at the restaurant that night.

890
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,309
But how dare you?

891
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,771
The future of KH Group
depends on this Pilo-dong project.

892
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,482
How dare you try
to invest the filthy money

893
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,192
that you made by selling drugs?

894
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,445
What in the worldâ€¦

895
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,530
No, let me ask you this first.

896
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,159
Why did you partner with Park Jun-seo

897
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,828
to deceive Jong-soo behind his back?

898
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,123
Is this how you repay my kindness?

899
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,209
Are you really asking
because you don't know?

900
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,466
Yes, that's right.

901
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,927
Jun-seo and I sold drugs together

902
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,888
to put together investment funds.

903
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,766
Was that so wrong?

904
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:50,521
You forced perfectly fine companies
into bankruptcy.

905
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,901
Then you purchased those companies
for very little and created KH Group.

906
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,153
Eight people committed suicide
in the process.

907
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,617
Can you honestly say
that the money you've made

908
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,953
is any better than the money
I've earned from selling drugs?

909
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,749
Do you think investing my money

910
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,086
could make KH Group any more corrupt?

911
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,843
I took in the only son of a man

912
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,973
who couldn't even afford to buy feed
for the ten cows he raised.

913
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,185
I poured a lot of money into you
to make something out of you.

914
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,562
I see now.

915
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,440
You really are something, aren't you?

916
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,879
Is Sang-ui telling the truth?

917
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,716
Is it okay to leave him like that?

918
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,510
If I arrest Sang-ui right now,

919
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,680
we can prove Jung Sang-ui made the drugs,
and Park Jun-seo sold them.

920
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,850
That bastard, Park Tae-jin.

921
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,519
How can we get him to talk?

922
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,105
If we limit this case to a drug case,

923
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,315
it'll be hard to reveal
who controlled Park Jun-seo.

924
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,819
And it'll only strengthen their claim
that Jun-seo killed himself.

925
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,905
He sold drugs,
felt hopeless, and killed himself?

926
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,494
What should we do then?

927
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,748
You want to trust that psycho,
Jung Sang-ui, and just wait?

928
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,793
He made you into an addict out of revenge.

929
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,837
I'm telling you, he's crazy!

930
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,515
Tell Sang-ui to bring some new drugs.

931
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,100
I don't want the same old thing today.

932
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,729
What's with the face, you jerk?

933
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,064
Today's my last day.

934
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:01,652
I'm going to rehab in the US next month.

935
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,405
Why so surprised?

936
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,074
That's what's going to happen,

937
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,285
so just let me have today, okay?

938
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,164
-Okay.
-Hurry up and bring it.

939
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,804
Hey, Sang-ui.

940
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,264
Bring some pills to Loraine.

941
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,810
Can you get here in 30 minutes?

942
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,188
Okay.

943
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,863
PARK SANG-JIN
I WILL FOLLOW JUNG SANG-UI

944
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,721
ANHYEON POLICE STATION

945
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,520
Captain Jang.

946
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,648
We foundâ€¦

947
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,569
Jung Yun-ho.

948
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,114
Where?

949
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,294
I don't know what he's thinking.

950
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:24,754
We don't know anything for sure yet.

951
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,130
What's going on?

952
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,424
You sold drugs behind my back?

953
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,718
This is why people
need to know their place!

954
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,012
Nobody can access that money.

955
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,556
Park Tae-jin has finally made a move.

956
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,267
We have a search and seizure warrant
for Yeongryun Cold Storage.

957
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,435
Let's go in.

958
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,690
She said to give this
to Mr. Jang and Ms. Oh if they come.

959
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,609
What's on this?

960
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,277
The ninth floor.

961
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,283
It wasn't your first time
seeing CEO Yoon, was it?

962
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,578
-What's the matter with you both?
-Look carefully at what you did.

963
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:04,877
