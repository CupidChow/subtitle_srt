No, to be precise.

Don't you know his legend yet?

The General Yan

35
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,750
is more terrifying than spirit-hunter.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,610
Thousand times more terrifying.

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,130
It is said that

38
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,770
three thousand years ago.

39
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,780
The spirit clan and human race

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,140
had a war that lasted for decades.

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,020
It caused the world to be devastated and bleeding.

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
At that time,

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,620
a young general was newly appointed in ancient Shu.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,829
He alone

45
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,970
put an end to the war between the spirit clan and human race.

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,780
Thus,

47

the future generation of spirit clan

48
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,480

he should be half human and half spirit clan.

Legend has it that

58

General Yan

59
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,900
fell in love with our Spirit Clan Saintess.

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,829
Then he was hunted by the spirit clan

61
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,690
and was seriously injured.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,990
In order to save him, the Spirit Clan Saintess

63
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,640
gave him her energy core.

64
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,900
After receiving the energy core from Spirit Clan Saintess,

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,500
General Yan's power increased dramatically.

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,190
He then became half human and half spirit clan.

That energy core

73

is the source of energy for our spirit clan.

74

Without the energy core,

75
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,970
her power was greatly reduced.

the original body of the Golden Crow was wounded.

General Yan wanted to reunite the spirit of Spirit Clan Saintess.

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,270
So he took

84
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,190
one of the remaining spiritual feathers of Spirit Clan Saintess

85
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,190

He also sealed himself there.

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,910
He nourished the spiritual feather with energy core every day.

Day and night, he tormented.

He only hoped that Saintess can reincarnate.

You can't go on the small roads.

340
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,410
The main road will take you a long way around.

341
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,250
Not to mention this dense forest.

342

In the evening, the fog will be thick.

343

If you are not familiar with the road,

344
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,310
it is easy to get lost in the dense forest.

345

Besides, in the mountains,

346
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,830
there are also some wild animals or something else.

347

Are you looking for a place to stay?

Why don't you go to my hotel?

Well, Master.

what if she is, is a bad person?

Should we be afraid that she will take advantage of the blackmail?

That’s right, we're not afraid of anything.
