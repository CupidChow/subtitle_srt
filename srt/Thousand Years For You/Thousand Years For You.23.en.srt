[Episode 23]

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,229
Lu Yan.

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,720
Look what I've prepared for you.

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,270
I made this myself.

30
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,020
Lu Yan.

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,110
Lu Yan.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,440
You can even sleep while sitting.

33
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,400
You must have consumed too much energy

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,680
and haven't fully recovered.

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,680
Let me give you some energy.

36
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,660
What's going on? My energy...

37
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,030
The words left on the execution ground

38
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,079
is still in this hairpin.

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,170
No, I can't let her hear them.

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,870
You're awake.

41
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,650
What were you trying to do?

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,650
I saw some dust on your head,

43
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,620
so I wanted to clean it for you.

44
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,060
It's okay.

45
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,590
I must have got it dirty

46
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,700
when I was grilling fish.

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,210
You've been in a coma for a day.

48
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,250
Do you feel better?

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,420
Eat something to take nutritional supplements.

50
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,110
Guess what I made for you?

51
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,960
Come here.

52
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
Look.

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,990
The grilled fish I made for you

54
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,310
and your favorite...

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,520
No, my favorite rice cakes with brown sugar.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,980
It doesn't look good,

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,250
but it should taste good.

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,380
Try it.

59
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,930
Hurry.

60
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,690
I made this myself.

61
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,030
How is it?

62
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,470
How does it taste?

63
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,790
It tastes good.

64
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,380
You have a good taste.

65
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,380
My uncle and Dahai said

66
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,920
I have no talent for cooking.

67
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:03,980
It seems that

68
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,750
we are Boya and Ziqi.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,840
It's you who have a good taste.

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,730
Unlike them,

71
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,360
they are just ordinary people who don't appreciate it.

72
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,840
Why are you staring at me?

73
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,680
How is the spirit clan in the Yingdu City?

74
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,440
Gu Beixi has asked around.

75
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,020
Most of the spirit clan in the Yingdu City

76
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,320
have escaped from the city

77
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,760
after the execution.

78
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,180
Some of the spirit clan

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,410
haven't been discovered by humans.

80
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,830
They're ready to leave the city now.

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
Do I still have dust on my head?

82
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,170
Dengdeng.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,010
Why don't you give me back my hairpin for a while?

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,159
You gave it to me before.

85
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,090
What? Are you going back on your word?

86
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,500
No.

87
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,010
The style of this hairpin is a bit out of date.

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,950
I can give you

89
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,140
the most popular one.

90
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,159
I think this is good.

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,930
Yes.

92
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,700
But I can get you a better one.

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,390
I'm not the person who despise the poor and curry favor with the rich.

94
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,270
I think this wooden hairpin is good.

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,370
But, this...

96
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,820
Lu Yan, don't act beyond your capacity now.

97
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,970
You can't defeat me now.

98
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,960
Now,

99
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,650
you're like the tiger who went down to level land, and you would be insulted by me.

100
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,680
Fine.

101
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Since you said so,

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,150
I'll just eat the fish.

103
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,130
Why does it sound weird?

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,800
As the proverb goes, "the tiger went down to level land, it would be insulted by dogs!" You mean I'm a dog!

105
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,650
You should have reminded me.

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,300
I didn't even think about that.

107
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,630
You...

108
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,010
I'll let it go.

109
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,890
Since you haven't recovered,

110
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,190
I'll forgive you this time.

Dengdeng.

118
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,790
You brought me food again.

119
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,590
I knew it.

120
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,300
Even if my daughter married someone,

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
she won't forget me.

122
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,050
Where is the meal?

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,730
He ate them all.

124
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,070
Does he know how to respect the elders?

125
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,840
Master,

126
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,260
what did Concubine Lu do wrong?

127
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,110
You treat him like this.

128
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,090
I'll teach him a lesson.

129
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,670
Don't get involved in their marriage.

130
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,310
It will be a big deal if it goes on like this.

131
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,300
That's rude.

-Senior Master. -Yu.

133
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,880
That's rude.

134
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,940
Keep your voice down.

135
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,110
Someone is following us.

136
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,520
Who?

137
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,180
I didn't see him, but his kung fu is good.

138
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,380
It shouldn't be.

139
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,260
Didn't Concubine Lu say

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,240
there is a skill formation

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,930
blocking the aura and energy?

142
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,510
Yes.

143
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,030
It's impossible for ordinary people to find us.

144
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,300
No matter who come,

145
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,400
they are guests.

146
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,460
I'll go take a look.

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,110
Wait.

148
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,940
The enemy is in the dark, we are in the light.

149
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
If you go out now,

150
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,590
you won't get any advantage.

151
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,760
Why don't we...

152
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,780
Okay.

153
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,130
Great!

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,480
Okay!

Master.

156
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,810
Do we need to tell Concubine Lu?

157
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,380
No need.

158
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,230
You don't need a knife, which is used to kill cows to kill a chicken.

159
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,680
If you tell him now,

160
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
he won't be able to recuperate.

161
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:16,830
Father.

162
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,540
I haven't finished yet. Where are you going?

163
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,390
Kill the chicken.

164
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,160
I think he has diarrhea. [Note: "killing the chicken" and "diarrhea" have similar pronunciation in Chinese.]

Uncle,

166
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,180
I'm too tired.

167
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,930
I must have a good sleep.

168
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,710

172
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,620
Why can't I move the water tank?

173
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,860
Don't move.

174
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,920
You have got into my Zichen Qiankun Net.

175
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,520
Do you want to escape? No way.

176
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,750
I'd like to see

177
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,300
who dares to mess with us.

178
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,030
Yes.

179
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,890
Open it for me.

180
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,210
Are you Xin?

181
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,440
Master.

182
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,190
Why are you here?

183
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,970
Hurry up.

184
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,740
What did you do?

185
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
Your ladyship

186
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm here to test your reaction ability.

187
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,049
I didn't expect that it's great.

188
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,480
Great job, Chieftain Yu.

189
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,919
Great job, uncle.

190
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,480
Dahai is better.

191
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,940
Sir is calling me.

192
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,130
I'll go back first.

193
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,800
Your ladyship, I...

194
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,610
Don't force me.

195
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,880
I promised Mr. Lu

196
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,280
I won't say anything.

197
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,090
What did you promise?

198
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,880
Your ladyship, here's the thing.

199
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,460
Didn't Mr. Lu want the hairpin back?

200
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,220
Didn't you refuse to give it to him?

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,340
So I wanted to volunteer

202
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,650
to take the hairpin back.

203
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,480
What?

204
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,480
You wanted to steal it.

205
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,260
We're family.

206
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,480
How could you say that?

207
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,950
Why did he suddenly want to take the hairpin back?

208
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,800
What's wrong with this hairpin?

209
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,400
Are you going to tell me or not?

210
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,220
Say!

211
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,170
Say it.

212
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,140
Dengdeng.

213
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,690
I hoped that we can remain a devoted couple all through our lives.

215
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,460
But today,

216
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,300
I'm afraid I'll break my promise.

217
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,330
Remember,

218
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,230
I'll pay you back for what I did.

219
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,890
You treated me as your husband in this life.

220
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,520
I will marry you in the next life.

221
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,960
This matter is settled.

222
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,720
Living or dying can't change it.

223
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,310
So touching.

224
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,830
My goodness.

225
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,730
Concubine Lu is so straightforward. It's so cool.

226
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,990
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,930
He's clearly teasing Dengdeng.

228
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll kill him.

229
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,100
Come back!

230
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,310
What are you doing here?

231
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,350
You…

232
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,260
Chieftain.

233
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,790
Dengdeng.

234
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,090
It's just a confession.

235
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,150
All of you

236
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,160
are ignorant.

237
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,330
What a loser.

238
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,870
All right, since we've figured it out,

239
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,750
it's a misunderstanding.

240
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,570
Go back and rest.

241
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,390
Let's go.

242
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,660
Go.

243
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,620
Why did you push me?

246
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm just concerned about Dengdeng.

247
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,780
Let's go.

248
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,510
Dengdeng.

249
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,230
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,760
I hoped that we can remain a devoted couple all through our lives.

251
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,780
But today,

252
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,350
I'm afraid I'll break my promise.

253
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,550
Remember,

254
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,390
I'll pay you back for what I did.

255
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,470
You treated me as your husband in this life.

256
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,180
I will marry you in the next life.

257
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,670
This matter is settled. Living or dying can't change it.

258
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,830
Lu Yan.

259
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,370
Lu Yan.

260
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,770
You're asleep again.

261
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,720
You must be exhausted.

262
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,660
You fell asleep

263
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
before Xin replied.

264
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,500
You were usually fierce to me.

265
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,290
I didn't expect a general like you

266
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,740
has such a passionate heart

267
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,800
under your cool appearance.

268
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,290
Well, you're quite cultured.

269
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,610
I've experienced a lot of things.

270
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,080
When I heard your confession in so many people's presence just now,

271
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,560
I almost couldn't hold it.

272
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,840
Actually, I was very angry.

273
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,930
I was angry that you broke your promise.

274
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,910
I was angry that you died alone.

275
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,590
But for the sake of your confession,

276
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,500
I'll show you mercy and let you go.

277
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,780
Dengdeng, I'm sorry.

278
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,810
I hoped that we can remain a devoted couple all through our lives.

279
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,620
You...

280
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,710
Well done, Lu Yan.

281
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,820
You pretended to be asleep

282
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,070
to steal my hairpin?

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,470
Do you think I can't remember it

284
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,400
after you stole my hairpin?

285

Yu, aren't you sleeping?

356

Why are you back?

357
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,990
Chieftain Yu.

What Chieftain Yu? Call him dad.

359

Don't let him call me father.

360

We've prayed to the ancestral hall and got married.

Why can't him call you father?

363

So it doesn't count.

365

Besides, he wrote the divorce letter.

You have nothing to do with him now.

Lu Yan, call him father.

370
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,570
He's 3000 years old. He calls me father.

371

That will shorten my life.

You are my daughter.

Why should I reason with you?

375
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,950
We will go back to the Qingquan Stronghold

376
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,750
to get married again.

377
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,510
Let him be a member of the Yu family.

378
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,630
We'll talk about it after the ceremony.

379
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,030
Go back to sleep now.

You're my father. I can't afford to offend you.

I'm so mad about this.

I'm so mad.

Didn't you see Lu Yan's love for Dengdeng

392
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,540
in the battle of Yingdu?

393
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,280
Why aren't you satisfied?

394
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Why is Dengdeng

395
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,150
on his side now?

396
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,700
Since she met Lu Yan,

397
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,350
she doesn't recognize me as her biological father.

398
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,860
A grown girl can't be kept.

399
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,010
You're right.

400
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm her father.

401
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,420
Why can't I match

402
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,340

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,480
How about this?

405
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,250
We introduce another man to her, okay?

406
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,950
That man is

407
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,330
Gu Beixi.

408
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,700
It's useless.

409
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,900
I've done everything I can.

410
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,540
She will be blessed.

411
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,660
Don't worry about it. Or she will be more rebellious.

412
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,850
Dengdeng gave this to you.

413
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,310
My daughter is the one who cares about me.

414
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,630
Yes, she asked you to bring some supplements for Lu Yan

in Lu Yan's room later.

421
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,540
Flowers should match beauties.

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,190
Here's the radix angelicae and ginseng rootlets you asked for.

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,900
Lu Yan.

514
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,070
You took advantage of me first this time.

515
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,160
Not bad.

516
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,370
I'm so sleepy.

517
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,570
I want to take a nap.

518
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,830
Hold me tight.

519
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,550
Don't let go.

520
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,420
Dengdeng!

521
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,700
It's a spirit worm.

522
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,060
How could it be?

523
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,770
Why is the energy that was infiltrated into Dengdeng's body

524
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,230
running out quickly?

525
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,560
-Dengdeng. -Master.

526
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,560
What happened?

527
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,190
I put some energy in her.

528
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,270
She's fine now.

529
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,230
Lu Yan.

530
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,020
Dengdeng, you're awake.

531
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,210
Don't worry.

532
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,490
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

533
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,870
You stay here and take good care of Dengdeng.

534
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,860
Dengdeng!

535
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,620
Master.

536
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,610
Have a good rest, Dengdeng.

537
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,020
Lu Yan, we meet again.

538
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,450
You did all this, didn't you?

539
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,650
You look so weak now.

540
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,120
You must have spent a lot of energy to save her.

541
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,270
I advise you not to waste your energy.

542
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,140
Our Saintess Yun Xi...

543
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,530
No, it's Yu Dengdeng.

544
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,290
Now she can enjoy the taste of the spirit worm.

545
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,360
What are you going to do to her?

546
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,310
Nothing.

547
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,440
I just planted a worm on her.

548
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,220
It can absorb her power for me at any time.

549
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,530
The worm is here, the person is here.

550
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,910
If the worm dies,

551
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,130
you will never see

552
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,300
the alive Yu Dengdeng.

553
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,940
Back then, you took the energy core of the Saintess.

554
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,960
That's why you could fight me.

555
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,320
[The family is blessed with the arrival of the New Year]

556
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,320
[The family is full of wealth with the spring breeze blowing]

557
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,160
Now that your energy is damaged,

558
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,870
you'd better give me the energy core.

559
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,550
Back then, without the energy core,

560
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,720
when we met on the battlefield,

561
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,480
I had never been defeated.

562
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,660
I must have underestimated you.

563
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,200
We humans

564
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,030
don't understand the evil ways of your spirit clan.

565
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,580
But we know how to join hands against the enemy.

566
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,080
You're too naive!

567
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,480
Dengdeng!

568
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,200
Master!

569
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,600
Master!

570
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,240
Dengdeng!

571
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,350
-Dengdeng!  -Master!

572
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,280
-Dengdeng!  -Master!

573
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,510
Don't scare me.

574
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,190
Master!

575
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,130
Think of a way.

576
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
What should we do?

577
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,130
How would I know?

578
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,710
Dengdeng, I'm here.

579
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,940
Zhu Rong.

580
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,890
You just want

581
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,190
the energy core in my body, right?

582
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,650
Release Yu Dengdeng and the others.

583
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,040
I'll give you the energy core.

584
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,460
Look at you, a good-for-nothing one!

585
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,880
Who are you to bargain with me?

586
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,240
Do you think

587
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,400
it can be taken as you wish?

588
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
Dengdeng!

589
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,730
You scared me to death.

590
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,500
Xin, how is he?

591
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,690
Your ladyship, don't worry.

592
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,480
He is fine with the protection of the energy.

593
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,210
He just needs to rest for a few days

594
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,680
and he can recover.

595
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Okay.

596
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,460
That's good.

597
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,560
Let me give some energy to him.

598
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,160
Dengdeng.

599
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
Don't you know

600
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,700
what's your health condition?

601
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,040
How can you give him your energy?

602
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,710
I can't leave him alone.

603
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,630
It was because

604
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,710
he gave me his energy before.

605
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,600
That's why he was attacked by Zhu Rong.

606
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,440
But with your condition...

607
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,220
This...

608
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm fine.

609
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,990
Sir.

610
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,450
Do you feel unwell?

611
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,190
Come.

612
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,980
Let me check what's inside you.

613
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,970
Well...

614
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,660
Didn't all the spirit worms die?

615
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,010
This one is different from previous worms.

616
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,800
The purpose of Zhu Rong is

617
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,420
to take advantage of my weakness

618
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,660
when my energy ran out

619
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,740
and put this spiritual worm in Dengdeng's body.

620
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,360
Then hurry up and drive it away.

621
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,050
I've just checked.

622
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,270
This spiritual worm

623
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,450
is connected to Dengdeng's body.

624
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,580
Once the spirit worm is hurt,

625
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,980
Dengdeng will also get hurts.

626
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,330
How could this be?

627
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,090
It keeps evolving.

628
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,860
It's getting harder and harder to address it.

629
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,860
Is there no other way?

630
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,870
Think of a way.

631
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,590
This...

632
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,700
Unless

633
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,450
let it out of Dengdon's body

634
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,290
in good condition.

635
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,790
Hurry up!

636
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,520
Yes, hurry up.

637
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,700
Look at her.

638
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,700
Don't be discouraged.

639
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,750
Didn't you say

640
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,100
"the hurdles are difficult to pass, but they must be passed;

641
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,500
every step is difficult, but we still have to go step by step."

642
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,970
There's always a way to deal with it.

643
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,280
Only you can do it.

644
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,840
Don't worry.

645
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,450
I will find a way.

646
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,020
I trust you.

647
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,480
Chieftain Yu,

648
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,780
I heard that there is one clan of the hunters

649
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,430
who never dealt with the spirit clan.

650
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,430
They specialize in evil things in the mortal world,

651
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:19,750
for example, chasing corpses or using legendary venomous worms.

652
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,820
You mean the King of Worm is also a kind of legendary venomous worms?

653
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,570
The Questions In 1000 Years also said

654
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,280
the spirit worms are not born

655
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,360
but are chosen.

656
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,990
So I suspect the spirit worm is the legendary venomous worm.

657
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,430
I see.

658
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,270
You want to deal with it

659
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,370
in the way of dealing with legendary venomous worms.

660
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,580
As far as I know,

661
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,790
in the Yingdu City,

662
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,060
there is a hunter who specialize in legendary venomous worms.

663
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,430
But his whereabouts are uncertain.

664
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,670
Now Dengdeng is in danger at any moment.

665
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,840
I must stay by her side all the time.

666
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,210
I wonder if you can look for this hunter

667
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,010
for me?

668
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,510
What do you mean?

669
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,490
Of course.

670
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,570
My daughter's matter is my business.

671
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,860
I can find them.

672
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,400
I'll go now.

673
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,400
Thank you.

674
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,480
Sir, what are you doing?

675
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,350
No.

676
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,170
Stop talking.

677
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,270
Do you think

678
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,070
I'm going to use a hairpin to dig out the energy core for Dengdeng?

679
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,750
Am I right, sir?

680
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,910
She likes you so much.

681
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,180
You can't go to the dead end.

682
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,560

684
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,460
If I give the energy core to Dengdeng,

685
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,140
it's like giving endless energy to Zhu Rong.

It will only make Dengdeng weak more fast.
