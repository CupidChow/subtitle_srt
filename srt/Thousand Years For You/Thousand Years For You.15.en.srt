00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,260
You've never heard of it because you lack knowledge and experience.

679
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,330
Let me in!

680
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,490
-Are you leaving or not? 
-Get out!

681
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,150
Go away quickly!

682
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:55,810
Please open the door.

683
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,500
We're here to deliver documents of missing people.

684
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,850
[Yingdu Missing Case]

685
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,850
[The Theft and Murder Case in Yingdu]

686
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,020
Since I can't do it publicly.

687
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,050
Don't blame me for doing it in secret.

688
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,500
Chieftain Gu.

689
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
It seems that you're not very charming.

690
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,770
Your father-in-law doesn't seem to know you well.

691
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,640
Let's get down to business.

692
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,230
How should we get into Bai Mansion?

693
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,920
In my opinion,

694
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,920
let's just get in

695
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,030
by pretending to be servants of Bai Mansion.

696
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,170
No way.

697
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,200
Even an old lady who sweeps the floor in Bai Mansion

698
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,490
is demanded to come from a decent family.

699
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,590
We are outsiders.

700
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,060
How can we get in?

701
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,530
I don't want to blame you, but you are…

702
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,590
What's the use of having you, a son-in-law from Bai Mansion?

703
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,470
You are really…

704
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,790
Why is it useless?

705
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,430
We can't get in by pretending.

706
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,810
But I can make him

707
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,720
invite us to the mansion openly.

708
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,320
What does it mean?

709
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,930
Looks like...

710
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,980
It's time to do something new.

711
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,470
You mean...

712
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,140
No, no, no, no.

713
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,330
Sir...

714
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,630
They want to pretend to be bandits and hijack the caravan

715
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,550
when women of Bai Mansion

716
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,980
are on their way to pay incense.

717
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,330
Then Yu Dengdeng will deal with those bandits.

718
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,770
They want to put on a play called the hero rescued beauty.

719
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,690
So that Chief Bai will owe them a debt of gratitude.

720
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,350
Then he will treat them as guests

721
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,170
and invite them to his mansion.

722
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,970
I got it.

723
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,120
Keep following her.

724
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,770
Yes.

725
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,840
Sir.

726
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,200
Maybe I go protect the Master too?

727
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,340
I feel worried

728
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,670
to leave this thing to them.

729
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,940
If Yu Dengdeng is in danger,

730
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,330
I can sense it.

731
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,150
I can get to her in time.

732
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,710
Now,

733
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,870
I need you to confirm one thing for me.

734
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,940
What is it?

735
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,570
Isn't this the spiritual butterfly

736
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,180
that attacked Master in Qingquan Town.

737
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,670
Come to feel

738
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,050
the scent on this butterfly.

739
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,870
Sir!

740
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,680
This is the butterfly of Zhu Rong's subordinate.

741
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,450
Are you sure?

742
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,230
Yes.

743
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,400
Three thousand years ago,

744
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,690
I've seen that spirit clansman several times.

745
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,300
This is his scent.

746
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,840
I thought he and Zhu Rong had died together.

747
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,520
I didn't expect that

748
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,110
he has survived till now.

749
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,840
There are two women from Bai family coming this time.

750
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,820
One is Chief Bai's newly married concubine.

751
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,080
The other one is the young lady of Bai family, Bai Shiqi.

752
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,940
Bai Shiqi.

753
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,110
It seems that Chief Bai has lots of sons and daughters.

754
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,630
As soon as the carriage arrives,

755
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,000
you two rush out and rob.

756
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,490
Don't hurt people.

757
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,010
I'll deal with the rest.

758
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,160
I'll go out with your precious apprentice

759
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,600
and pretend to be robbers

760
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,910
Don't shoot for real!

761
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,450
How can that work?

762
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,170
We should do it seriously.

763
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,510
I have to give you two a shot each,

764
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,710
which will make people believe.

765
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,980
Is this really necessary?

766
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,940
Don't worry.

767
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,260
The bullets will just pass by you.

768
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,290
No one will get hurt.

769
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,340
All right.

770
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,950
Two shots, two shots are fine to me.

771
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,310
We both protect our heads from shooting.

772
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,250
I found out that you are

773
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,470
a man who wants beauty more than life.

774
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,340
This time,

775
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,770
I can finally give Master

776
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,880
to you trustingly.

777
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,780
Here they come. Here they come.

778
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,820
Don't move! Don't move!

779
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,250
Hurry up!

780
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,480
Back up.

781
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,470
Get down.

782
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,450
Get over there!

783
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,660
I'm telling you guys.

784
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,230
From now on, Shuangming Mountain is our territory.

785
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,840
If you want to pass by,

786
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,310
you have to give us your money.

787
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,290
Don't panic.

788
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,690
Give them all our money and jewelry.

789
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,380
Give it all to them.

790
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Yes, Miss.

791
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,410
Come down.

792
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,710
You brave man,

793
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,450
We've given all the money to you.

794
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,390
Please do us a favor.

795
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,500
Let us go.

796
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,090
You are straightforward.

797
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,320
But you've already heard my voice.

798
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,530
In order to prevent you from reporting to the police,

799
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,740
I'll have to kill you all.

800
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,700
Sir, there is honor among thieves.

801
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,940
We've given all the money to you.

802
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,320
Why do you have to go back on your word?

803
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,710
Shiqi, don't contradict them.

804
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,740
Don't be afraid, Auntie.

805
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,450
My father is the chief of police.

806
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,490
I can't be scared by such a scene.

807
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,490
If you are reasonable, take the money and leave.

808
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,960
If you are not reasonable,

809
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,010
I'm not afraid of you bandits.

810
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,860
Little girl.

811
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,600
You are brave.

812
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,700
Today I want to see that

813
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,100
why you are not afraid of me.

814
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,790
If you want to kill me,

815
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,250
I have one life.

816
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,820
If you want to humiliate me,

817
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,710
I can only die.

818
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,820
Ok.

819
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,230
Bro.

820
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,250
Don't move!

821
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,580
See if you insult her today,

822
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,820
or kill her?

823
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,469
Well, today we're here to rob.

824
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,820
Master is still waiting to show her appearance.

825
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,330
Why are you talking to this girl?

826
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,170
Then let us kill her.

827
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,760
Wait a minute.

828
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,969
Even if I have to die, let me know the reason.

829
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,020
My father has attacked Xiongya Stronghold many times.

830
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,389
You're here for revenge?

831
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,420
No.

832
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,429
I don't belong to any group. We are looking for money and killing people today.

833
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,120
Then just do it.

834
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,850
Who is it?

835
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,820
Who are you? Why are you blocking my way?

836
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,680
How dare you rob in a broad daylight?

837
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,760
It's a pity you met me.

838
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,700
Today

839
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,390
You are unlucky!

840
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,800
Miss.

841
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,780
Boss.

842
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,650
This woman doesn't look easy to deal with.

843
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,170
Let me try to fight with her.

844
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:13,990
You hero.

845
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,250
Throw the gun away if you dare.

846
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,920
Let's fight in the flesh.

847
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,140
It's ok.

848
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,270
Let me

849
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,170
have a fight with you today.

850
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,930
Master, you are really hard, you…

851
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,210
Your performance is too pompous.

852
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,860
She is almost killing me!

853
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,080
Please forgive us.

854
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,940
We have eyes but fail to recognize Mountain Tai.

855
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,060
Do you dare to commit highway robbery again?

856
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,020
-Don't dare!
-Don't dare!

857
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,260
Do you know you're wrong?

858
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,300
-We know.
-We know.

859
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,840
Do you still want to be a bandit?

860
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,590
-No, no,
-No.

861
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,760
What happened?

862
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,980
Miss Yu

863
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,910
has fallen out with her friend?

864
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,800
Thank you for saving my life.

865
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,890
-Thank you! Thank you!
-Thank you.

866
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
You're welcome.

867
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,050
Can you tell me your name?

868
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm Yu Dengdeng.

869
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm from Qingquan Town.

870
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,860
I came to Yingdu

871
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,180
to look for my relatives.

872
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,820
How can I not help you when I see something unjust?

873
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,420
Please get in the car.

874
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,020
I can escort you back to the city.

875
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,570
Then...

876
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,930
What should we do to these two bandits?

877
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,970
It's not safe to take them back.

878
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,490
I've already tied them up.

879
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,280
I'll give them a beating later

880
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,100
to make you relieved.

881
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,130
Miss.

882
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,860
My father is the chief of the police.

883
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,750
Why don't we send them to the police station?

884
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,370
To prevent them from doing evil again.

885
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,620
Or they will harm others and themselves.

886
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,540
Ok.

887
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,030
Good point.

888
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,370
Good point.

889
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,360
Then,

890
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,660
please get into the carriage first,

891
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,790
Miss Bai.

892
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,270
Okay.

893
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,960
Lady warrior! Lady warrior!

894
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,800
Master, you're giving us away?

895
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,180
Play to the score.

896
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,820
Can't you see that Bai Shiqi is not easy to deal with?

897
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,210
Your Master is wearing a buckle.

898
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,540
Rest easy, you and I.

899
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,790
Let's go.

900
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,120
Lady warrior.

901
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,350
The horse is startled.
