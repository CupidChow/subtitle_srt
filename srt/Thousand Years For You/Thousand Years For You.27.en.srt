27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,000
Go to the paradise early.

28
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,720
Go to the paradise early.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,350
Rest in peace.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,509
Master.

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,890
Fireflies, right?

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,270
I arrived at a dark place.

33
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,340
Fireflies brought me out.

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,380
This is the fireflies that Dummy said.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,410
The dark place he said

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,870
should be this underground palace.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,830
Maybe

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
he was scared into a fool

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,430
because he saw these bones.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,920
Didn't Dummy say

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,120
the fireflies took him out?

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,110
Let's give it a try.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Fireflies.

44
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,270
Boss!

45
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,370
Please take us out.

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,240
Okay?

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,160
It's useless, Master.

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,260
Maybe

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,880
the fireflies which took him out

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,220
are the incarnation of his friends,

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,170
My father once said

52
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,670
after people die,

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,280
the spiritual energy may turn into fireflies.

54
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,710
These fireflies

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,579
should all be the incarnation of the dead

56
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,370
and trapped here too.

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,610
Then it's over.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,670
We don't know the fireflies here.

59
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,540
None of them is familiar.

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,050
Master, you're trying to release them from purgatory.

61
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,270
I have less energy.

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,730
Master,

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,930
you can't consume your energy anymore.

64
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,260
Helping others

65
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,620
is the first principle of Qingquan Stronghold.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,750
Master, in front of me,

67
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,230
stop saying grandiloquent words.

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,899
Be careful.

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,350
Dahai!

70
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,510
Master! Master!

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,130
Master! Master!

72
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,320
Master, are you alright?

73
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,240
Dad!

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,080
Dengdeng!

75
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
Are you hurt?

76
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,350
I knew you were here.

77
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,530
What's wrong with you?

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,730
I was so worried.

79
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,520
Your problem of leaving without noticing hasn't changed at all.

80
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,450
Uncle should also be blamed.

81
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,630
He messed around with you.

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,010
Let's not talk about this.

83
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,450
Dengdeng,

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,610
I'll take you out of the underground palace.

85
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,920
Let's go.

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,550
You know how to get out?

87
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,340
Where is my uncle?

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,060
He went out first.

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,909
I walked around here for several days

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,120
to figure out the way.

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,110
Let's go.

92
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,790
Dahai and Lu Yan are also here.

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,060
Let's go find them first.

94
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,250
OK.

95
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,460
Let's go.

96
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,350
How long will it take?

97
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,760
Soon.

98
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,430
When can we get out of here?

99
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,180
Soon.

100
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,380
The hurdles are difficult to pass,

101
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,310
but they must be passed.

102
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,850
Yes, let's go.

103
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,950
When will we arrive?

104
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,300
Soon.

105
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,870
It's right ahead.

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,250
Hurry up!

107
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,840
Who are you?

108
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm your father.

109
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,370
You didn't even blink

110
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,640
when you saw my father's marks.

111
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,710
You can't even remember what my father always said.

112
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,750
You don't know my father well.

113
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,190
Tell me, who are you?

114
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,030
Yun Xi.

115
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,520
You are...

116
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,080
Zhu Rong?

117
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,870
It's not easy for us to meet alone.

118
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,420
It's not good to use violence.

119
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,910
Don't waste your energy.

120
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,030
You're no match for me!

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,760
Just kill me.

122
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,050
Why disguise?

123
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,380
Cut the crap.

124
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,710
Come with me.

125
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,220
Let's see what you're up to.

126
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,200
You put spirit worm on me

127
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,350
and purposely led us here.

128
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,669
What are you up to?

129
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,200
Is it just because

130
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,470
you want to absorb my energy?

131
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,850
How can the energy in your body

132
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,300
compare to the energy pellet in Lu Yan's body?

133
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,130
It turns out

134
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,130
you want to exchange me for the energy pellet with Lu Yan.

135
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier? We can discuss it.

136
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,770
Don't be so aggressive.

137
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,770
Just ask me to send him a message.

138
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,960
I'll ask him to come over.

139
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,070
Sure.

140
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,800
Discuss?

141
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,200
Go and open Lu Yan's chest

142
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,410
and dig out the energy pellet for me.

143
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,730
Don't turn your eyes.

144
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,650
Do you think I'll believe your lies?

145
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,110
It's no need to lie when it comes to you.

146
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm just curious.

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,810
Why someone like you

148
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,240
who have stolen others' possessions

149
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,230
can act so righteously?

150
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,290
The energy pellet belongs to our spirit clan.

151
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,090
It's the source of all the spirit clan's energy.

152
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
You betrayed your clan

153
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,430
and gave the energy pellet to a human easily.

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,580
As the leader of the spirit clan,

155
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,450
why can't I get it back?

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,730
Leader of the spirit clan?

157
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,600
In order to take the energy pellet,

158
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,110
you even created a riot of spirit worm

159
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,480
and killed so many spirit beings.

160
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,300
Besides, you made so many spirit beings

161
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,030
in Yingdu City homeless.

162
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,630
How dare you

163
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,250
call yourself the leader of the spirit clan?

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,520
I killed spirit beings?

165
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,460
I made the spirit beings homeless?

166
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
Thousands of years ago,

167
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,790
the resources of our homeland were drained.

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
In order to survive,

169
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,950
spirit beings ate each other.

170
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,110
It was me

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,700
who led them to expand their territory

172
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
and come to this nine continents.

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,670
But what about you?

174
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,790
As the saintess of the spirit clan,

175
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,260
you gave the energy pellet to a human

176
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,290
and made us spirit clan helpless.

177
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,490
Have you forgotten

178
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,310
how many compatriots Lu Yan killed?

179
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,840
The Battle of humans and spirit clan has lasted for decades.

180
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,260
How many compatriots

181
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,160
died under Lu Yan's blade?

182
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,560
Was it me who caused all this?

183
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,550
I don't know what happened 3,000 years ago.

184
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,860
I only know

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,810
the current Lu Yan

186
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
only wants to protect humans and spirit beings.

187
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,330
Now,

188
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,720
humans and spiritual beings are living in peace.

189
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,920
Why are you making trouble again?

190
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,500
We are living in peace

191
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,670
or the spirit clan

192
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,460
don't dare to show their true colors

193
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,820
and live in hiding?

194
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,940
3,000 years ago,

195
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,570
as the saintess of the spirit clan,

196
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,270
you betrayed our clan.

197
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,890
3,000 years later,

198
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,680
I, Zhu Rong,

199
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,710
will lead the spirit clan

200
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,290
to destroy nine continents.

201
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,420
You want to break the formation with blood?

202
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,050
Now you can't even bleed.

203
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,550
How can you break the formation?

204
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,070
Almost.

205
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,630
I'm going all out.

206
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,390
Lu Yan, be here sooner.

207
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,730
Aren't you afraid that the underground palace will collapse?

208
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,670
Even if it collapses,

209
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,400
I want you to bury with me.

210
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,030
Who is bullying my daughter?

211
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,790
-Master! Master!
-Dengdeng. Dengdeng.

212
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,070
How is it, Dengdeng?

213
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,390
-How about you, Dengdeng?
-Master.

214
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,550
Dahai.

215
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,870
Uncle.

216
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,630
How did you get together?

217
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,380
This shabby place is like a maze.

218
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,110
I just walked around

219
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,340
but I met the Second-in-command.

220
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,440
Then we started looking for you.

221
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,870
We happened to find the flower mark you left.

222
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,130
So we followed you.

223
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,990
Why is this demon here?

224
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,480
It's a long story.

225
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,410
Let's go. The best way is to leave.

226
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,220
Hurry up.

227
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,680
Yu, let's go.

228
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,080
You go first.

229
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,430
Let's go.

230
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,130
You want to leave? It's not that easy.

231
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,320
Master!

232
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,900
Dengdeng!

233
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,700
Master!

234
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,580
Master!

235
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,440
Dengdeng!

236
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,460
Master!

237
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,940
Master! Master!

238
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,530
Dengdeng!

239
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,160
Master!

240
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,380
Master.

241
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,420
Yu.

242
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,360
Senior Master.

243
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Father.

244
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,870
I'm the one you want to deal with.

245
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,480
Come at me if you dare.

246
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,460
Lu Yan.

247
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,650
I'll leave you to it.

248
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,200
Arrest them all!

249
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,650
Lu Yan, come here.

250
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,930
Take a look at Dengdeng.

251
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,250
I'll transmit some energy to Dengdeng.

252
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,450
Let's go.

253
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,800
Dengdeng!

254
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,080
Dengdeng!

255
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,940
Master!

256
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,480
-Master!
! -Dengdeng!

257
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,180
You finally fell out with your lieutenant.

258
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,380
Let's go.

259
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,829
Hurry up. Let's go.

260
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,940
Hurry up.

261
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,230
Take my sword.

262
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,410
What's going on?

263
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,670
Master, there are enemies in front and behind.

264
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,720
Zhu Rong has just left and Wei Du has come.

265
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,980
Your lieutenant

266
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,620
is really loyal to you.

267
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,870
General,

268
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,170
let me ask you again.

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,950
Do you choose this spiritual woman

270
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,680
or these fellows

271
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,910
who risked their lives with you?

272
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,700
Did you see that, Master?

273
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
They began to force him.

274
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,590
General,

275
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,940
are you sure you want to choose her?

276
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,110
So what?

277
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,170
Without Dust-proof Bead,

278
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,860
this woman will die after being drained of energy.

279
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,090
Can you protect

280
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,410
her?

281
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,410
You can only watch her die again.

282
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,620
Not necessarily.

283
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,430
Sir, the mission is completed.

284
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,840
Dust-proof Bead.

285
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,420
Aren't you outside the underground palace?

286
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,380
Master knew

287
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,810
you wouldn't hand over Dust-proof Bead.

288
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,650
So he pretended to let me stay outside the palace

289
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,950
to lower your guard.

290
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,120
Actually, I followed you all the way.

291
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,940
In terms of intelligence, you are no match for my master.

292
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Not bad.

293
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,040
You even slandered your own men.

294
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,190
This is called

295
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,260
the one who approaches me is evil.

296
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,810
Now that we have Dust-proof Bead,

297
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,120
Wei Du, I won't hold you accountable for

298
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,480
what you did before.

299
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,010
From now on,

300
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,870
stay in Ancient Shu.

301
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,210
Don't think about making any more trouble.

302
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,510
Let's go.

303
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,160
If you take away Dust-proof Bead,

304
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,080
people of the whole city will die.

305
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,060
You...

306
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,870
What do you mean?

307
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,350
General.

308
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
I lied to you.

309
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,430
We survived by testing medicine for the spirit clan.

310
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,430
Then we built this capital of Ancient Shu.

311
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,240
But a few years later,

312
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,630
the effect gradually disappeared.

313
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,430
We started to grow old

314
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,190
and die.

315
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,380
At this moment,

316
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,280
Zhu Rong showed up

317
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,180
and gave me Dust-proof Bead.

318
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,140
After putting Dust-proof Bead in the underground palace,

319
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,110
the people of the city stopped aging

320
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,510
and become immortal

321
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,080
and won't die.

322
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,330
That's why Zhu Rong

323
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,270
used this bead

324
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,560
to lure you

325
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,400
to take us to the underground palace.

326
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,210
If he took the bead,

327
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,680
all the people in the city will die.

328
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,090
He has the lives of the people in the city.

329
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,590
I have to obey him.

330
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,020
But it's different now.

331
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,720
You're back.

332
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,790
We can work together

333
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,030
to kill Zhu Rong.

334
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,510
It's just a bead.

335
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,910
Is it that powerful?

336
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,640
It can make people immortal for 3,000 years?

337
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,770
Impossible.

338
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,960
There are Ghost Vines in this underground palace.

339
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,660
Ordinary people can't come in.

340
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,940
Wei Du, you must be hiding something.

341
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,500
Where does the energy on this bead come from?

342
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,590
Fine.

343
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,420
If you don't tell me, I'll speak for you.

344
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,150
This underground palace

345
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,070
contains countless human skeletons of different ages

346
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,750
and also the bodies

347
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,230
of people that went missing a few days ago in Baile Village.

348
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,840
You made this place a trap to kill people.

349
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,200
You used human life

350
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,030
to maintain the energy of Dust-proof Bead

351
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,450
and also your immortality.

352
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
You'll be executed.

353
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,900
Is that so, Wei Du?

354
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,030
General.

355
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,310
You once asked me if being alive is good.

356
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,670
It's good to be alive.

357
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,740
But it's not that easy to live.

358
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,620
What else

359
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,510
can we do?

360
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,130
Will I just see

361
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
our people

362
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,620
and our fellows

363
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,900
die miserably?

364
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:02,980
Wei Du.

365
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,850
You've changed.

366
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,600
You're no longer the former Wei Du.

367
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,750
What you did

368
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,680
is no different from those evil spirit beings.

369
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,150
The spirit clan forced us to come this far.

370
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
General.

371
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,960
Wei Du's death is worth it.

372
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,470
But what about these fellows?

373
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,340
What about the old and young people in the city?

374
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,790
They were all your followers

375
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,950
and trusted you.

376
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
General.

377
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,380
Fellows don't have to die tragically.

378
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,550
You can stay and be our king.

379
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,620
This is Shu.

380
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,410
People here,

381
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,220
and the capital here

382
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,110
are no different from those of the homeland 3,000 years ago.

383
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,960
General.

384
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,510
please choose.

385
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,600
Wei Du.

386
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,680
Don't make any more mistakes.

387
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,100
General,

388
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,110
you really don't even give us

389
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,710
half a chance?

390
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,140
Okay.

391
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Okay.

392
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,110
In that case,

393
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,550
let's bury together here.

394
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,590
They are trying to trap us to death.

395
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,940
Master, let's go.

396
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,580
Yes.

397
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,490
Wei Du.

398
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,720
What's the point of doing this?

399
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,190
Wouldn't you regret it?

400
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,210
General.

401
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,240
I know with your ability,

402
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,950
this door can't stop you.

403
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,580
In that case,

404
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,460
if you want to take this woman and the bead away,

405
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
my fellows and I

406
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,070
will have nothing to care.

407
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,390
Let's die here

408
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,150
and let our souls return to our homeland.

409
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,320
General.

410
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,840
Enough, Lieutenant Wei.

411
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,630
Stop acting.

412
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,920
You're making a scene.

413
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,090
Your general believes you. I don't.

414
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,710
What did you say?

415
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,450
With Lu Yan's stubborn mind,

416
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,020
he'd rather the world betray him

417
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,660
than let the world down.

418
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,530
But you let him

419
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,720
choose between the one he likes and his fellows.

420
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,120
Isn't that forcing him to die?

421
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,990
What kind of choice question is this?

422
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,540
Don't you hate me?

423
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,650
Fine. I'll give you a chance to make a choice.

424
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,700
Either I'll smash the bead.

425
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,050
Once the bead is destroyed,

426
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,830
everyone will die together,

427
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,770
so that your general won't be in a dilemma.

428
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,030
Master, are you crazy?

429
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,500
If they don't leave, let's go ourselves.

430
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,810
Dahai, Lu Yan doesn't want to leave his fellows.

431
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,580
Your master doesn't want to leave Lu Yan either.

432
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:35,990
Or

433
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,460
you go out with us,

434
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,850
Lu Yan can stay and be your king.

435
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,520
As for me,

436
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,800
I will stay here to be your queen.

437
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,330
When the bead expels the worm from my body,

438
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,290
I'll carry on his family line

439
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,370
and help you achieve great cause.

440
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,020
Double win or double lose.

441
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,150
Choose one.

442
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,180
But you are from the spirit clan.

443
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,740
I don't care.

444
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,650
I don't care about anything except him.

445
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,140
Wei Du.

446
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,150
Her choice

447
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,420
is my choice.

448
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,030
Go out with us.

449
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,240
Now, you should believe my sincerity.

450
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,140
It's a win-win situation.

451
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,940
What else are you thinking about?

452
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,890
Exactly.

453
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,610
Get out of the underground palace.

454
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,730
Let them all go.

455
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,010
Let's go.

456
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,440
Let's go.

457
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,320
Let's go. Master. Let's go.

458
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,970
Are you okay?

459
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,620
I'm fine.

460
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,110
You're bleeding from the fall.

461
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,580
General.

462
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,990
I know I'm sinful.

463
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,190
Please punish me.

464
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,990
Wei Du.

465
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,340
More than ten years ago,

466
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,890
Yu Dengdeng's mother

467
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,570
was killed by someone with a dragon tattoo.

468
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Is this related to your army?

469
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,710
No wonder

470
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,500
she kept asking me

471
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,020
if I had left the city.

472
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,650
General.

473
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,390
I didn't lie.

474
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,260
The people of the city have never gone out.

475
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,600
We can only survive

476
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,710
within the energy scope of Dust-proof Bead.

477
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,530
We can't get out.

478
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,470
But it's different now.

479
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,960
You're back.

480
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,420
You're our hope to get out of here again.

481
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
Get up.

482
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,120
Thank you, General.

483
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,990
Where is Dust-proof Bead?

484
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,680
I've discussed with the people in charge of the rituals in the capital.

485
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,770
When you officially take over Ancient Shu City,

486
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,270
I will present Dust-proof Bead

487
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,730
at the enthronement ceremony

488
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,520
as a gift for your ascension.

489
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,620
What do you think?

490
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,950
I didn't have time to tell you in the underground palace.

491
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,000
In the underground palace,

492
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,840
I found the fireflies Dummy mentioned.

493
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,610
When he accidentally entered the capital of Ancient Shu,

494
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,940
he must have been to the underground palace.

495
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,860
He was scared by the scene there.

496
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,040
In the underground palace,

497
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,140
why did you lie to Wei Du

498
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
to stay here on purpose?

499
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,610
Then why did you

500
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,700
make the same decision as I did?

501
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,280
[This city is suspicious.]

502
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,560
[There's a trap in this city.]

503
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,020
Wan.

504
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,490
Why haven’t the men who went to explore the way back?

505
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,920
Is there anything wrong?

506
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,360
Don't worry. Let's wait for them.

507
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,490
Boss.

508
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,170
What is this?

509
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,230
This is said to be pawned

510
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,790
by the people of Xiongya Stronghold.

511
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,910
They must belong to the Bai family.

512
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,980
Please take a look.

513
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,510
They belong to Shiqi.

514
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,690
♫Listen to the wind start to blow♫

515
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,560

What is this place?

579
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,310
I don't want to go in.

00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,100

Don't be afraid, son.

584
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,610
Sir.

585
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,350
Where are you taking us?

586
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,920
Just go inside.

587
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,470
Don't be afraid. It's useless to be afraid.

588
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,490
You don't have to be afraid if you die.

589
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,700
Follow up!

590
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,530

595
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,360

596
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,420

597
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,270
General.

598
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,389
I asked the fortune-teller in town

599
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,920
to calculate several auspicious dates.

600
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,449
Please choose one day to hold the enthronement ceremony.

601
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,530
Leave it.

602
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,620
These are the articles

603
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,630
I composed

604
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,550
according to ancient Shu etiquette.

605
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,320
We are not familiar with royal etiquette.

606
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,590
We might miss something.

607
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,810
Please have a look

608
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,650
and see if we need to adjust it.

609
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,610
Times are different now.

610
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,770
There's no need to look into this old calendar.

611
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,760
Do as you plan.

612
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,620
General.

613
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,300
How can we let our guard down?

614
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,680
You are our general

615
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,190
and a prince of Shu.

616
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,350
It's justifiable

617
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,330
for you to inherit the throne of Shu.

618
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,760
The enthronement ceremony

619
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,630
must be held according to the rules of Ancient Shu.

620
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,490
According to the rules,

621
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,390
my eldest brother should be the one to inherit the throne.

622
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,400
We didn’t know if you were alive.

623
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,680
The eldest prince inherited the throne,

624
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,060
but Shu was declining and destroyed.

625
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,730
We often feel that

626
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,780
if you were to ascend the throne,

627
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,980
Shu would have been eternal.

628
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,880
Now,

629
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,770
we finally have a chance

630
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,090
to give you the throne

631
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,780
to make up for the regret 3,000 years ago.

632
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,490
There must be no mistakes

633
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,100
in this enthronement ceremony.

634
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,120
Whatever.

635
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,830
General.

636
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,790
After the enthronement ceremony,

637
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,280
we will start to build a new palace.

638
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,870
These are the locations. General.

639
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,580
Wei Du, stop doing things that

640
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,460
are a waste of manpower and resources.

641
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,850
But the palace

642
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,470
is the dignity of the royal family.

643
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,650
What's the use of that?

644
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,330
Even if I ascend the throne,

645
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,180
I'm just

646
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,880
the puppet emperor of capital of Shu.

647
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,430
I'm incompetent.

648
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,870
I will

649
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,460
definitely assist you

650
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,200
to recreate the layout of Shu

651
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,830
and give you a real world.

652
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,620
Do you think I want revive Shu?

653
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,300
General,

654
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,950
you don't have to choose Shu,

655
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,230
but the people of Shu

656
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,830
can't live without you.

657
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,410
For 3,000 years,

658
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,120
besides soldiers like us,

659
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,030
the people have been prospering here for generations.

660
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,720
The people of a country

661
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,420
live based on morale.

662
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,560
To be frank,

663
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,470
we don't know

664
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,320
what the outside world looks like.

665
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,280
Only you

666
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,260
is our hope.

667
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,500
Wei Du,

668
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,960
You've been here for a thousand years.

669
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,470
You're a real leader.

670
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,570
You could have lived a better life.

671
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,160
Why do you want to suffer?

672
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,860
As a remnant,

673
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,690
how can I make a choice?

674
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,240
I was wrong.

675
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,030
In order to survive,

676
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,420
I was lured by Dust-proof Bead held by Zhu Rong.

677
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,330
But I'm only loyal to Shu and you.

678
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,370
Heaven and earth can witness it.

679
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
If you have doubts,

680
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,680
after you become the emperor,

681
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm willing to remove my armor

682
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,200
to make up to my mistake.

683
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,780
Please keep your promise.

684
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,020
Don't leave us behind.

685
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,780
If we lose you again,

686
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,830
we will have nowhere to go.

687
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,750
Get up.

688
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,390
General.

689
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,450
Once you ascend the throne,

690
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,980
we will no longer be controlled by the spirit clan.

691
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,510
We will be loyal to

692
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
you and the new queen.

693
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,220
You lured the people outside into the underground palace

694
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,980
to offer sacrifice to Dust-proof Bead.

695
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,540
This is too cruel.

696
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,860
Don't do it again.

697
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,690
Yes.

698
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,060
Since Zhu Rong can inject energy into Dust-proof Bead

699
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,610
to keep everyone alive,

700
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,630
maybe

701
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,600
I can give it a try.

702
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,470
Thank you, General.

703
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,630
With your energy,

704
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,270
the bead doesn't need

705
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,550
take human lives anymore.

706
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,350
The people and soldiers in the capital

707
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,850
will be safe.

708
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,350
Shu will be prosperous.

709
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,010
General.

710
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,800
The underground palace is the safest place in the capital.

711
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,530
So it's safer to reserve the bead

712
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,540
in the underground palace.

713
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,410
Now I can only trouble you to come here in person.

714
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,010
It's okay.

715
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,600
This shop looks nice.

716
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,690
General, do you want to have a rest?

717
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,560
Stop!

718
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,890
Stop!

719
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,980
Sir.

720
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,430
Isn't this Mei from Baile Village?

721
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,150
Don't kill me!

722
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,820
Stop!

723
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,140
Don't kill me!

724
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,630
General.

725
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,520
Mei.

726
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,800
How did you get in?

727
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,470
Help me! Help me!

728
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,940
There's monster! Help me!

729
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,110
Wei Du, what's going on?
