27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,350
This shop looks nice.

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,460
General, do you want to sit down and have a rest?

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,240
Stop!

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,780
Stop!

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,789
Sir.

32
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,170
Isn't this Miss Mei from Baile Village?

33
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,780
Don't kill me!

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,530
Stop!

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,750
Don't kill me!

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,190
General.

37
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,200
Mei.

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,500
How did you get in here?

39
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,240
Help me!

40
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,740
There's a monster! Help me!

41
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,940
Wei Du, what's going on?

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,150
I'm asking you.

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,900
What happened?

44
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,300
She probably ran from the underground palace.

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,270
Help me! There's a monster!

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,030
Are you still attracting outsiders for sacrifice at the underground palace?

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,130
Please forgive us.

48
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,430
I was too busy

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,100
to deliver the order.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,060
Take her away.

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
Let her go.

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,670
Don't let them catch me. Don't let them catch me.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Don't let them catch me.

54
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,100
Don't.

55
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,380
Wei Du, can you send her out in person?

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,600
General.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,100
We don't have the Gate to the outside.

58
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,350
Every time it was Zhu Rong who lured people to come in

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,900
and we waited at the entrance.

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,990
There's a way to get in.

61
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm afraid it's hard to get out.

62
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,430
In my opinion,

63
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
why don't we keep this lady

64
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,920
in our city?

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,990
She's so scared that she's delirious now.

66
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,480
She can't live alone.

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,880
Xin,

68
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,380
take her back to the General Mansion for a rest.

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,310
Okay.

70
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's go.

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,450
It's okay.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Don't worry.

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,070
Don't worry.

74
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,850

Wei Du.

77
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,210
The citizens of Shu are humans.

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,930
The people outside are also humans.

79
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,790
From now on, don't use people's lives

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,190
to sacrifice to the Dust-proof Bead.

81
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,180
Yes.

82
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,110
Go check

83
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,030
if there are any outsiders

84
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,150
who have been lured into the city with this lady.

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,350
Take good care of them if you find any.

86
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,670
Yes, General.

88
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,650
So

89
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,420
you and my uncle volunteered to go to the underground place?

90
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,310
Do you know

91
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,100
we were so worried about you?

92
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,720
It's not like that.

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
We just wanted to find the Dust-proof Bead,

94
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,130
but we ran into a monster.

95
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,910
It led us to there.

96
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,260
Come on.

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,910
You just suspected the underground palace.

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,160
And then?

99
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,620
You went there by yourself.

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,480
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,280
We had searched other places

102
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,240
except there.

103
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,620
When I went in,

104
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,870
I saw nothing

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,140
but a bunch of skulls.

106
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,080
Senior Master, what did the monster look like?

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
See, it had

108
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,220
no facial expressions.

109
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,870
There's no color in its face.

110
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,450
It walked like...

111
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,570
You know?

112
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,070
You said you were going to find the Dust-proof Bead.

113
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,450
Actually,

114
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,450
you were looking for the dragon mark, right?

115
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,490
Incidentally.

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,230
Incidentally.

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,280
Did you find it?

118

It'll be found soon.

Senior Master.

120
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,030
You didn't find it, but my master...

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,030
She found it.

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,390
I found

123
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,370
all the soldiers here

124
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,600
have that mark.

125
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,070
Really?

126
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,130
Yes.

127
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,770
Dahai and I have confirmed it.

128
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,310
Could it be that

129
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,700
your mother was killed

130
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,840
by Lu Yan's men?

131
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,870
There's no concrete evidence yet.

132
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,370
Let's not act rashly.

133
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,070
Let's check again.

134
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,370
It must be that Lieutenant

135
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,390
who colluded with Zhu Rong.

136
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,230
Dad!

137
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,100
Dad, calm down.

138
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,500
If they had really killed my mom,

139
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,140
I wouldn't spare them.

140
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,610
But we haven't found any evidence yet.

141
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,070
Don't act rashly

142
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,430
and ruin Lu Yan's plan.

143
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,330
Okay.

144
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,110
How about this?

145
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,390
You stay here

146
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,220
and investigate more with me.

147
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,230
But the General Mansion

148
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,900
is heavily guarded.

149
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,710
It's hard to get out.

150
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,280
-Miss Yu. -Well...

151
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,180
Miss Yu.

152
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,150
Our Lieutenant wants you back to the room.

153
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,210
Got it.

154
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,150
General, she's here.

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,210
Lieutenant Wei, what's the matter?

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,470
Miss Yu.

157
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,750
General is going to hold the enthronement in a few days.

158
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,380
You need to prepare some dresses.

159
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,670
This is the best dressmaker in the capital.

160
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,050
She will

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,320
measure your body.

162
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,230
Sure.

163
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,250
Do it.

164
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,090
Yes.

165
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,260
Lieutenant Wei.

166
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,100
Anything else?

167
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,190
Miss Yu.

168
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,370
After what happened in the underground palace,

169
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,830
I think there shouldn't be secrets

170
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,930
between us.

171
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,140
Is he going to tell the truth?

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,700
He's coming in no peace.

173
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Lieutenant Wei,

174
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,170
I've always been straightforward.

175
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,460
I say what I mean.

176
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,540
There's nothing to hide.

177
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,180
Have you finished measuring?

178
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200
Yes.

179
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,990
Leave.

180
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,680
Yes.

181
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,940
Then I'll be honest with you.

182
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,920
I don't want our General

183
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,540
to marry a girl from the spirit clan.

184
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,090
But since General loves you so much

185
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,020
and you have no memory of what happened before,

186
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,000
so

187
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,580
I can accept

188
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,310
that you will become the Queen of Shu.

189
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,040
It's my pleasure.

190
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,880
But

191
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,280
you need to

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,970
take the responsibility of the Queen.

193
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,659
Since you've decided to marry General,

194
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,300
you have to forget that you are a spirit being.

195
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,930
Don't keep

196
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,310
any ambition from the spirit clan.

197
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,490
If you keep recognizing yourself as a part of the spirit clan,

198
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,020
using the energy magic,

199
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,909
and causing discontent

200
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,960
from citizens and soldiers,

201
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,120
then Shu

202
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
won't tolerate

203
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,060
a Queen like that.

204
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,570
Then, even General

205
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,580
can't make sure your safety.

206
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,910
Lieutenant Wei,

207
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,760
you think too much.

208
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,740
I grew up eating normal food.

209
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,700
I never thought of myself as a member of the spirit clan.

210
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,020
I hope so.

211
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,480
In order to make sure the future Queen of Shu

212
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,960
won't make any mistake,

213
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,220
I've arranged a team of guards

214
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,200
to serve you.

215
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,669
He's trying to spy on me?

216
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,470
I'll take that

217
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,549
for Lu Yan.

218
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,200
Thank you, Lieutenant Wei.

219
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,680
Thank you.

220
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,340
I was short-staffed.

221
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,720
However,

222
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,030
I also have a question

223
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,750
to ask you.

224
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,630
What is it?

225
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,910
Look at you.

226
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,040
You keep distinguishing

227
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,500
human beings from spirit beings so clearly.

228
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,330
But Lu Yan is a human.

229
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,860
He has the energy core of our spirit clan

230
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,480
within his body.

231
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,070
Is he a human or a spirit creature?

232
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,030
Besides,

233
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,420
we are so in love now.

234
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,270
We will have lots of children in the future.

235
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,720
Do you think those princes and princesses

236
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,570
are humans or spirit beings?

237
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,690
Come to think of it,

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,550
they're more like descendants of the spirit clan.

239
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,320
In that case,

240
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,430
aren't you going to

241
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,210
serve an emperor from the spirit clan?

242
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,440
Headache.

243
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,570
What a headache.

244
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
What are you supposed to do?

245
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
You...

246
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
Unbelievable.

If I hadn't been busy,

250
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,330
I would have taught you a real lesson.

251

What's wrong?

258
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,400
It's from the underground palace.

259
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,120
The girl had escaped from there.

260
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,430
The rest of her company

261
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,010
have been sent back to the underground palace.

262
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,510
Should we rescue them?

263
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,230
Since they've already been sent back,

264
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,740
forget it.

265

Don't tell anyone

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,830
about these things.

267
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,730
If General asks,

268
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,900
tell him they have been sent out.

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,650
Understood.

270
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,880
Where is the girl who escaped from the underground palace?

271
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,840
She was arranged by someone close to General Lu.

272
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,850
She probably ran into the Ghost Vines

273
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,690
and got scared.

274
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,420
General said no one can disturb her

275
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,180
and let her rest quietly.

276
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
So

278
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,260
cares about this girl.

Do you treat my daughter

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
She found a way to distract them

350
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,750
and release us.

351
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,920
Cool, Master.

352
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,280
You're so smart.

353
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,340
Thank you Zhao for making time out of your busy schedule

354
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,420
and coming to celebrate my grandson's first-month birthday.

355
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,740
It's really our Liu's honor.

356
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,510
You're welcome.

357
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,840
He's celebrating his grandson's first-month birthday for the second time.

358
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,970
Is it a scam for gifts?

359
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,630
Congratulations.

360
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,290
-Thank you for coming. -Congratulations.

361
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,360
Thank you so much.

362
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,620
It looks nice there.

363
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,450
Go.

364
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,790
Let's go for a treasure seeking.

365
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,680
This is a forbidden place.

366
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,950
No one is allowed to enter.

367
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,030
Am I anyone?

368
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,010
I'm your future Queen.

369
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,360
Miss Yu.

370
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,050
There are neither shops

371
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,260
nor people living here.

372
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,470
Why don't you go check out that street?

373
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,550
Wait and see.

374
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,970
When I become the Queen,

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,460
you'll all be punished.

376
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,760
Why can't I find the border of Shu

377
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
in such a small place?

378
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,250
Could it be that

379
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,240
there's magic guarding this city?

380
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,310
Guards!

381
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,360
Guards!

382
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,220
General.

383
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,480
Where are the servants?

384
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,080
I heard

385
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,960
they were with Miss Yu.

386
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,820
Yu Dengdeng?

387
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,099
Miss Yu said

388
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,550
she wanted to go around the city.

389
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
She thought there hadn't been enough people with her,

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,140
so she took away all the soldiers available

391
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,170
in the mansion.

392
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,010
What did she do in the city?

393
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,599
Rumor has it that

394
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,030
she went to seven shops

395
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,020
and three private houses.

396
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,920
She also messed up a cockfighting place.

397
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,450
But she's only looking around.

398
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,190
She didn't use the energy magic.

399
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,740
Leave her alone.

400
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,580
Let's do it this way.

401
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,650
Let the butler

402
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,700
figure out the losses she caused to those citizens

403
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,930
and find a chance to tell General. Go.

404
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,590
Yes.

405
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,250
That's weird.

406
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,310
After leaving the mansion,

407
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,700
I went all the way north and didn't even look back.

408
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,390
Why am I here again?

409
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,800
Are there two places looking alike in the city?

410
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,550
No.

411
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,550
There must be something wrong.

412
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,920
I need to look into it.

413
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,390
General Wei.

414
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,020
General Wei.

415
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,560
What's the matter?

416
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,960
Miss Yu insisted on playing hide-and-seek

417
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,110
on the street with our people.

418
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,660
She took the chance to get rid of them

419
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,650
and ran away.

420
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,630
What?

421
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,820
Get someone to follow her.

422
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,560
Yes.

423
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,970
Yu Dengdeng.

424
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,290
You can't enter here.

425
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,900
My men are hiding inside.

426
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,810
I need to get in and look for them.

427
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,570
This is a forbidden place.

428
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,510
No one is allowed in.

429
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,610
Why can others get in

430
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,680
but not me?

431
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,870
Listen.

432
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,330
If you don't let me in,

433
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,760
I'll tell your General

434
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,020
and punish all of you for harbouring.

435
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,040
Move aside!

436
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,550
Go away.

437
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
How dare you!

438
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,940
Darn it.

439
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
I can't use my energy

440
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,500
after getting harmed by that stupid worm.

441
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm not as strong as before.

442
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,920
Dengdeng!

443
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,580
Dad.

444
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,750
Good for you.

445
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,500
Have you found the exit?

446
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,750
Not yet.

447
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Let's get in and have a look.

448
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,310
Let's go.

449
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,590
Look over there.

450
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,190
There's nothing.

451
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,010
What are the soldiers guarding?

452
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,400
Besides here,

453
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,460
there are two more places guarded by soldiers.

454
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,580
I went in and took a look.

455
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,780
There's nothing.

456
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,910
There must be something.

457
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,200
It's just

458
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,600
we haven't found out.

459
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,730
Girl,

460
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,180
go get some stones.

461
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,730
Go.

462
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,000
See?

463
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,050
Here.

464
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,980
Here.

465
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,910
And here.

466
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,670
See?

467
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,150
These three intersections,

468
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:00,900
the underground palace

469
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,770
and the gap where we entered the mountain before.

470
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,210
There are five roads in every direction

471
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,430
all connected.

472
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,780
Is there anything special about it?

473
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,140
This is a formation.

474
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,470
A formation?

475
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes, this formation

476
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,330
is called Guardian Formation.

477
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,480
I don't know where

478
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,270
the eye of the formation is.

479
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,360
Then who can find the eye of the formation?

480
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,130
It's the one who set this formation

481
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,810
knows where the eye of the formation is.

482
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,680
No one else knows unless he tells.

483
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,050
So we can only

484
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,500
enter this formation,

485
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,140
but can't get out.

486
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,320
Yu.

487
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,380
I didn't know

488
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,860
you're really something.

489
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,630
You seem mindless

490
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,790
but are actually a hunting master.

491
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,060
Now you're talking.

492
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,970
Otherwise, how can I be your father?

493
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
But we can only enter but not leave this formation.

494
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
Could it be a formation set by Wei Du?

495
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,660
Impossible.

496
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,400
I've observed Wei Du.

497
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,260
Although he has lived long enough,

498
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,710
he's a mortal.

499
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,270
He's just an ordinary person.

500
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,630
And this formation

501
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,530
is set by the spirit clan.

502
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,100
It needs the energy support.

503
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,980
Wei Du hates the spirit clan so much.

504
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,630
How could he use a spirit clan's formation

505
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,330
to protect the capital?

506
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,620
Could it be that

507
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,710
he colluded with Zhu Rong?

508
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,470
I never thought about that.

509
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,070
Could that formation

510
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,010
be set by Zhu Rong?

511
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,350
It could be.

512
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,260
Apart from the formation,

513
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,420
I also found something

514
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,840
very strange today.

515
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,960
I tried to transfer energy

516
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,770
into the Dust-proof Bead today,

517
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,460
but I found there's nothing within the Dust-proof Bead

518
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,150
that can't absorb or release energy.

519
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,940
So Wei Du was deceived by Zhu Rong.

520
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,920
The Dust-proof Bead can't release energy.

521
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,790
Then what is it

522
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,630
that has been supporting all the soldiers in the city to have lived for 3,000 years?

523
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,940
I guess

524
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,210
it's that formation.

525
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,430
It's not the Dust-proof Bead

526
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,780
that keeps everyone staying in the capital,

527
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,220
but the formation.

528
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,960
If there really is a formation,

529
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,550
how did we get in here?

530
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,430
Stupid.

531
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,920
It means

532
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,350
it is the same as Pi Xiu.

533
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,210
It takes in

534
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,320
but never spits out.

535
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,120
My dad and I

536
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,580
have searched a few Gates

537
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,100
to the outside.

538
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,400
But these Gates are usually closed.

539
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,910
They're only open for the transportation of the energy.

540
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,330
It's similar to

541
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,820
the Mysterious Market.

542
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,860
Sorry.

543
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,050
I ate something in the kitchen.

544
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,650
The food in the kitchen stunk,

545
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,470
but I was too hungry.

546
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,570
I just took a few bites.

547
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,270
I'm not feeling well now.

548
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,900
Excuse me for a moment.

549
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,920
Lu Yan.

550
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,910
I almost lost to

551
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,640
two soldiers today.

552
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,720
Why don't we

553
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,530
make it clear to Wei Du now?

554
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,470
Let's tell him the existence of the Dust-proof Bead

555
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,440
has nothing to do

556
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,850
with the lives of people in the city.

557
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,710
How about

558
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,600
give it to me

559
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,730
to repel the worm?

560
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,690
He won't believe it.

561
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,170
He will only think

562
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,900
we want to steal the Dust-proof Bead.

563
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
That's right.

564
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,850
We do want to take it.

565
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,870
But we can't steal it.

566
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,040
Well,

567
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,520
he has to face this sooner or later.

568
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,700
Leave it to me.

569
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,690
I'll find a way to get the Dust-proof Bead

570
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,940
and give it to you these days.

571
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,680
After you get the Dust-proof Bead,

572
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,820
leave the capital with your father and the others.

573
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,650
I will leave the Gate open in advance.

574
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,150
What about you?

575
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,600
I'll stay here to clean up the mess.

576
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,530
No.

577
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,370
Don't worry.

578
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll finish up here as soon as possible.

579
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,550
But...

580
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,390
I trust you

581
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,940
and your ability.

582
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,250
You can handle it well.

583
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,830
How about this?

584
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,950
We'll wait for you in Baile Village.

585
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,030
Come back as soon as possible.

586
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,850
By the way,

587
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,370
Mei from Baile Village

588
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,290
somehow got into this city

589
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,010
and almost got caught into the underground palace.

590
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,030
Luckily, she bumped into me.

591
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Now,

592
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,550
I've let her stay in the General Mansion.

593
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,870
Take her with you when you leave.

594
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,190
Don't worry.

595
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,440
Leave it to me.

596
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,100
Weird.

597
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,260
Weird.

598
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
So weird.

599
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,840
What's weird?

600
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,090
See?

601
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,700
The toilet is weird.

602
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
I went to the toilet.

603
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,390
I saw someone get in.

604
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,450
so I just waited there.

605
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,560
I waited and waited.

606
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,910
He still hadn't come out.

607
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,430
I couldn't stand it anymore

608
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,590
and went to urge him.

609
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,480
When I opened the door,

610
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,310
it turned out that there was no one.

611
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,930
Did you run into a ghost?

612
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,790
Like the monster Senior Master talked about?

613
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,740
Don't talk nonsense.

614
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,250
All the monsters in the world

615
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,590
are crated by the spirit clan for fun.

616
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,020
There are no real monsters, right?

617
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,100
Dahai, what time is it?

618
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,240
It's just past midnight.

619
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,520
My father told me

620
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,550
he saw the same thing

621
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,070
when he woke up to go to the toilet at the midnight.

622
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,190
Someone went in,

623
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,330
but no one came out.

624
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,520
He thought it was someone

625
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,160
sent to spy on us.

626
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,700
Now it seems that

627
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,570
there's another reason.

628
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,560
What are you thinking about?

629
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,590
I didn't want to scare you.

630
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,750
So,

631
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,140
don't rush to send me out of the city tomorrow.

632
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,210
Let me verify my guess first.

633
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,260
What guess?

634
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,230
It's a secret.

635
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,350
Come out.

636
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,770
Don't pretend to be a ghost.

637
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,270
You and your master reunited after a long time.

638
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,040
You should thank me.

639
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,390
What?

640
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,220
He saw through it?

641
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,840
You're afraid he won't trust you,

642
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,350
so you want to bring me to him to prove yourself?

643
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,800
I've done

644
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,510
what you asked me to do for you.

645
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,450
It's your incompetence

646
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,650
that you failed to kill the Saintess.

647
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,900
From now on,

648
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,620
we are neither enemies nor friends.

649
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,630
If you dare

650
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,370
harass me again,

651
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,580
don't blame me for being rude to you.

652
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,210
Lu Yan's energy is strong.

653
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,040
You think

654
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,600
you can live happily

655
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,560
with him?

656
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,670
Do you forget

657
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,750
Lu Yan is supposed to return the energy core to Yu Dengdeng?

658
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,750
After he returns the energy core,

659
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,260
he's definitely

660
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,810
going to die.

661
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,990
What?

662
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,330
What?

663
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,510
Didn't your master tell you that?

664
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,420
It seems

665
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,100
he doesn't trust you that much.

666
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,970
He stayed

667
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,580
only to save his woman.

668
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,290
If you can bring Yu Dengdeng

669
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,690
to me,

670
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,370
maybe

671
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,110
I'll consider

672
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,950
letting you know more truths,

673
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,610
or,

674
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,390
letting your dream

675
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,330
last for a little longer.

676
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,260
Don't try to trick me again.

677
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,990
Never ever.

678
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,250
Everything goes as planned.

679
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,100
When that loyal lieutenant

680
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,640
thinks of all of this,

681
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,660
this city

682
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,810
will be the grave of the Lu Yan and the others.

683
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,760
We can't do anything to Yu Dengdeng.

684
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,210
Otherwise, General will be angry.

685
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,110
Guards!

686
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,110
General.

687
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,240
The girl

688
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,250
General took back...

689
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,110
What's going on?

690
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,200
Go and ask what happened.

691
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,200
What's going on with the girl inside?

692
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,550
General Wei sent her here.

693
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,780
He thinks he's smart?

694
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,840

Most of the weapons in the mansion
