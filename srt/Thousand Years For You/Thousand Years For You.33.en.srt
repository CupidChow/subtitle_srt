[Episode 33]

27
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,170
Chieftain!

28
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,120
Bad news! Someone is gonna die!

29
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,880
Qian took us

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,220
to Hongqing Stronghold for a contest.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
We are about to lose.

32
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,640
We're almost dying.

33
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,979
Is he messing around with his life?

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,440
Hongqing Stronghold?

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,650
Those notorious rogues.

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,400
Why did they come to our place?

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,200
You weren't here back then.

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,890
We

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,520
went hunting

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,570
but was intercepted by their men.

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,680
Qian was so angry

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,360
that he asked them

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,729
to have a fight at the foot of the mountains this afternoon.

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,890
We made it two out of three.

45
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,790
No matter it was going to be a shooting or kungfu battle,

46
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,200
we thought

47
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,910
Qian wouldn't lose anyway, right?

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,210
Unexpectedly, in the second round,

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,530
their third brother didn't follow the rules.

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
He played dirty.

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:22,810
He knocked Qian down

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,950
in no time.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
Now it's the third round.

54
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,390
It's called "Courage Battle".

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,230
No one knew what it was going to be.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,079
It turned out they needed to point guns

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,400
at each other's head.

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
They are betting on their lives.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,640
My goodness. What a mess!

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,360
We'd never seen this before,

61
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,120
so we rushed back to you.

62
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,800
Those reckless monkeys

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,590
played dirty tricks.

64
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,920
They're so arrogant on my first day coming back.

65
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,640
They're bullying us, Master.

66
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,360
No way.

67
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,800
Master, go check it out.

68
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm telling you.

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,600
Qian never gives in.

70
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,090
It'd be a disaster if he got shot.

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's go save him.

72
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,400
Just bring him back.

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,520
Don't make any trouble.

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,280
Don't worry, dad.

75
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,570
What's wrong?

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,260
Lu Yan, Qian went to fight with people from Hongqing Stronghold

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,600
without telling us.

78
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,800
Now it's the critical moment.

79
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,520
He is almost gonna die.

80
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Let's go and save him.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,480
Okay.

82
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go.

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's go.

84
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,570
Master.

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,230
Don't force it.

86
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,220
Safety first.

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
Stop it.

88
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,910
Qian.

89
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Shoot.

90
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,320
Shoot.

91
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,850
Shoot.

92
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,750
Stop!

93
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,860
Stop, Qian.

94
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,110
Drop the gun.

95
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,770
Drop the gun. Drop the gun.

96
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,850
Right, we're not doing this.

97
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,600
Stop!

98
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,620
Stop fighting.

99
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,220
Who dare touch my people!

100
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,780
Chieftain.

101
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,130
Interesting.

102
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,420
This stronghold is small, isn't it?

103
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,510
There are lots of chieftains.

104
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,680
Is your chieftain a woman?

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,120
Yeah.

106
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,200
What are you talking about?

107
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,400
Watch your mouth.

108
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,350
You people from Hongqing Stronghold are playing dirty.

109
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,690
Playing dirty?

110
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,490
You people from Qingquan Stronghold

111
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,790
came to die today.

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,310
What? You can't afford it?

113
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,780
Say it if you can't afford it.

114
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,020
This place will be ours then.

115
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,640
Chieftain.

116
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
You want to die?

117
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,670
I'll see you off.

118
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,000
You're really mad.

119
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,760
If you're capable,

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,980
why don't you play this round?

121
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,250
Dengdeng.

122
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,350
Let me do it.

123
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,159
Yes, if you want to fight my master,

124
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,330
beat her man first.

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,490
You brat look young.

126
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,050
Don't freak out later.

127
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,360
A bet is a bet.

128
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,740
If you win,

129
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
you can take him away.

130
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,120
Fine. If you lose,

131
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,550
I'll take both him and the land.

132
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,480
Bring it on.

133
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,110
OK. Let's start.

134
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,650
What's going on?

135
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,500
What magic is this?

136
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,130
It's nothing. I'm just more skilled.

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,070
Forget it.

138
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,570
Prominent figures stand out when they are young.

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,800
It's just a piece of land.

140
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,200
I can afford to lose.

141
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,140
Then keep your promise.

142
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
That's right.

143
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:54,850
Let's go.

144
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,710
It's just a piece of land.

145
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,159
Let's go.

146
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,840
Don't go too far.

147
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,480
How dare you play tricks?

148
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,730
Do you want to die?

149
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,070
Dengdeng, calm down.

150
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,000
-Give me the gun. -Master.

151
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,190
Master, spare him.

152
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,800
Give it to me.

153
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,290
Chieftain, calm down.

154
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,530
Master.

155
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,120
Forget it, Master.

156
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,610
Forget it.

157
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,720
Forget it, Master.

158
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,790
Forget it, Master.

159
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,670
Spare his life.

160
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,360
No! No!

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,480
No, no, no.

162
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,350
Go!

163
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,409
Let's go.

164
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,260
Be careful!

165
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,520
Playing dirty?

166
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,400
Are you okay, Master?

167
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,930
Master!

168
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,280
Chieftain!

169
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,710
Are you alright, Chieftain?

170
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,640
Chieftain.

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,620
Chieftain.

172
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,880
Hurry. Help him up.

173
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
Don't be afraid.

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,590

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,920
What do you mean?

525
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,490
Nothing.

526
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,720
How did they die?

527
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,080
I don't know.

528
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,820
Maybe they did a lot of bad things

529
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,270
so they got punished by the God.

530
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,320
But that's not the point.

531
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,380
Shiqi told me she missed you.

532
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,370
She wants to see you.

533
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,160
Okay.

534
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,070
Lu Yan.

535
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I haven't seen Miss Bai for a long time.

536
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,830
I'm gonna go to see her.

537
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,970
I'll be back soon.

538
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,290
Okay, go ahead.

539
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,220
Let's go.

540
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,350
Sir.

541
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,360
Is there anything unusual about these bodies?

542
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,850
They have no shadows.

543
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,300
They really have no shadows.

544
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,710
Why is it like that?

545
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,820
Life is unpredictable.

546
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,310
Their chieftain fought against Master yesterday.

547
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,670
They all died today.

548
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,930
That's exactly what Master wants.

549
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,180
Master was so angry yesterday.

550
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,450
Now she should feel better.

551
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,250
Xin.

552
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,640
Follow me.

553
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,490
The eclipse totem.

554
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,090
You know this totem?

555
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,790
Three thousand years ago,

556
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,710
Master decided to seal her evil spirit

557
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,560
to bring an end to the human wars.

558
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,760
Stop it.

559
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,140
Yun Xi.

560
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,310
Are you really willing

561
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,160
to kill me

562
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,300
for those weak humans?

563
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,640
I'm not trying to kill you.

564
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,830
If I let you continue doing this,

565
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,730
you will make a huge mistake.

566
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,190
The spirit clan

567
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,430
will have no living space

568
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,740
in this world.

569
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,200
What I want is

570
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,870
spirit beings living together with humans.

571
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,630
Stop it.

572
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,760
Don't make more mistakes.

573
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,430
Be good.

574
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,570
Don't make more mistakes, okay?

575
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,140
You're wrong. It's you.

576
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Only I can lead the whole spirit clan

577
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,760
and create a new world.

578
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,880
Only me.

579
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,790
Only me.

580
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,670
You're so stubborn.

581
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,170
Don't blame me for sealing you.

582
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,730
Master sealed Dark Spirit

583
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,930
in the ancient sacred tree on the other side of the East Sea.

584
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,380
I saw this totem in Spirit.

585
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,520
Yun Xi.

586
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,830
No! Yun Xi!

587
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,330
Yun Xi, no!

588
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,110
I thought

589
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,190
it was all over.

590
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,760
I didn't expect

591
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,400
it was just the beginning.

592
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,550
Sir, you mean...

593
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,180
Xin, I saw this totem

594
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,610
in the underground palace as well.

595
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,080
It was right next to the corpse of Zhu Rong.

596
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,180
It seemed

597
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,060
she was resurrected by Zhu Rong.

598
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,010
Oh no.

599
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,380
Master had sealed her for thousands of years.

600
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,030
She has deep resentment.

601
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,880
She will definitely come back for revenge on Master.

602
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,140
Even...

603
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,670
Even what?

604
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,860
Master once told me

605
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,300
if evil spirit ever breaks free from the sacred tree and is back,

606
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,770
not only will Master be devoured by her

607
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,680
and become her shadow,

608
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,950
but her energy will increase

609
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,680
and she'll bring a disaster to the world.

610
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,100
No wonder.

611
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,350
No wonder I found Dengdeng's shadow today

612
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,100
lighter than others'.

613
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,090
That means she's already started taking actions.

614
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,530
Yesterday's purple thunder

615
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,430
and the livestock in the village today...

616
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,380
No wonder Master reacted so fiercely

617
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,350
to those people from Hongqing Stronghold yesterday.

618
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,670
Master had always been kind.

619
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,290
Although she's a little bad-tempered,

620
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,430
she wouldn't kill anyone.

621
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,520
Right.

622
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,560
She acted differently to Hongqing Stronghold

623
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,170
than usual.

624
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,300
Sir, Master has no memory of her past life.

625
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,330
She still has no clues to these things.

626
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,610
Let's stop it

627
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,850
before it happens.

628
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,940
Where is the East Coast?

629
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,060
I'll take you there.

630
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,830
[Palanquin]

631
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,770
Bear with it.

632
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,120
Bear with it.

633
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,770
Is it here?

634
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,050
Shiqi.

635
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,690
Shiqi.

636
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,950
Look whom I brought here.

637
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,100
Dengdeng.

638
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,840
Miss Bai.

639
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,290
You're good?

640
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,050
I'm glad you came back safely.

641
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,330
You have no idea.

642
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,790
Everyone worried about you so much

643
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,750
when we heard what happened to you,

644
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,720
especially Gu Beixi.

645
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,490
He sent people to ask about you everywhere.

646
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,040
He was so worried.

647
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,490
Dengdeng.

648
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,440
Don't embarrass me out there.

649
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
I'm telling the truth, okay?

650
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,430
He even cried a lot.

651
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,790
Your clothes...

652
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,960
I borrowed this from the villagers.

653
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,420
It may not look that good,

654
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,490
but it's warm.

655
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,670
You know what?

656
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,370
At the beginning,

657
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,340
I was worried that they didn't like me.

658
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,790
But later I found that they were all very nice

659
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,170
and they took good care of me.

660
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,320
What happened to you?

661
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,510
Why do you volunteer in the medical team?

662
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,250
I got injured

663
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,100
when I escaped from that shabby temple.

664
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,030
I fainted halfway.

665
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,740
The doctor here saved me.

666
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,570
Anyway I'm homeless now.

667
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,830
I have no one to rely on.

668
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,260
It's good to stay here, learn medicine

669
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,170
and help people.

670
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,800
I heard everything about your family from Gu Beixi.

671
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,240
Don't be too sad.

672
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,810
Everything will be fine.

673
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,630
Those bastards from Xiongya Stronghold

674
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,290
will go to hell for sure.

675
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,610
It's so unfair.

676
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,900
They are living a carefree life

677
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,970
after ruining others' lives.

678
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,060
Dengdeng.

679
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,570
It's all in the past.

680
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,200
Besides,

681
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,050
look at me now. I'm doing great.

682
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,090
Treating patients is accumulating good karma.

683
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,570
Good people will be rewarded.

684
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,060
You...

685
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,500
You are so kind.

686
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,170
Doctor! Doctor!

687
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,190
Doctor, save my father!

688
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:34,050
Come on.

689
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,840
Hurry up.

690
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,590
Hurry.

691
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,640
These people are really badly injured.

692
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,800
Yes.

693
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,860
There was a thunder in the village yesterday.

694
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,960
It burned dozens of houses.

695
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,330
Many people were injured.

696
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,640
We almost can't handle it today.

697
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,610
Let me help.

698
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,930
You're gonna use your energy?

699
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,970
Be careful.

700
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,120
Don't worry.

701
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,990
Doctor.

702
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,090
I'm gonna go over there.

703
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,180
Be careful.

704
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,840
Let me help you.

705
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,690
Try not to move.

706
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,510
Shadow.

707
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,620
My shadow.

708
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,700
Once Black Saintess is revived,

709
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:28,850
everything

710
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,850
will be devoured.

711
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,300
Darkness

712
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,680
and shadows

713
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,250
will rule the world.

714
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,580
Sir, she's really here.

715
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,960
[Peaceful Powder]

716
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,180
Dengdeng.

717
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,890
Dengdeng!

718
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,770
Dengdeng!

719
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:10,380
Dengdeng!

720
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,230
Are you alright?

721
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,800
Dengdeng!

722
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Dengdeng.

723
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,860
Dengdeng!

724
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,920
What happened?

725
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,570
Dengdeng.

726
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,200
What's going on?

727
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:33,860
Dengdeng.

728
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,200
Shiqi.

729
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,590
Dengdeng.

730
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,460
Dengdeng!

731
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,600
If you kill me, she won't live either.

732
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,199
Do you think

733
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,199
you can save her?

734
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,330
What do you mean?

735
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,360
Yun Xi and I

736
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,150
are a whole.

737
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,870
If you hurt me,

738
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,710
she will get hurt too.

739
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,580
If you kill me,

740
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,420
she will die too.

741
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,630
If you kill me today,

742
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,960
when you go back,

743
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,380
you'll see her dead body.

744
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,960
What do you want?

745
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,880
What?

746
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
Be patient.

747
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,160
Do you know how much I hate this world?

748
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,350
After I devour Yun Xi,

749
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,100
I will make this world

750
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,160
the shadow under my feet.

751
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,350
Dengdeng!

752
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,850
Dengdeng!

753
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,480
What's wrong with Dengdeng?

754
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,690
She was fine just now.

755
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,370
I don't know why

756
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,420
she suddenly became like this.

757
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,720
Yes, she suddenly flew out.

758
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,160
and vomited blood all over the floor.

759
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,440
Then she fell unconscious

760
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,300
like someone had strangled her.

761
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,290
I'm gonna take her back.

762
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,770
How did they disappear?

763
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,670
Yeah.

764
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,600
What's going on?

765
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,550
Did I see or not?

766
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,230
Yes,

767
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,200
Yes, we saw it.

768
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,840
They're gone.

769
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,300
They disappeared all of a sudden.

770
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,620
Yeah.

771
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,950
Master. Master.

772
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,800
Master looks much better.

773
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,300
Luckily we made it on time.

774
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,670
She's fine for now.

775
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,240
Another one.

776
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,800
Dengdeng.

777
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,110
You've been lying in bed for hours.

778
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,710
Why aren't you awake yet?

779
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,460
Give it to me.

780
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,740
Let's wait and see.

781
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,850
Sir,

782
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,200
you've transferred so much energy to her,

783
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,380
but she hasn't waken up.

784
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,510
Is there anything wrong?

785
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,310
Dengdeng got badly injured this time.

786
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,690
Even if I gave her a lot of energy

787
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,550
to save her,

788
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,360
she still needs three hours to wake up.

789
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,340
It seems

790
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,310
what that person said is true.

791
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,620
She and Dengdeng are a whole.

792
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,560
If I hadn't stopped just now,

793
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,640
the consequences would have been a real disaster.

794
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,400
Sir, it's not your fault.

795
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,500
Xin didn't know about this either.

796
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,770
In fact, she knew

797
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,330
you wouldn't do anything to her.

798
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,740
Let's go. Dengdeng is supposed to wake up.

799
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,600
Okay.

800
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,330
She's awake.

801
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,680
That's great.

802
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,460
-Dengdeng. -She's awake.

803
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,430
I'm gonna tell Lu Yan.

804
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,160
Dengdeng.

805
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,450
She's finally awake.

806
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,000
She's awake, right?

807
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,750
Dengdeng is awake.

808
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,070
Don't get up. Lie down for a while.

809
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,190
Are you okay?

810
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,440
She's awake.

811
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,980
What happened to you, my girl?

812
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,800
I don't know.

813
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,770
Lu Yan.

814
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,490
What happened to me?

815
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
What happened to her?

816
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,000
Is she alright?

817
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,740
Dengdeng's vitals are normal.

818
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,800
She's okay.

819
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,580
That's great.

820
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,000
Her uncle, bring me the herb medicine.

821
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,230
Right, the medicine.

822
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,060
Here.

823
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
I told you I'm okay.

824
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,480
Don't worry.

825
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,810
There you go.

826
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:45,300
Time for medicine.

827
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,670
Here.

828
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,550
Come on.

829
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,510
Have another sip.

830
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,230
Okay.

831
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,710
How do you feel?

832
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,920
Much better. I'm fine.

833
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,110
It's weird.

834
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,810
I didn't see anyone hurt you.

835
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,450
Why are you so badly injured this time?

836
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,950
Right, Dengdeng.

837
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,210
You'd always been healthy.

838
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,370
How come you suddenly became like this?

839
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,310
Yeah.

840
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,740
Shiqi and I freaked out.

841
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,170
Yes. Thanks to Second-in-command,

842
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,500
he's skilled to exorcise the evil from you.

843
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,120
Otherwise...

844
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,330
Are you okay?

845
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,040
I'm fine.

846
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,200
Dengdeng has just recovered.

847
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,230
She needs to rest.

848
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,890
Why don't you all go back and have a rest?

849
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,230
I can stay with her.

850
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,490
It's okay.

851
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,760
I'm awake. I don't need company.

852
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,900
Don't worry.

853
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,270
Go.

854
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,240
What's wrong?

855
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,120
You all look upset. Don't you believe me?

856
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,640
Do you want me to run in front of you?

857
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,750
Don't.

858
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,430
Dengdeng, you should rest.

859
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,360
Lie down.

860
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,580
Then you should just leave now.

861
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,420
I'm so sleepy.

862
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,200
You should go.

863
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,690
Otherwise, how can I sleep?

864
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,950
All right.

865
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,080
Guys, go back.

866
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,800
It's okay. It's normal.

867
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,700
It is inevitable to get bewitched living in the mountains.

868
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,630
That's right. You should leave now.

869
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,440
I just want to sleep quietly.

870
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,500
I'll be fine after sleep.

871
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,460
Let's go.

872
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,060
Don't touch me.

873
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,650
Have a good rest.

874
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,020
I'm gonna go, Master.

875
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,170
Call dad if you need anything.

876
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,220
Sir,

877
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,720
you've been frowning all night.

878
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,020
What are you thinking?

879
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,710
Dengdeng's shadow is fading.

880
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,780
I just checked

881
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,620
the energy in her body

882
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,050
and found almost half of it had gone.

883
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,120
If this keeps going,

884
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,210
she'll die in a few days

885
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,910
even with my energy.

886
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,820
Is it that fast?

887
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,780
So...

888
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,800
Can Master only wait here

889
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,670
to be devoured by her?

890
