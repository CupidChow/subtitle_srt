Father!

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
I told you

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,550
this was a misunderstanding.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,870
-Why did you... -What misunderstanding?

31

He used to want to kill you.

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,090
Living with a man like this for all your life

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,090
is too dangerous.

34

Write the divorce letter now.

37

Write a divorce letter?

You've gone too far, huh?

39

You've gone too far, Yu.

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,230
I...

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,310

Dengdeng and I...

I'm talking to Dengdeng.

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,920
Why are you interrupting?

48
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,979
I won't divorce him.

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,380
Right.

50
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
I support you.

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,250
It's him who has

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,930
been protecting me all the way here.

53
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,480
Otherwise,

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,079
I would have died many times.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,150
Can you still see

56
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,100
such a lively daughter?

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,170
What you said makes sense.

58
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,829
You're blinded by love again.

59
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,150
Am I blinded by love

60
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,940
or do you have prejudice against him?

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,430
I can see clearly

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,920
how he treats me, and I know it clearly.

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,930
I don't need you guys to tell me.

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,680
Dengdeng,

65
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,070
don't think that I don't know you well.

66
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,740
I've also told you

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,760
if a woman

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,280
wants to achieve something big,

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,340
she can't be greedy for man's beauty.

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,230
Even if you can't find a toad with three legs,

71
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,190
a man with two legs

72
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,140
can be found everywhere.

73
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,260
Go back to the Qingquan Stronghold.

74
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll find the best one for you.

75
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,730
I don't care.

76
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,230
I don't like any of them.

77
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,590
Besides,

78
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,130
when I married him,

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,990
I asked for many dowries from them.

80
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,320
If I have to divorce him,

81
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,830
all those dowries should be returned to them.

82
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes.

83
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,500
Your ladyship is right.

84
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,300
Chieftain Yu,

85
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,180
the dowries of our Xin's Sedan Chair Company

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,440
are worth over a hundred thousand silver dollars at least.

87
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,030
Who do you think you are?

88
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,920
Just return the dowries.

89
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
I'll see how you can return them.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,060
I will return them.

91
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,220
You will return them?

92
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,710
Yes!

93
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,530
How are you going to return them?

94
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,380
Let me calculate it.

95
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,460
If you want a divorce...

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,500
Calculate it carefully.

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,450
It'll be considered as

98
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,310
our Qingquan Stronghold's debt.

99
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,310
According to the daily doubled interest,

100
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,780
if we add up all the compound interest...

101
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,960
Add up all the compound interest...

102
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
How much will it be?

103
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,980
More than 90,000 taels.

104
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,610
You can't pay it off all your life.

105
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,920
I'll pay it back for you.

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,500
What are you talking about?

107
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Shut up.

108
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,650
None of your business.

109
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,460

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,909
Have you dealt with everything properly?

175
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,080
The medicine store was burned,

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,200
but Long Ears was caught.

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,720
Come on. You must be hungry.

178
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,990
You're full. It's my turn.

179
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,630
Go and solve the remaining problems.

180
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,390
Yes.

181
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Wait.

182
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,600
They ruined the trade.

183
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,100
Go and give them some trouble.

184
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,150
Dahai is coming back.

185
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,850
We're going back to the Qingquan Stronghold.

186
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,370
Old friend, I didn't use you this time.

187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,100
Right.

188
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,260
Your Lv Family's ancestral fortune-telling skill is just a trick.

189
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,250
Nonsense.

190
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,930
But this peach wood sword is real.

191
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,960
Once the sword is drawn out,

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,490
something bad will happen.

193
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,130
I'll go get some of it.

194
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,260
Where are you going?

195
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,480
There's food but no wine.

196
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll go get some wine.

197
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,080
Dengdeng doesn't allow you to drink wine.

198
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,310
If neither you nor I tell her,

199
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,630
how would she know?

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
I'll be back soon.

201
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,310
Don't tell anyone about it.

202
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,910
Can't you make her less worried?

203
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,820
Got it.

204
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,020
Okay.

205
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,860
Thanks. Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

206
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,110
So many people.

207
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,610
So many delicious food.

208
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,140
Come here.

209
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,700
Hello, sir.

210
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,670
Have a seat over there.

211
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,350
Hello.

212
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,400
I haven't seen you for a long time.

213
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,260
I haven't seen you for a long time.

214
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,160
In order to hide their own identities,

215
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,690
these creatures of the Spirit Clan

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,210
have suffered a lot.

217
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,250
They either lost their lives,

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,700
or even lost their original bodies.

219
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,020
Now I think about it. They're really pathetic.

220
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,100
Just like the last concubine,

221
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,150
she loves Chief Bai so much.

222
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,500
She doesn't even dare to tell him about her real identity.

223
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,470
Can't they love each other just because

224
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,030
they were born different,

225
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,760
and come from different races?

226
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,750
Actually, the Spiritual Clan and humans are the same.

227
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,880
They are both raised by their parents.

228
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,890
They both know love, hatred, coldness and warmth.

229
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,760
He knows pain when he's hurt.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,240
He'll be grateful if you treat him well.

231
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,720
Actually, they also want to

232
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,750
live an ordinary life,

233
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,090
and live a simple and happy life

234
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,560
with their beloved ones.

235
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,420
Lu Yan, let's help them.

236
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,220
How do you want to help them?

237
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,110
I want to

238
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,960
try the energy you've taught me to use.

239
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,520
Sir, your wine.

240
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,380
Thank you.

241
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,770
-Just get back to work. -You're welcome.

242
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,960
Old man, I've said everything I need to say.

243
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,760
Why did you still come here?

244
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,860
Help!

245
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,350
Run!

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,570
What species is this?

247
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,040
Miss.

248
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,260
Run!

249
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,070
-Are you okay? -I'm fine.

250
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,180
What is this?

251
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,330
Catch him!

252
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Catch him!

253
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,900
Father!

254
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,870
-Dad! -Yu!

255
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,360
-Don't go over there. -Yu!

256
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,360
What's wrong with you?

257
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,340
-Yu! -Dad!

258
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Xin, summon the sedan chair.

259
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,550
Yu.

260
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,010
Father.

261
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,260
They are all monsters.

262
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,200
Catch them all!

263
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,110
Catch them!

264
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,840
Father, what's wrong with you?

265
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:50,970
Go!

266
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,590
Go.

267
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Go.

268
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,990
Hurry up!

269
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,580
Yu.

270
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,730
Lu Yan.

271
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,670
He will protect himself. Let's go.

272
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,860
Why are you still standing there?

273
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,770
Chase them!

274
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,520
Yes!

275
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,760
Sir, don't be afraid.

276
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,310
I'm here.

277
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,810
Be quick. Come on.

278
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
I've set a defensive barrier for this sedan chair.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,330
These animals are safe.

280
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
What's wrong with my father?

281
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,870
Why did he suddenly hurt other people?

282
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,250
Now we must find a reliable place

283
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,300
and stay here

284
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,390
so that we can save and treat Chieftain Yu.

285
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,390
My uncle once said

286
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,810
every time he came to Yingdu,

287
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,550
he would go to a shabby temple outside the city and stay there.

288
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,750
Why don't we go there?

289
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,800
Okay.

290
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
No, Dahai.

291
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,490
Dahai hasn't been saved out yet.

292
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll go save Dahai. You guys go first.

293
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,390
Okay. I'll entrust Dahai to you.

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,220
Remember.

295
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,840
After you find Dahai, disguise yourselves and leave the city.

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,900
Be careful.

297
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,630
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

298
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,320
Let's go.

299
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,710
Check the place in the front.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,230
Yes!

301
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,350
This way.

302
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,360
Come on. Drink the wine.

303
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,630
Why is it so noisy outside tonight?

304
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,530
Right.

305
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,310
Why are there many people there? What's the matter?

306
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,640
Forget it. Let's drink.

307
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,450
Come on. Eat.

308
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,830
Young Master, what are you doing here?

309
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,300
Chief Bai ordered

310
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,220
you to release Peng Dahai.

311
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,680
What? You don't obey Chief Bai's order?

312
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,650
Hurry up.

313
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,020
Don't you obey your chief's order?

314
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,850
Hurry up, or he'll fire you.

315
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,390
Release him now.

316
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,110
Okay.

317
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,380
What's going on?

318
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,810
Can't you sense it?

319
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,920
Didn't the chief say he'd release me?

320
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,050
Rescue me from jail?

321
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,580
It's fake?

322
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's go.

323
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,240
Hurry up!

324
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,890
This guy...

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,480
Let's go.

326
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,540
How dare you hit me!

327
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:37,550
[Order for Arrest]

328
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,350
Come and have a look.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:47,500
[Order for Arrest]

330
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,430
If you find these people, go to the police station and report it.

331
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,830
Then you'll be rewarded.

332
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,410
Chieftain Gu,

333
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,410
as soon as I came out,

334
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,230
you performed the drama of Lin Chong Fled At Night.

335
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,030
It was so exciting.

336
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,850
The more exciting part is coming.

337
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,240
Well, who did you guys offend?

338
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,990
What do you mean by you guys?

339
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,160
It's us.

340
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,430
From today on,

341
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,430
let's play the game of

342
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,480
catching a turtle in the jar with him.

343
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,079
Catching a turtle in the jar.

344
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,369
Who is the turtle?

345
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,410
We are.

346
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,099
Go!

348
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,540
Stop!

349
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,960
Raise your head.

350
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,290
Go away at once!

351
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,580
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,580
She reeks of alcohol.

353
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,310
Stop!

354
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,640
What a bad luck.

355
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,980
Go away!

356
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,180
Wait.

357
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,070
Take off your turban.

358
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,100
I told you to take off your turban!

359
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,030
Take it off!

[Order for Arrest]

364
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,650
Interesting.

365
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
Take off your turban.

366
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,340
Take it off!

367
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,600
Hurry up!

368
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,110
Hurry up.

Mr. Scar Face.

370
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,760
Mr. Scar Face.

371
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,530
-Ms. Bai. -Ms. Bai.

372
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,000
You two know each other?

373
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,700
He once saved my life.

374
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,520
Mr. Scar Face, where are you going?

375
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
I'll take you there.

376
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,670
Ms. Bai,

377
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,420
if you do this, it's difficult for us to do our job.

378
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,160
Yes.

379
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,930
Can you still do your job if you offend me?

380
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,620
-Right. -Right.

381
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
Let's go.

382
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's go, Mr. Scar Face.

383
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,110
Why are you here?

384
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,870
To help you.

385
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,890
-Help me? -Chieftain Gu! Chieftain Gu!

386
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,740
Who are you?

387
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,490
I'm...

388
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Yu Dengdeng's apprentice, Peng Dahai.

389
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,720
Isn't Peng Dahai a man?

390
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,470
No, my lady.

391
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,540
I don't have time to explain.

392
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,200
In short, I was poisoned by a drug of the Spiritual Clan.

393
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm sometimes a woman, and sometimes a man.

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,860
Where are you going?

395
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,900
I'll take you there.

396
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
We're going to the south of the city.

397
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,490
Can you drive?

398
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,570
I've never driven a car before, but I've seen others drive it.

399
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,980
My driver drives this car every day.

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,840
Even if I couldn't drive, I've learned it by seeing it.

401
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,590
Sit tight.

402
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,820
Oh my God.

403
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,230
A car isn't started like this.

404

All the animals are settled.

414
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,830
Let me see. Come on.

415
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,460
There are spiritual worms inside my father's body.

416
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,490
Father!

417
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,150
Father, are you okay?

418
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,910
Yu!

419
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,840
Father!

420
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,440
Father!

421
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,480
-Yu. -Father.

422
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,130
Yu.

423
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,990

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,850
Dengdeng.

425
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,620
Did I scare you?

426
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,440
Chieftain Yu,

427
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,550
do you remember how the spiritual worms

428
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,150
entered your body?

429
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,220
I only remember that

430
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,560
I sneaked into the banquet hall.

431
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,940
There was a lot of delicious food.

432
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,430
While I was eating, I...

433
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,850
Why am I here?

434
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,130
What happened?

435
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,700
Uncle, take care of my father for me.

436
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,410
Just go.

437
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,530
Lu Yan, come out.

438
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,810
Yu.

439
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,360
I've told you many times.

440
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,110
Don't go. Don't go.

441
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,190
You insisted on going.

442
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540
How come my father got infected with spiritual worms?

443
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
It was not easy for me to find him.

444
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,050
I thought after this case was closed,

445
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,170
I could take him back to the Qingquan Stronghold

446
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,610
to enjoy a good life.

447
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,560
It seems that the long-eared member of the Spirit Clan didn't lie to us.

448
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,810
The King of Worm can control the host.

449
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,000
He was probably trying to kill people

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,060
by using Chieftain Yu at the banquet.

451
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,440
He made a scene at the banquet

452
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,500
so as to distract others' attention.

453
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,790
What a brilliant move to kill a person with a borrowed knife and create a diversion.

454
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,680
I can't let him get close to my father anymore.

455
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
As long as he is still alive for one more day,

456
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,770
my father will be in danger for one more day.

457
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,050
The Spirit Clan in the city

458
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,120
will continue to suffer the pain of being bitten by spiritual worms.

459
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,860
We must find him as soon as possible.

460
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,590
There were many people at the banquet today and the situation was complicated.

461
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,540
It was not difficult to sneak in.

462
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,390
He was wearing a windbreaker

463
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,230
and walking with strange sounds.

464
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,570
Those who have seen him must remember him.

465
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,830
We can go to the Bai Mansion to inquire about it.

466
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,430
Maybe we can find some clues.

467
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,310
We can look for...

[Sanskrit Flows All over the World]

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,650
Speak of the devil. You came.

471
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,730
-Hurry up. Take this away. -Okay.

472
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,310
I have a phobia about blood.

473
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,240
Sir, I'm sorry.

474
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,590
I didn't expect

475
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,010
Paralyzed Yu would be out of his mind.

476
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,900
Sometimes, the Spirit Clan made trouble.

477
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,170
Sometimes, he was out of his mind.

478
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,990
He didn't look like

479
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,540
being out of his mind.

480
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,090
Right.

481
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,440
Could it be that he had also

482
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,510
got infected by a worm of the Spirit Clan?

483
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,370
Don't worry.

484
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,210
I will investigate it and find out the truth.

485
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,630
You've said the same thing before.

486
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,110
Where is the suspect of the Spirit Clan you've caught?

487
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,230
He's... He's dead.

488
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,690
He's dead?

489
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,110
What about the physical evidence?

490
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,420
It's gone, too.

491
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:52,740
No.

492
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,290
Sir, don't be angry.

493
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,580
Please don't be angry.

494
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,910
Be careful of your wound. Be careful of it.

495
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,670
Give me three days. Just three days.

496
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,410
I promise I'll catch the suspect.

497
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,010
For the people of Yingdu,

498
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,130
it's fine that my arm is injured.

499
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,760
But those who came here tonight

500
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,710
are people with fame and prestige.

501
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,050
If the higher-ups know about this,

502
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,370
will it be useful if you only catch Paralyzed Yu?

503
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,490
A man in a windbreaker.

504
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,950
He also walked with strange sounds.

505
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,270
One more photo.

506
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,310
It's that journalist.

507
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,270
Journalist?

508
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,470
Do you know him?

509
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,670
No.

510
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,300
But at the banquet,

511
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,620
I saw him sneaking around.

512
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,260
He disappeared while I was not noticing it.

513
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,880
His expression was also weird,

514
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,950
so I remember him.

515
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,920
But there are so many newspaper offices in the city.

516

If we search one by one,

In the past, if there was a banquet in our mansion,

520
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,540
it was common for the journalists

521
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,670
to come to report it.

522
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,860
So they needed certificates to go in and out.

523
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,860
They also needed to get registered.

I thought there was something suspicious about it.

528

What's wrong with you?

688
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,490
I'll go ask Mr. Lu to come.

689
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,290
It's too late.

690

Let me do it.

Help me pin him down.

How about just giving it up, Dengdeng?

699
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,960
I'll try again.

700
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,630
I can do it.

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,040
Dengdeng, listen to me.

Dengdeng, you've done your best.

707

Listen to me. Stop it.

Don't try to persuade me.

709

Your ladyship, you can't hold on like this.

Dengdeng!

711
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,380
Get out!

712
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,670
Get out!

713
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,790
Get out!

You've done your best, Dengdeng.

717
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,430
Uncle,

718
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,510
don't persuade me.

719
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,680
I was still young when my mother passed away.

720
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,160
I couldn't do anything.

721
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,510
I finally found my father.

722
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,740
I can't watch him die without doing anything.

723
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
But before your father wakes up,

724
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,520
you might pass out.

725
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,260
How am I going to explain it to Yu after he wakes up?

726
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,170
Dengdeng.
