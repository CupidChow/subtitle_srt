[Episode 21]

27
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,380
Dengdeng, listen to me.

28
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,110
You've done your best, Dengdeng.

29
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,759
Uncle,

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,570
don’t persuade me.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,910
I was still young when my mother passed away.

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,630
I couldn't do anything.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,770
I finally found my father.

34
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,830
I can't watch him die.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,710
But before your father wakes up,

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,730
you would have fallen sick.

37
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
What should I tell Yu when he wakes up?

38
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,610
Dengdeng.

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,200
It seems to work.

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,700
Dengdeng.

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,180
Yu.

42
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,240
I just don't understand.

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,260
I can help others

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
and save others.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,570
But why can't I save my father?

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,660
Dengdeng.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,250
The spirit beings are different from humans.

48
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,700
We can only find the cure slowly.

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,340
Don't blame yourself.

50
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,030
What if my father can't wait?

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,610
Then I’ll lose him.

52
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,620
Uncle,

53
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,880
don’t comfort me.

54
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,780
I know what I am capable of.

55
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,980
Since I was young,

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,060
I've never been good at kung fu,

57
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,380
and gotten through with my tricks.

58
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,510
I thought I was fearless.

59
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,050
In fact, it's because you spoiled me

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,960
and fellows protected me.

61
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,570
Now I realize

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,180
how incompetent I am.

63
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,070
Who said that?

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,190
Girl,

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,580
our village is poor.

66
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,970
When we didn't have enough food,

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,440
you didn't eat the food yourself.

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,390
You shared the food with everyone.

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,940
You'll do anything for us.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,390
You were the first to get out

71
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,380
and the last one to come back.

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
Who said you're incompetent?

73
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,160
I'm not as good as you said.

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,990
You silly girl.

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,920
Dengdeng is the best.

76
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,230
You

77
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,050
remember what your father said.

78
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,650
The hurdles are difficult to pass,

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
but they must be passed.

80
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,880
Every step is difficult,

81
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,690
but we still have to go step by step.

82
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Mother.

83
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,220
Father, mother.

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
How is my daughter?

85
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,870
How is she?

86
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,100
Not good.

87
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,970
Come on. Apply it on her.

88
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,570
What happened to your leg?

89
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,860
I'm fine. I applied medicine. Hurry.

90
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,780
What do you mean?

91
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,650
You'll be crippled if you don't treat it.

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,720
Go now.

93
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,790
Let's go.

94
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,150
Hurry up.

95
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,050
Daughter, I'm here.

96
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,980
It's okay.

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,850
[Wine]

98
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,350
It's all my fault.

99
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,600
Since your mother passed away,

100
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,710
As a rough man,

101
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,170
I didn't take good care of you

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,590
and let you get infected.

103
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,490
Now, there is famine.

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,210
There's nothing delicious for you

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,760
or any medicine.

106
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,100
You've suffered.

107
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,920
Dad.

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,780
Daughter.

109
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,890
You're awake.

110
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,900
Dad, where did you get the wine?

111
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,990
Did you go down the mountain?

112
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,200
Gu Beixi told me

113
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
none of the rabbits came out

114
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,880
because the heavy snow covered the mountain.

115
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,260
How dare you go down the mountain?

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,850
Don't listen to Beixi.

117
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,220
He is timid.

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,970
He was scared even when ice pick fell.

119
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,460
Who am I?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,020
I'm strong.

121
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,670
Dad.

122
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,110
Didn't you say the hurdles are difficult to pass but they must be passed?

123
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,930
Yes.

124
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,880
Every step is difficult,

125
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,950
but we still have to go step by step.

[Wine]

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,470
Dad, what happened to your leg?

128
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,240
Don't move.

129
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,720
It's okay.

130
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,880
I'm still tough.

131
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Don't worry.

132
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,600
Dad.

133
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,990
If I'm recovered,

134
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,010
don't force me to write calligraphy

135
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,650
or do needlework.

136
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,850
I'll be bored to death.

137
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,680
Okay.

138
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,250
When my daughter recovers,

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,780
I'll take you to hunt.

140
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,670
Let's go.

141
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,520
Go get the rabbit. Okay.

142
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,320
Deal.

143
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,310
Deal.

144
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,520
Go to sleep.

145
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,090
The hurdles are difficult to pass but they must be passed.

146

Every step is difficult, but we still have to go step by step.

The hurdles are difficult to pass but they must be passed.

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,800
Every step is difficult,

149

but we still have to go step by step.

150
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,490
I won't let anything happen to you.

151
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,980
We're going up the mountain to catch rabbits.

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,630
Just cry out if you want.

153
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,630
Who wants to cry?

154
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,790
That's too girly.

155
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,360
It's not my style.

156
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,550
Dengdeng.

157
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,980
You don't have to act tough in front of me.

158
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,190
Can you give me a hug?

159
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,910
Lu Yan.

160
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,050
I'm really scared.

161
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,130
I've never seen

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,140
my father like this.

163
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,160
I'm so scared.

164
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,100
I'm afraid we don't have chances

165
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,890
to do many things together.

166
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,370
I'm afraid to watch him

167
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,200
being tortured by bugs

168
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,890
without being able to do anything.

169
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm also afraid that after I finally found him,

170
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,550
I'll lose him soon.

171
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,030
Don't be afraid.

172
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,670
I'm here.

173
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,180
I'll always be with you.

174
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,790
By the way,

175
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,970
what did you do today?

176
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,650
I found something.

177
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,500
What is this?

178
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,070
Reporter Shao’s diary.

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,880
When I saw Chieftain Yu didn’t get better today,

180
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,370
I remembered that we missed something.

181
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,700
Maybe Reporter Shao is not the King of Worm.

182
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,070
Or,

183
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,480
he's not entirely King of Worm.

184
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,800
Reporter Shao

185
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,810
likes to write down his thoughts

186
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,880
on his notebook.

187
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,150
But why he happened to stop doing so

188
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,520
one month ago?

189
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,790
And this notebook has dust

190
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,060
on its cover.

191
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,020
People's habits are hard to change.

192
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,060
So

193
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,370
Reporter Shao fell for King of Worm's trap.

194
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,110
He is not King of Worm.

195
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,650
He was manipulated by King of Worm.

196
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,860
Not only was he manipulated,

197
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,500
but King of Worm is inside him.

198
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,800
When we killed Reporter Shao,

199
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,230
it escaped when we weren't looking.

200
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,440
If Reporter Shao

201
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,080
was really possessed by King of Worm,

202
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,700
after the bug comes out,

203
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,950
there must be traces on his body.

204
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,180
The body is with the captain.

205
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,240
He should be sent to the morgue outside the city gate.

206
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,590
Let's go find him now.

207
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,630
Dengdeng.

208
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,990
I've been there.

209
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,300
I went to check Reporter Shao's body.

210
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,980
There was a fist-size hole

211
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,880
in his chest.

212
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,850
That wound wasn't left by an ordinary gun.

213
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,840
The wound is surrounded

214
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,450
by radiating blood marks.

215
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,510
They are not in sync.

216
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,150
Now it seems

217
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,270
it must be the trace of King of Worm coming in and out.

218
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
This King of Worm is so vicious.

219
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,410
Poor Reporter Shao.

220
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,200
King of Worm uses his body as a disguise

221
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
and did all kinds of evil things,

222
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,350
making him never rest in peace.

223
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,280
I took his palm in the secret room today.

224
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,540
I knew his strength.

225
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,190
It's more than enough to take him down.

226
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,650
But I didn't expect

227
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,220
his energy would increase in an instant

228
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,180
and he can make his power increase so much

229
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,900
in such a short time.

230
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,410
I think

231
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,070
it's related to the spirit worm sneaking into his body.

232
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,180
In that case,

233
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,620
King of Worm not only spreads bugs

234
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,790
and make spirit worm deal.

235
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,980
He also used these worms to absorb other people's power,

236
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,290
and then took it back.

237
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,920
He was capturing a wolf with bare hands.

238
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,780
He got so much money

239
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,390
but still hung on a dark web all day long.

240
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,540
He doesn't care about ordinary pleasures.

241
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,200
What does he want?

242
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,930
The trade of spirit worm is lucrative.

243
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,710
Spirit creatures with long ears

244
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,860
are willing to be agents

245
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,870
for this evil business.

246
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,590
It seems that King of Worm

247
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,360
that they used their feature of coveting money

248
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,320
to achieve the real purpose behind him.

249
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,580
Energy?

250
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,900
That's right.

251
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,850
He's sinister and cunning.

252
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,490
I wonder if there is any manipulator

253
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,750
behind this monster.

254
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,150
If there is,

255
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,430
this person

256
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,510
will absolutely ruin the world.

257
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,310
We must find him.

258

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,360
Director.

695
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,750
All the monsters are here.

696
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,550
Good.

697
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,070
Load your guns.

698
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,830
Load your gun.

Shiqi.

700
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,230
Gu Beixi.

701
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,100
Shiqi, why are you here?

702
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,720
Are you addicted?

703
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,710
No.

704
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,000
Where's Miss Yu and the others?

705
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,450
Dengeng is in a shabby temple taking care of her father.

706
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,770
Mr. Yu seems to be getting better.

707
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,390
I bought him some wine and chicken.

708
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,710
Why are you in such a hurry?

709
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:39,630
My father

710
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,920
is going to execute the spirit beings on the execution ground today.

711
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,160
When?

712
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,100
Just today.

713
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,020
All my guards were transferred.

714
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll inform Dengdeng and the others.

715
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,790
Wait.

716
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,160
Are you going to the execution ground?

717
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,150
I'll send you there.

718
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,940
Be good and go home.

719
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,970
It's dangerous.

720
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,110
I can't get you involved.

721
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,070
But you...

722
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,980
Don't worry.

723
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,370
We will be fine.

724
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,570
And your father doesn't want anything to happen to you, right?

725
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,890
Then you must come back safely.

726
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,380
Sir, what's wrong?

727
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,530
Bai Shiqi sent a message that

728
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,610
Director Bai is going to execute all the spirit beings on the execution ground.
