00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,080
in order to take away her spirit.

513
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,300
Now if you kill me,

514
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,620
you not only take your revenge

515
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,530
but also save her.

516
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,470
Who told you all this?

517
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,080
Not your business.

518
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,250
She's not my old lover.

519
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,670
I…

520
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,990
Admire her.

521
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,570
I know. Love is hard to tell.

522
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm just curious about

523
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,040
the woman who can haunt you for 3,000 years.

524
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,810
What does she look like?

525
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,980
How could she live in your heart for thousands of years

526
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,150
and make you miss her till today?

527
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,230
For saving her, you even want to kill me.

528
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,020
[Three thousand years ago. The ancient Shu battlefield.]

529
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,990
General.

530
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,150
General?

531
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,650
General,

532
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,940
passing this valley,

533
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,710
we will see the reinforcements from the Capital.

534
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,080
Be careful, the golden powder is poisonous.

535
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,180
Cover your mouth and nose.

536
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,170
Cover your mouth and nose, fellas.

537
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,920
Don't look at it, cover up now.

538
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,160
General, what happened to them?

539
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,700
They've been poisoned by the spirit clansman.

540
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,010
Now they are under an illusion.

541
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,910
Take care.

542
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,620
Okay.

543
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,490
Wake up.

544
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,550
You have no reinforcements.

545
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,320
General Yan,

546
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,440
once you die,

547
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,320
Shu is doomed.

548
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,700
As long as I have my breath,

549
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,200
that's not going to happen.

550
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,520
General Yan is truly a patriot.

551
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,270
But your patriotism

552
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,080
will kill you.

553
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,370
Zhu Rong,

554
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,310
stop killing people.

555
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,750
We came to Nine States for survival.

556
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,240
Why are you killing innocent people indiscriminately?

557
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,190
Yun Xi,

558
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,590
you're so naive.

559
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,390
The world is ruled by law of the jungle.

560
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,960
Only those who win

561
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,690
are entitled to live.

562
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,140
War

563
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,340
will only destroy the land.

564
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,400
Making it impossible for both of us to live.

565
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,090
The Nine States is vast enough.

566
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,290
Humans also have a lot of wisdom.

567
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,830
We, Spirit clansmen,

568
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,890
should learn to live

569
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,510
in this land.

570
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,190
And the two of us

571
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,270
should also live together in peace.

572
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,920
Humans are of the lower race.

573
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,190
They do not deserve to live with the spirit clan.

574
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,730
You, as the Saintess of the Spirit Clan,

575
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,330
why do you favor humans over and over again?

576
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,540
Humans or

577
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,990
Spirit clansmen,

578
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,860
the grasses and trees

579
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,090
are all lives.

580
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,080
Saintess of the Spirit Clan

581
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,910
will never say such

582
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,310
words of indulgence.

583
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,830
Yun Xi,

584
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,830
have you sealed your killing intention?

585
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,520
Without the killing intention,

586
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,010
you are abandoning our future.

587
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,550
The future of the spirit clan

588
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,560
is never reached by killing and conquering.

589
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,500
You are our Saintess,

590
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,530
don't force me to hurt you.

591
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,470
In that case,

592
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,520
forgive me for being merciless.

593
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,280
Get out of here.

594
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,660
No soldier of Shu's troops

595
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,150
will escape.

596
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,510
General, be careful.

597
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,510
You're awake.

598
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,830
It's you.

599
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,080
Where am I?

600
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,820
Don't worry, it's safe here.

601
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,860
I've set up a barrier here.

602
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,500
Other spirit clansmen can't come in.

603
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,770
Where are my soldiers?

604
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,910
Zhu Rong was heavily injured.

605
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,740
He left.

606
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,920
And your soldiers

607
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,910
also scattered to escape.

608
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,770
I'm going to find them.

609
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,480
Even if you're leaving,

610
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,730
wait until your injury is cured.

611
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,800
How do you feel?

612
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,610
Does it feel better?

613
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,650
Much better.

614
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,670
Why

615
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,810
the blood of other spirit clansmen is all green

616
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,380
but yours is red?

617
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,180
As the Saintess of the Spirit Clan,

618
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,930
I am nourished by the energy core.

619
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,950
That's why my blood is different from others.

620
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,400
Thank you for saving my life.

621
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,170
I'll find an opportunity to repay you in the future.

622
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,460
I'm only doing what I can do.

623
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,380
You don’t need to repay me.

624
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,360
I don't like to owe people favors.

625
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,230
Then if you really want to repay,

626
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,260
can you take me around the nine continents?

627
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,570
You want to go to the nine continents?

628
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,370
Although you have saved my life,

629
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,830
I still wouldn't agree with anything that might threaten

630
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,600
the safety of the people

631
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,040
in the nine continents.

632
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,900
General Yan, don't take my intention wrongly.

633
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,300
We used to

634
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,030
consider

635
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,810
humans and all other lives on the nine continents

636
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:44,730
as lower rank beings.

637
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,530
They are the food of the spirit clansmen.

638
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,270
But after arriving here,

639
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,270
I found

640
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,450
everything has a spirit.

641
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,780
The grasses and trees have hearts too.

642
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,820
How can they be easily erased?

643
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,320
So I'd like to visit the nine continents

644
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,710
to see between the humans and the spirit clansmen,

645
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,370
besides fighting each other,

646
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,219
are there other options?

647
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,590
Can you escort me for a ride?

648
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,360
So you are thinking of…

649
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,900
I've been hoping

650
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,590
that humans and spirit clansmen could live together in peace

651
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,960
and merge with each other.

652
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,710
Never had a chance

653
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,290
to understand the human world before.

654
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,630
If I am lucky enough to visit the nine continents this time,

655
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,860
maybe

656
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,980
I can find some way to solve the problem.

657
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,810
If you still have worries,

658
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,540
I won't force you.

659
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,250
I can take you to the nine continents,

660
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,780
but you have to promise me

661
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,390
not to use your energy

662
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,860
and follow me throughout the journey.

663
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,100
If you make any moves

664
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,640
that may threaten

665
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,240
the people of the nine continents,

666
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,160
I will never let you go.

667
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,620
Okay,

668
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I promise you.

669
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,360
Saintess of Spirit Clan,

670
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,050
maybe

671
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,200
she really will be the turning point between the two races.

672
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,420
What is this place?

673
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,050
Why did you bring me here?

674
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,440
This is the most prosperous market in Shu.

675
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,460
Have a look around, Miss.

676
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,300
Take your pick.

677
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,330
This is a beautiful one.

678
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,100
Let me show you.

679
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,470
Open it like this.

680
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,880
Then close it like this.

681
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,840
You can have a try.

682
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,500
Miss?

683
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,820
Excuse me?

684
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,430
You,

685
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,140
you haven't paid me the money yet.

686
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,930
Money?

687
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,680
Here you are.

688
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,740
Thanks, General.

689
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,890
Let's go.

690
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,240
What you just gave him is money?

691
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,590
With the money,

692
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,430
I can get this for exchange?

693
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,070
Doing Commerce between humans

694
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,220
requires an equal exchange.

695
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,830
Families and households,

696
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,600
all can work by themselves

697
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,590
to earn money

698
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,430
and buy what they need.

699
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,930
People take what they need

00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,170
and live an orderly life.

701

[Qian]

702
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,740
Equal exchange.

703
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:15,950
Interesting.

704
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,210
In the future, the Spirit Clan

705
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,690
will also open a market for trade.

706
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,370
If we had a market,

707
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,190
it would be called

708
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,790
Mysterious Market.

709
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,740
What do you think?

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,240
Mysterious Market?

711
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,030
Sounds not bad.

712
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,950
Then it's called Mysterious Market.

713
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,780
-Here you are.
-Thanks, officer.

714
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,050
Come on, get in line.

One bowl per person.

-Thank you. 
-Everyone has a share.

717
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,640
These

718
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,810
are your soldiers?

719
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,870
Here, yours.

720
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,590
Yeah.

721
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,720
They're giving porridge to the people.

722
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,420
The military and the people of Shu have a deep relationship.

723
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,130
This is quite common.

724
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,190
The strong do not bully the weak.

725
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,380
Instead, they are in a good relationship.

726
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,680
Humans and spirit clansmen

727
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,490
are really quite different.

728
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,760
The stronger ones among us

729
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,100
only prey on the weak,

730
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,750
and make the weak

731
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,090
die of hunger.

732
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,280
There is no such thing as relationship as you call it.

733
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,450
Other spirit clansmen perhaps are not.

734
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,820
But you do.

735
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,370
You saved me on the battlefield.

736
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,760
Isn't that because there is compassion

737
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,450
in your heart?

738
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,630
Here, is that fun?

739
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,580
Yeah, it's fun.

740
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,320
There are many kinds of relationships.

741
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,630
For example,

742
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,470
when the child is in danger,

743
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,270
parents are reckless

744
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,800
to protect their children.

745
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,070
Likewise,

746
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,830
when parents are in danger

747
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,950
their child makes the same choice.

748
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,560
Mutual protection

749
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,310
makes the world alive and well.

750
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,380
That's right.

751
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,070

What's this?

756

And there is a relationship called the love of men and women.

757
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,940
If you love each other deeply enough,

758
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,740
it is also possible to give up your life for the other.

759
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,080
What you mean is that

760
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,040
the living is willing to die instead?

761
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,360
Why is the love of men and women so powerful?

762
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,600
It's a hard thing to explain.

763
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,700
Only those who have experienced it themselves

764
