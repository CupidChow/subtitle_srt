00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,580
of delivering the dress yourself.

175
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,270
You're welcome.

176
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,970
You're welcome.

177
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,740
This is

178
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,680
the wedding present for your Chief.

179
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,480
Cool. This is...

180
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,950
And,

181
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
[Fan]

182
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,750
this,

183
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,170
is the present for your Second-in-command.

184
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,020
The flavor.

185
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,810
Thank you. Thank you so much.

186
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,240
Second-in-command is combing our master.

187
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,190
Later

188
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,730
I will deliver it

189
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,850
to him myself.

190
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,470
Is that okay?

191
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,110
It took you so long to be here.

192
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,550
You must have a drink.

193
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,020
Of course.

194
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,880
Not return without getting drunk.

195
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,210
Sure. Sure.

196
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,680
Come on. Bring Mr. Bu in.

197
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,850
Mr. Bu. Mr. Bu.

198
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,310
This way. Please.

199
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,000
This way, please. This way, please.

200
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,560
See you later.

201
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,290
See you later. See you later.

202
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,830
Please. This way.

203
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,790
I'm telling you.

204
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,290
18 chiefs from the strongholds

205
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,280
are all here today.

206
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,110
They are way much richer than Qingquan Stronghold.

207
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,920
Let's stay

208
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,590
and meet them.

209
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,640
We can win our business

210
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,320
for the next year if it goes well.

211
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,030
Understand?

212
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,030
Sure. Sure.

213
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,230
Uncle.

214
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,760
Where shall I put my hairpin?

215
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,490
It looks pretty wherever you put it.

216
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,559
Try it.

217
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,049
Here.

218
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
Try it this side.

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,039
See?

220
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm right.

221
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,950
It looks pretty no matter how.

222
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,340
So beautiful.

223
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:52,650
[Double Happiness]

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,350
Then I will put it here later.

225
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,220
Sure.

226
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,290
I think you are pretty

227
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,620
no matter how.

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,690
You have grown up.

229
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,060
You finally get married.

230
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,570
You don't fall short of your dad's expectation.

231
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,130
Listen to me.

232
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,850
Live a good life with him.

233
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,190
If Lu Yan

234
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,140
dares to treat you bad,

235
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,130
I will fight him to death.

236
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,590
Uncle.

237
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,880
Who dares to bully me with your presence?

238
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,780
That's true.

239
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
Uncle.

240
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,740
These years are not easy for me.

241
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,310
My mom died early

242
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,920
and my dad doesn't come home often.

243
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,270
But for you,

244
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,670
I may live

245
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,960
a terrible life.

246
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,600
You are living a good life.

247
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,980
You have me

248
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,020
and your dad.

249
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,320
No more talking.

250
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,810
It is your wedding day.

251
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,150
Don't be emotional, shall we?

252
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Sure.

253
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,220
But you remind me.

254
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,840
Your father is so unreliable.

255
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,300
It's been so long.

256
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,890
It's been so long.

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,970
He seems to find something precious for you

258
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,950
as your wedding present.

259
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,260
I don't want precious stuff.

260
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,070
I only wish his accompany.

261
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,680
But

262
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,390
what time is it?

263
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,750
Why hasn't he come back?

264
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
Could it be the letter was not delivered to him?

265
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,190
The reply letter has arrived.

266
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,380
Somebody has gone to the station to fetch him.

267
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,190
He is supposed to come back.

268
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,140
Chief.

269
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,670
Chief.

270
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,620
The wedding dress is here.

271
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,960
Good. Put it here.

272
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,660
Okay.

273
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,690
Thanks.

274
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,940
I will take over Dahai's shift

275
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,420
and get myself busy outside.

276

[Double Happiness]

277
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,390
See you.

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,380
Sir.

279
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,800
I didn't expect

280
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,050
you look great

281
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
in the wedding gown.

282
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,770
Are you serious?

283
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,990
I never expect the taste

284
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,260
of Qingquan Stronghold would be like this.

285
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,420
I don't like it, anyway.

286
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,860
Hurry up.

287
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,240
Bring the sedan in.

288
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,460
Careful. Careful.

289
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,990
In the back. Hurry up. Hurry up.

290
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,360
Come on. Guys. Put it down.

291
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,900
Slowly. Down.

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,550
Alright.

293
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,510
What're you doing here?

Aunt Lu.

295
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,810
Chief asks me

296
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,360
bring your wedding sedan here.

297
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,380
Nonsense.

298
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,220
How come a man takes the wedding sedan?

299
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,180
But you

300
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,610
are a man

301
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
who marry our chief.

Aren't you?

303
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,240
Yeah.

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,450
You are special.

305

Chief has

306
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,150
asked Aunt Lu

307
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,610
to dress yourself

308
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,750
and ride the sedan

and sent to carry the ceremony.

What?

Here,

329
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,670
the present for you from Mr. Bu.

330
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,420
Take it.

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,470
I'll go.

332
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,610
So thirsty.

333
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,030
Hold on. Stop drinking.

334
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,390
In case you get drunk.

335
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,740
Oh yeah.

336
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,910
I can't drink. Thanks for your reminder.

Go. Hurry.

What should we do now?

Why are you so panic?

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,600
Go get him and fix it for me.

351
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,400
Go. Go.

352
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,280
Find him.

353

for the dress, are you?

Tell me.

Why aren't you a girl?

But I have

371
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,360
a bunch of

men around me at my wedding.

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,410
I find the atmosphere

374
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,780
a little bit unsatisfying.

375
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,140
I hope I have a cute, outgoing little

exquisite arrangement like a wedding wench.

I don't want exquisite things normally.

Shall I get a doctor for you?

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,400
Oh my gosh.

421
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,770
How did that happen?

422
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,020
What's happening here?

423
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know.

424
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,160
I become a female after I drink.

425
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,000
Men represent Yang while women Ying.

426
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,450
Could it be that it happened

427
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,470
since your injury last time?

428
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,550
Yeah.

429
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,130
You remind me of that.

430
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,100
I think it is.

431
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,860
Starting from yesterday,

432
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,990
I would turn to this after drinking.

433
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Every time I drink I will transform.

434
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,750
I recover when I wake up.

435
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,870
Master.

436
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,130
I was not like this

437
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,030
before I got injured.

438
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,780
I see.

439
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,710
They told me

440
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,660
you didn't come back to your dorm last night.

441
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,470
I thought you went out drinking and gambling.

442
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,460
No way.

443
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,480
There were a bunch of men.

444
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,870
How could I come back?

445
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,000
If I went back, they will...

446
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,540
Stop laughing.

447
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,070
This…

448
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,790
I know.

449
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,870
This is what the doctors call

450
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,010
"sequel".

451
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,100
The sequel is such a disaster.

452
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,030
Then what can I do?

453
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,840
Can I recover?

454
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,210
I'm dead.

455
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,860
I got it.

456
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,950
This is the science mentioned by Gu Beixi.

457
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,349
He said

458
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,650
science can cure lots of diseases.

459
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,670
I will ask Gu Beixi to find the science for me

460
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,540
after my wedding

461
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,569
to cure you.

462
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,480
Done. I'll try.

463
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,900
Then. Master.

464
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,079
There is no other solution

465
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,099
or choice.

466
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,260
You will be my wedding wench.

467
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,390
Come here.

468
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,560
Come here.

469
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,950
Practice first.

470
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,690
They must let me drink on the banquet.

471
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,369
They must ask me to drink a lot

472
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,950
if you are not around.

473
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,210
If so, what can I do in the bridal chamber?

474
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,390
If I let Lu Yan look down on me

475
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,110
at the wedding night,

476
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,950
he will bully me

477
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,360
for the whole life.

478
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,670
Okay. Master.

479
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,800
You relax.

480
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,720
I'll take care of all your alcohol.

481
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,880
You just go and enjoy

482
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,310
your chamber night with Aunt Lu.

483
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,530
Bro. It hurts.

484
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,540
All depend on you.

485
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,340
Now go and change yourself.

486
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,970
Alright.

487
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,720
I'll go in there.

488
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,040
Is it your new maid?

489
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,710
Mr. Bu.

490
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,470
-Why is her clothes...
-Hurry up.

491
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,040
Come and check my dress.

492
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,750
Is there a crack?

493
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,790
How can you be so careless?

494
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,290
Luckily there is time.

495
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,740
I told you it doesn't fit.

496
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,370
It's too tight.

497
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,060
Come on. Let me fix it for you.

498
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,810
Blood,

499
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,150
sweat

500
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,470
and money

501
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,390
are the price

502
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,420
of being a beauty.

503
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,820
Chief, you just wore a shabby dress

504
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,140
when you got married last time.

505
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,780
Why this time are you willing to spend the money,

506
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,360
and go through all this?

507
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
For him,

508
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,650
it's worth it.

509
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,060
Do you mean your new heroic husband?

510
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,390
You don't understand.

511
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,420
This is what the people overseas called

512
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,690
romance.

513
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,150
It's romantic.

514
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,430
What did you say?

515
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,220
Chief Yu, I thought you didn't take it seriously

516
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,520
and just took part in merely accidental amusement.

517
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,510
Who would know

518
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,310
you fell for it?

519
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,190
What do you mean?

520
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,590
Are you implying that

521
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,750
Lu Yan just acted based on circumstance

522
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,340
and I'm the one who fell in love?

523
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,500
Isn't it obvious?

524
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,950
No, it isn't.

525
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,660
You gotta make it clear.

526
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,530
I'm a man,

527
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,580
I know women.

528
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,690
And deep down,

529
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,610
I know men better.

530
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,770
If a man likes you,

531
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,830
his eyes will follow you around;

532
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,620
he'll always listen to your words;

533
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,550
he'll make contact with you.

534
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,260
He'll care about all your stories,

535
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,710
and is willing to share all his stories with you.

536
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,460
When he sees you hurt or suffer,

537
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,740
he will not have the heart to leave you behind.

538
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,310
When you are happy, he'll be over the moon.

539
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,390
To think about it,

540
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,040
is your Aunt Lu like that?

541
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,160
How much do you know him?

542
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,080
Believe it or not, I'll have roasted chicken tonight.

543
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,370
Don't you dare.

544
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,170
What age is this,

545
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,580
how can there be people believing in spirit clan?

546
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,640
Wait for me.

547
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,740
I'm not feeling well,

548
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,220
carry me for a while.

549
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,310
Walk on your own.

550
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,330
This is not like the old ages,

551
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,090
free love is about mutual attraction.

552
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,580
Do you talk much?

553
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,630
We fight more than talk.

554
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,620
Then how do you know

555
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,720
he doesn't love somebody else?

556
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,270
Women are the auspicious beings of the nature.

557
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,700
True love is like water.

558
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,220
We are afraid that

559
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,110
it may flood.

560
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,700
Or we are obscured and not able to see the whole picture.

561
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,940
What I want is his whole being.

562
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,180
As long as I get him,

563
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,240
I don't mind if he loves me sincerely or not.

564
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
Whatever you please.

565
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:10,650
Chief,

566
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,490
all the chiefs of other strongholds have arrived.

567
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,910
Second-in-command asks you to welcome them.

568
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,680
Roger that.

569
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,880
Chief.

570
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,850
See you.

571
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,400
People who are trapped by love.

572
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,180
See?

573
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,990
Here comes Miss Yu.

574
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,500
Where did Chief find such a pretty girl?

575
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,690
We've never seen you before.

576
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,910
What are you staring at?

577
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,550
I'm hired by your Chief at great expense.

578
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,020
One glimpse will cost you one yuan.

579
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,740
Restrain yourself.

580
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,400
From Chief of Changying Stronghold,

581
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,390
one box of mountain mushrooms, one piece of hare skin,

582
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,020
and two silver dollars.

583
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,750
From Chief of Beigou Stronghold,

584
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,590
[Rice]

585
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,350
two pheasants

586
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,090
and four silver dollars.

587
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:57,960
Four dollars.

588
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,790
Master,

589
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,730
our feast is humble enough,

590
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,060
but I didn't expect these old folks

591
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,590
to be this stingy.

592
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,700
Master, what are you pondering?

593
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,670
Later,

594
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,970
get these food supplies such as rice, flour, oil, and meat

595
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,710
together,

596
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,650
and share some

597
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,490
with folks who gave us gifts to bring back.

598
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,850
Then ask around

599
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,970
and see if any household

600
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,850
has patients

601
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,760
or newborns.

602
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
Give them a few more silver dollars.

603
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,670
Alright. I'm on it.

604
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,690
Let's go.

605
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,250
Chief of Beigou Stronghold.

606
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Miss Yu.

607
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,650
My precious guest. I apologize if I treated you inappropriately.

608
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,810
Miss Yu,

609
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,250
you are young and promising.

610
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,600
At such a young age,

611
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,970
you already have two amazing spouses.

612
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,550
Quite impressive.

613
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,420
Say,

614
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,150
where's your main husband?

615
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,270
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

616
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,730
What I did is not worth mentioning.

617
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,800
It's nothing compared to your

618
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,370
eight or nine concubines.

619
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,370
How embarrassing.

620
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,840
Chief of Nanfeng Stronghold comes!

621
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,030
Master,

622
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,540
people from Nanfeng Stronghold have arrived.

623
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,450
They flourish and are the most successful stronghold among all 18 mountains,

624
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,180
and they are the most arrogant ones as well.

625
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,420
These are all goodies. Take a look.

626
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,220
I haven't visited for quite a long time,

627
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,030
why is your place this shabby?

628
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,490
Even your wedding is miserable.

629
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,920
We are small in size,

630
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,260
how can we compete with a thriving one like

631
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,420
Nanfeng Stronghold?

632
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,060
Chief of Nanfeng Stronghold.

633
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,620
He surely spent a lot of money.

634
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,830
How come he got that amount of goods?

635
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,020
He is generous.

636
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,710
Master, Master, Master.

637
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,590
Master?

638
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,890
How come she also calls you "Master"?

639
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,490
Where is Dahai?

640
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,390
You are getting married and he is slacking off, right?

641
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,840
She can call me whatever she likes,

642
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,050
and it's none of your business.

643
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,250
What do you mean

644
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,210
by giving me these?

645
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,150
Aren't you getting married just for dowry?

646
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,740
Say, Yu Dengdeng,

647
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,720
you could have told me if you were poor.

648
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,090
We grew up together,

649
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,810
you know I won't sit back and watch you starve.

650
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,680
But how could you find yourself a kept man?

651
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,730
You did this to disgust me, didn't you?

652
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,450
In my opinion,

653
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,880
our two strongholds should unite as early as possible.

654
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,300
Then you can have as much money as you like.

655
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,460
Forget it.

656
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,690
Do you think I know nothing

657
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,260
about what you are up to?

658
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,570
What do you mean by that?

659
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
All these years,

660
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,660
what you've been doing,

661
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,670
and what you have done,

662
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,880
don't expect me to know nothing about them.

663
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,840
Don't you just want

664
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,420
the caravan under your wing that smuggle uncooked opium

665
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,100
to get pass our Qingquan Stronghold's property?

666
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,810
Let me tell you something.

667
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,330
That can happen

668
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,260
over my dead body.

669
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,780
You are just overthinking.

670
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,620
I broke up with that good-for-nothing caravan long time ago.

671
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,230
Uncooked opium transportation is prohibited within nine continents.

672
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,460
I support it.

673
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,740
These are just wedding gifts,

674
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
nothing complicated.

675
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,470
Did you hit your head or something?

676
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,560
Kindness

677
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,900
is not your thing.

678
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,760
You say that because you don't know me well.

679
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,600
Someday,

680
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,580
you, as well as all your belongings, will be mine.

681
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,470
Get outta here.

682
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,170
You wanna annex our Qingquan Stronghold?

683
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,580
Keep dreaming.

684
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,460
Let's go.

685
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,310
Quick, put them away.

686
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,010
Master,

687
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,240
I think this Gu Beixi guy is not bad.

688
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,850
Nanfeng Stronghold has both money and social connections.

689
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,990
The mayor also bewares of him.

690
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,490
If you take him in as a heroic husband,

691
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,330
we won't worry about money anymore.

692
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,650
He is good enough

693
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,220
to trick a numbskull like you.

694
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,770
Put away these gifts for now.

695
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,970
After the wedding,

696
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,570
show them to Second-in-command.

697
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,720
I hope it's not

698
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,350
some loot he robbed somewhere.

699
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,520
Why did you react like that?

700
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,110
We were never on good terms with Nanfeng Stronghold.

701
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,910
That good-for-nothing Gu Beixi,

702
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,860
how could he be so generous to us all of a sudden?

703
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,860
These better not be something he stole

704
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,050
and used to frame us.

705
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,120
Alright.

706
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,000
How rich.

707
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,970
Of course.

708
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,630
We are not rich.

709
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,780
It's funny that he makes mistakes by sending gifts.

710
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,580
Say, why does Ma-

711
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,050
your Chief

712
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,380
look down on Gu Beixi like that?

713
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,880
I know.

714
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,930
She must be into somebody like Aunt Lu.

715
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,220
A person who is good-looking

716
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,440
and has a clean and tidy appearance.

717
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,420
Gu Beixi, on the other hand,

718
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,520
is a messy and untidy person

719
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
with long hair.

720
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,740
This is not good.

721
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,410
If he has a haircut,

722
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,570
maybe he can get better luck with your Chief.

723
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,410
Do you hear that?

724
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,370
Yes, I do.

725
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,420
What the heck!

726
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,610
It's totally a fool's errand.

727
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,000
How come it's your fault to send her gifts?

728
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,210
What have you been listening to?

729
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,710
Her mean comments about us.

730
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,670
Dengdeng says she likes short hair.

731
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,490
That's it.

732
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,950
No wonder all these years Dengdeng is not interested in me,

733
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,250
it's all because of my hairstyle.

734
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,530
I don't know what you heard.

735
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,490
You blockhead.

736
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,990
Uncle.

737
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,090
Chief.

738
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,210
The hairpin does not fit.

739
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,060
Take it off.

740
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,290
He just casually

741
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,240
took out a woman's hairpin.

742
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,350
Could it be that he's truly in love with someone else?

743
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,130
What if the hairpin belongs to his late mother?

744
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,210
I cannot rule this out.

745
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,120
It's not worth it

746
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,270
if we have hard feelings toward each other because of this.

747
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,810
Forget it.

748
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,910
There's no better option,

749
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,910
I'll wear it.

750
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,290
Chief.

751
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,040
Chief.

752
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,650
The person we sent

753
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,190
to pick up former chieftain just came back.

754
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,240
They said that all the buses have arrived,

755
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,620
but they didn't find him.

756
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,120
The auspicious time is coming.

757
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,720
Gongbao Garden is also ready.

758
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,520
Shall we...?

759
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,830
Fine. Get ready for the wedding.

760
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,080
Okay!

761
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,720
Why am I here?

762
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,280
How do I know why you are here?

763
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,270
Come on! It’ll be too late.

764
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,890
Get ready for the wedding.

765
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,270
What?

766
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,550
Please have fun. I’ll be back later.

767
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,430
How about this?

768
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,670
Pretty nice, right?

769
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,970
Mr. Bu, you are really good at doing business.

770
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,210
Let’s go over there to have a drink later.

771
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,850
Mr. Bu.

772
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,430
Beigou Chieftain!

773
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,880
So hard!

774
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,720
Thank you for saying so!

775
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,860
Here is a small gift for you.

776
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,520
You are giving one to me as a gift?

777
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,800
Of course!

778
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,680
Mr. Ya,

779
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,080
What’s the matter with you?

780
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,120
I heard that you felt a little dizzy just now.

781
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,260
It’s a kind of chronic ailment.

782
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,070
I didn’t have breakfast.

783
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,510
I felt a little dizzy.

784
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,520
After lying down for a while, I feel much better.

785
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,960
Please take care.

786
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
After working,

787
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
you can have some more food and drink.

788
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,210
Okay. Okay.

789
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,350
Tell me if you need.

790
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,140
Okay.

791
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,940
See you later.

792
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,520
See you.

793
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,040
Hurry up with your work!

794
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,570
You are awesome!

795
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,940
You know how to cut hair.

796
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,470
After having my hair cut,

797
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,610
I feel my head is quite bare.

798
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,040
It feels as if I’m not wearing clothes.

799
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,230
You’ll feel so just after you had your hair cut.

800
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,660
You’ll get used to it later on.

801
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,780
Do you think Yu Dengdeng

802
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,090
understood my words just now?

803
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,570
Even if she can’t understand you now,

804
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,090
she will understand everything after a long time.

805
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,430
What’s more, didn’t you have your hair cut

806
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,600
because she likes it?

807
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,160
Yes. Yes. Yes.

808
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,550
I mean,

809
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,050
if you and she become a couple,

810
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,870
Nanfeng Stronghold and Qingquan Stronghold

811
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,370
will form a powerful alliance

812
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,140
and they will love each other.

813
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,650
The guns, money, and medicine

814
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,650
we gave them still belong to us.

815
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,680
Even she belongs to us.

816
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,430
It’s useless for you to understand it.

817
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,400
I want to know whether Yu Dengdeng understood it.

818
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,520
I talked so much to her.

819
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,330
Why do I feel that she was not moved?

820
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,510
Sir,

821
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,550
Yu Dengdeng can force a man to marry her.

822
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,610
She is very iron-hearted.

823
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,380
She is crueler than ordinary people.

824
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,990
You still need more time

825
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,390
to win her heart.

826
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,970
Don’t be anxious.

827
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,340
A pressing matter of the moment

828
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,580
is to get rid of the troublesome one.

829
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,370
Let’s go!

830
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,020
[Zhang Mo Bei Si Ran Shi Zan Gao Yang]

831
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,940
Sir,

832
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,530
on such a day,

833
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,260
why do you practice calligraphy?

834
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,290
For self-cultivation.

835
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,620
I see.

836
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:18,980
Is it because of Yu Dengdeng?

837
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,660
You are afraid that she won’t respect you.

838
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,350
Tonight won’t be a peaceful night.

839
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,800
How about

840
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,500
me drugging her

841
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,250
after you enter the nuptial chamber? Then...

842
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,020
The newly-married.

843
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,410
Since you’ve come,

844
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,980
why do you have to hide away?

845
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,780
You are really skillful in martial arts.

846
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,820
Did you attack us with your people

847
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,940
and shoot us with a gun on that day?

848
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,050
It was me.

849
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,570
You are from Nanfeng Stronghold.

850
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,150
Nanfeng Stronghold and Qingquan Stronghold
have always been on bad terms.

851
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,840
Do you want to do harm to Yu Dengdeng?

852
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,810
I want to do harm to you.

853
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,130
This place is Qingquan Stronghold.

854
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,180
So what?

855
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,330
Even if this place is the celestial kingdom,

856
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,890
I can still do harm to you.

857
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,120
No one can do anything to me.

858
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,230
But you are a poor guy.

859
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,700
I heard that you would marry into Qingquan Stronghold.

860
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,180
I don’t think you are willing.

861
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,680
Take the money.

862
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,580
Go out of the gate and turn right. There is a doghole.
