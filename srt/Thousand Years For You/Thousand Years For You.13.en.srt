What's this?

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,280
And there is a relationship called the love between men and women.

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,520
If you love each other deeply enough,

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,650
it is also possible to give up your life for the other.

31

What you mean is that

32
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,680
the living is willing to die instead?

33
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,050
Why is the love so powerful?

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,390
It's a hard to explain.

35

Only those who have experienced it themselves

36

can truly understand.

37

Has General Yan ever experienced the love between men and women?

this made by crops?

why bother taking time

I thought the land of nine continents

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,110
is so powerful that the land can grow so many strange things.

59

It turned out

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,470
that they are all made out from the most basic crop.

61

spirit clan

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,690

The population of the spirit clan

are much less than that of human race.

Nine continents are so large.

103
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,690
Why do you insist

104
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,350
that killing and robbing

105
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,530
are the only ways for you to survive?

106
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,170
Because we think

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,230
the resources in nine continents

108
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,800
are scarce despite the vast territory.

109
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
And there would be less.

110
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,450
So

111
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,600
only by robbing and taking food

112
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,060
can spirit clan survive.

174
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,690

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,570
I feel quite happy.

179
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,120

It must be near.

186
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,130

Why did you stand here by yourself?

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,020
I feel closer to my hometown

213

standing here.

214
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,040
Hometown?

215
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,350
What does your hometown look like?

216
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,190
That one.

217
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,300
The place whose light almost vanishes

218
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,580
is my hometown.

219
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,290
Let me show you.

220
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,690
My hometown had already become like this

221
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,770
when I was born.

222
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,260
But my father told me

223
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,030
that it

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,360
used to be as beautiful as here.

225
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,260
Beautiful and rich in resources.

226
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,660
Then resources gradually died out.

227
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,350
People became selfish.

228
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,750
Wars were aroused between tribes.

229
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
Energy was used out in the war.

230
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,190
Some died,

231
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,750
while some became

232
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,900
what you can see now.

233
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,610
As thin as a lath.

234
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,470
How did you come up with

235
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,820
the idea of coming here?

236
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,440
The sun guided us here.

237
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,890
I thought

238
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,080
there won't be any creature here.

239
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,040
But we didn't expect that

240
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,820
we would bring war and harm to you.

241
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,970
Lu Yan.

243
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,630
Human and spirit clan

244
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,370
will get along peacefully

245
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,090
if you learn the skill of farming from human.

246
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,050
Don't worry.

247
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,900
I'll help you.

248
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,740
I hope

249
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,820
the day can come soon.

250
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,280
Where are you taking me to?

251
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,500
Hold on. We are very close.

252
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,850
Have we arrived?

253
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,680
Careful.

254
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,520
Can I open my eyes now?

255
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,210
Just a minute.

256
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,270
Alright.

257
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,470
I noticed that your hometown is bare.

258
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,760
So I prepared this place for you.

259
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,870
I've planted some flowers and grass.

260
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,190
I hope it can

261
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,780
bring different feelings to you.

262
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,070
And I hope you will like it.

263
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,550

264
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,960

General. News from the frontline.

315
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,819
Zhu Rong has assembled another spirit troop

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,710
why are you being so strange

321
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,440
lately?

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,420
So strange?

324
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,680
General, I think you are the one being strange.

325
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,160
Why is that?

326
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,910
Are you

327
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,290
controlled by the energy

328
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,750
of the spirit clanswoman?

329
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,740
I have been holding my fire

330
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740

331
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,630

332
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,460
How many brothers

333
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,470
have been killed in the battlefield by spirit clan?

334
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,000
And who gave you your wounds all over the body?

335
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,930
We have a deadly feud.

336
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,700
How can you be so nice

337
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,600
to that girl?

338
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,890
And you even prepare a... a house for her?

339
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,870
Aren't you afraid that she is a spy?

340
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,670
Wei Du.

341
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,090
I would never

342
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,520
risk people's safety.

343
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,670
I trust my judgment.

344
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,080
Yun Xi is different from other spirit clansmen.

345
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,100
Maybe she

346
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,990
will bring a chance

347
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,150
that makes the two species get along peacefully.

348
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,490
Get along peacefully?

349
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,680
How can that be easy?

350
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
If I were you,

351
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,250
I would take her as our hostage

352
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,840
and negotiate with Zhu Rong

353
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,390
to make them withdraw their troops.

354
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:43,950
No way.

355
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,060
If I do it,

356
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,890
I will become a treacherous man.

357
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,170
You can't be sincere facing spirit clan.

358
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,880
Wei Du.

359
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,940
Sorry, sir.

360
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Please give me punishments.

361
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,320
Alright.

362
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,950
You have been with me for so long.

363
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,150
You know how I behave.

364
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,890
I need your trust.

365
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,280
Of course I trust you.

366
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,670
And I have never doubted you.

367
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm just worried that the foxy spirit clan would...

368
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,940
Alright.

369
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,230
I know.

370
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,320
I will

371
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,920
follow your orders.

372
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,760
You don't punish me.

373
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,820
I will punish myself and bear twenty whips of stick.

374
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,670
Be careful, please.

375
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,550
I shall ask your excuse.

376
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,540
It seems the war is inevitable.

377
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,010
I underestimated it.

378
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,110
It's been a while since I came to Shu.

379
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,190
I thought

380
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,680
it won't be too late

381
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,510
when I learn the way human live

382
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,640
and teach my people.

383
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,700
But what matters the most now

384
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,440
is that I must let spirit clan stop the war

385
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,910
and show our sincerity.

386
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,440
Zhu Rong is aggressive.

387
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,080
I don't think he would easily give up.

388
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,480
Though he is aggressive,

389
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,230
I believe my people

390
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,560
are more willing to live a stable life.

391
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,120
I can convince them.

392
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,900
Are you leaving alone?

393
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,820
Zhu Rong will do harm to you

394
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,440
if you go back by yourself.

395
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,040
How about this?

396
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,070
To show the sincerity to stop the war,

397
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,380
I will go back with you.

398
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,610
This way, your people will be more easily to trust you.

399
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,670
Lu Yan.

400
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,900
You are so kind.

401
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,400
The hair pin

402
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,360
was made from ancient sacred tree.

403
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,020
It echoes with my energy.

404
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,400
Take it.

405
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,280
Though we are far apart,

406
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,560
we can sense each other.

407
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,570
That magical?

408
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,230
If you go with me,

409
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,870
it will be dangerous.

410
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,790
And your people will misunderstand you.

411
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,540
They think you are partial to spirit clan.

412
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,830
I don't want to bring you trouble.

413
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,270
Don't worry.

414
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,550
I'm the Saintess of spirit clan.

415
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,050
I will make it.

416
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,960
Lu Yan.

417
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,290
Wait for me.

418
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,130
Take it.

419
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,090
Though we are far apart,

420
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,320
we can sense each other.

421
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,540
General.

422
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,010
Why are you in a hurry?

423
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,440
General.

424
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,740
Spirit troops have moved forward.

425
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,850
It will take another day for them to arrive in Bei Du.

426
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,170
Pass down my order.

427
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,650
Be prepared to fight.

428
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,720
Halt the troops.

429
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,240
Wait and see.

430
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,580
Yes, sir.

431
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,660
Lieutenant Wei, what did General say?

432
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,310
Halt the troops.

433
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,280
Halt the troops?

434
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,040
Why?

435
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,560
We have no time.

436
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,680
Is he still waiting

437
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,140
for the news from the Saintess?

438
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,100
No gossip about General.

439
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,460
It... It is a crucial time.

440
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,230
Does General still believe in the Saintess of spirit clan?

441
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,290
Since she has left,

442
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,920
has he received any message?

443
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,890
General should have never let her go.

444
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,990
With the Saintess,

445
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,440
won't it be easy to beat spirit clan?

446
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,040
Shut up!

447
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,530
How dare you

448
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,200
doubt General's decision?

449
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,680
No obeying military order. Offend your General.

450
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,480
You should be beheaded. Guards!

451
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,460
Lieutenant Wei.

452
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,800
Take them.

453
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,650
We didn't.

454
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,370
General.

455
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,630
We won't do it anymore.

456
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,470
General.

457
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,300
Stop.

458
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,340
General.

459
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,530
-General.
-General. General.

460
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,690
General. Sorry to disturb you. Please punish me.

461
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,790
It's okay.

462
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,150
You should be in solidarity facing the enemies.

463
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,050
Against the opposite together.

464
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,940
I will take down your mistakes.

465
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,360
We will discuss it afterwards.

466
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,090
Now leave.

467
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,120
Thank you for forgiving us.

468
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:14,950
Come on.

469
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,270
General.

470
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,280
Eat something.

471
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,710
No need.

472
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,850
General.

473
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,830
I'm still worried that

474
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,590
it will be too risky

475
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,720
to sneak in spirit clan's territory.

476
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
Is the news accurate?

477
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,590
Will the Saintess pass by here?

478
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
There's something wrong with the hair pin.

479
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,830
So I guess Yun Xi must be in trouble.

480
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,140
And spirit clan troops have paused

481
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,980
the process of attacking Bei Du.

482
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,470
I think

483
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,370
they are waiting for something.

484
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,740
Here it comes.

485
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,520
Saintess doesn't want to hurt us.

486
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,090
But Chief asked us to poison her.

487
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,930
She betrayed us first.

488
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
And she defended those hateful humans.

489
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,880
We would have taken over Shu

490
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,340
if she didn't get in the way.

491
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,080
But she contains the energy core of our spirit clan.

492
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,160
What should we do

493
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,930
if she abandons us?

494
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,440
Chief said he has found

495
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,580
a way to be stronger.

496
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,610
Maybe

497
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,380
we won't need a Saintess anymore.

498
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,990
Fire.

499
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,190
General.

500
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,910
Who is inside?

501
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,870
We are asking you.

502
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,910
Yun Xi.

503
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,230
Yun Xi.

504
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,770
Lu Yan.

505
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,480
Why are you here?

506
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,940
The hair pin twinkled.

507
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,950
I knew something wrong must happened to you.

508
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,680
So I sent people to gather news.

509
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,850
As long as you are in danger,

510
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,340
I will come to you

511
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,210
no matter how far it is.

512
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,750
Come on. This way.

513
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,420
General. Let's go.

514
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
They are after us.

515
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,680
Come on.

516
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,410
Yes, sir.

517
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,930
Kill.

518
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,670
Come on.

519
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,070
Hurry up.

520
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,900
General.

521
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,160
General.

522
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,660
General.

523
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,450
More and more spirit clansmen are here.

524
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,720
It is spirit clan's territory,

525
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,200
you can't beat them.

526
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,460
Why don’t

527
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,310
you let me go back?

528
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,340
No way.

529
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,890
Zhu Rong regards you as a traitor.

530
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,350
You will die if you go back.

531
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,360
But I can't implicate you.

532
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,780
There is no implication between us.

533
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,810
I told you, as long as you are in danger,

534
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,320
I will come to you.

535
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,420
I won't let you die.

536
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,410
General.

537
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,790
You go first.

538
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,670
I will draw their attention.

539
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,250
Don't bother.

540
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,560
Let's split. I'll meet you at Fuyu Mountain.

541
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, sir.

542
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,670
Go.

543
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,430
Everyone, be careful.

544
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,320
Brothers. Hurry up.

545
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,910
Come on.

546
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,160
You are injured.

547
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,650
I'm okay.

548
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,800
General Yan.

549
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,500
Our Chief

550
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,860
is willing to spare your life

551
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,260
as long as you give the Saintess back to us.

552
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,140
Zhu Rong is evil.

553
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,480
Yun Xi

554
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,250
won't associate with him anymore.

555
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,700
You'd better give up resisting

556
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,810
if you don't want to see them killed.

557
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,870
General.

558
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,910
Wei Du.

559
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,890
General.

560
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,170
We only

561
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,080
have you now.

562
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,560
Give your orders.

563
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,240
We would rather die than surrender!

564
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,810
Rather die than surrender!

565
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,510
Alright.

566
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,020
Rather die than surrender!

567
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,860
Hold on.

568
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,940
Fellow spirit clansmen,

569
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,410
I'm not willing to hurt you.

570
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,830
If you let them go,

571
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,530
I will forgive you

572
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,150
no matter what you did

573
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,660
because of Zhu Rong's lie.

574
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,390
Saintess has got blood toxin.

575
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,450
Now her blood can not destroy formations

576
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,790
nor suppress us.

577
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,160
Catch her quickly

578
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,460
before she recovers.

579
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,050
You can protect the Saintess.

580
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,980
But can you protect your brothers?

581
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,580
No.

582
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,230
Kill these spirit clansmen.

583
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,170
Wei Du.

584
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:04,980
No.

585
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,150
Why do you kill them?

586
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,990
Have you forgotten your promise?

587
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,120
General. Do you know how many people were killed by them?

588
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,380
Stop.

589
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,310
Stop.

590
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,030
Saintess.

591
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,190
How could you help human kill us?

592
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,990
Arrows.

593
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,490
No.

594
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,060
General.

595
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Spirit clan.

596

Lu Yan.

597
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,270
Lu Yan. Hold on.

598
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,520
I'll save you.

00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,020

Wake up.

Lu Yan.

612
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,630
You killed General.

613
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,230
You killed him.

614
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,330
I'll kill you.

615
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,739
All spirit clansmen deserve it.

616
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,980
Lu Yan.

617
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159

Don't sleep.

Open your eyes and look at me.

Lu Yan.

622
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,550
You can't leave me alone.

623
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,480
You promised.

624
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,610
The two of us

625
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,880
will witness the day when the two species live together.

626
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,440
Lu Yan. Don't sleep.

627

♫The decision I made for you♫

692
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,380
♫When two hearts are so close to each other♫

693
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,920
♫When the whole world is occupied by you♫

694
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,950
♫I'll call out your name so hard♫

695
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,750
♫Until you respond ♫

696
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,250
♫You're the only one for me♫

697
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:17,080
♫The scenery that I walk into♫

698
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,480
♫This encounter with the seasons♫

699
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,570
♫Fate is carved into love♫

700
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,870
♫How lucky I am♫

701
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,000
♫The decision I made for you♫

702
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:02,180
