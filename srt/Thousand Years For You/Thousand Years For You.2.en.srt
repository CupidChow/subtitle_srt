1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
Be careful!

3
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,340
Don't break them. Or they'll lose value.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,120
Careful.

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,580
Don't move. Put them down.

6
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,220
These are all gold, right?

7
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,729
We could make a fortune!

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,000
Put down! Put down!

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Don't touch that!

10
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,920
Are you the shopkeeper?

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,890
Who on earth are you?

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,520
Don't touch that.

13
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
Let's put that aside.

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,320
Let me ask you.

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,039
Is Lu's sedan chair

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,400
from your company?

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,080
What trick did your company do?

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,800
You sabotaged my plan,

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,180
and made me lose my man.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,210
How will you make it up to me?

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,240
So you are that bully!

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Be careful what you say!

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
Be careful of your words!

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,880
Calm down!

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,800
So,

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,600
you admit

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,960
you did something to the sedan chair?

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,560
No!

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,720
We are a normal company.

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,040
And we do decent business.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,170
The sedan chairs we rent are ordinary.

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,280
Shut up!

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Cut the crap!

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,440
Pay for our loss!

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,000
Or we'll take away all your things!

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
-Let's do it!
-Take those things!

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,820
See if you dare!

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,280
Don't be so rude.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Let's settle this calmly.

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,480
Hey,

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
boy.

42
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,800
Judging from his look,

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,580
you are the real shopkeeper, aren't you?

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
So,

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,720
your company made me lose my man.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,160
I am so angry,

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,760
and sad.

48
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,120
Money

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,320
can't possibly heal my broken heart.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,880
So,

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,640
how should we settle this?

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,579
How do you want to settle this?

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
You made me lose a man. You should pay me back with a man.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
You

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,079
are a cute boy.

56
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,360
Maybe

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,090
you can be my man instead of him.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,000
Master.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,079
Chief!

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,839
Master!

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you okay?

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,730
Are you okay?

63
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,140
Master, is everything all right?

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,920
Master, you are vomiting blood!

65
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
What is wrong with him?

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,920
How can he beat you into this?

67
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Yeah, what's wrong with that guy?

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Hey, he didn't beat me into this.

69
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
My gums are bleeding because of inner fever.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Okay, okay, okay.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
Master, you have an inner fever.

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
I believe you.

73
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,890
Are you okay?

74
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,159
Master!

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Damn that man!

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,240
Let's beat him!

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,800
Beat him!

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,960
Go beat him!

79
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,770
He can beat me like this.

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,300
You are looking for death!

81
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,440
I...

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
This guy

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,020
has great inner power.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,880
Not bad.

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
How interesting.

86
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,840
What do you mean, Master?

87
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
Are we really going to let him go?

88
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,960
We can't let him go so easily!

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,680
We can't!

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,040
He sabotaged our plan.

91
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,410
How can we let him go?

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, how can we just let go of him?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,880
You all saw

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
the countless antiques in that room.

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,090
These are worth more than Lu's wealth.

96
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
Ten times more than Lu's wealth.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,010
We could make a fortune.

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,040
This man

99
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
is mine.

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,680
Sir,

101
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,800
this chieftain

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,260
looks a lot like my Master.

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,080
Could she be...

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,080
I tested with the hair clasp left by Yun Xi.

105
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,010
She is not Yun Xi.

106
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,320
What matters most now is to find the emblem.

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
The company has many sources out there.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
Chang and I will take action separately,

109
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,740
and find it out.

110
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,640
I arranged this room for you.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,300
Please have a rest.

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,800
Okay.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,320
Sir.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,800
Sir.

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Sir.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Be careful.

117
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm still in pain.

118
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
When I get you,

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll show you how good I am.

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,860
Be careful.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Be careful. Here.

122
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,520
Quiet.

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Master,

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,880
they are no ordinary men.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
How should we deal with them?

126
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
Haven't you heard?

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,130
No matter how powerful a man is,

128
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
he is always afraid of hidden tricks.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
I just saw the shopkeeper go out.

130
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,840
Whose money is that?

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,520
No matter how powerful a man is,

132
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,570
he can be knocked down by drugs.

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,280
He looks

134
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,080
so handsome and cute.

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,680
He is as handsome

136
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
as the movie stars.

137
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,520
If I marry you,

138
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,080
I'll let you bear 10 children for me.

139
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,880
Such delicate nose and lips.

140
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,520
Master,

141
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,380
why are you sitting there?

142
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Did our plan work?

143
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,290
Take him with us.

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,040
Sir?

145
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Sir?

146
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,480
You are awake.

147
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,800
I thought you were dead.

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,040
Okay, stay here.

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,800
I'll get you something to eat.

150
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,440
Stay here.

151
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Lie here. Don't go anywhere.

152
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,280
Uncle.

153
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,800
it's been

154
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,760
so long,

155
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,530
why hasn't my heroic husband woken up?

156
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,640
You gave him too much drug.

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
Let alone humans,

158
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,920
even a bear couldn't wake up.

159
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,160
Don't worry.

160
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
Dahai is watching him.

161
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,620
When I drugged him,

162
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,340
why didn't you tell me how powerful the drug was?

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
What should we do now?

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,260
The drug is too strong.

165
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,200
Maybe

166
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
get a doctor to check him out?

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,450
We don't need to. He'll wake up when he gets enough sleep.

168
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,920
Dengdeng, look at yourself.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,930
You should sit and stand properly.

170
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,760
Can you please act like a lady?

171
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,480
Can you be a beautiful girl?

172
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,280
A pretty girl?

173
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Can you?

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
Please?

175
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,400
I don't need to.

176
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,880
You have to.

177
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,280
You are the chief of a stronghold, act like one!

178
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,960
Don't talk about that in our house!

179
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
Let me tell you.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,930
Now you are married.

181
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,300
You have a husband.

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,240
The next step is to have children.

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,640
And then your job is done.

184
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,520
It hurts!

185
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,280
Dahai, when did you learn the flying skill?

186
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
You can fly now!

187
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,920
Are you blind?

188
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,280
I was thrown out of the window!

189
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,010
Are you okay?

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,440
My waist hurts.

191
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,480
The newcomer dares to beat my people.

192
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,440
Such a rough man.

193
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,940
Ouch, my waist.

194
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
You again!

195
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,640
Yes, me again. Is that a problem?

196
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,400
Dahai, what's wrong with you?

197
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,810
I told you to serve him good dishes.

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,520
How could you...

199
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,480
He didn't eat at all.

200
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
And he just kicked me out.

201
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
Why didn't you tie him up?

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
I did. He broke out.

203
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,280
Hey, dude.

204
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,200
Boy.

205
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
No, that's not right, either.

206
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,840
Anyway, it's wrong to beat people.

207
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,280
He deserves it.

208
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,700
But you can't beat him.

209
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,480
We got you here in this way.

210
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,240
And we know you don't like it.

211
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,040
However,

212
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
if you stay here for a while,

213
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,520
you'll know

214
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
how lucky you are.

215
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,100
Don't touch me.

216
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
What's your name?

217
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Get out of the way.

218
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,520
I ask you what your name is.

219
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,220
Master.

220
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,240
His name is Lu Yan.

221
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
So you will be Yu Lu in the future.

222
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
My heroic husband.

223
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,290
I suggest you

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,000
behave well in my stronghold.

225
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,120
If you behave,

226
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,400
you won't get into trouble.

227
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,530
If you don't behave,

228
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
I'll kick you...

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,930
Heroic husband?

230
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,920
Dengdeng, stop talking.

231
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
Don't be so rude.

232
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,480
Here is the thing.

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,620
She has been

234
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
spoiled by me.

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,280
Dengdeng is still young.

236
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
I hadn't been able to get her a proper heroic husband.

237
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,680
Those guys were either poor,

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
or ugly.

239
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,680
But ever since she met you,

240
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,400
she has

241
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
been in love.

242
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,460
I said, don't touch me.

243
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,800
Do you think I'm asking for your advice?

244
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,560
Here is Qingquan Stronghold!

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,160
Dahai.

246
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,770
Take that thing out.

247
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,480
Let me show you what it is.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,660
Have a look!

249
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
With it...

250
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,640
Just look!

251
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,720
What is it?

252
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
It's upside down.

253
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,440
Look what it is!

254
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Marriage paper.

255
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,080
Can you see it?

256
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,970
Here is your handprint.

257
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
And your signature.

258
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,460
Do you want to break your promise?

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,930
I'm telling you.

260
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
If you agree to be my heroic husband,

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,640
you can be safe.

262
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,320
But if you don't comply,

263
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
I'll break one of your legs.

264
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,690
And you can be the best friend with the bed.

265
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,320
It could be worse.

266
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah.

267
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,610
Where are you going? I haven't finished talking!

268
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,360
Master.

269
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,080
Be careful.

270
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Do you want to fight?

271
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,780
It would be bad if you get hurt.

272
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,840
Master.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,730
Are you okay?

274
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,080
See?

275
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
You are bleeding.

276
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
What a nice pair of hands!

277
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,840
What a pity

278
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,400
if you have scars on them!

279
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,720
I told you. Don't resist.

280
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,280
The more you resist, the more excited I get.

281
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,440
Don't underestimate my stronghold.

282
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,680
Although it's just a small stronghold,

283
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
as long as you obey me,

284
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,160
you can have

285
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,260
anything you want.

286
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,960
Later,

287
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
buy some ointment

288
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,200
for his wound.

289
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,760
Okay.

290
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,040
You've heard her.

291
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,100
You'll get hurt if you resist.

292
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,490
Stop resisting.

293
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,560
You can't run away no matter how hard you try.

294
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Think about it.

295
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,240
Yeah, you signed the marriage paper.

296
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,480
It's no use regretting.

297
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,840
Yeah.

298
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
And you want to kill my Master?

299
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,640
If you kill her,

300
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,800
you'll be a widower.

301
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,040
Hey, what are you talking about?

302
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm just scaring him.

303
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,080
I can stay.

304
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,330
But I have a request.

305
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,240
Say it.

306
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,330
I don't like to be constrained.

307
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,220
So in this stronghold,

308
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
I need to walk freely.

309
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,180
What if you try to run away?

310
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
There are so many people here.

311
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
How can I run away?

312
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
He can't run away.

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
He definitely can't.

314
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,640
I wouldn't tie you up if you had complied like this.

315
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Rest assured.

316
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,000
Later,

317
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
Daqian will show you around.

318
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,880
Also,

319
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,760
I don't like being touched by people.

320
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,800
We don't touch him.

321
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
Come here. Let him think about it.

322
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,960
Let's go.

323
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Rough boy.

324
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,800
Today,

325
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,480
I'll give you some space.

326
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,200
Yeah.

327
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,440
Let's give him some space.

328
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Gigolo.

329
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,640
Is he afraid of being touched?

330
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,400
Is he porcelain? Will we break him or what?

331
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,160
He'll be yours sooner or later.

332
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,800
Ridiculous.

333
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
Give him some space.

334
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,600
Don't touch him. He's boring.

335
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
He'll come around.

336
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,839
How interesting.

337
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,880
I thought Beigou Stronghold was tough.

338
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,440
You dare to sneak around in Nanfeng Stronghold.

339
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,800
Chief! Chief!

340
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,119
Chief!

341
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,280
Bad news!

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,640
Qingquan Stronghold is holding a wedding!

343
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,680
A man gets a wife.

344
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,040
What's the big fuss?

345
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,880
Not a man.

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
It's Yu Dengdeng.

347
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,130
She's getting married.

348
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,520
Tell your chief.

349
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,320
If he messes with me and Qingquan Stronghold again,

350
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,960
I'll destroy everything he owns.

351
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,560
Get out!

352
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
Yes sir.

353
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Did you say Yu Dengdeng is getting married?

354
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,080
After losing Mr. Lu,

355
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,000
Yu Dengdeng went to the sedan chair company to reason with them.

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,400
And then she fell in love with the owner of the company.

357
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,280
So she took him back to Qingquan Stronghold by some tricks.

358
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,440
She's a girl.

359
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,850
How could she do something like that! In broad daylight!

360
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,490
Sabotage that wedding.

361
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,410
What does that have anything to do with us?

362
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
What are you saying?

363
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,360
I, as the chief of Nanfeng Stronghold, haven't had any wife.

364
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,280
And the chief of Qingquan Stronghold is about to have a second husband.

365
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,810
How does that make you feel?

366
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,920
Chief,

367
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,840
when the late chief was still alive,

368
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,560
people were lining up

369
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
to get wives for you.

370
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,720
You were the one who refused all of them.

371
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,180
Those women were garbage.

372
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
Too weak.

373
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,960
Too spoiled.

374
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,520
And they spoke foreign languages.

375
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,850
I don't like any of them.

376
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,140
Yeah yeah yeah.

377
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,410
I know what you like.

378
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,720
You like careless,

379
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
loose,

380
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,440
and rough women.

381
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,890
It would be better if she can fight, right?

382
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,280
You knew?

383
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,360
Chief, you have feelings for Miss Yu.

384
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,960
We all know that.

385
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,360
You all know?

386
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,320
How can you all know,

387
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,460
while Yu Dengdeng doesn't get it?

388
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,900
Is she pretending not to see my heart?

389
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
Why can't she

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880
be mild,

391
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
cute, and smart in front of me?

392
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,880
That guy is in Qingquan Stronghold now.

393
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,010
Maybe we could go there and kill...

394
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,560
No.

395
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
Qingquan Stronghold looks loose,

396
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,930
but in fact, it is well guarded.

397
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,690
If we take actions recklessly,

398
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
and she knows it,

399
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,280
she'll lose face,

400
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,020
and blame us for sabotaging her wedding.

401
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Chief.

402
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
I have an idea.

403
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,800
That's good.

404
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
Master, maybe you should get another man to be your heroic husband.

405
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,520
Every time you see each other,

406
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920
you two fight.

407
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,180
It's so dangerous.

408
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,200
There are so many good-looking and rich guys

409
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,280
in the world.

410
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,040
Why do you hold onto this rough guy?

411
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,840
No.

412
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I only want him.

413
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,560
The furniture he broke

414
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,000
will be double-counted into his dowry.

415
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,360
Okay.

416
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,560
Chief, you are so good at making money.

417
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,480
If I don't make more money, how can I support you guys?

418
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,480
I'll ask for three times more dowry.

419
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,240
Make some preparations.

420
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
The wedding

421
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,880
will be three days later.

422
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
So soon?

423
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Invite all the chiefs of the strongholds

424
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,940
to come to the wedding.

425
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Ask them for wedding gifts.

426
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,720
I want to show them.

427
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,200
I, Yu Dengdeng,

428
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,360
can not only marry a rooster,

429
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,480
but also find a good husband.

430
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,160
After the wedding,

431
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,530
the sedan chair company

432
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,960
will be ours.

433
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,360
By the way,

434
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,480
keep an eye on him and don't let him run away.

435
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
I always have this feeling,

436
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
that the reason he said yes so quickly

437
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,640
is to find an opportunity to run away.

438
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,800
Don't worry, Master.

439
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
Our stronghold

440
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
is heavily guarded.

441
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,970
Even a mosquito can't run away.

442
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
But I think Lu Yan is so stubborn

443
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
and unrestrained.

444
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,280
One day he'll get on top of you.

445
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,360
He is an unrestrained horse. But I am a skillful horseman.

446
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,410
He is unrestrained.

447
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
I will tame him.

448
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,650
How enterprising, Master!

449
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,520
There are six gardens and one hall in our stronghold.

450
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
Aunt Lu. Oh no, Mr. Lu.

451
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,220
Now you are living in Gongbao Garden.

452
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,850
This is Yuxiang Garden. Chief lives here.

453
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,890
It's so lively here, right?

454
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,460
Please.

455
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,600
This is the hall where we have meetings.

456
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
It's called Delicious Hall.

457
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,320
This is where we live.

458
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,240
This is called

459
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,260
Hotpot Garden.

460
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,400
Except for this place,

461
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,060
feel free to go anywhere else.

462
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,290
What's the copper coin for?

463
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
That's merely a decoration.

464
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,330
Our Former chieftain, Paralyzed Yu, is superstitious.

465
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,960
He insisted it was

466
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,600
some Feng Shui preservation stuff.

467
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
He wouldn't let us remove it no matter what.

468
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
With this on display,

469
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,000
people in the stronghold are still living in poverty.

470
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,330
It's not really useful.

471
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
On the east side, it's adjacent to a precipice;

472
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,440
on the west side, it's hanging from mountains and rivers.

473
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,920
All of its eight sides are evil and dangerous.

474
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,800
To ward the evil off, a small amount of money should be spent.

475
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,920
This Qingquan Stronghold,

476
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
although it seems to have a cheesy and confusing layout,

477
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,280
and being in the center of evil everywhere,

478
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
it actually lives by death.

479
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
The set-up person is a Master.

480
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
Mr. Lu, I can tell that

481
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,680
you are a real man.

482
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,620
How can a dignified man

483
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
suffer from a woman?

484
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,600
As you came,

485
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,040
we are counting on you to withstand our Chief.

486
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,080
If you think I'm decent,

487
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,440
I, Daqian, can help you.

488
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,160
Our Qingquan Stronghold

489
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,720
cannot be operated by a woman all the time.

490
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,200
Sir.

491
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,520
Sir. Sir.

492
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,280
What are you doing?

493
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,920
What do you want?

494
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,960
How dare you kidnap our Sir?

495
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Do you want to die?

496
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't make me beat you.

497
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
Release him now.

498
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,440
Isn't he

499
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,280
the young shopkeeper of Xin's Sedan Chair Company?

500
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:38,720
He is.

501
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Then, why should we let him go?

502
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,960
Why should we let him go?

503
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,120
Let's escort him to Delicious Hall for interrogation.

504
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,800
Move. Move.

505
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,570
Release him.

506
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,160
Sir.

507
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,490
Are you alright?

508
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,320
Who do you think you are to order us around?

509
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,240
I will not do as you say.

510
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,800
Let's go.

511
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,880
Aunt Lu says to let him go, and you let him go.

512
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,920
Are you deaf?

513
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,160
Sir.

514
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,320
Master.

515
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,720
He came to give us money.

516
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,500
How can we treat him like this?

517
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Yes. To give money.

518
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
Right, I left a note.

519
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Silly me. You're here to give us money.

520
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,500
What a misunderstanding.

521
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Your family is here,

522
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
and why didn't you give us a heads-up?

523
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,720
What about to have dinner together?

524
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,760
Right, let's go.

525
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,400
Master.

526
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,560
Here.

527
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,010
Here you go, Master.

528
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,570
When you smell the rooster,

529
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,560
way to go.

530
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,900
You start practicing.

531
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,840
Here we go.

532
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Sir.

533
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Are we really going to have dinner with these morons?

534
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,340
Why not just fight our way out?

535
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,980
Take a look around you.

536
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,730
This stronghold is the culprit who stole our Master.

537
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
We should observe quietly,

538
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,640
and don't act rashly.

539
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,050
Alright.

540
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,040
That's it for today's practice of Rooster and Dog Rise to Heaven.

541
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
Hurry up and eat.

542
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
But, Master.

543
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,680
You are not practicing enough.

544
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,200
It's our Senior Master who set the rule to practice when smelling the rooster.

545
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,560
Isn't he enjoying himself traveling around the world now?

546
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,360
He lied to me about catching some sort of monsters.

547
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,480
Aunt Lu, and our in-laws,

548
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,210
come sit, and start digging in.

549
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,360
In our family, the servants are not allowed to sit and eat with us.

550
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,280
Who do you call a servant?

551
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,410
He is my apprentice.

552
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,560
Everyone is equal in Qingquan Stronghold.

553
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,600
If you like to stand, suit yourself.

554
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,440
Here, Master.

555
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,680
Have a chicken heart.

556
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
I tried

557
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,480
so hard

558
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,220
to save this from those brats.

559
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,880
Have a try.

560
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,130
I'm not a fan of this.

561
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,960
You have more.

562
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,420
It can keep your wits about you next time.

563
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,570
I'll have this sweet glutinous rice cake.

564
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,920
What's this?

565
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,920
It's called glutinous rice cake.

566
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,720
It's a snack made of sticky rice.

567
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,600
Here.

568
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,720
Try it.

569
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,760
Aunt Lu.

570
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Why don't you eat?

571
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,860
What are you doing?

572
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,080
We asked you to eat, but not to eat these.

573
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,080
Bring them on.

574
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,800
Coming.

575
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,700
Here you go.

576
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,960
These are for you.

577
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,570
What do you mean by this?

578
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,720
The food is not good enough for you?

579
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,160
Each and every house in Qingquan Stronghold

580
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
has its own share.

581
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,040
Not only did you smash utensils,

582
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,600
but you also hurt my apprentice.

583
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,960
To sum it all up,

584
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,840
your budget for this month has already been used up.

585
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,370
If you want more fancy food,

586
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,410
you should pay more.

587
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,400
It's like this.

588
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,160
From now on,

589
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,800
for every meal, I mean every meal,

590
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,360
if you want to change steamed corn bread to fine flour bun,

591
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
it's 50 cents.

592
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,760
Change the leftover to freshly made dishes,

593
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,480
that would be 80 cents.

594
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,440
If you are tired of vegetables and crave for meat,

595
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,360
my goodness, that's a big deal.

596
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,760
Let me tell you.

597
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,800
How can you calculate the bill like this?

598
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,920
In our family, we calculate it like this.

599
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,640
Aunt Lu.

600
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,460
Choose your combo.

601
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,400
After all,

602
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,440
what your want is our Sedan Chair Company's money.

603
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,760
Aunt Lu, how could you say that?

604
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,600
I'm not an unconscionable person.

605
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,080
Right now,

606
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,080
you belong to me, Yu Dengdeng.

607
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,160
As long as you serve me well,

608
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
I'll provide you

609
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,210
fine food and garments.

610
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,200
Here,

611
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,380
first, show me your smile.

612
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,330
How dare you!

613
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,360
You have a fine body.

614
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,180
When you've done smiling,

615
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,600
do a dance for me.

616
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,440
Don't push us too far.

617
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Sir, let's leave.

618
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,840
Halt.

619
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,080
You smashed my table,

620
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,480
contaminated my dishes,

621
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
and now you want to leave?

622
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,680
Which one of the things here belongs to you?

623
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,080
You just bought them on credit.

624
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,320
What do you mean by that?

625
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,760
Are you looking down on us?

626
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,880
We earn our money fair and square.

627
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
You are just a shopkeeper of a sedan chair company. What's so great about that?

628
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,600
As I quote from the play,

629
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,560
Are the princes, barons, generals, and ministers born to be supreme than others?

630
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,680
The prices of merchandise vary,

631
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,680
but how can a life be born to be remarkable or insignificant?

632
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
We should teach you some rules here.

633
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,880
Dahai.

634
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,080
Tell Aunt Lu

635
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
about the rules in our stronghold, in detail.

636
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,060
With pleasure.

637
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,380
Listen carefully.

638
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,320
About this...

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,260
I hold it the wrong way.

640
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,200
Hurry up.

641
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,080
Well,

642
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,240
Chief is the Master of the whole stronghold.

643
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,960
Aunt Lu, she also is the head of your family.

644
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,720
From now on,

645
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
for anything you do, ranging from talking and acting, to eating, dressing and living,

646
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,690
you should obey the arrangement of Chief.

647
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,560
You can't throw a tantrum at her.

648
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,560
Not to mention that you cannot compare yourself with her.

649
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,620
Most importantly,

650
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,920
you cannot

651
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,960
blow up

652
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,320
just because of

653
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,160
her favor.

654
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,540
Do you understand?

655
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,090
If you step out of this door,

656
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,920
you may not be able to know anything about the emblem in your life.

657
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
If you finish learning the rules properly,

658
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,240
I can give you a treat

659
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,180
and tell you about the emblem.

660
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,120
It seems to be the emblem.

661
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,520
Do you think I don't know?

662
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
The reason you were cut by my dagger

663
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,040
was not that you couldn't dodge,

664
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,880
but

665
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,560
you were lost in thought

666
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
when seeing the emblem on it.

667
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,560
You seem to be wandering around in the Qingquan Stronghold,

668
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,640
but what you're really doing is gathering information.

669
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,240
It's all about the emblem.

670
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,240
In the whole Qingquan Stronghold,

671
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,480
nothing can be hidden from me.

672
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,720
Right, right.

673
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,440
Dahai,

674
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,800
continue.

675
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
Okie dokie.

676
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,280
When Chief doesn't ask you to come,

677
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,610
you shouldn't persist;

678
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,480
when she does want to see you,

679
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
you can't just shrug it off, either.

680
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,600
See?

681
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
Excuse me.

682
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
Pardon me.

683
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
Make the way.

684
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,880
Qingquan Stronghold is a stronghold of etiquette.

685
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,640
As the heroic husband,

686
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,040
you should show respect to elders,

687
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,600
by attending upon them every morning and night, bidding greetings and serving them tea.

688
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,080
Right.

689
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,760
Greetings and tea serving are the main objectives.

690
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,400
Here.

691
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,280
Hurry, it's your time to shine.

692
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,520
Show yourself.

693
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,920
Don't just stand there, hold it.

694
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Your stuff is not well made,

695
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,760
one touch and your tables break,

696
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,820
and so do your cups.

697
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,840
Dahai,

698
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,490
get another one.

699
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,040
Forget it.

700
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,400
We are family now.

701
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
We don't need the mere courtesy.

702
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,080
Since Chief has already decided that,

703
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,240
as a man,

704
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,400
there is no shame in being submissive to your wife.

705
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,640
Here.

706
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
These

707
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,530
are hand-sewn by me.

708
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,080
It's been three or four years,

709
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
and they finally come in handy today.

710
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,680
Come here.

711
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
There you go. The both of you.

712
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,540
I'm counting on you

713
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,400
to give birth to Yu The Third.

714
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Yes. These are good.

715
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,960
Here, take them.

716
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,370
See, see.

717
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,280
What a goodie.

718
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
As the heroic husband, you should unite your brothers more,

719
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
treat the people of the stronghold well,

720
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,000
and you cannot put on airs

721
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,200
or be condescending.

722
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,080
You should wear a smile all the time.

723
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,680
Moreover,

724
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,680
When others greet you, you should always respond.

725
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,280
Am I right?

726
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,200
Yes, you must respond.

727
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
-You have to.
-Bring them up.

728
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,560
Coming.

729
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,560
Take this.

730
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,880
Take a look at mine.

731
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,040
Mine is great.

732
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,640
Don't do that.

733
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,560
Stop it. Stop it.

734
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,360
Don't act like this.

735
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,520
Order. Order.

736
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,600
Be quiet.

737
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,880
These are their first harvest

738
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,740
after a year long of hardworking.

739
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,200
It's a bit inappropriate

740
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,300
to put up such a show, isn't it?

741
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
Good, good.

742
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,200
As the heroic husband,

743
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,280
not only should you respect elders, unite brothers,

744
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,610
and, serve your Master,

745
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,440
moreover,

746
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
you should diligently

747
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,080
and willingly

748
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,530
serve the main husband.

749
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
And this Big Red

750
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,000
is Chief's main husband.

751
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,570
Your rooster's name is Big Red?

752
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,640
Big Red.

753
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
Big at heart and red as fire.

754
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,900
Sounds joyous.

755
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,680
True. It's joyous.

756
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,620
This is your main husband.

757
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,160
What's so funny?

758
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,500
It's a chicken.

759
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,920
It's also your big brother.

760
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,580
From now on,

761
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,960
you can't sleep until it hits the hay.

762
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
You have to get up before it does.

763
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Grooming, feeding, cleaning the coop,

764
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,080
these are all your responsibility.

765
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,480
-Chief is right.
-True.

766
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,400
However,

767
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,330
you can also pay others to do it for you.

768
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,250
I can do that. You can ask me.

769
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,040
Here.

770
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,920
Serve your big brother to eat.

771
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,000
Believe it or not, I'll have roasted chicken tonight.

772
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,860
Don't you dare.

773
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,240
I just told you the family rules and you've already forgotten them.

774
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,840
Here, Master.

775
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,300
Let me do a demonstration.

776
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,100
Remember to pay me afterward.

777
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,400
Big Red.

778
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,560
I messed around with you for half a day.

779
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,420
Don't keep draining my patience.

780
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
Forget about it.

781
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,170
As Chief, I'm not an unreasonable person,

782
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,900
I also have a tender heart for fair "ladies".

783
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,840
Come to my room later.

784
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,640
So you want to know about the family emblem.

785
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,520
To be fair,

786
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,540
there's nothing unusual about this ol' dagger.

787
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,840
To be honest,

788
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,680
the emblem engraved on it

789
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,320
is the family emblem left by the ancestors of our Yu family.

790
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,440
Except for us Yu family,

791
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,900
nobody knows how to use it.

792
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,980
It's both ugly and difficult to draw.

793
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,210
What does this mean?

794
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,800
It's a character Yu.

795
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,440
It was handmade

796
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
by the ancestors of our Yu family.

797
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,680
Although it's a bit ugly,

798
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,340
it also has a pass-down value, don't you know it?

799
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,920
Where did you live 20 years ago?

800
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,920
Have you been living in Qingquan Stronghold all the time?

801
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,760
How could I remember what happened 20 years ago?

802
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,800
For as long as I can remember,

803
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,730
I'd been traveling with my father,

804
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,040
until he built the Qingquan Stronghold.

805
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,970
We've been living here since then.

806
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,880
So,

807
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,520
the Qingquan Stronghold was built by your father?

808
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,120
Right.

809
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,280
Do you know that

810
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
there's a type of creature in the world

811
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,610
called the spirit clan?

812
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,160
It's said that

813
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,460
the spirit clan

814
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
originally lived in the sky.

815
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,120
Thousands of years ago,

816
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,400
they descended from the sky,

817
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,240
to compete for territory with human.

818
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,080
From then on,

819
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
there is

820
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,540
one more great profession in this world.

821
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,560
It's called the spirit-hunter.

822
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,760
The spirit clan and humans fought for hundreds of years,

823
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,920
and hundreds of turns.

824
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,440
The spirit-hunters beat the spirit clan up.

825
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,720
They fled in desperation,

826
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,380
and have been hidden in the mountain since then.

827
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,000
But actually...

828
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,480
But actually...

829
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm just kidding.

830
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,719
See the look on your face.

831
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,800
You bought it.

832
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Really?

833
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,880
You really believe it?

834
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,880
These are just tales

835
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,210
my father used to tell me when I was little.

836
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,170
So your father's a spirit-hunter.

837
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,440
What spirit-hunter?

838
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,840
It's just a bluff he used to scam people.

839
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Did your father ever bring anyone back from the spirit clan?

840
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,239
I couldn't remember.

841
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,320
You can ask Second-in-Command.

842
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,250
He knows everything my father did.

843
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,020
Then what else do you know?

844
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,800
It's actually what you really want to know.

845
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,840
Why do you show such great interest

846
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,040
in our family emblem?

847
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,719
It's nothing.

848
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,880
I just happen to be interested in spirit-hunters.

849
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,880
Look at yourself,

850
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,160
for such a decent young man like you,

851
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,200
why do you still believe in this superstition?

852
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,000
Let me tell you,

853
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,120
there's no such thing as spirit clan in this world.

854
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,440
There's no spirit-hunter either.

855
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,880
I've seen my father spirit-hunting.

856
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
It's just a trick he did

857
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
together with Uncle.

858
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,280
It's just for scam.

859
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,610
Have you also been tricked?

860
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,960
What age is this?

861
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,300
How can there be people still believing in the spirit clan?

862
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,780
I haven't finished yet, why do you leave?

863
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,530
What a long face.

864
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,520
Master.

865
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,890
Did you upset the poker face again?

866
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,000
No, I didn't.

867
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,480
He just asked about

868
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,540
the emblem on the dagger and ran away.

869
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,920
He is such a handful.

870
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,970
I'd say you two don't fit at all.

871
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,920
Aunt Lu is simply impractical.

872
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,040
He looks like one of those

873
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,080
delicate sissies who obtains some knowledge

874
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,760
of lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting.

875
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,920
He thinks he is out of our league,

876
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,320
and the feeling is mutual. Am I right?

877
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,280
What do you know?

878
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,580
Isn't it just being delicate?

879
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,080
Isn't it just lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting?

880
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,560
Go.

881
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Bring my brush and ink.

882
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
I have a masterpiece to paint today,

883
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,840
to blow his mind.

884
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,480
You are quite ambitious, Master.

885
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,200
Impressive.

886
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,460
I'll fetch them for ya.

887
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,200
Sir,

888
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,100
how's it going?

889
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,620
She knows nothing.

890
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,130
She doesn't know anything?

891
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,440
But,

892
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,280
but the emblem,

893
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,440
and her appearance,

894
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,560
those are more than mere coincidences, right?

895
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
Although she knows nothing,

896
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,020
the identity of Paralyzed Yu is suspicious.

897
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,340
This Qingquan Stronghold

898
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,800
must hold more secrets.

899
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,120
But from what I know,

900
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,180
its former chieftain doesn't come back all year round.

901
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,280
So who else

902
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,320
knows about this?

903
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,460
Isn't this Aunt Lu?

904
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,980
Did you fail to fall asleep

905
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,480
and come out for a walk?

906
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,260
It's Second-in-Command.

907
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,890
I just wanted to take a walk in the stronghold,

908
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,440
to get acquainted with the environment.

909
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,970
I didn't expect to get lost.

910
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,640
It seems this Hotpot Courtyard

911
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,700
is not somewhere I'm allowed to come.

912
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Don't say that.

913
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
We are family now.

914
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,920
You can go anywhere you like.

915
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,380
It's full of goodies here.

916
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,860
Let me show you around.

917
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,880
Here.

918
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,040
See?

919
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
A secret chamber.

920
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
There are lots of family Yu's possessions

921
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,480
hidden here.

922
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,000
Let me show you.

923
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,640
Here, welcome.

924
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,480
Take a look.

925
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
The feather of a phoenix.

926
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,850
The eyeball of a four-eye bird.

927
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,000
And the tail sting of a hook snake.

928
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Such abundant remains of the ancient spirit clan.

929
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,210
You know about this kind of thing, too?

930
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,000
I know a smattering of it.

931
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,200
These

932
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
are mere garbage.

933
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,400
The ancestors of the Yu family were spirit-hunters.

934
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,800
They got a lot of booties.

935
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
The most valuable one

936
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,940
is the bone of Ying Dragon.

937
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,720
You can have it if you like it.

938
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,280
It doesn't possess the energy of Yun Xi.

939
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
No, thank you.

940
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
It's worth a ton in the black market.

941
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't have much to do with that.

942
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,360
Aunt Lu,

943
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
can you be honest with me?

944
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
Who on earth are you?
