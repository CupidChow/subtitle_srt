upon my blood?

What are they going to do there?

what about the Millennium Memorial?

There is a mysterious market on the way there.

Infant matrimony?

343
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,040
You mean you have

344
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,330
a fiancee in Yingdu?

345
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,100
If you don't like it,

346
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll withdraw it at once.

347
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,330
I have accepted two wedding gifts of money

348
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,240
from Nanfeng Stronghold.

349
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,770
It's time to give you back one.

350
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,780
I'll be generous when I need to.

351
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,030
You are welcome.

352
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,330
I don't even know

353
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,270
what she looks like.

354
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,670
I haven't met her before.

355
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,320
I have to see her in advance.

356
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,780
If we are not suitable, I can run early.

357
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,580
Since it's such a coincidence.

358
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
Shall we go together?

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,030
Together?

360
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,630
What good can it do to me?

361
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,590
Take our own way.

362
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,680
Then I'll be in trouble.

363
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,180
After Yanhuo Stronghold was attacked by you,

364
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,230
they have been hating you

365
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,270
and planning to attack you in the village ahead.

366
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,570
You seem to be not afraid. Brave girl.

367
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,900
But what about me? All by myself.

368
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,670
Everyone knows we are friends

369
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,770
when Nanfeng Stronghold helped Qingquan Stronghold

370
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,500
catch monsters.

371
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,930
If they can't get you, they will bully me.

372
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,550
Master. Master. Master.

373
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,530
I think Chief Gu

374
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,140
is kind of poor.

375
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,440
He is all by himself

376
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,480
and doesn't even have anyone with him.

377
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,630
If something goes wrong,

378
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,010
people will blame Qingquan Stronghold

379
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,800
for leaving him to die.

380
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
Not good for our reputation.

381
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,500
Stop it. Dahai.

382
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,470
After all, my life

383
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,780
has nothing to do with Qingquan Stronghold.

384
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,090
Master. After all,

385
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
we will have an assistant if we take him.

386
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,270
Then those minions from Yanhuo Stronghold

387
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,000
can't make any trouble, right?

388
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Fine.

389
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Let him go with us.

Let me take it for you.

Master. I'm not hungry anymore. Master.

It seems people from Yanhuo Stronghold have come here.

No more than ten people.

Maybe it's better for Chief not to take it.

434

Let's prepare something better for her.

I know her.

437
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,950
She would say,

438
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,770
"Take things as they come."

439
