174
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,280
What's up?

175
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,270
How…How could you suddenly appear? It's scary.

176
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,300
Or do you want me

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,470
to go back?

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,710
Wait a minute.

179
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,420
Were you in the interrogation room just now?

180
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,220
When did you get there?

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,270
How did you help me?

182
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,080
You asked me so many questions at once.

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Which one should I answer first?

184
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,780
Was it hard

185
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,960
to help me?

186
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,170
Actually, it was not hard.

187
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,810
You can learn it by yourself.

188
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,750
Me?

189
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,650
Are you kidding me? How is that possible?

190
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,930
You absorbed Yun Xi's spirit

191
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,410
and you were nourished with the energy core for many years,

192
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,910
so there is energy in your body.

193
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,540
As long as you find the right way,

194
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,660
you can also use some simple magic.

195
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,300
Come on.

196
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Give me your hand.

197
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,140
This is the energy

198
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,500
in your body.

199
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,610
I just got it out for you.

200
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,060
A…Amazing!

201
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,220
Teach me!

202
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,300
You've promised me

203
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,070
that if I help you, you'll pay me back 10 times.

204
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,730
This is the rule you set for me.

205
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,980
So when you

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,580
give me today's reward,

207
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll consider

208
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,430
if I should teach you other kinds of magic.

209
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,300
Goodbye.

210
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,190
Lu Yan.

211
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,390
You're petty.

212
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,550
General Yan?

213
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,890
What a petty man!

214
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,050
Ms. Yu, here we are.

215
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,730
Please.

216
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,710
Please.

217
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,870
How much have the Bais earned?

218
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,290
No wonder my father arranged a marriage with them before.

219
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,390
He's such a sly old fox.

220
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,570
Ms. Yu, this way, please.

221
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,750
Ms. Yu, this way.

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,060
Please.

223
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,350
Ms. Yu.

224
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,400
You'll be living here for a while.

225
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,320
Thank you.

226
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,030
Who are they?

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,320
Master said

228
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,120
these servants will protect you.

229
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,220
When you leave the house,

230
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,020
they'll follow and protect you.

231
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,080
Got it.

232
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,740
Alright.

233
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,290
Ms. Yu, good night.

234
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,810
The sly old fox

235
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,740
overestimated me.

236
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,590
He laid siege to me like this.

237
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,480
Even if I have wings, it's hard to fly out.

238
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,530
Lu Yan. Lu Yan.

239
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,530
What's up?

240
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,360
You're still awake?

241
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,580
Yep.

242
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,540
Thank you for the help today.

243
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,250
You sent someone to follow me before.

244
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll no longer be angry about that.

245
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm a woman of my word.

246
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,340
As long as you help me, I'll pay you back 10 times.

247
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Tell me. What do you want?

248
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,490
I want to see you.

249
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,280
You can do it anytime.

250
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,510
You know what?

251
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,760
There's only one chance.

252
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,890
You need to seize it.

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,120
Tell me what you want.

254
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm willing to do anything for you.

255
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
I want to see you 10 times.

256
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,400
Stop it.

257
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,370
Why are you even naughtier than me?

258
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,180
You're out of your mind today.

259
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,890
Let's talk about it another day.

260
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,950
It's time to sleep.

261
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,210
Is he still the one that I used to know?

262
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,590
How did he become so proactive?

263
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,260
Looks like

264
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,980
no one can resist

265
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,170
falling under my spell.

266
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,610
Lady.

267
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,900
Lady.

268
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,610
Guess what I've found

269
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,030
in the yard just now.

270
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,350
What did you find?

271
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,430
Just now

272
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,370
when I was feeding the last concubine's calico cat,

273
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,090
someone suddenly threw it over the wall.

274
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,060
Look.

275
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,350
[Kaitong Ingot]

276
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,330
Did you see the person who threw it?

277
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,460
No.

278
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,030
Anyway, I guess

279
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,430
it's a man.

280
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,890
How did you know?

281
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,150
That's what it says in every script.

282
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Over the wall and on the horse.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,330
Pass it in secret.

284
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,880
Promise to get married.

285
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,890
I guess it's for the last concubine.

286
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,800
Stop talking nonsense.

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,130
If someone hears you,

288
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,390
there will be trouble.

289
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,690
Zip your lip.

290
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,000
Now it's mine.

291
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,940
Don't tell anyone. Did you hear me?

292
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,750
Yes.

293
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,080
Well, lady,

294
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,500
today a girl moved

295
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,390
into Master's Western Garden.

296
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,800
Master even sent people to guard the Western Garden

297
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,110
as if he was afraid that the girl would run away.

298
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,480
The last concubine went missing not long ago.

299
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,980
Is my father going to marry a new woman?

300
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,120
No, he isn't.

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,320
She's one of the wanted people.

302
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,680
Is my father home?

303
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,940
Yes.

304
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,070
I'll go meet him.

305
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,380
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?

306
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,190
Get out!

307
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,990
How many times has the doctor said

308
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,720
smoking is bad for your health?

309
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,550
Why can't you keep it in mind?

310
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,920
Well, I'm your father

311
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,270
instead of your son.

312
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,010
Is it right for you to scold me like this?

313
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,320
Is it right? Is it right?

314
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,750
Mung bean soup for you.

315
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,150
Good girl.

316
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,960
Father.

317
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,070
I heard

318
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,580
that you brought a wanted woman home.

319
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,840
Her name is probably

320
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,340
something like Yu Deng.

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,620
She's got something.

322
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,250
She said all the recent troubles

323
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,130
were caused by the spirit clan,

324
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,420
so I gave her a chance

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,920
to save her accomplice

326
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,410
and prove her ability.

327
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,660
Her accomplice was also arrested?

328
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,020
We only caught one accomplice.

329
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,220
There's another one.

330
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,470
You're a lady. Why are you asking me about this?

331
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,050
It's a jinx, right?

332
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,130
Alright.

333
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,580
Shiqi.

334
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,970
I heard

335
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,630
that you met a male classmate recently.

336
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,280
Did Wan Quan snitch on me again?

337
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,990
It doesn't matter who told me.

338
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,829
Anyway, I spent money sending you to a girls' school.

339
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,740
All the teachers at the school

340
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,030
are women.

341
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,280
How could you get a male classmate?

342
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,460
How did you know him?

343
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,630
He…

344
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,510
Father, he's the older brother of my classmate.

When we studied in the provincial capital,

346
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,110
I hanged out

347
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,810
with him once.

348
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,150
Now he's in Yingdu.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
When I see him, I should say hi to him,

350
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,460
right?

351
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,510
Really?

352
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,320
OK. I believe you.

353
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,770
I believe you will never lie to me, right?

354
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,180
But remember

355
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,180
that there's an arranged marriage

356
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,720
between us and the Gus of Nanfeng Stronghold.

357

Although they are

358
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,710
really unreasonable

359
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,520
and they never reply to us,

360
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,800
we

361
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,900
can't break our promise.

Don't bring shame on me. Am I clear?

365
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,930
I know, father.

366
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,150
I'm OK as long as you approve of this marriage.

367

Later

I'll ask Mr. Gu's son to come here

375
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,280
and marry you. OK?

How to treat him?

381
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,030
Beat him.

382
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,020
Hang him up and beat him.

383

A lot of men want to marry you.

387
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,360
But what he did?

388
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,520
He never replied

389
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,860
to the letters about your wedding.

390
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,060
What was he thinking?

391
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,880
I'll tug at his ear, telling him

392
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,530
I can give him anything

393
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
only if

394
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,940
he treats my daughter well. Right?

395
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,190
If he dares to treat you badly,

you should dress up when you go out

It's no use for you to disagree.

687

I've already reported to Chief Bai.

General Yan,

691
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,210
I know you're worried about me.

692
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,150
But I am at least

the Chief of Qingquan Stronghold.

694
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,640
I have Kung-fu and I'm equipped with weapons.

695
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,470
And then there's the hair pin you gave me.

696
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,350
So, you really don't have to stick with me all the time.

697
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,670
Until I get him,

698
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,290
everything must be on my terms.

How can you be so unreasonable?

And

702
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,580
as soon as you arrived, you said that you and I were a couple.

00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,500

704

Are you and I a couple?

You're just a heroic husband.

706

Have you ever considered my honor and chastity?

707
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,610
Then when you took me back to Qingquan Stronghold,

708
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,010
did you think about my honor and chastity?

709
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,610
I'm not going to talk to you about this.

I'll stay somewhere else.

it won't work so well.

Are you threatening me?

716
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,580

[The Bai Mansion]

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,840
I've checked several places

760
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,050
where missing persons disappeared

761
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,050
and found some suspicious guys.

762
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,560
The guys you bring back

763
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,170
are spirit clansmen with the attribute of combining species.

764
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,830
Their energy is extremely low

765
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
and they are unable to revert to the spirit clansmen

766
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,480
or human appearance.

767
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,610
If so,

768
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,310
the last concubine may also be a member of the spirit clan.

769
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,040
Do you think

770

Spirit clansmen and humans have been living together for a long time.

772
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,610
I heard Xin say

773
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,740
examples of marriage between a spirit clansman and a human

774
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,600
are quite a lot.

775
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,900
But

776
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,660
the spirit clan are, after all, aliens in the nine continents.

777

become like this today?

It doesn't look like she was attacked by an external force.

785
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,600
It was more like some kind of change

786
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,900
has occurred from the inside.

787
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,090
If the last concubine is a spirit clansman.

788
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,020
Then she

789
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,210
should have some kind of attribute.

Let's go check her room.

791

It is unexpected that the last concubine

792
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,550
is still a childlike woman.
