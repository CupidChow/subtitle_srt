692
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,860
You are Chief Bai, right?

693
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,350
Let him go.

694
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,980
He knows nothing.

695
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,580
Make it between us.

696
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,860
Between us?

697
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,470
Who are you?

698
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
You're here to turn yourself in.

699
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,240
Tell us all about your crime first.

700
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,150
I heard that Chief Bai of Yingdu is wise and elegant.

701
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,710
Today I finally meet you.

702
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,110
But you're not that good.

703
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,460
What a fool!

704
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,100
Chief Bai,

705
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,400
today I'm not here to turn myself in.

706
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,600
I'm here to help you.

707
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:18,690
Help me?

708
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you.

709
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,860
Ms. Yu Dengdeng, right?

710
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,380
Are you stupid?

711
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,400
Help me?

712
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,580
Do you know how serious your crime is?

713
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,250
Because of murder and kidnapping,

714
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,910
you'll be sentenced to death.

715
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,480
Will I be sentenced to death?

716
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,310
Listen to me before making a judgment.

717
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,860
Say it.

718
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,740
I heard that Yingdu

719
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,280
is the gathering place of the spirit clan.

720
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,230
As a local officer here,

721
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,050
you must have heard of it before.

722
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,380
Stop talking nonsense!

723
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,430
Yingdu never advocates

724
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,060
those theories about gods and devils.

725
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,190
Why are you nervous?

726
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,710
Judging from the way you look,

727
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,370
I think there is a spirit clan.

728
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,970
I believe all of you

729
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,270
have heard of some strange things,

730
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,790
more or less.

731
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,469
To be honest,

732
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,710
the spirit clan does exist.

733
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,370
Both my disciple and I

734
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,150
are spirit-hunters.

735
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,420
That day

736
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,969
we arrived at Yingdu.

737
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,730
The sky was full of dark clouds.

738
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,210
A disaster was about to happen.

739
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,679
And I dare to say

740
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,710
the missing person cases of Yingdu

741
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,580
are related to the spirit clan.

742
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,270
Yes.

743
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,790
Yes, it's true.

744
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:38,239
Chief Bai.

745
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,659
That day I stopped your family's carriage

746
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,900
because I expected

747
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,710
the spirit clan would hurt your family.

748
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,650
Fortunately, my disciple and I arrived there in time.

749
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,909
We defeated the spirit clan.

750
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,989
Otherwise,

751
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,120
more than one member of your family would have gone missing.

752
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,580
I'm afraid that your house would have been filled with bodies.
