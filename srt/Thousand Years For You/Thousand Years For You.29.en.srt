[Episode 29]

27
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:45,979
How about this?

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,810
When we get back to Qingquan Stronghold,

29
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,100
I'll build a yard like this for you

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
so that you can live a peaceful life

31
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,680
and enjoy the flowers and plants.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,020
Okay.

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,220
Thank you.

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,660
You can't just say thank you.

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,060
How about...

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,050
What do you want?

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,000
Forget it. I won't force you.

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,170
I'm just kidding.

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,500
Let me tell you my discovery.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,590
Actually,

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,410
I also found something.

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,310
My discovery is...

43
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,900
Beware of eavesdropping.

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,020
Write it on my hand.

45
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,640
We thought the same thing.

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,260
We really have mutual affinity.

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,390
After you verify it tomorrow,

48
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,300
tell me with the hairpin.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,540
I will find a way to open a access

50
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,760
to get you out of here.

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,540
If that's the case,

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,090
it would be terrible.

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,420
When I think

54
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,330
you and Wei Du have to face this matter,

55
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm really worried.

56
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,540
It's okay.

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,650
But you must leave.

58
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,780
Find a safe place

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,200
to get rid of the spirit worm.

60
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,270
You should know

61
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,120
only when you are fine,

62
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,130
can I have no worries.

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,860
I know.

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,600
But you have to be careful.

65
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,010
No matter what decision you make,

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,820
I'll support you.

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,540
Boss.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,600
From the map,

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,940
this should be near Lingdong.

70
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,960
Maybe Chieftain Yu and others

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,850
stay in the nearby village.

72
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,930
We're tired.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,110
Let's stay in Baile Village tonight.

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,800
Find a place.

75
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,769
Be polite and don't disturb the people.

76
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,930
If possible,

77
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,820
ask about their whereabouts.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,850
Yes.

79
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,380
Boss!

80
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,680
This village is strange.

81
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,420
The villagers all look so pale.

82
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,140
I asked you to find a place to sleep.

83
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
Who told you to pay attention to their expressions?

84
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,100
Well.

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,740
They said the village head ordered

86
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,740
not to house outsiders.

87
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,220
And they wouldn't say anything else.

88
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,659
But I found an empty house ahead.

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,460
We can sleep there tonight after cleaning.

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,460
Let's go.

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,260
Go and ask what happened.

92
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,210
They said something strange happened in this house.

93
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,250
The birthday banquet was held well yesterday.

94
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,620
But then they went outside the village to worship the ancestors

95
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,860
and haven't come back yet.

96
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
The whole family has been lost.

97
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,700
Why don't they look for them

98
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,580
but praying here instead?

99
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,740
Exactly.

100
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,180
Some villagers said

101
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
this family was chosen and taken

102
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,060
by some immortal in the mountain.

103
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,500
It's a poor place.

104
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,180
It's good that they don't meet wolves, tigers or leopards.

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,710
There's no God of Mountain.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,950
God bless us.

107
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,820
I told you

108
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,220
the Zhang family

109
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,970
will be honored.

110
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,140
Surrounded by auspicious clouds,

111
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,780
it must have great luck.

112
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,380
It's really like what I said.

113
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,100
Are they crazy?

114
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,600
It's strange.

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,580
They all look like wood.

116
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,500
Right?

117
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,180
They not only look numb,

118
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,780
but also don't know anything.

119
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,740
I wonder

120
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
if Chieftain Yu has been here.

121
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,700
Have a rest.

122
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,900
Find a chance

123
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,580
to ask other villages tomorrow.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Yes.

125
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,700
Are you here

126
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,630
for someone?

127
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,100
After those nobles helped me recover,

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,730
they mentioned this thing called the Dust-proof Bead.

129
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,040
Then they really went to the mountains.

130
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,260
If they really did,

131
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,130
it's been three or five days.

132
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,340
It's really them.

133
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
I don't remember

134
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,970
what was in that place.

135
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,310
But it feels

136
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,490
it was a very scary and dangerous place.

137
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,820
Those distinguished guests saved me.

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,700
The missing wife of the Zhang family, Mei,

139
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,460
also helped me a lot.

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,159
You are their friends.

141
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Please

142
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,220
save them.

143
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,380
No need to thank me.

144
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,700
They are equally important to me.

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,220
Tomorrow morning,

146
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,780
take me there.

147
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,600
Wan Lishan.

148
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,500
Let more people

149
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,780
see if there is any sign of Dengdeng's whereabouts.

150
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,580
Yes.

151
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,620
Yu Dengdeng.

152
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,450
Where are you now?

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,540
Lu Yan!

154
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,710
Come out!

155
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,950
Lu Yan!

156
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,260
You brat.

157
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:27,900
Father!

158
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,370
-Come out! -Father!

159
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,100
Come out!

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,460
Father, stop wasting your energy.

161
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,460
He's not here.

162
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,260
I heard

163
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,780
Lu Yan wanted to sleep in your room last night.

164
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,580
Is that true?

165
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,460
Do you sleep together?

166
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,020
Peng Dahai

167
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,780
I was just telling the truth.

168
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,500
Father, it's a misunderstanding.

169
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,190
Father.

170
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,060
It was said to confuse Wei Du.

171
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,460
Confuse Wei Du?

172
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,810
Did you sleep together?

173
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
No. How is that possible?

174
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,540
No, of course not.

175
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,460
Are you lying to me?

176
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,260
We slept together.

177
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,900
Yes.

178
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,580
But we did nothing.

179
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,740
Nothing!

180
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,060
We were just discussing countermeasures.

181
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,540
I don't believe you.

182
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Why are you so noisy in the morning?

183
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Aren't you hungry?

184
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,900
Let's eat.

185
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,120
Uncle, you can't eat.

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,140
What?

187
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,640
There is something wrong with the food.

188
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,180
It stinks.

189
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,380
Then should we starve?

190
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,190
Hang in there for a while.

191
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,660
We should

192
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,990
leave here as soon as possible.

193
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,460
Lu Yan will find a way

194
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,540
to send us out.

195
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,620
But before that,

196
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,660
I need you guys

197
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,020
to check a few things for me.

198
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,780
What is it?

199
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,500
Dahai.

200
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,340
Do you remember last time...

201
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,660
Over there.

202
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,820
Are you kidding us?

203
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,440
Where is the karst cave?

204
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Every time someone went missing in our Baile Village,

205
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,540
it happened around here.

206
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,420
I remember there is a karst cave here.

207
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,460
Did you come here again?

208
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,260
No.

209
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,980
It can't disappear

210
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,740
so soon after several months.

211
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,670
Everyone, disperse and search carefully.

212
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,700
Yes.

213
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,220
Guys, where are you going?

214
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,730
Let's play dice together.

215
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,810
Dice?

216
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,870
What is dice?

217
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,130
If they don't remember how to play dice,

218
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,330
you can talk with them about the things happened in the underground palace.

219
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,610
Anything else?

220
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,260
Have you forgotten

221
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,690
we just played it in the underground palace that day.

222
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,060
When the Dragon-breaking Stone fell,

223
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,500
we worked together with the two generals

224
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,180
to escape, right?

225
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

226
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,650
It's the underground palace.

227
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,620
How we can enter as we wish?

228
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,500
By the way,

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,060
I remember your leg was injured.

230
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,100
Are you okay now?

231
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,700
Are you okay, bro?

232
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,620
I'm fine.

233
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,980
It's bleeding.

234
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,500
Hurt?

235
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,380
Let me see.

236
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,380
Let me see.

237
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,180
What are you doing?

238
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,740
Let's go.

239
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,660
Oh my god.

240
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,300
Is he really a monster?

241
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,190
[Weapons Workshop]

242
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,450
Miss, have a look.

243
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,260
Take a look.

244
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,300
Sir,

245
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,570
what kind of weapon do you want to buy?

246
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,970
The treasure of this shop is

247
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,210
in a wooden box.

248
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,380
It's a green sword.

249
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,660
I have bought it.

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,710
I want this sword.

251
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,860
Sir,

252
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,020
this sword is our treasure. It's not for sale.

253
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,610
If you want to buy it,

254
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,220
I have other swords.

255
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,740
Dahai.

256
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,060
You said

257
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,140
you saw a family celebrating the one-month birth twice

258
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,340
for their grandson.

259
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,880
Now go there

260
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,910
to see if they're still celebrating the one-month birth.

261
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,940
It's best to ask the kid's name

262
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,220
and see if it's the same as

263
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,480
what you heard before.

264
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,980
Please come in.

265
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,240
What are you doing?

266
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,820
Sir, don't be afraid.

267
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,120
My ladyship wants to have good relationships with others.

268
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,580
She heard you are celebrating the one-month birth for your grandson today.

269
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,860
So she asked me to give you some gifts.

270
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,700
Who is your ladyship?

271
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,820
Her name is Yu Dengdeng.

272
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,410
She is the future Queen of our city.

273
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,340
These are the one-month birth gifts

274
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,570
prepared by my ladyship.

275
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,220
It's nothing. Come on.

276
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,370
Thank you.

277
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,260
Please take a seat.

278
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,110
No.

279
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,940
Your guests are all your relatives.

280
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
You'll feel uncomfortable if I join, right?

281
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,620
By the way,

282
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,740
my ladyship asked

283
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,660
if your grandson has been named.

284
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,500
If he has,

285
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,660
tell me.

286
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,460
I will let my ladyship see how it is.

287
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,110
Yes, he has been named.

288
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,860
The single-character given name is "Jin". Liu Jin.

289
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,460
Dad, have you figured out the baby's first name yet?

290
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,910
Yes.

291
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,020
I'll name him Jin. Liu Jin.

292
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,380
This is the one-month birth longevity bun made by us.

293
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,860
Please let the Queen try it.

294
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,590
Please accept it.

295
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,940
As you wish.

296
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,620
I'll accept it for her, okay?

297
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,290
Go on with your work.

298
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,060
My goodness.

299
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,540
Take care.

300
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,900
OK. Bye.

301
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,270
My goodness.

302
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,780
Lu Yan.

303
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,580
I asked everyone to investigate in the city.

304
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,130
It proves that our guess is true.

305
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,880
People in the ancient city

306
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,810
do the same thing every day.

307
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,850
The next day, they will forget everything.

308
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,840
They don't remember what they sold.

309
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,090
They don't remember their injuries.

310
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,700
They don't remember they have given their grandson a name.

311
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,940
Are the food here

312
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,060
and people here

313
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,210
all illusions?

314
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,410
But every one of them is alive.

315
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,930
I'll listen to you.

316
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,960
We're ready to leave.

317
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,630
Be careful.

318
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,580
General.

319
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,790
After the enthronement ceremony tomorrow,

320
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,610
I will hand the Dust-proof Bead

321
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,020
to you.

322
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,020
You can use it

323
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,460
to treat Miss Yu.

324
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,710
Before that,

325
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,540
it's more appropriate to put it

326
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,930
in the underground palace.

327
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,850
Don't worry.

328
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,860
I asked you to take out the Dust-proof Bead

329
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,210
because I'm afraid that it doesn't have enough energy.

330
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,140
If it can't release enough energy

331
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,060
during the enthronement tomorrow,

332
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,260
causing the people in the city

333
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
to age and get ill,

334
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,780
finally, wars and worries are triggered.

335
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,020
We'll be in trouble.

336
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,220
You're right, General.

337
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,340
Please

338
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,540
check this Bead.

339
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,060
General.

340
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,180
How is it?

341
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,420
All right.

342
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,810
The Dust-proof Bead is full of energy now.

343
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,170
The enthronement ceremony tomorrow

344
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,780
will be fine.

345
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,220
Great.

346
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,580
After the enthronement ceremony tomorrow,

347
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,020

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,660
I've asked someone to change the bedding

524
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,900
into a new one.

525
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,660
Later,

526
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,260
I'll ask them to bring the mosquito smoke here.

527
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:29,900
Okay.

528
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,900
You're so thoughtful.

529
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
I will introduce you a better girl

530
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,780
if Dengdeng doesn't marry you.

531
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,580
Is there a widow Wang at the foot of a mountain?

532
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,810
The one who made her eight husbands die.

533
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,130
Keep her for yourself.

534
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,540
What's wrong, Master?

535
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,500
-Your ladyship. -Dengdeng.

536
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,140
-Your ladyship. -Master.

537
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,700
Dengdeng.

538
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,900
-Dengdeng -Master.

539
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,700
Dengdeng!

540
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,220
Don't scare me.

541
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,350
It's terrible!

542
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,800
After these days,

543
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,860
all the energy in her body has been exhausted.

544
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,050
Dust-proof Bead? Let me do it.

545
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,450
Wei Du.

546
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,440
Yes.

547
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,970
General.

548
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,720
How's it going? Did you catch Zhu Rong?

549
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,770
I've sent people

550
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,420
to search everywhere in the city.

551
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,950
He is cunning

552
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,400
and has the power of energy.

553
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,130
He is also good at disguising.

554
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,610
There's no news yet.

555
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,300
Zhu Rong won't retreat easily.

556
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,140
After that raid,

557
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,620
he never showed up again.

558
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,310
I always feel that he is plotting something.

559
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,940
Are you worried

560
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,860
he will rebel at the enthronement ceremony?

561
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,580
I'll send more men

562
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,080
to search.

563
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,190
Can Zhu Rong go in and out of the underground palace at will?

564
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,770
I let him in at that time.

565
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,420
But it was heavily guarded outside the underground palace.

566
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,470
The alleys in the underground palace are complicated.

567
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,020
If he's hiding in there...

568
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,930
No way.

569
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,920
Send someone to investigate.

570
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,060
Yes.

571
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,840
Forget it.

572
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,890
I'll investigate it myself later.

573
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,380
Yes.

574
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,700
Could it be...

575
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,420
He knows

576
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,690
I didn't let those villagers of Baile Village go.

577
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,980
So he doesn't trust me.

578
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,380
It's coming out.

579
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,590
Choke this bastard to death!

580
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,660
It's gone!

581
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,170
Are they going to die together?

582
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,970
That's good to make both of them disappear.

583
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,630
It's very exhausting.

584
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,780
She needs to rest.

585
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,460
Senior Master, don't worry.

586
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,680
I'll make tonic for Master.

587
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,780
Although the worms are gone,

588
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,540
will there be sequelae?

589
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,080
Of course.

590
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,920
It will affect

591
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,710
her physical strength and energy.

592
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,960
We need to stay here with her.

593
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Don't fan here.

594
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,740
You use so much strength.

595
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,140
How can I treat Master if you destroy the medicine?

596
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
If I don't fan harder,

597
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,580
the mosquito will bite my ladyship!

598
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,980
Go away.

599
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,370
Stop messing around.

600
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,340
Lu Yan.

601
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,530
Lu Yan!

602
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,380
Fool.

603
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,050
Where can I find Lu Yan for you?

604
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,850
If you're really worried about him,

605
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,160
get well soon.

606
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,330
Then go find your Lu Yan.

607
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,060
Don't come near me.

608
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,920
[Five Blessings]

609
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,660
Yu.

610
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,650
Yu!

611
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,940
Are you deaf?

612
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,210
Why are you stopping me?

613
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,630
Something is wrong with that girl.

614
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,720
-Let's go. -What's wrong?

615
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,300
Don't come over.

616
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,860
[Five Blessings]

617
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,420
Don't come over.

618
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,460
The villagers weren't willing to treat her.

619
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,540
It was Xiucai Sun who went to a faraway village

620
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,680
to get a doctor.

621
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,580
He prescribed medicine and acupuncture her.

622
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,060
Then she was sober.

623
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,700
But look, she keeps talking nonsense.

624
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,140
Look at her.

625
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,980
She lost two souls in the three souls.

626
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,660
But what did she see in the underground palace?

627
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,760
What made her so scared?

628
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,060
Miss! Miss!

629
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,330
Don't come near me!

630
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,820
Don't be afraid. Miss.

631
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,260
Don't be afraid.

632
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,100
What did you see

633
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,020
in the underground palace of Ancient Shu?

634
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,480
A big tree,

635
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,410
which ate humans.

636
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,470
Don't eat people.

637
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,060
Stop eating.

638
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,300
General.

639
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,720
I should call you Your Majesty today.

640
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,430
Let me help you change your clothes.

641
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,000
Leave it.

642
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,240
I can witness

643
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,040
that you ascend the throne.

644
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,720
I can rest in peace.

645
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,870
It's just a dress.

646
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,740
What does it matter if you follow your heart

647
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,630
even if your appearance has changed.

648
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,770
Your Majesty is right.

649
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,560
We have the same heart.

650
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,830
I always want to protect people of Shu.

651
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,600
It has never changed.

652
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,490
Your Majesty.

653
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,060
I have a question.

654
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,650
You like Miss Yu

655
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,260
and you want to save her life.

656
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,720
Why did you suddenly let her go

657
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,090
and stop treating her?

658
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,820
She's not from Ancient Shu.

659
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,860
So she has nothing to do with this city.

660
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,690
Now,

661
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,250
there are only

662
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,460
things between you and me,

663
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,420
as well as things between us and this city.

664
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,610
But if you give up Miss Yu,

665
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,100
I wonder if she will hold a grudge against you.

666
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,580
When she gets out,

667
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,760
if she is captured and used by Zhu Rong,

668
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,940
won't it become a big trouble for us?

669
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,580
How about...

670
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,890
Do you want to kill her?

671
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,900
This matter is up to Your Majesty.

672
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,700
We can't leave this city.

673
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,780
If this goes on,

674
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,290
you have to do it yourself.

675
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,480
But I think

676
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,770
Your Majesty is kind.

677
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,330
I'm afraid you can't do it.

678
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,300
Wei Du,

679
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,440
you weren't like this 3,000 years ago.

680
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,670
At that time,

681
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,700
you wouldn't even kill

682
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,620
women and children who were captured.

683
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,680
I was wrong.

684
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,990
As time goes by,

685
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,150
my heart becomes stiff.

686
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,420
How did you live

687
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,820
for the past 3,000 years?

688
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,300
At the beginning,

689
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
it was hard.

690
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,620
But then,

691
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,720
until now,

692
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,740
it's just a dream

693
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,920
that repeated year after tear.

694
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,450
I can't remember it so clearly.

695
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,140
Maybe it's because you're finally back.

696
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,710
All the days before

697
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,110
seem not important.

698
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,300
Is it worth it?

699
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,220
Yes.

700
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,590
Aren't you standing in front of me?

701
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,140
It's time.

702
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,330
Let's go.

703
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,370
General, welcome to be our King of Shu.

704
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,429
Let's begin.

705
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,580
Yes.

706
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,840
Because of the chaos of the spirit clan,

707
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,430
the foundation of Shu was collapsed.

708
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,160
Our soldiers have been hiding here.

709
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,450
We were blessed by the heavens to live forever and never die.

710
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,540
So we were able to take care of the people.

711
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,660
Every one is the people of Shu

712
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,110
in our city.

713
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,420
The world has changed.

714
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,380
But our people will never change.

715
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,660
I dare to use the Xuanmu

716
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,860
to announce that the Emperor Yan is crowned to the throne

717
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,900
to restore our country

718
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,860
to the previous Emperor and the previous Emperess.

719
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,460
Make the Emperor Yan the King and restore our country!

720
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,380
All right.

721
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,580
Get up.

722
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,460
Up.

723
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,540
Wei Du,

724
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,140
can you give me the Dust-proof Beads now?

725
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,020
Yes.

726
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,910
You once said

727
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,160
the people of the city

728
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,210
came from the remnants of Ancient Shu.

729
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,120
And this Dust-proof Bead

730
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,280
is the thing to maintain everyone's lives, right?

731
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:20,980
Yes.

732
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,180
Why do you

733
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,060
mention this now?

734
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,340
No.

735
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,860
Your Majesty.

736
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,980
Don't panic.

737
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,320
This Dust-proof Bead is fake.

738
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,960
As for the real one,

739
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,790
I've asked Yu Dengdeng to take it away.

740
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,020
What?

741
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,780
What?

742
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,820
Your Majesty.

743
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,900
How could you

744
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,580
give our lives

745
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,260
to a member of the spirit clan?

746
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,010
Do you know

747
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,920
we will die

748
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,180
without the Dust-proof Bead?

749
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,220
Do you really think

750
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,950
you will die without the Dust-proof Beads?

751
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,130
Do you really think

752
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,860
you can't leave here

753
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,420
because of the Dust-proof Bead?

754
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,380
What do you mean?

755
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,870
Back then, when we were old and mutated,

756
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,870
the Dust-proof Bead saved us

757
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,840
and helped us back to normal.

758
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,740
Besides it,

in this city,

760
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,790
is there any strength?

761
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,100
I ordered you to kill your horse.

762
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,180
Then why is it still here today?

763

This...

3,000 years ago,

765
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,990
in this city,

766
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,620
there was a one-arm blacksmith whose arm was broken.

767
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,580
Both of us asked him to repair the weapons.

768
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,120
Although thousands of years have passed,

769
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,170
his appearance hasn't changed at all.

770
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,070
Even his clothes,

771
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,790
and the furnishings in the house

774
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,610
Don't you think it's strange?

775
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,620
Well...

776
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,010
It's not strange.

777
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,120
It's not just the one-arm blacksmith,

778
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,140
but also the weather in this city,

779
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,870
what happens every day,

780
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,740
and the people living here.

781
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,980
Nothing

changes with time.

783
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,280
Although they look lively,

784
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,500
they are just repeating

His first name is Jin, Liu Jin.

788

No.

No.
