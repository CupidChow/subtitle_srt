could you tell me the truth?

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,990
Who are you?

31
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm the owner of Xin's Sedan Chair Company.

Where do you live?

that the owner of Xin's Sedan Chair Company is you?

I just came back from my hometown the day before yesterday.

a younger brother, and a younger sister.

Since you have family  to worry about,

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
why did you choose to come here?

Since I chose to stay here,

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,329

Our village is poor,

Don't you want it?

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,810
It scared the hell out of me.

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,570
Uncle,

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,329
you persuaded me to marry him

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,620
but now you say that you know little about him.

90

You're thinking too much.

91
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,870
I've sent someone to ask around.

92
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
He's indeed the owner of Xin's Sedan Chair Company.

93
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,620
His parents' and siblings' names are unknown to us.

94
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,060
Why have I never heard about

95
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,400
someone surnamed Lu who comes from

96
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,850
a large family in Chuan County?

97
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,640
It's because you're ignorant.

98
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,140
Am I ignorant?

99
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,170
In addition…

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,970
I'm going to marry Lu Yan

101
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,560
instead of his siblings.

102
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
It seems that you know a lot about him.

103
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,130
What else do you know?

104
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,490
Are his siblings

105
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,840
as good-looking as him?

106
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,430
Be serious, OK?

107
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,790
He is not an ordinary man.

108
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,630
Uncle,

109
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,790
don't worry.

110
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,660
Why do we have to be afraid?

111
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,550
If he seized something from us,

112
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,899
we could recover it from him, right?

113
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,470
Even if he was the king of heaven,

114
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,830
should we be afraid of him?

115
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,010
There are so many people

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,870
in our Qingquan Stronghold.

117
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,840
He is

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,400
our cash cow.

119
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,650
I have to keep a close eye

120
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,770
on him.

121
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,430
Wipe your mouth.

122
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,010
Cash cow?

123
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,970
Is it because you are bewitched by his beauty

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
and want a relationship with him?

125
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,200
That's right.

126
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,740
I take a fancy to

127
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,010
his money and face.

128
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,520
I also want a relationship with him.

129
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,840
Don't be bewitched by his beauty.

130
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Beautiful people are the root of the trouble.

131
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,860
A lot of emperors died for them.

132
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,310
Emperors?

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,480
Uncle,

134
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,760
I didn't expect

that you have such high hopes for me.

136

Don't worry.

137

I will not let you down.

138

Don't think I'm complimenting you.

139
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,500
Why do you like him?

140
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,830
I'm also

Are you on night patrol?

152

I knocking it for you?

155
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,540
I can also do it.

156

You're very kind.

157
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,270
Aren't we a family now?

158
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,350
Well,

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,170
I like to inquire about some anecdotes.

160
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,390
I heard that the former commander

161

is a spirit-hunter.

162
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,520
Could you tell me some anecdotes

163
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,720
about him

164
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,860
so that I can show off

165
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,880
to the face of those guys.

166
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,670
I indeed know something.

167
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,120
Let me tell you.

168
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,380
I also heard about it

169
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,690
from the former commander

170
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,280
when he was drunk.

171
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,180
You know our Chief

172
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,550
is Yu Dengdeng.

173
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,270
It is said that

174
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,130
when she was less than three years old,

175
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,240
she had a strange illness

176
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,390
and almost died.

177
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,730
The former commander prayed to God for her recovery.

178
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,150
As a result,

179
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,160
he caught a magic bird

180
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,070
that could save her life

181
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,670
at a big lake in the mountains the next day.

182
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,000
A magic bird?

183
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,800
It is said that the bird

184
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,730
had an aura of mystery

185
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,770
and was covered with golden feathers.

186
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,010
It might, I think, be able to talk when growing up.

187
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,960
And then?

188
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,390
The chief

189
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,380
had eaten it.

190
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,510
What?

191
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,260
They boiled it

192
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
and asked the chief to drink it.

193
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,510
She woke up the same day.

194
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,010
She was perfectly healthy, had great strength,

195
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,110
and could hit others hard.

196
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,920
It's all because of the magic bird!

197
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,240
They knew that the bird was extraordinary.

198
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,810
Why did they eat it?

199
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,590
Where did this strong wind come from?

200
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,730
It's going to rain.

201
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Let's go.

202
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,470
When Yun Xi's spirit is formed,

203
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,960
she will turn into a golden bird.

204
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,250
Against all expectations…

205
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,150
Sir,

206
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,810
don't unseal the energy.

207
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,030
If the energy went backward,

208
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,860
You would not be able to withstand it.

209
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,430
What the female chieftain said

210
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,390
is not necessarily true.

211
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,340
Even if the master's spirit was caught by them,

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,780
they, as ordinary people,

213
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,490
couldn't absorb and integrate it.

214
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,120
We still have another chance.

215
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,430
You're right.

216
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,520
If the spirit is still intact,

217
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,620
we still have a chance to get it back.

218
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,720
Yes, our priority

219
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,270
is to make sure that

220
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,799
whether there are traces of my master on her body.

221
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,049
I'll use the energy core to probe again.

222
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,820
Yun Xi's energy core and her spirit

223
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
must respond to it.

224
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,150
If the spirit is still there,

225
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,410
we'll get it out

226
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,830
while Yu Dengdeng is still alive.

Great, Yu Dengdeng is asleep.

229
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,730
Now things get easier.

230

Sir, I'll keep watch for you.

Lu Yan.

235
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,240
What are you doing in my room at midnight?

236
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,170
To murder your  husband?

Or your  wife?

238
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,270
You're thinking too much.

239
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,210
Do you want…

240
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,020
You are so low-down.

241
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,160
You're really thinking too much.

242
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,750
You look so serious during the day.

243
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,620
I didn't expect that

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,550
you would do such a thing like this.

245
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,900
Since you are here,

246

why don't you give me a kiss?

Go away.

248

I won't.

249
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,320
Why should I go away?

250
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,210
You came here on your own initiative.

251
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,460
Do you forbid others to do

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,930
what it is doing itself?

253
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,350
It's not time to kill her.

254
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,370
Yu Dengdeng, he belongs to my master.

255

Let him go!

Yun Xi's spirit

Sir, did you find it?

Yun Xi's spirit is still intact.

Great!

261

The spirit is the base for our spirit clan.

As long as the spirit is still alive.

263

The master has the hope of reshaping himself.

Sir, why don't we…

265
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,950
take out the master's spirit now.

266
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:13,990
Yun Xi's spirit

267
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,170
has been combined

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,580
with Yu Dengdeng's body.

269
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,690
We can only use our energy

270
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,230
to take it out by force.

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,180
I will do it myself

272
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,510
at dusk tomorrow.

273
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,080
Yes.

274
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,160
We'd better find a secluded place.

275
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,700
The pain of breaking a spirit

276
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,240
will be greater than that of breaking bones.

277
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,410
Even the spirit clan can't bear it.

278
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,340
Taking out the spirit

279
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,090
will probably be as painful as this.

280

If we took out the spirit here

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,590
this female chieftain

282
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,820
might make a noise,

283
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,940
and cause unnecessary trouble.

284
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,660

285
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,490
tonight you go down the mountain early

to make some preparations for me.

287
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,160
Tomorrow I'll have my own way

288

to lure Yu Dengdeng out of the mountain.

Yes, sir.

Recently, you show great anger after getting up.

294
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,240
Did I spoil your sweet dreams again?

295

It's okay.

296
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,610
Eat some of this

to calm your nerves.

298
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,540
What sweet dreams?

299
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,790
It's just an inexplicable dream.

300
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,670
Something's wrong.

301
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,470
Why does my neck hurt so much?

302
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,350
I just had a dream.

303
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,580
Why is my neck so stiff?

304
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,100
Your neck is stiff? Let me see.

305
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,300
Let me see.

306
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,760
Where does it hurt? Is it here?

307
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,950
Master, I know.

308
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,990
You must be drawing with your head down

309
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,910
for long.

310
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,590
Are these what you have drawn this day?

311
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,480
They are so fierce

312
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,980
and look like devils.

313
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,230
You know nothing.

314
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,960
This is Aunt Lu.

315
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,540
Why do you like Aunt Lu so much?

316
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,480
There are so many rich and handsome men in our town.

317
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
You chose to court him,

318
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,080
but he's not interested in you.

319
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,820
It is so hard for you.

320
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,630
He's a far cry from those ordinary men.

321
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,290
Besides,

322
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,430
who says I'm courting him,

323
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,910
and who says he's not interested in me?

324
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,510
Sit down.

325
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,420
Let me tell you a secret.

326
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,780
Last night he came to see me secretly.

327
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,250
My God!

328
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,660
Are you serious?

329
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,980
Tell me, tell me.

330
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,560
I like to hear those things.

331
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,880
Aunt Lu came to me

332
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,920
and sneaked onto my bed

333
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,930
last night.

334
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,710
My God! He is too bold.

335
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,920
Then what happened?

336
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,590
Then

337
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,460
we were in love,

338
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,420
clinging to each other,

339
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,400
and we had a fight.

340
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,300
I just

341
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,450
pinned him down like this.

342
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,350
And then…

343

The wedding will take place the day after tomorrow.

to buy some necessities?

However, I'm on a tight budget.

We'll be a family now.

it is not worth doing,

Of course, it is worth doing.

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,690
Master.

516
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,650
Chief.

517
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,270
Master.

518
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,760
Hey, guys.

519
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,180
How much longer will it take

520
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,670
to get there?

521
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,500
Guys?

522
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,200
What's going on?

523
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,260
Where are they?

524
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,390
Dahai?

525
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,230
Dahai?

526
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,180
So strange.

527
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,530
Where am I?

528
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,310
Aunt Lu?

529
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,020
How come it dispersed?

530
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,250
Could it be…?

531
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,520
Aunt Lu.

532
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,110
Why

533
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,910
is my heart in so much pain?

534
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,200
Feels like I'm dying.

535
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,030
Where's Peng Dahai and the others?

536
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,320
They haven't got here yet.

537
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,700
This place is desolate and unsafe.

538
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,700
We'd better leave.

539
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,740
Wait for me.

540
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm in pain. Could you carry me on your back?

541
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,530
Walk yourself.

542
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,750
You know what?

543
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,250
There are a lot of wild mountain animals here.

544
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,840
It'll scare you to death if you encounter

545
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,800
a wolf or a tiger.

546
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,650
Don't tell me

547
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,660
I just jinxed it.

548
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,530
What… What are they?

549
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,060
Wild men?

550
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,770
They are not human beings.

551
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,730
Your dagger won't kill them.

552
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,750
Didn't you say the man was in the sedan?

553
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,110
Who would've thought

554
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,620
they'd switch sedans?

555
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,610
But looks like that mister didn't lie to us.

556
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,920
These wild men are indeed fierce.

557
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,510
How useless you are.

558
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,520
If Dengdeng is hurt by those wild men,

559
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,150
I won't forgive you.

560
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,520
They won't eat us, will they?

561
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
There's a small possibility that they'd eat you.

562
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,920
You or me, it doesn't matter at this point.

563
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,040
If they eat me, you won't survive either.

564
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,980
Boss, we'll be exposed if you help them.

565
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,690
It's not the time to mind that.

566
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,260
Go ahead and run.

567
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,310
I'll deal with them.

568
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,340
Who is it?

569
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
Who fired a gun?

570
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,740
Did you see anybody?

571
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,080
Perhaps it's someone who's a trouble-maker and a meddler.

572
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,360
Boss, you are such an excellent shooter.

573
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,540
Boss,

574
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,810
I think we should leave.

575
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,740
If Miss Yu finds out

576
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,850
that we are involved,

577
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,730
we'll be in trouble.

578
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,230
Fine.

579
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,830
Those wild men are dead anyway.

580
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,870
Dengdeng should be safe now.

581
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,170
Let's go.

582
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,540
Come on.

583
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,500
What's going on?

584
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,020
I thought they were dead.

585
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,190
I didn't expect there'd be another Spirit Clan.

586
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,940
Master. Master.

587
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,120
-Dahai.
-Dahai.

588
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,750
Doctor, how is he?

589
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,590
Mr. Peng's life is not in danger,

590
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,630
but

591
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,370
judging by his pulse condition, I think he's poisoned.

592
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,910
Dahai, do you feel any discomfort?

593
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,040
I'm fine. I don't feel any discomfort.

594
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,020
I'm just

595
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,010
a little hungry.

596
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,590
Are you alright, Master?

597
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,470
His Chi pulse is sometimes weak and sometimes strong.

598
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,460
It's very rare.

599
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,190
A male's Chi pulse remains weak, while a female's remains strong.

600
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,670
If his is sometimes weak and sometimes strong,

601
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,560
then it means

602
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,110
he's sometimes male and sometimes female.

603
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,660
Sometimes male and sometimes female?

604
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,150
As long as his life is not in danger.

605
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,920
You may go back now.

606
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,050
I'll take my leave.

607
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,550
Doctor,

608
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,350
let me walk you out.

609
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,770
We are leaving.

610
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:05,650
See you.

611
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,930
Bye, Chief.

612
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,650
It'll be fine.

613
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,770
Take a good rest.

614
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,560
Don't listen to them.

615
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,590
As long as you are safe.

616
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,780
Dahai, what happened exactly?

617
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,360
Why did you faint suddenly?

618
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,380
Master. Master.

619
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,310
Chief. Chief.

620
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,240
Master.

621
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,680
The wound is quite deep.

622
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,330
Let me apply some medicine for you.

623
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,920
Don't move.

624
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,700
Dengdeng.

625
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,750
Go ahead and put some medicine on your wound. Let me take care of him.

626
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,590
My small wound is no big deal. I'm fine.

627
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,100
Let me.

628
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,560
Master.

629
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,280
Don't worry.

630
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,950
In that case,

631
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,590
that spirit clansman was the leader.

632
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,420
Did he come after you

633
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,040
or after my Master's spirit

634
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,790
in Dengdeng's body?

635
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,530
These  spirit clansmen

636
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,410
were all after Yun Xi.

637
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,360
Did someone find out

638
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,540
that my master's spirit gathered?

639
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,240
I didn't tell anybody about that.

640
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,350
Why would the spirit disperse after being extracted?

641
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,590
Stop looking.

642
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,750
How could it be recorded

643
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,220
in the human books?

644
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,540
Mr. Lu,

645
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,030
these are not ordinary books.

646
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,230
These are the ancient books written by a spirit-hunter,

647
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,290
[Spirit-hunter Manual]

Mr. Lu,

654
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,320
I found it.

655
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,240
Look.

[Five hundred years ago, a spirit-hunter swallowed the spirit of a spirit clansman by accident]

657

500 years ago,

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,420
a spirit-hunter swallowed the spirit of a spirit clansman by accident

663

but the spirit dispersed as soon as it was taken.

664
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,390
The reason is that the spiritual energy in this world is too thin,

665
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,500
and the spirit of the spirit clansmen is full of Yin energy.

666

If it's fetched by force,

667

687

It's okay.

Press harder.

689

Do you know

690
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,640
how brave I was at  that time?

691
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,050
I was surrounded by a dozen of wild men

692
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:34,910
who snarled at me.

693
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,440
They had long finger nails

694
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,110
and long fangs.

695
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,280
They came out from nowhere

696
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,600
and started attacking us.

697
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,980
I punched and kicked them

698
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,670
very hard,

699
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,660
and had them on the run.

700
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,450
You've got to train harder.

701

703

You mean Yu Dengdeng?

704
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,030
I'll ask her to shut up.

705
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,770
No need.

706
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,420
Just let her be.

707
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,690
She doesn't have much time to left anyway.

708

But Mr. Lu,

709
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,700
we can wait for the full moon night,

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,990
but

712
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,460
given the fact that it's so hard to find

713
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,470
even a hundred-year-old Spirit Clan,

714
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,460
how are we supposed to find

715
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,260
the bone ashes of ancient spirit clansmen?

716
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,280
There are bones of Ying Dragon

717
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,880
in the ancestral temple of the Yu family.

[Hotpot Courtyard]

724
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,350
You are saying the defensive barrier outside

725
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,790
the ancestral temple is made from bones of Ying Dragon?

726
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,030
Yes.

727
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,040
Maybe the Yus

728
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,889
are hiding a secret in the ancestral temple,

729
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,260
and that's why they used the energy

730
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,659
of the bones of Ying Dragon to make the barrier.

731
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,469
Is the barrier so powerful

732
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,020
that you can't even break it?

733
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,670
I may be able to break it by force,

734
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,440

don't you ever knock?

738
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,810
Why would I knock

739
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,940
in my own house?

740
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,159
What's up?

741
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,510
You must be tired from fighting the wild men.

742
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,200
Would you like me to give you a massage?

743
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,330
No need.

744
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,830
Then forget it.

745
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,830
Look what I got for you.

746
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,080
Why did you bring this to me.

747
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,370
It's your favorite.

748
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,340
When did I tell you it was my favorite?

749
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,160
Stop pretending.

750
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,190
When you saw the glutinous rice cakes,

751
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,390
you couldn't take your eyes off them.

752
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,530
Last time when you saw them

753
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,860
in my room,

754
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,400
you wanted to eat them in one gulp.

755
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,560
You saw it wrong.

756
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,900
Don't try to deny it.

757
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,070
I wanted to buy some for you

758
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,170
from the Li's shop down the mountain,

759
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,780
but they were all sold out.

760
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,760
So,

761
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,980
I cooked some for you

762
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,240
in person.

763
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,240
Give it a try.

764
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,450
I'm not interested.

765
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,650
You are so stubborn.

766
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,410
How do you know

767
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,800
you aren't interested without tasting it?

768
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,590
The ones you  liked before might be tastier,

769
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,370
but there's no way for me to get them for you.

770
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,270
Just try it.

771
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,900
Maybe you'll like these better

772
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,700
and I think they are more flavorful.

773
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,870
Come on, try it.

774
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,570
I don't want it.

775
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,270
One bite.

776
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:53,760
I don't want any.

777
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,480
Try it.

778
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,290
You won't eat it, huh?

779
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,550
Fine.

780
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,320
If you don't try it,

781
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,210
I'll stay here with you.

782
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,610
I like to stay up late anyway.

783
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,310
And seeing you sulking like this,

784
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,990
I feel even more energetic.

785
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,520
I can stay up the whole night.

786
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,410
Try it.

787
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,560
I am trying it.

788
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,780
What do you think?

789
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,160
Is it sweet enough?

790
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,350
I stole the finest brown sugar

791
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,940
from the Second-in-command's kitchen.

792
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,050
Do you like it?

793
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,080
Not bad.

794
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,300
It's not bad.

795
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,680
Would admitting you like it kill you?

796
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,650
Not bad.

797
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,850
Then I'll take it as you like it

798
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,240
next time when you say not bad.

799
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,510
Let me ask you.

800
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,390
Do you

801
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,830
like me?

802
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,550
Is this why you are here?

803
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,030
To ask me this?

804
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,620
Actually,

805
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,850
I want to thank you for saving my life.

806
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,650
I told you that you don't have

807

to thank me.

808
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,500
It was the hunter's gunfire that scared them away.

809
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,080
I don't think so.

810
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,360
It was so dangerous,

811
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,630
and you didn't abandon me.

812
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,380
We are a couple

813
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,150
who've been through life and death together.

814
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,450
You looked so handsome

815
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,040
when you bravely fought against the wild men.

816
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,330
I was so attracted to you

817
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,550
I even forgot my fear.

818
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,150
You protected me first.

819
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:18,940

if you need any help.

823
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:25,950
I'm willing

824
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,830
to do everything for you.

825
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,540
I don't need any help.

826
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,410
I just have a question

827
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,610
for you.

828
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,220
Go ahead.

829
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,710
What is the secret hidden in the ancestral temple of the Yu family?

830
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,370
Why is strongly fortified by a defensive barrier?

831
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,770
There's no secret hidden inside.

832
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,080
I've entered the hall many times.

833
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,230
There's nothing special.

834
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,190
Can you take me inside?

835
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,330
No.

836
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,530
The ancestral temple

837
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,860
only opens for ancestor worship

838
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,320
during important festivals.

839
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,720
And only the Yu family members are allowed in.

840
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,870
Important festivals.

841
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,740
Even the earliest would be the Mid-autumn Festival.

842
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,970
Looks like I have to find another way.

843

Oh, right.

844
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,850
After we get married tomorrow,

845
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,220
you'll be a member of the Yu family,

846
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,280
and I can take you inside  next morning

847

to pay respect to our ancestors.

848
