Master,

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,610
what is wrong with you?

60
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,680
Why take out your energy core?

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,420
You will die.

62
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,030
It's not working.

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm calling you over

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,170
to take Lu Yan away.

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,780
From now on,

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,380
Lu Yan

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,990
is your new master.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,560
No, Master.

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll take you with me.

70
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,330
I will find a way to save you.

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Zhu Rong is coming soon.

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,380
Leave now!

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,630
Otherwise, we'll lose all our efforts.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,790
No, Master!

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,670
This,

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,190
give it to Lu Yan.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,110
Then I'll take the General away first.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,130
Wait for me to come back and save you!

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,890
Wait for me!

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,030
There is another relationship called the love of men and women.

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,830
If your love for each other is deep enough,

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,680
it is also possible to give up your life for the other.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,240
So,

84
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,130
this is the love of men and women.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
The living one

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,030
is really willing to die instead.

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,310
When I woke up,

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,550
Yun Xi had disappeared.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,110
And Xin told me

90
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,480
she took out her own energy core to

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,550
save me.

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,909
General,

93
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,860
after Master gave you her energy core,

94
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,110
she let me regard you as my master

95
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,450
and take you away.

96
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,290
When I came back,

97
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,040
I found that the master's spirit had dissipated

98
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,340
and the only remaining thing was this spiritual feather.

99
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,500
Yun Xi is the Saintess of the Spirit Clan.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,970
Her original body is the golden crow

101
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,740
with which no ordinary clansman can compare.

102
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,330
Are there no other ways

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
to get her spirit back?

104
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,810
A way?

105
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,370
We, the Spirit Clan, have a legend

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,010
that as long as the person carrying the energy core

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,730
seals himself into a mountain with a lake

108
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,300
and uses the power of the energy core

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,650
to nourish the scattered spirit fragments,

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,190
the spirit can be reunited after 3,000 years.

111
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,220
Maybe this is a way

112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,740
to make my master appear again.

113
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,060
Really?

114
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,480
Only it's just a legend.

115
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,970
There has never been a precedent.

116
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,420
As long as there's a one-in-a-million chance,

117
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,290
I'm going to try it.

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,180
It is said that this approach

119
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,530
will make the person carrying the energy core

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,530
suffer great damage.

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,570
Even if you survived 3,000 years

122
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,630
and got out of the mountain,

123
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,510
your disposition and energy

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,830
might also be affected.

125
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,040
You might become indifferent

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,840
and your energy might also become unstable.

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,800
As long as we can bring Yun Xi back to life,

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,310
this really doesn't matter.

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,120
The Saintess is so righteous.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,710
She is kind of a heroine.

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,970
And you ought to find her

132
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,570
and save her.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,710
If I were a man

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,120
and met a woman like this,

135
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,050
I'd try my best to save her too.

136
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,100
So,

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,280
the stuff I ate before

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,870
is the reunited spirit of the Saintess

139
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,540
which you gathered for 3,000 years.

140
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,010
That's a tough one.

141
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,590
According to you, she's a nice person.

142
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm not a bad person, am I?

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,990
You can take the spirit if you want.

144
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,530
But can you let me live?

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
I don't want to die.

146
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,070
For my father has raised me for so many years,

147
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,340
you can't let him raise me for nothing.

148
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,860
I went to the Mysterious Market

149
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,150
to find a rare book.

150
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,670
It records an occult method

151
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,130
which can let me know all the things

152
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,650
a spirit has experienced from beginning to end.

153
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,400
I feel

154
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm about to find her.

155
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,550
What are you doing?

156
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,470
No,

157
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
I just want to talk to you about it.

158
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,190
You don't have to do it now if you don't want to talk about it.

159
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,110
We can have a further discussion.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,180
I must know

161
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,070
if you are her or not.

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,790
Am I her or not?

163
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,130
Who?

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,780
What are you talking about?

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,710
Don't be afraid.

166
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,360
This occult method won't hurt you.

167
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,300
Who am I?

168
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,730
Who else could I be?

169
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,890
I am definitely Yu Dengdeng.

170
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,950
Yu,

171
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,520
there.

172
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,330
Is that a little girl?

173
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,910
Father.

174
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,180
Mother.

175
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,940
Don't go over there. That's a spirit clansman.

176
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,890
What's wrong with spirit clansmen?

177
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't go over.

178
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,510
This child

179
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,680
is the same age as our Dengdeng.

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
If you leave her alone in the mountains,

181
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
how can she survive?

182
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,090
What?

183
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,860
You want to take her home?

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,190
-I'm hungry.
-Oh honey.

185
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,010
God has taken our Dendeng away.

186
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
What?

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,720
Maybe it's a chance

188
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,270
God gave us

189
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,740
by giving us this child back.

190
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,990
Don't you always say

191
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,930
there's no difference between human and spirit clansman?

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,950
Yeah.

193
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,910
Why can't she just

194
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,520
be our child?

195
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,950
Since you like her,

196
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,350
just take her back.

197
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,220
But you can't tell anyone about this.

198
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,880
Otherwise, the girl will be in danger.

199
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,700
Why?

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,140
What's going on here?

201
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,960
How can there be two Yu Dengdengs?

202
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,510
Yun Xi,

203
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,040
it must really hurt to take out the energy core, right?

204
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,510
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,750
I didn’t find you until now.

206
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,340
You, you stay away!

207
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,050
What illusion have you cast on me?

208
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,310
You can kill me if you want.

209
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,380
Don't do that.

210
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,470
This is not an illusion.

211
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,060
This is the memory of Yun Xi's spirit

212
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,440
inside you.

213
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,010
The real Yu Dengdeng

214
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,380
died young.

215
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,630
The Yu family adopted you

216
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,000
and covered your real identity with energy.

217
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,320
That's why

218
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,550
I've been treating you as a human woman.

219
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,790
Dengdeng,

220
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,500
you are the embodiment of Yun Xi's spirit.

221
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,590
You are the one

222
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,860
I've been looking for.

223
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,610
That's a poor lie.

224
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll tell you

225
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,280
the one you're looking for is the noble and mighty Saintess.

226
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,710
I am Yu Dengdeng,

227
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,240
chief of a stronghold who almost got killed by you.

228
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,750
You said I was her.

229
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,690
What evidence do you have? Who believes it?

230
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Evidence?

231
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,470
Didn't you just see all the evidence?

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,560
You are so mighty.

233
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,340
How do I know

234
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
what I just saw

235
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,180
wasn't made up by you to bluff?

236
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,180
I got it.

237
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,170
You're trying to make me willingly

238
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,080
give you her spirit, right?

239
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,540
That's too much drama.

240
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,300
No one dares to write a play script like this.

241
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,670
Three thousand years ago,

242
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,550
you gave me the energy core.

243
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,670
I've been looking forward to

244
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,840
the day when I can give it back to you.

245
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,050
I was born by my mother and raised by my father

246
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,260
and looked after by Second-in-command.

247
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,080
I am human.

248
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,670
Why would I want your energy core?

249
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,790
You leave your energy core for the one you like.

250
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,100
You are the embodiment of Yun Xi's spirit.

251
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,570
Now you are Yun Xi,

252
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,310
the one I like is you.

253
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,810
Stop joking.

254
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,870
Let me ask you.

255
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,820
Suppose I bought a jar of Dukang wine today

256
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,330
and drank it up.

257
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,660
Then I refilled the jar with Fen wine.

258
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,850
The jar is the same,

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,280
but could the wine inside be the same?

260
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,040
That is certainly not the same.

261
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
Think about it.

262
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,230
Dukang and Fen wine are not alive things,

263
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,030
but you come with a spirit inside.

264
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,190
Stop it. I won't listen.

265
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,030
How come I don't remember anything?

266
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,590
I'm telling you again.

267
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,160
I, the Chief of Qingquan Stronghold,

268
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,730
beautiful Yu Dengdeng,

269
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,310
don't want to play your game anymore.

270
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,860
I'm done listening to your story too.

271
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Let's part our ways now.

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,530
I know.

273
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,839
It's hard for you to suddenly

274
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,220
accept all these things.

275
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
But it doesn't matter,

276
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,310
I can wait

277
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,210
until the day your spirit recovers.

278
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,980
To confirm what I said,

279
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,520
you can ask your father for confirmation.

280
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,099
But for these days,

281
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,280
I hope you can agree that

282
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,670
I can continue as before

283
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,150
protecting you in the dark.

284
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't you be ridiculous.

285
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,480
Protect me secretly?

286
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,420
I feel more insecure

287
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,940
when you're by my side, okay?

288
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,600
Don't you have any idea how scary you are?

289
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,080
Spirit clansmen are also hiding from you.

290
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,990
Dengdeng,

291
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,530
the situation in the Mysterious Market is very complicated.

292
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,670
You also hurt your foot.

293
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,940
Where are you going?

294
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,540
You're a smart girl.

295
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,470
And you know that

296
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
you've been in danger many times along the way from Qingquan Stronghold.

297
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,940
You must have been targeted.

298
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,840
I don't know

299
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,100
what will happen in the future.

300
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,440
I have to stay by your side to protect you.

301
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,610
Nothing can be worse than someone trying to kill me

302
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,010
and take my spirit.

303
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,960
Don't you dangle in front of me.

304
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,640
For my bullets have no eyes.

305
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,160
You can still use the hair pin.

306
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,310
Here you are.

307
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,030
This hairpin is Yun Xi's which has energy with it.

308
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,410
This is the hair pin that Yun Xi used before

309
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,390
to dissect her energy core.

310
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,250
It can easily take my life.

311
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,190
Later if you feel that my actions

312
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,330
may threaten your life.

313
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,070
You can use this hair pin

314
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,950
to hurt me.

315
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,390
At that time, why would you hand

316
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,730
something so important to me casually?

317
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,160
I was in a hurry to save your life.

318
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,840
Maybe it's the fate of you and me.

319
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,530
This is destined to

320
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,840
return to the destined one.

321
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,610
Who's the destined one?

322
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,960
Weird.

323
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,470
What's this nonsense?

324
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,980
You don't believe me, do you?

325
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,200
Then I'll show you.

326
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,190
Hey!

327
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,990
You know that

328
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
whenever I get hurt,

329
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,570
the injury will heal immediately.

330
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,060
Now you can believe me.

331
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,840
This hair pin has one more use.

332
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,350
You call me using it.

333
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,500
I'll be able to notice

334
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,520
and come to your side right away.

335
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,280
So powerful!

336
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,020
It's better than any foreign phone invented overseas

337
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,050
with no need for wires.

338
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,490
How much does it worth?

339
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,670
Don't overthink it.

340
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,470
I'm not forgiving you.

341
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm just figuring

342
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,240
the things that I encountered along the way

343
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,750
are very weird indeed.

344
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,130
I can deal with humans.

345
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,990
But it's hard when encountering spirit clansmen.

346
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,220
Before finding my father,

347
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll believe you for the moment.

348
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,100
If you dare to hurt me again,

349
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,380
I'll stab you 10,000 times

350
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,050
with this hair pin.

351
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,340
So you agree.

352
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,550
Don't you worry.

353
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,150
I can assure you.

354
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,580
From now on,

355
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,940
I, Lu Yan, have no harm for you,

356
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,150
only guardianship.

357
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,110
Anyway, your legs grow on your body

358
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,550
and I couldn't stop it even I want to.

359
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,930
But I just want to find my dad now

360
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,020
and don't have time to hear anything from you

361
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,480
about the Story of the Saintess of Spirit Clan.

362
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,920
This is Millennium Memorial.

363
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,990
All the spirit clansmen and spirit-hunters

364
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,470
want this treasure.

365
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,870
Hope it will help you.

366
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,950
Seeing you so sincere,

367
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,330
I'll take it for now.

You can follow me.

369
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,810
But I have one condition.

370
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,730
What condition?

371
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,970
Can't get too close to me.

372
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,120
And do not live under the same roof as me.

373
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,790
Otherwise, I'd be insecure.

374
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,060
Okay.

375
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,270
Then I'll stay half a mile away from you.

376
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,300
And I'll never step into that range.

377
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,030

Lu Yan's energy is too powerful.

385

They escaped from the Mysterious Market.

386
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
I told you so.

387
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,320
With Lu Yan around,

388
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,960
you can't trap him at all.

389
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
Forget it.

390
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,680
Anyway, this time

391
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,650
we're just trying to feel him out.

392
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,720
I have laid a trap in Yingdu.

393
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's see if he has the luck

394
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,330
to get out or not.

395
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,360
I just left some energy

396
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,660
on Yu Dengdeng.

397
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,470
Lu Yan took her out of the Mysterious Market to heal her wounds.

398
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,190
My energy got some strange fluctuations.

399
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,800
I found Yu Dengdeng's energy

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,910
is similar to someone.

401
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,190
Who’s that?

402
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,540

403
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,360

For sure.

405

If that's the case,

406
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,760
it would make sense.

407
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,290
I was wondering why Lu Yan

408
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,420
has been staying around

409
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,750
an ordinary human woman.

410

I'll have to try that girl first.

It stinks.

414
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,180
This really stinks.

415
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,480
If my Master hadn't asked me to save you,

416
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,430
you and Chief Gu

417
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,530
would still be trapped in the Mysterious Market.

418
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,110
You let go of me.

419
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,460
Will you show some gratitude?

420
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Calm yourself!

421
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,910
What about this little weirdo?

422
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,360
What do you think?

423
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm afraid that she may have already killed a lot of people

using this hotel.

425
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,890
I think it's better to just kill her.

426
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,170
That's not true.

427

she didn't hurt anyone's life.

But I don't know what happened.

440

Our parents

441
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,710
disappeared one after another.

442
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,270
We later found out that

443
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,430
they all disappeared in Yingdu.

444
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,840

we opened this hotel for robbery.

it has to rain, right?

614
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,120
When it's raining,

615
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,900
it waters a field, right?

No matter how fertile this field is,

617
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,830

Don’t take it seriously.

681
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,650
Spirit Clan’s Saintess?

682
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,510

686
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,180
I didn't use my hands.

695
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,710
It's already autumn and it's still so hot.

696

Why don't we also switch to horseback riding?

697

706

to get some cold water from the well

707

Master,

712
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,500

Where can we hide from the rain in the middle of nowhere?

Where are our umbrellas?

725
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,710
I left our umbrellas at the Rose Hotel.

726
