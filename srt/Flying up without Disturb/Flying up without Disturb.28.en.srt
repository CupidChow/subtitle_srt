=Episode 28=

16
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:48,644
Ling Bo.

17
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,124
What is this place?

18
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:04,644
This compass doesn't seem reliable.

19
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:07,165
Are you sure
the Soul Anchoring Lamp is here?

20
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:08,845
That's what

21
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:09,728
the manual says.

22
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,804
It states within this ruined city.

23
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:12,544
When we were

24
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:13,364
outside just now,

25
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:14,524
it pointed directly here.

26
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,565
It should be right here.

27
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:17,804
This place is enormous

28
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:18,944
and dilapidated.

29
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,684
There's not even a trace

30
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:21,204
of the Lamp.

31
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:22,764
Keep searching.

32
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,084
Lin Hu,

33
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,244
we are not going
to tear the place apart, are we?

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,885
Since the compass shows it's here,

35
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:33,804
we'll tear it apart

36
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,725
if we have to.

37
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,005
Let's start tearing?

38
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:10,176
Lin Hu,

39
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:11,804
what exactly does

40
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,325
the Soul Anchoring Lamp look like?

41
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:15,244
- Let's not miss it
- Well...

42
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:16,005
without knowing.

43
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,504
Young Master said

44
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,244
this Soul Anchoring Lamp

45
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:21,568
is a divine mountain-sealing artifact

46
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:22,964
nurtured by heaven,

47
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,576
and offered to the lord of this city.

48
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,244
So

49
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,005
do you know

50
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,725
its appearance or not?

51
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,524
We'll know once we find it.

52
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,040
So you don't actually know?

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,244
Then why are we searching?

54
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:37,364
Not knowing isn't a crime.

55
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:38,325
I'll know if I find it.

56
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:39,165
Why are you mad?

57
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:53,244
This must be it.

58
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:54,405
Good thing we have a compass.

59
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,605
Or we'd never have found you.

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,484
Take a look.

61
00:03:58,644 --> 00:03:59,285
Wait.

62
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,764
This spiritual tool draws power
from heaven and earth.

63
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:03,804
Handle it cautiously.

64
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:08,684
Oh, lamp.

65
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:09,964
Divine lamp.

66
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,285
We just need you to save lives.

67
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,725
Nothing else.

68
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,484
Please don't harm me.

69
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,444
Smell it?

70
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,004
Feel it.

71
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,285
See if it has spiritual energy.

72
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:29,525
How is it?

73
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:31,564
Nothing at all.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,232
This doesn't look like a lamp to me.

75
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:37,924
Lin Hu!

76
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,285
That painting!

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,484
Utmost tranquility, selfless void.

78
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,085
Got it!

79
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:58,324
Looks like this.

80
00:04:58,324 --> 00:04:59,364
Excellent.

81
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,525
Excellent.

82
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,725
Let go.

83
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,045
No, I won't.

84
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,605
Your young master is waiting.

85
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:15,004
Yes, he's waiting.

86
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,124
How can I expel

87
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,160
the Gu parasite?

88
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:50,605
Kong Hou.

89
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,004
Zhong Xi.

90
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,605
Why do you look so pale?

91
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:55,725
Just now,

92
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,564
were you trying to force
the Gu parasite out?

93
00:05:58,684 --> 00:05:59,484
Yes.

94
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:03,744
But the dark cultivator's techniques
are too sinister.

95
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:05,564
I've studied for days,

96
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:06,564
yet remain unable

97
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,965
to expel the Gu parasite.

98
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:09,924
It's a pity that Xiao Pei

99
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:10,845
stole ancient books

100
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,804
from Jiusu,

101
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,504
but I barely glimpsed them

102
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,784
before she had to return them.

103
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:16,605
Given more time,

104
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,684
I would surely find a solution

105
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:20,244
from those books.

106
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,124
If that's the case,

107
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,872
I'll go back to Jiusu's lair again.

108
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:25,564
I'll retrieve all those books

109
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:26,444
for you.

110
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:27,845
Wait here. I'm leaving now.

111
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:28,765
Kong Hou.

112
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,168
Perhaps

113
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,564
I should go with you?

114
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,124
When I meet Jiusu,

115
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,285
if it's just me,

116
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,896
I could make excuses to him.

117
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,004
I know

118
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:40,124
my current condition

119
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,016
will only cause you trouble.

120
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:43,605
But

121
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,045
if I make you steal the books,

122
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,845
you'd take risks like Xiao Pei.

123
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:48,285
Either way,

124
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,924
it doubles the risk.

125
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,096
If I can go there personally,

126
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,405
it should be more effective

127
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,244
than our current approach.

128
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,144
You have a point.

129
00:06:59,004 --> 00:06:59,765
How about this?

130
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:00,884
I've already

131
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:01,884
informed Jiusu

132
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:02,765
that I'm visiting

133
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,128
Liuguang Sect these days.

134
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:05,684
Before then,

135
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,880
I'll find a way

136
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,004
to bring you along

137
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:08,896
to visit him once.

138
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:13,364
Are you all right?

139
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:15,285
This...

140
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:16,965
Why did a barrier suddenly appear?

141
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:17,605
Exactly!

142
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,405
There wasn't one

143
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,205
when we entered.

144
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,605
I knew getting this lamp

145
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:22,880
wouldn't be that easy.

146
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:23,845
The lamp?

147
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,124
Is the lamp intact?

148
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:28,645
Well...

149
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,004
Why is it gone?

150
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:31,924
It was in my hand moments ago.

151
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,085
I'm afraid we've been tricked

152
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,124
by the lamp.

153
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,045
Creating barriers and disappearing,

154
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,845
it seems it doesn't want to leave.

155
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:39,525
It has self-awareness?

156
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,244
Didn't your young master say

157
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:43,444
this Soul Anchoring Lamp

158
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:44,725
is born divine mountain-sealing

159
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,624
artifact nurtured by heaven?

160
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,444
So it's not strange it's aware.

161
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,045
Lamp!

162
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,048
Divine lamp!

163
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:56,285
We came seeking your help!

164
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:57,484
As a spiritual tool,

165
00:07:57,484 --> 00:07:59,004
shouldn't you save lives

166
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,444
and uphold justice?

167
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:04,416
Actually, spiritual tools
have no such obligations.

168
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,104
Fair point.

169
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:08,965
Then we should...

170
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:36,724
Are you okay?

171
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:39,964
Soul Anchoring Lamp,

172
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,525
what do you really want?

173
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:44,485
I was peacefully sleeping

174
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:45,204
in my storybook.

175
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:45,844
It speaks!

176
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,564
You two disturbed my tranquility.

177
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:48,604
How annoying!

178
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:49,632
You can't leave!

179
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:50,724
Divine lamp,

180
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,804
we need your help to save lives.

181
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:53,924
Why should I save lives?

182
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:54,645
No way.

183
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:57,204
What not?

184
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,724
You're an ancient spiritual tool.

185
00:08:58,924 --> 00:08:59,924
The Ten Great Sects have

186
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:01,405
many ancient spiritual tools too.

187
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,844
When I tell them

188
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:04,084
about your petty refusal

189
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,645
to save dying lives,

190
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:07,125
they'll mock you endlessly!

191
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
Yes, endless mockery!

192
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:10,844
I don't fear mockery!

193
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:11,924
However,

194
00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:12,765
I've slept here

195
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:13,724
for centuries.

196
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,204
It is rather dull.

197
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,245
Fine then.

198
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,444
I'll give you one chance.

199
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:18,005
One chance?

200
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:18,604
If you

201
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:19,765
can find me once,

202
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:20,924
I'll go with you.

203
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,485
Fine.

204
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,604
Promise sealed.

205
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,245
Now hide properly!

206
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:47,604
There's nothing...

207
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:56,525
Soul Anchoring Lamp?

208
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:04,684
You know.

209
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,245
This room's small.

210
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,765
What is Soul Anchoring Lamp's

211
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,125
true form?

212
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:17,405
It's the paperweight.

213
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:18,684
There used to be

214
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,045
a small piece of porcelain.

215
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,485
Are you saying

216
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:22,765
it's transformed?

217
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,604
Then catch it.

218
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:27,485
To tame it,

219
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:28,844
mere capture won't suffice.

220
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,365
What do we do?

221
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,125
I've got an idea.

222
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:38,084
Let's use our spiritual energy to infuse

223
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,804
the paperweight with itchy liquid.

224
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,005
Let's see how long it can endure.

225
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,964
A drop won't be enough.

226
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:45,724
We need at least a hundred times more.

227
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:46,365
That way,

228
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,245
it'll transform into an ugly monster!

229
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:02,885
Stop!

230
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,645
You two nuisances!

231
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,005
Soul Anchoring Lamp,
we genuinely need you.

232
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:08,285
If you return with us

233
00:11:08,285 --> 00:11:09,324
to save our friend,

234
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:10,724
we'll reward you handsomely.

235
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,525
Name any condition you wish.

236
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:14,604
Really?

237
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,564
Yes.

238
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,564
Then here's the deal.

239
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:17,684
After everything's done,

240
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,165
you two must bring me back here

241
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:20,736
and play with me for 800 years.

242
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,604
800 years?

243
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,525
This...

244
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:25,888
I agree.

245
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,324
Me too.

246
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,885
We can even form a spiritual pact!

247
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,844
This little thing
is quite the trickster.

248
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,645
Well...

249
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,924
Do you truly plan

250
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,604
to stay here with it for 800 years?

251
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,204
That was just talk earlier.

252
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:55,165
We need it to help us first.

253
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:58,285
Ling Bo, thank you.

254
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,885
No need. It's my duty.

255
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,604
Anyway,

256
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:03,844
after it's over,

257
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:05,204
wherever

258
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:06,324
you go,

259
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:07,365
I'll go with you.

260
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,056
Alright, let's go.

261
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:11,765
Let's go.

262
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,656
After delivering the lamp
to Young Master,

263
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:16,844
we're already halfway there.

264
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,844
By then,

265
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:18,924
peace will reign.

266
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:19,844
What?

267
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:21,165
Only halfway?

268
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:21,765
Yes.

269
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:23,084
First,

270
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:24,285
the lamp must actually work.

271
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,285
If it can't suppress

272
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:26,405
the dark cultivator blood

273
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:27,724
within Kong Hou's body,

274
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,204
this whole trip was pointless.

275
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,684
What do you mean by "actually work"?

276
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,645
If you don't trust me,

277
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,568
don't ask for my help.

278
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,564
It's not about trust.

279
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:36,964
We'll only know if it works

280
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,724
once you meet her

281
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,285
and the illness is cured, right?

282
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:40,684
You'll see!

283
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:45,525
I truly hope our Liuguang Sect

284
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,405
recruits more juniors.

285
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,084
After eliminating the dark cultivator,

286
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:50,885
when Young Master

287
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:51,844
leads the new disciples,

288
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:53,245
I'll play with them every day.

289
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,005
A simple wish.

290
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:56,844
Wish?

291
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,045
Speaking of wishes, I do have one.

292
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,804
What is it? Can you share?

293
00:13:00,844 --> 00:13:01,765
It's...

294
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:05,365
Spit it out or don't!

295
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,125
Fine! I'll say it.

296
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,604
My wish is

297
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,216
to find a cultivation partner

298
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,136
who shares my passions.

299
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:17,344
And we'll raise children together

300
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,724
and keep a dog.

301
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,324
Whether we ascend

302
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,792
or remain in Lingyou Realm,

303
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,072
we'll

304
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:24,964
live blissfully like immortals.

305
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,165
The fox wants a wife!

306
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:31,645
Too bad. No one wants a stinky fox.

307
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:33,765
Y-You foolish lamp!

308
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:35,165
Oh, I get it!

309
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:36,724
You want Ling Bo

310
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:38,285
to marry you.

311
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:39,684
Silence!

312
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:40,844
Nonsense!

313
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:43,204
I-It's just talking nonsense.

314
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:45,924
So you...

315
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,405
Don't you think this idea of mine

316
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,365
is perfect?

317
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,045
That's all?

318
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:50,924
That's it.

319
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:51,684
Perfect?

320
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:52,485
Not perfect?

321
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:53,645
Cliché!

322
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,324
A grown man

323
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,005
spends all day

324
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:57,324
obsessing over love.

325
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,444
Wait. What do you mean

326
00:13:58,444 --> 00:13:59,844
"a grown man obsessing over love?"

327
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:00,844
This is called

328
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,844
f-fundamental human nature.

329
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,125
Desires, okay?

330
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,245
You said it yourself

331
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,885
it's fundamental human nature.

332
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,005
You stinky fox,

333
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,645
dare crave love?

334
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:11,125
Exactly!

335
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:12,604
Silence!

336
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:16,604
I admit

337
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:17,604
I'm not human.

338
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:19,604
But even as a fox,

339
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:20,405
these feelings

340
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:21,525
are perfectly normal, right?

341
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:22,924
Well, you?

342
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,885
What's your ideal version

343
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:26,885
of a perfect life?

344
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,525
As for me,

345
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,645
I want to rightfully

346
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,064
become the revered

347
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,844
head of Zhaohan Sect.

348
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:39,724
That's...

349
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:41,280
T-That's all?

350
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,005
Nothing else?

351
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,804
Nothing more.

352
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:46,365
Let's go.

353
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:47,045
Truly nothing?

354
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:48,324
Wait.

355
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,405
Your ambition seems too basic.

356
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,125
Stop. Stop!

357
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,165
What's happening?

358
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:55,924
It smells so good!

359
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:56,804
I've been sealed

360
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,084
in that place for centuries.

361
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,924
I haven't received offerings in ages.

362
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,365
Buy me treats now,

363
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,684
or I refuse to move.

364
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,324
Our journey is urgent.

365
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,324
After finishing our task,

366
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,765
we'll buy you whatever you want.

367
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:08,245
Deal?

368
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,405
No! I need to eat now!

369
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:12,324
Or else, I'll...

370
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:13,165
Immolate myself!

371
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:14,365
Immolate yourself?

372
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,645
Go ahead. Show me.

373
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:16,645
Fine.

374
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,045
Let it eat if it insists.

375
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:18,964
Better than having

376
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:19,964
it cause trouble later.

377
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:22,604
Alright then.

378
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,084
Eat!

379
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,964
That's more like it.

380
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:26,604
Let's go.

381
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:27,324
Go.

382
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,324
I've confirmed

383
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:48,005
Jiusu will leave today on business,

384
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,285
with Wu Bei accompanying him.

385
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:50,645
We have ample time

386
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:51,680
to search thoroughly.

387
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:28,645
These books

388
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:31,245
mainly record esoteric arts.

389
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,604
We should find clues here.

390
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:53,525
Let me handle it.

391
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:08,364
I'm so scared.

392
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:10,324
Since coming here

393
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:11,725
with Jiusu,

394
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,005
I've kept telling myself

395
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:15,485
to stay strong.

396
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,164
But

397
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,884
I've done so many things
against my conscience.

398
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,920
Will everyone hate me?

399
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,084
After all this,

400
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:26,045
will they ever forgive me?

401
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,045
Yes.

402
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,084
Everything you've done

403
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,084
is for all living beings

404
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,005
in the Lingyou Realm.

405
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:33,920
I've witnessed it all.

406
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:35,804
At that time,

407
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,960
I'll testify for you.

408
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,045
I believe those

409
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:39,488
who survived because of you

410
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:40,925
will all be grateful

411
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:44,224
just like me.

412
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,208
But this time,

413
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,485
without any reason,

414
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,848
I always feel uneasy.

415
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,088
Zhong Xi,

416
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,324
promise me.

417
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,525
This time when I'm out,

418
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:57,792
no matter what happens,

419
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,445
you must protect yourself.

420
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:00,765
Don't have any contact

421
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:01,804
with Jiusu.

422
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:02,765
You

423
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:05,324
have to wait here for me to return.

424
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:06,285
Understood.

425
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:09,525
I promise you.

426
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:11,765
It makes sense.

427
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:13,344
You're juggling both sides,

428
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,456
anxious

429
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:16,884
and on edge

430
00:18:17,124 --> 00:18:18,528
the whole time.

431
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,604
That's normal.

432
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:23,364
I'll wait for you here.

433
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,604
Let's search now.

434
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:29,765
See

435
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:30,685
if there's a way

436
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,765
to remove the Gu parasites.

437
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,285
You foolish lamp. You really eat a lot.

438
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,205
You ordered even when you can't finish.

439
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:39,844
Enjoyed it?

440
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:40,485
Can't finish it?

441
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,124
Isn't it nice just to smell it?

442
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,205
If you obediently

443
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:43,925
help me,

444
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:44,804
we'll let smell many

445
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:45,364
tasty foods.

446
00:18:45,364 --> 00:18:46,245
Stop. Stop.

447
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:47,485
- What's wrong now?
- What's wrong?

448
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,884
I want to see a beauty.

449
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,245
The street is deserted,

450
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,324
not a single beauty.

451
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:53,045
Stop messing around, okay?

452
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,124
We're not out for fun.

453
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,725
We're on an important
lifesaving mission.

454
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:56,604
Exactly.

455
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:57,925
What's wrong?

456
00:18:58,164 --> 00:18:59,445
It pricked me.

457
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:00,084
I...

458
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,685
You fool lamp.

459
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:02,644
What's wrong with you?

460
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:03,485
If you joke again,

461
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:04,525
I really won't be polite.

462
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:06,364
- She hit me first!
- Forget it.

463
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,084
Zhong Xi and Kong Hou are still waiting.

464
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:08,804
We need to hurry.

465
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:09,644
Behave yourself.

466
00:19:11,245 --> 00:19:12,205
Zhong Xi, look.

467
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,164
Nine-Yin Corpse Gu.

468
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,445
It's forged from a pure-yin corpse

469
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:19,164
that perished in a place

470
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:21,124
of utmost yin, thus the Gu is born.

471
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,604
Once Nine-Yin Corpse Gu

472
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,192
enters a living body,

473
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:26,205
if not driven by spiritual energy,

474
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,765
the person remains the same
as any other.

475
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,285
But if the caster

476
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,205
activates it with spiritual energy,

477
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:35,124
it will cause severe pain
to the heart and insanity.

478
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:37,804
Within half a day, they will bleed
from the orifices and die.

479
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:40,445
This must be

480
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:41,725
the Gu parasite Jiusu forged.

481
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,404
Is there a way to break it?

482
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:44,364
Let me see.

483
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,245
Here it is.

484
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,205
Take a container.

485
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,205
Fill it with the blood

486
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,445
of a pure individual,

487
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,965
and then cut the palm

488
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,164
of the afflicted person.

489
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:00,925
Cast a spell,

490
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,084
and the Gu parasite

491
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,765
will be attracted to the fresh blood.

492
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,685
Once it is immobilized,

493
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,485
burn it with true fire.

494
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:09,884
Zhong Xi,

495
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,045
isn't this

496
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,084
the solution?

497
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:13,285
Let's try it now.

498
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,844
But

499
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:17,525
what does the book mean

500
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:20,404
by the fresh blood

501
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,725
of a pure individual?

502
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,164
Well...

503
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,632
Why are you blushing?

504
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:34,324
By the way,

505
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,725
I read in a storybook

506
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,084
that a pure individual means

507
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,364
someone who is not married.

508
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,844
Where do we find a pure individual?

509
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:45,884
How about

510
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:47,205
we catch a dark cultivator later?

511
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,084
What if the one we get

512
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,408
is not a pure individual?

513
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,604
Haven't we wasted our efforts then?

514
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:53,925
Then maybe let me try?

515
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,045
No, no!

516
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:57,005
That's unnecessary.

517
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:58,804
Why hesitate now?

518
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,324
We haven't got married so far.

519
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:02,285
Perhaps fate reserved us
for this moment.

520
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,765
Jiusu will return soon.

521
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:04,445
We must

522
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,644
remove the Gu parasite

523
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:07,084
before he comes back.

524
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,005
You're truly something.

525
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:19,445
Demanding food and drink all the way.

526
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,644
Let me make this clear.

527
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:21,685
We have no time

528
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:22,525
for your games.

529
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:23,872
We're on a tight schedule.

530
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,765
I ate three bowls
of beef noodles earlier.

531
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:27,725
Too salty.

532
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:28,685
I want tea.

533
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:30,364
You want tea?

534
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:33,844
Ling Bo! Ling Bo!

535
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:36,084
What now?

536
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:37,804
I apologize.

537
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,045
Don't be angry.

538
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:41,005
Forget it.

539
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:42,685
I won't stoop to your level.

540
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:45,005
You're so kind.

541
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:48,084
Lin Hu!

542
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:49,124
What?

543
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,324
What did you say you wanted to do

544
00:21:51,404 --> 00:21:52,965
once we took down dark cultivators?

545
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,925
Ling Bo,

546
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,485
I want to marry you immediately!

547
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:58,804
Raise children together!

548
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,084
Shameless!

549
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:01,725
Wait.

550
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,245
Who are you cursing?

551
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,525
Ling Bo. Ling Bo.

552
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:06,965
Ling Bo.

553
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,084
Ling Bo.

554
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:09,245
Ling Bo.

555
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,884
Ling Bo, wait for me!

556
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:12,704
You're done for. She's furious now.

557
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:17,485
Kong Hou,

558
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:19,328
is this truly necessary?

559
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,285
It's just a small cut

560
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,765
on my hand.

561
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:23,765
Besides,

562
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,364
this is all to save you.

563
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:26,485
Okay.

564
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:38,285
From wondrous unity springs life.

565
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,192
To wondrous unity all things return.

566
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:43,685
Divided into three origins,

567
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,725
and then from three origins.

568
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:05,324
Zhong Xi,

569
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:06,604
hold on.

570
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:07,404
The Gu parasite

571
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:08,725
seems to be moving out.

572
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:09,765
Don't worry about me.

573
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,005
I'm fine.

574
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,644
Put your hand in.

575
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:31,725
The Gu parasite was squirming earlier,

576
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:32,725
but now it seems

577
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:33,804
to be completely gone.

578
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,005
Zhong Xi,

579
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:37,164
we actually removed the Gu parasite.

580
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:38,240
It's great.

581
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,324
How do you feel now?

582
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,245
Let me try.

583
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:49,205
Great.

584
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:51,124
We finally succeeded.

585
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:53,564
Ling Bo.

586
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:54,965
Ling Bo.

587
00:23:55,324 --> 00:23:56,124
I understand now.

588
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:57,445
Let me explain.

589
00:23:57,445 --> 00:23:58,525
You're under Reverse Spell,

590
00:23:58,525 --> 00:23:59,045
you know?

591
00:23:59,045 --> 00:23:59,925
How dare you!

592
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:00,965
Spouting nonsense again!

593
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:01,604
I'm not.

594
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,124
I told you. It's the lamp!

595
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:03,965
Oh, no.

596
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:05,604
Everything I say sounds opposite to her.

597
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,164
Break the spell now.

598
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:07,844
Or I'll

599
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:08,804
seal you underground.

600
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:09,685
Still making excuses?

601
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,485
I'm not.

602
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:11,364
Ling Bo, I'm not.

603
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:20,285
Ling Bo.

604
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:22,285
What's happening now?

605
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:23,844
Why aren't you affected?

606
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:25,124
I see.

607
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,445
Because you're a fox.

608
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:27,005
Ling Bo.

609
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:28,245
Stop calling her.

610
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:29,124
She can't hear you.

611
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,080
I've sent her

612
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,296
into an illusion.

613
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:31,776
An illusion?

614
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:33,485
She's living an immortal life there.

615
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:34,485
An immortal life?

616
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:37,685
Ling Bo.

617
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,285
This is the Yunhua Sect?

618
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:04,925
Xiao Dong,

619
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,685
why are you here?

620
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:07,965
My love, you're awake.

621
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,285
What did you call me?

622
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:11,285
My love?'

623
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:14,560
You're still groggy?

624
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:17,604
What's going on here?

625
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:20,285
You're truly still groggy.

626
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:21,884
After years of marriage,

627
00:25:21,925 --> 00:25:23,045
you're still this cute.

628
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,005
This post-sleep daze

629
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,604
is just how you always are.

630
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:28,285
Marriage?

631
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:31,485
You and me?

632
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:34,005
Who else would it be?

633
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:37,364
Alright.

634
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:38,364
Get ready.

635
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:39,685
Later, we'll be attending

636
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:40,965
Tan Feng's succession ceremony.

637
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:41,965
Tan Feng?

638
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:44,644
Succession ceremony?

639
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:47,285
What kind of situation is this?

640
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,364
What's wrong? A headache?

641
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:51,324
I feel like I've forgotten something.

642
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,205
Did you forget to bring something?

643
00:25:54,324 --> 00:25:55,045
No.

644
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:58,912
I remember Kong Hou and Zhong Xi.

645
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:00,485
Oh, yes, and Jiusu too.

646
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,364
What about them?

647
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:02,604
Why would it be Tan Feng

648
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,776
succeeding as the Head?

649
00:26:05,404 --> 00:26:07,232
My love, you've truly
been confused by sleep.

650
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:09,445
These events happened centuries ago.

651
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,040
Centuries?

652
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:14,564
Back then,

653
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:15,884
you and I found

654
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,005
the Soul Anchoring Lamp,

655
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:17,965
suppress Kong Hou's

656
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:18,944
dark cultivator blood.

657
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,448
Master Zhong Xi and Kong Hou

658
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,925
eradicated the Dark Cultivator Hall

659
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,205
and defeated Jiusu.

660
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:24,445
And now,

661
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:25,124
the two of them

662
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,272
have ascended for years.

663
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,840
Is that truly how it was?

664
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,404
Why do I recall there being

665
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:33,564
another person

666
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,324
find the Soul Anchoring Lamp with me?

667
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:36,564
You're wrong.

668
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:37,884
There was no other person.

669
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,072
Only you and me.

670
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,564
Back then, we went

671
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,208
through so much to make it happen,

672
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:43,324
so don't wipe out

673
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:44,205
your husband's credit

674
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,245
just because

675
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,164
you took a nap.

676
00:26:46,844 --> 00:26:48,124
Husband?

677
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:54,925
It does feel hot.

678
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:56,324
No wonder you're so confused.

679
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:58,725
Master,

680
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,544
the young master sneaked away
for training.

681
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,712
Young master?

682
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:06,404
You may leave.

683
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:06,965
Yes.

684
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,245
Our son.

685
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,384
Son?

686
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,904
You and me?

687
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,584
He is too mischievous.

688
00:27:23,404 --> 00:27:23,925
Come on.

689
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:25,045
Thank you.

690
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:26,432
Why thank me?

691
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:28,564
Oh, right.

692
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:30,045
I have something for you.

693
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:31,245
What is it?

694
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:34,725
This is...

695
00:27:37,765 --> 00:27:38,485
This

696
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:40,445
is our love token jade pendant.

697
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,124
I once dreamed

698
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,304
of attaining such happiness.

699
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:52,644
Become the admired

700
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,045
Head of Zhaohan Sect

701
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:55,364
through my own efforts.

702
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,124
And then,

703
00:27:57,245 --> 00:27:59,005
find a harmonious cultivation partner

704
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:00,512
who shares my passions.

705
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,168
We'll raise children together

706
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:04,804
and keep a dog.

707
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:08,644
So do I.

708
00:28:10,324 --> 00:28:12,005
As long as we can stay together,

709
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,324
whether we ascend

710
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,525
or stay in the Lingyou Realm,

711
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:15,485
every day will be

712
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,768
a blissful immortal life.

713
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:32,884
Break the spell now.

714
00:28:32,884 --> 00:28:33,644
Stop this nonsense.

715
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:35,804
I can wake her up.

716
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:37,564
But I want to make a wager with you.

717
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,525
Name your terms.

718
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:41,324
Whether Ling Bo

719
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:43,084
has true affection for you.

720
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,205
Mortals never have true affection,

721
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:46,205
only using one another.

722
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,604
I once helped others sincerely,

723
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,496
yet got sealed in a flowerpot.

724
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,765
They're nothing
but treacherous schemers.

725
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,084
You deserved it.

726
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:56,285
You're incorrigible.

727
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:56,965
Listen well.

728
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:57,725
Right now, I want

729
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,725
to bury you underground.

730
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:00,164
You're scared to take the bet?

731
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,525
Shall I tell you

732
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:02,656
who played her husband

733
00:29:02,656 --> 00:29:03,925
in the illusion?

734
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:05,364
No.

735
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,324
I won't hear it.

736
00:29:06,564 --> 00:29:08,205
You don't dare to find out, do you?

737
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,164
It was Xiao Dong!

738
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:13,568
Stop spouting lies!

739
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,164
Ling Bo sweet-talks you,

740
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:18,464
but pines for another in her heart.

741
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:19,904
In that illusion,

742
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,408
she married him and bore his child.

743
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:22,205
She's overjoyed.

744
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:22,844
She forgot

745
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,844
about you stinky fox.

746
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:24,364
You...

747
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,445
(This stupid lamp)

748
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,144
(is plotting more tricks.)

749
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:35,364
(Stay calm.)

750
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:36,445
(I can't let it)

751
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,525
(control me anymore.)

752
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:41,084
(What's this thing's weakness?)

753
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,285
Bugs!

754
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,604
Help me catch it!

755
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:07,040
Just let it crawl away.

756
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,205
What's wrong with you?

757
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,005
Didn't you always

758
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:16,364
help me catch bugs before?

759
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:19,084
It'll leave on its own.

760
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:19,965
Calm down.

761
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:21,485
Before?

762
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:23,765
Before...

763
00:30:24,844 --> 00:30:26,765
It was Lin Hu catching bugs for me.

764
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,285
Who's Lin Hu?

765
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:32,205
Oh, right.

766
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:33,804
It was Lin Hu!

767
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:34,725
He came with me

768
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:35,525
to find the Lamp.

769
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,884
Lin Hu caught bugs for me.

770
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,485
You're delusional.

771
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:39,884
There's no such person.

772
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,525
What's happening here?

773
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,124
It turns out

774
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,324
you're afraid of bugs.

775
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,324
Listen up.

776
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,925
Release Ling Bo

777
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,205
this instant.

778
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:03,808
Or else,

779
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:04,525
I'll shove this

780
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:05,804
filthy worm

781
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:06,725
- in your mouth.
- Get it away.

782
00:31:06,844 --> 00:31:07,965
- Release her or not?
- Get it away now.

783
00:31:13,965 --> 00:31:15,104
You're not Xiao Dong.

784
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:17,084
Who are you?

785
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,205
Take a guess.

786
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:20,604
Guess correctly,

787
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,272
and I'll free you.

788
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,324
You're the Soul Anchoring Lamp.

789
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,285
Not entirely stupid.

790
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:29,765
Wait, no. You're still stupid.

791
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:30,725
You actually bought

792
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,844
Lin Hu's lies?

793
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:33,644
I'm telling you.

794
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:35,525
He was afraid he couldn't beat me,

795
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:36,445
so he left you alone

796
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,525
in the woods

797
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:38,404
and ran off himself.

798
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,164
Who would believe you?

799
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:40,925
Lin Hu would never

800
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:41,965
abandon me.

801
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:46,124
Have you forgotten

802
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:47,564
his grand plan

803
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:48,765
to marry eight vixens?

804
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,844
Men's hearts cast wide nets.

805
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:54,884
And he wants

806
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:56,804
to catch

807
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:58,525
fools like you.

808
00:31:58,604 --> 00:31:59,965
Enough nonsense!

809
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:00,485
Just tell me

810
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,472
where this place is.

811
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,404
This is an illusion.

812
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:11,525
Look.

813
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:14,624
How perfect this illusion is.

814
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:17,804
It has everything you desire.

815
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:19,685
You're the Head.

816
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,324
You also have

817
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,672
a handsome and devoted husband.

818
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,240
I've even prepared

819
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,445
a son for you.

820
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:29,205
What more could you want?

821
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:34,685
I want...

822
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:37,164
No!

823
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:38,205
No more tricks!

824
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:39,324
Release me now!

825
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:41,925
You foolish woman!

826
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,364
Why leave?

827
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,056
This illusion is wonderful.

828
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,164
Look, everything's here.

829
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,084
How often

830
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:47,925
do wishes come true?

831
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:48,804
You crave leadership

832
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:49,725
and also love.

833
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:51,045
Abandon this futile hope

834
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,164
and stay here.

835
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:54,528
Just stay here.

836
00:32:54,592 --> 00:32:55,164
Look!

837
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:56,544
I specially crafted

838
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,952
this illusion for you.

839
00:32:58,804 --> 00:32:59,884
Lin Hu doesn't truly

840
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:00,765
care about you.

841
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,965
He'll forget you eventually.

842
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:04,096
Lin Hu won't.

843
00:33:04,324 --> 00:33:05,445
He'd never abandon me.

844
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,884
Stop scheming.

845
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,485
He will! He will!

846
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:10,272
I...

847
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,644
Get it away!

848
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:14,164
Still not release her?

849
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:14,804
Back off!

850
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,344
I'll r-release her.

851
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:20,084
I'll release her!

852
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:21,364
Release or not?

853
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:26,245
Ling Bo.

854
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:28,768
Ling Bo, you're finally awake.

855
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:30,364
What happened to me?

856
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,005
You...

857
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:33,205
You were hit by the lamp's

858
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:33,765
Reverse Spell

859
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:34,925
and trapped in its illusion,

860
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:35,725
unable to escape.

861
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:38,005
So that's what happened.

862
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:39,725
Careful.

863
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:41,324
You foolish lamp!

864
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:43,804
You're finished!

865
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:44,844
You can't hit me.

866
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,765
I saved your life.

867
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:47,648
To wake you

868
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:49,024
from the illusion early,

869
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:50,016
I cracked myself.

870
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:54,564
It actually cracked.

871
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:56,005
You're just a fragile lamp.

872
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:56,804
Let me see.

873
00:33:57,324 --> 00:33:58,364
You deserve it.

874
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,604
Let me tell you.

875
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:01,564
You reap what you sow.

876
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:03,604
I'm cracked.

877
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,205
- I'm imperfect now.
- Wait.

878
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,404
I'm flawed.

879
00:34:07,404 --> 00:34:08,864
I-It's cracked.

880
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:10,925
Can it suppress Kong Hou's
dark cultivator blood?

881
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:12,000
We must find a way

882
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,885
to fix it.

883
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,284
But this is an ancient spiritual tool.

884
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,204
We can't fix this ourselves.

885
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,124
Someone can.

886
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:21,644
Who?

887
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:22,405
Xiao Dong.

888
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,968
His magic includes

889
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,376
methods for fixing spiritual tools.

890
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:26,764
How do you know?

891
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:28,005
You saw it earlier, right?

892
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,485
What nonsense!

893
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,525
Has this foolish lamp

894
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:31,485
corrupted you?

895
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:32,764
No.

896
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:34,485
Let's go.

897
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:35,564
Hurry and fix the lamp.

898
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:36,845
If we waste time,

899
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:37,885
Zhong Xi and Kong Hou

900
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:38,885
will be worried.

901
00:34:42,244 --> 00:34:43,124
Fix you?

902
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:44,684
You reap what you sow.

903
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,284
You contributed the most

904
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:50,724
on this visit to Liuguang Sect.

905
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,704
As expected, we made

906
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:54,752
those old fools obeyed obediently

907
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:56,485
without bloodshed.

908
00:34:57,885 --> 00:35:00,564
Your Eminence,
you were magnificent today.

909
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:03,204
I have a mere proposal.

910
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,485
Wu Bei, what are you up to now?

911
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,164
- Go!
- Go!

912
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:12,764
Let me go.

913
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:13,485
Kong Hou.

914
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,432
Kong Hou.

915
00:35:15,644 --> 00:35:16,525
Tan Feng!

916
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:18,485
Are you okay?

917
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:21,604
Tan Feng, how are you?

918
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,965
Your Eminence,
today is a joyous occasion.

919
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,464
I have a humble proposal.

920
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:28,256
Why not absorb spiritual energy

921
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:30,525
from two disciples to liven things up?

922
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:41,485
Wu Bei,

923
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:43,840
calling you a fool

924
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:46,496
would disgrace the term itself.

925
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:49,405
The Ascension Array is approaching.

926
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,040
We're in need of spiritual energy now.

927
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,045
Yet you

928
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,164
repeatedly waste it

929
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:56,480
on personal grudges.

930
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:58,688
Utter foolishness!

931
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,485
My lord,

932
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:04,204
I merely wanted to add some festivity.

933
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:06,485
The Sovereign speaks wisely.

934
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:08,124
Take them away.

935
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:08,965
Yes.

936
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:10,845
Kong Hou!

937
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:11,965
- Kong Hou!
- Kong Hou!

938
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:13,216
- Hurry! Move!
- Go!

939
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:18,005
Can he actually fix it for us?

940
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:19,365
Seriously.

941
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:21,525
Xiao Dong.

942
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:23,925
Ling Bo,

943
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,365
I got your messenger talisman.

944
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:26,045
I...

945
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:29,284
Wait.

946
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:30,445
Why that look?

947
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,365
Didn't she tell you

948
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,764
I'm accompanying her?

949
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:33,764
She mentioned it.

950
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:34,764
But...

951
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:35,525
But what?

952
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:37,485
He chose to ignore my presence, right?

953
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:38,365
Enough.

954
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,405
Is it the time

955
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,485
for these conversations?

956
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:41,084
No.

957
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:42,724
Oh, right, Ling Bo.

958
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:43,845
Your message mentioned

959
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,525
needing me to fix something?

960
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:47,005
Soul Anchoring Lamp.

961
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,816
Soul Anchoring Lamp is no ordinary.

962
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:52,525
Where did you acquire it?

963
00:36:52,764 --> 00:36:54,045
What's your purpose with it?

964
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:55,204
Why so many questions?

965
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:55,925
Fix it if you can.

966
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,365
If not, forget it.

967
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:58,445
Ling Bo,

968
00:36:58,644 --> 00:36:59,244
just tell me

969
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:00,124
what's going on here?

970
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:01,525
The messenger talisman was vague.

971
00:37:01,764 --> 00:37:02,445
And why would you

972
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:03,445
team up with this guy?

973
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,564
Team up with Lin Hu

974
00:37:05,604 --> 00:37:06,684
around?

975
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:07,764
I fear he might...

976
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:08,724
You fear what?

977
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:09,885
Wait. We're at least

978
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:10,764
fellow sect members.

979
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:12,045
Do you distrust me so much?

980
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:13,644
I'm worried you'll drag Ling Bo

981
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:14,684
into danger.

982
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:17,005
Soul Anchoring Lamp is
a spiritual tool to seal mountains,

983
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:18,284
specifically for sealing souls.

984
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:21,325
You...

985
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:22,164
Exactly.

986
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:23,445
We intend to use it

987
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:24,445
for Kong Hou.

988
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:25,764
Master Zhong Xi said

989
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:26,764
it can help suppress

990
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:28,005
her dark cultivator blood.

991
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,204
Kong Hou is beyond salvation.

992
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:34,805
She's a born dark cultivator.

993
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:36,445
Soul Anchoring Lamp

994
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:37,885
probably can't suppress

995
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,325
the evil energy within her.

996
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,284
Ling Bo,

997
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:43,845
don't follow Lin Hu

998
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,845
on this risky venture

999
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:46,124
and help someone

1000
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:47,885
who isn't worth saving.

1001
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,204
My actions

1002
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:51,724
are my own choice.

1003
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:52,564
Ling Bo, you must

1004
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:53,445
not be foolish.

1005
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,724
Wait, Xiao Dong, are you okay?

1006
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:55,244
I just...

1007
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:55,925
Alright.

1008
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,056
Stop talking about these.

1009
00:37:58,965 --> 00:37:59,644
Xiao Dong,

1010
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:00,684
take a look

1011
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,005
at how to fix the lamp first.

1012
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:07,244
Let me make this clear.

1013
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,005
I'm fixing this lamp not for Kong Hou,

1014
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:11,604
but for you.

1015
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:15,965
What?

1016
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:17,724
Am I invisible to you?

1017
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:18,764
You deliberately said

1018
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,204
- all those harsh words.
- Lin Hu,

1019
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:21,604
calm down.

1020
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:25,005
Xiao Dong,

1021
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,325
I know you resent Kong Hou,

1022
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:28,284
but you

1023
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,925
should trust Master Zhong Xi.

1024
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,204
This was his decision.

1025
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,445
Look, to be fair,

1026
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,965
Young Master is in her control now.

1027
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:39,325
If you fix Soul Anchoring Lamp

1028
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,204
and give it to her,

1029
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,845
it'll restore her rationality more.

1030
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,232
And Young Master will be safer.

1031
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:44,704
Then I'll give it a try.
