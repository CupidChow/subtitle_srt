Put in more effort.

Practice properly. No slacking off.

18
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,656
Is Senior Zhou Xiao venting on us

19
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:04,096
because Jin Ling got injured?

20
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,740
No way.

21
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,380
Mao Mao, no slacking off.

22
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:16,221
Got it.

23
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:17,341
We can't go on, Zhou Xiao.

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,912
Didn't we just

25
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,000
spar the other day?

26
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:21,344
It's hot today.

27
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:22,932
Let's call it quits for now.

28
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:24,372
You're the laziest one here.

29
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,893
Fu,

30
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:27,453
I told you to lose weight

31
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:28,492
and eat less.

32
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,573
Senior,

33
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,173
I-I do have muscles.

34
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,133
Look.

35
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,333
You have the best figure here.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,032
What's going on here?

37
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,536
Exactly. What should we do later?

38
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't know what to say.

39
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,252
Right, it's so sudden.

40
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:54,453
Out of nowhere,

41
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:55,328
why invite us

42
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:56,413
to bathe together?

43
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:57,733
Who knows?

44
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:58,932
Scrub time, scrub time.

45
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,293
I'll scrub everyone's backs.

46
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:01,573
Anyone wants a back scrub?

47
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,053
Scrub?

48
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,413
As a newcomer,

49
00:03:10,652 --> 00:03:12,413
I simply want to use scrubbing

50
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:14,372
to get closer to you all.

51
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:15,532
But you...

52
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,453
Do you all hate me?

53
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,053
No way.

54
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,133
You must hate me.

55
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,968
She's Senior Disciple's wife.

56
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,024
Master values her greatly.

57
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,212
We can't offend her.

58
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,853
Lady Kong Hou, I can.

59
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:32,453
You can?

60
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,812
Lady Kong Hou, I can too.

61
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:34,932
You too?

62
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:35,853
- Me too.
- Me too.

63
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:36,992
- Me too.
- Let's go, all together.

64
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:38,492
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

65
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:39,712
Hurry. Let's go.

66
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,453
Just as I thought.

67
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,613
What's happening?

68
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,733
That person

69
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:46,624
took heart's blood

70
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:49,092
to gather spiritual energy
to nourish the flower field.

71
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:50,592
What's their goal?

72
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,573
Come with me to the medicinal hall.

73
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:56,733
Medicinal hall?

74
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:57,853
(Consultation, Herbal Dispensary)
Why change

75
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:59,013
the dressing now?

76
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,320
(Acupuncture)
I'll help you dress.

77
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:28,372
There.

78
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,372
Hurry up.

79
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:36,096
Don't rush. Almost done.

80
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,213
Done.

81
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,132
I've never worn clothes
like this before.

82
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,812
It looks fine to me.

83
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,600
Why did you bring us here

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,572
exactly?

85
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,692
Anyone who easily

86
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:04,053
took heart's blood

87
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,413
can't be ordinary.

88
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:06,592
Acupuncture?

89
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:07,840
(Acupuncture)

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,904
(Acupuncture)

91
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:16,000
(Bai Zhu, Zhang Feng,
Tian Dong, Chai Hu)

92
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:18,853
Aside from
the four acupuncture disciples,

93
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:20,293
who's the most suspicious?

94
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:22,613
I don't know.

95
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,653
Everyone seems quite normal.

96
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:26,613
Nothing stands out.

97
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,572
They were all recruited
by Master externally.

98
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,132
Could it be...

99
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:34,812
Impossible.

100
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,053
I just checked.

101
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,012
Zhang Feng also has the mark.

102
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,093
Zhang Feng?

103
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,613
He has the mark too?

104
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:41,653
He knows acupuncture?

105
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:43,132
He's always been simple-minded.

106
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,572
No hope in cultivation.

107
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:45,413
So Master

108
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,653
had him study medicine instead.

109
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:49,093
I'll report this to Master.

110
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,853
This matter
isn't fully investigated yet.

111
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,653
Beyond us three who are here,

112
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,592
anyone could be a suspect.

113
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:01,853
Who is the one

114
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:03,293
that dared commit such atrocities

115
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:05,372
within our sect?

116
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:10,692
Tomorrow,

117
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,128
bring those acupuncturists

118
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:13,024
- to me.
- Okay.

119
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,332
I'll interrogate them myself.

120
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:16,293
What about Zhang Feng?

121
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,332
I'll handle this impartially.

122
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,413
Yes.

123
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,856
(Yuanji Sect)

124
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:23,372
The investigation is concluded.

125
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,932
The culprit

126
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,272
is one of our sect's

127
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,413
acupuncturists.

128
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:29,533
Someone.

129
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,853
Bring him forth.

130
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:38,093
That day,

131
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,132
I saw him being bullied

132
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,692
by a wealthy man in Sanshu City.

133
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:42,413
Upon inquiry,

134
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,973
I learned that the wealthy man

135
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,413
wanted him to perform acupuncture,

136
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,452
but withheld payment after that

137
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,413
and had him beaten and expelled.

138
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,692
Out of sympathy,

139
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,093
I pitied his plight

140
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:53,492
and brought him

141
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,572
to our sect's medicinal hall.

142
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:59,932
Never did I imagine
he was a dark cultivator.

143
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,932
I failed to vet him properly.

144
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:07,213
Esteemed guests,

145
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:08,613
today before your presence,

146
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:09,733
I shall personally purge

147
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,533
this sect's disgrace.

148
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,053
For our sect,

149
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,892
harboring such a scandal

150
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:34,533
is utterly...

151
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:36,572
We'll handle this now.

152
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,053
You've already helped us greatly.

153
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,384
The flower field...

154
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,973
Since it happened within my sect,

155
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:44,892
I will thoroughly
investigate and handle it

156
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,093
without leniency.

157
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,533
Lady Kong Hou,

158
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,533
do you distrust me?

159
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,568
But...

160
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,332
Master Shuang Qing

161
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,452
is definitely suspicious.

162
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,128
Since he said

163
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,252
they don't need our help,

164
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,692
let's do nothing for now.

165
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,293
How can we do nothing?

166
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,492
We need evidence to act.

167
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,053
Let's wait for Lin Hu.

168
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,173
I keep feeling the Yuanji Sect

169
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,972
harbors even more horrifying secrets.

170
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,692
Lady Kong Hou.

171
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:51,732
Lady Kong Hou.

172
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:52,704
Jin Ling is awake.

173
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:53,812
She requests your presence.

174
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:55,373
Really? Let's go immediately.

175
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:55,972
Hurry.

176
00:08:58,013 --> 00:08:59,452
Jin Ling. Jin Ling.

177
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:18,972
Young Master.

178
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,773
Young Master, I've confirmed.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,293
Master Huang Qi revealed

180
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:30,533
that certain powerful

181
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:31,612
dark cultivators do exist.

182
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,320
They've mastered

183
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,013
a forbidden art

184
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:34,212
to cultivate a plant called

185
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,092
Roumanluo.

186
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,413
When their bodies are damaged,

187
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:38,432
they bury their bodies

188
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:39,932
in spiritually abundant locations

189
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:40,512
to hide them

190
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,692
and plant Roumanluo there,

191
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:42,452
which then absorbs

192
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,773
spiritual energy

193
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:44,384
to nourish

194
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,408
their damaged bodies

195
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:46,080
until the bodies

196
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,572
fully regenerate.

197
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:50,533
And what about

198
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:51,773
those flowers?

199
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,024
The flowers are Roumanluo's

200
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:53,773
blooms produced

201
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:55,173
during spiritual energy absorption.

202
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,413
Let's go.

203
00:09:59,092 --> 00:09:59,732
Now?

204
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,732
Wait. I just returned.

205
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:01,572
Where are we going?

206
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:02,773
To destroy it.

207
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:04,612
Destroy it?

208
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,212
Let me go.

209
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:07,493
Let me go.

210
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,852
I've brought her here.

211
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:11,452
Now return my son.

212
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:30,173
Father.

213
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,053
Have some tea.

214
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,092
Good boy.

215
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,373
Father, let me rub your shoulders.

216
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:38,212
Okay.

217
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,533
You... Feng?

218
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,452
What are you doing?

219
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:51,173
If you ever want to see your son again,

220
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:52,972
you'll follow my orders.

221
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:54,493
Who are you?

222
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:57,452
That's irrelevant.

223
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:19,092
Give my son back.

224
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,773
Isn't your son right here?

225
00:11:31,972 --> 00:11:33,053
Go ahead, strike.

226
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,013
Let's see if your son's body

227
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,612
can withstand it.

228
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:48,253
Cooperate with me obediently,

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,304
and let me properly cultivate

230
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,452
my own body.

231
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,773
Then I'll return your son

232
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:55,008
to you intact.

233
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:59,572
Master, I have urgent news.

234
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:02,293
You know what to do.

235
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,053
Let me go.

236
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,493
Kong Hou.

237
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,408
Kong Hou. Kong Hou.

238
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,784
Huan Zong. Huan Zong.

239
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:21,852
You didn't expect this, did you?

240
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,293
We meet again so soon.

241
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,893
It's you.

242
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:39,852
The frog.

243
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,013
Where's the frog?

244
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,452
It's her.

245
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:03,692
That wretched girl from Yunhua Sect.

246
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:05,332
If not for her,

247
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,932
my body wouldn't have been destroyed.

248
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,013
She's brought herself to me.

249
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,893
Why is he here?

250
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:12,452
Let him come.

251
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,493
I'm Zhang Feng now.

252
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,133
Look at your weak physique.

253
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,053
You don't have many days left.

254
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,024
Yet you keep chasing me.

255
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:22,332
Put her down.

256
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:24,413
Huan Zong,

257
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,732
all these events

258
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,133
were done by Zhang Feng.

259
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,572
Kong Hou.

260
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:09,293
Huan Zong.

261
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,293
My body.

262
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:43,653
Feng!

263
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:47,872
- Kong Hou!
- Feng!

264
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:48,992
- Young Master.
- Feng?

265
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,253
The fire is too intense.

266
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:51,932
Let go. Let go.

267
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:52,896
- It's dangerous.
- Feng.

268
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:53,533
Kong Hou!

269
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:54,493
Young Master.

270
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:56,852
Huan Zong.

271
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,533
It's too dangerous.

272
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,533
Don't go.

273
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:01,452
Feng?

274
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:04,320
Wake up, Feng.

275
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,472
Wake up, Feng.

276
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:07,776
Feng!

277
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,013
Don't go.

278
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:36,173
Huan Zong.

279
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,224
Thankfully, Elder Qiu Shuang

280
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,253
gave me a fireproof robe.

281
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,013
Otherwise I'd be done for.

282
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:08,512
If that happened,

283
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,372
I wouldn't see Senior Ling Hui,

284
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,612
my master,

285
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:16,693
or you ever again.

286
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:27,092
Huan Zong.

287
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,372
Young Master, are you okay?

288
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:47,693
Huan Zong?

289
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,253
(This is)

290
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:12,652
(the dark poison I've accumulated.)

291
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,493
(It clashes with your)

292
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,572
(spiritual energy.)

293
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,132
(If you activate spiritual energy,)

294
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,773
(it'll destroy your spiritual core.)

295
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:20,453
(The faster you circulate your energy,)

296
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,132
(the sooner you die.)

297
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,293
Huan Zong?

298
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,493
Huan Zong?

299
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,892
Huan Zong, don't push yourself.

300
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,053
Let me in to help you,

301
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:40,973
please?

302
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,132
Huan Zong?

303
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,213
Huan Zong?

304
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:56,453
Huan Zong, are you feeling better?

305
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:57,973
I'm fine.

306
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:01,332
Where are you going?

307
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,576
(Hong Yan, Yuexing Sect)

308
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,048
(Heng Yan, Yunhua Sect)

309
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:40,768
What did

310
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:41,824
Master Heng Yan do?

311
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,172
Why would Master Shuang Qing
do this to him?

312
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:51,933
This abode

313
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:52,533
is the place

314
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,733
where Master cultivates.

315
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:55,372
Master has always regarded

316
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:56,372
other sect leaders

317
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:57,453
as imaginary adversaries

318
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,013
and aimed to defeat them one day

319
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:01,773
and elevate Yuanji Sect
into the Ten Great Sects.

320
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:03,332
But please believe

321
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,213
he has no connection
with dark cultivators.

322
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,332
He was threatened by one

323
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,453
with his son's life.

324
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:09,652
Feng!

325
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:13,652
Feng!

326
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:14,773
Wait here.

327
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:21,332
Feng!

328
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,184
What are you doing?

329
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,264
That person has already left.

330
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:40,672
This is my son.

331
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:43,648
You brought Kong Hou
to the flower field.

332
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:48,032
I had no choice.

333
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:49,920
He said

334
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,712
if I obeyed him obediently,

335
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:53,728
he would return my son

336
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,008
to me.

337
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,104
You should be grateful

338
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,088
Kong Hou remained unharmed.

339
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:03,296
My son

340
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:05,984
has never done anything wrong.

341
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:10,432
How could such tragedy befall him?

342
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,533
Feng.

343
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:16,704
Feng.

344
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:19,168
Feng.

345
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:19,936
My condolences.

346
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
Feng.

347
00:21:28,693 --> 00:21:29,372
Huan Zong.

348
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,013
Young Master.

349
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:32,412
Let's go too.

350
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:35,712
Huan Zong?

351
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,608
What's wrong?

352
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:37,973
Huan Zong, are you alright?

353
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:38,733
Young Master?

354
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:41,652
Huan Zong?

355
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:42,208
Young Master?

356
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:43,296
Young Master?

357
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,160
What's wrong?

358
00:21:56,852 --> 00:21:57,572
(Huan Zong,)

359
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,424
(hang in there.)

360
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:01,773
(I'll start regulating your energy now.)

361
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:03,332
(I can do this.)

362
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:04,693
(Trust me.)

363
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,493
It actually manifested.

364
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,092
With it,

365
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:34,533
my lord's grand plan
will surely succeed.

366
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,453
(Yunhua Sect)

367
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:37,216
No.

368
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:38,848
No. Absolutely not.

369
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,332
Kong Hou must return immediately.

370
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:43,092
She just descended the mountain.

371
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,693
Haven't you seen

372
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:46,453
the messenger talisman she sent?

373
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:47,520
How dangerous it was!

374
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,733
You were the ones who let her go.

375
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,232
Among all the dark cultivators,

376
00:22:51,232 --> 00:22:53,248
how many can restore their bodies?

377
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,253
Enough.

378
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:55,973
Kong Hou's current journey

379
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,612
is meant for cultivation.

380
00:22:57,612 --> 00:22:58,784
How can we let her come back

381
00:22:58,784 --> 00:22:59,693
when there's trouble?

382
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:01,253
She needs to learn

383
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:02,432
to resolve problems herself.

384
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:03,936
You stubborn old man.

385
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:05,760
I wanted her to descend the mountain

386
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,013
for some leisure.

387
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,440
Not to risk her life.

388
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:11,392
Senior,

389
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:12,812
calm down.

390
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:14,213
It's not that serious.

391
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:18,496
Because she's not your direct disciple,

392
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,092
right?

393
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:20,973
Easy for you to say.

394
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,213
Senior, calm down.

395
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,332
At worst

396
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:26,464
I'll lend you my cat.

397
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,584
(Cosmic Resonance)
Though Zhong Xi

398
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,852
didn't explain everything,

399
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:34,016
from Lin Hu's

400
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,372
message description,

401
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,652
I'm almost certain

402
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:38,172
it's Jiusu.

403
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,400
I've already

404
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,533
consulted with leaders

405
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,572
of major sects.

406
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:46,372
We all agree

407
00:23:46,572 --> 00:23:48,612
we must avoid widespread announcements

408
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:51,453
to prevent panic in Lingyou Realm.

409
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:53,092
For now, all sects

410
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:54,973
should fortify defenses.

411
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,332
What about Zhong Xi?

412
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,092
Let's recall him immediately.

413
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:03,328
He won't come back.

414
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:04,480
But his health

415
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,973
can't handle this much.

416
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,892
If he faces Jiusu again in battle,

417
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:09,092
I'm afraid...

418
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,852
Zhong Xi

419
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:13,253
has always made demon-slaying his duty

420
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,132
and will never back down easily.

421
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,092
Moreover,

422
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:20,332
Jiusu has only recently
regained his body.

423
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:21,172
His power

424
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:23,172
hasn't yet spiraled beyond control.

425
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:26,092
Zhong Xi still has time.

426
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,293
If we stop him from seeking medicine

427
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,812
under the guise of protection,

428
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,172
that would truly crush him

429
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:33,773
more than anything else.

430
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:37,973
When you sent words earlier

431
00:24:38,132 --> 00:24:39,733
about the puppet incident,

432
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:41,213
you couldn't imagine

433
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,693
how worried I became.

434
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:43,773
Master,

435
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:46,332
do you think the puppet
stole our phoenix

436
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,213
to help Jiusu

437
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:49,172
forge his new body?

438
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:52,693
You know

439
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,933
about Jiusu?

440
00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:57,372
Earlier, I noticed
the heavy guard presence

441
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,533
and found it strange.

442
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,973
So I asked a few questions.

443
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,293
So, Master,

444
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,892
what's exactly going on

445
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:05,132
with Jiusu's new body?

446
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:07,392
And the Azure Phoenix.

447
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:08,533
What role does it play?

448
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:10,172
It's merely

449
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,412
a forbidden dark art.

450
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:13,733
Legends say

451
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,213
the vines of Roumanluo

452
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,933
mimic human flesh perfectly.

453
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,144
Millennia ago,

454
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:20,064
those with twisted ambitions

455
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:21,533
deemed cultivation

456
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:23,973
for longevity insufficient.

457
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:26,240
They sought to use those vines

458
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,773
as replacement bodies,

459
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:29,773
infusing them with souls

460
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:32,172
to achieve immortality.

461
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,652
Thus this dark art was born.

462
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:38,612
Not just the feathers
of the Azure Phoenix.

463
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:41,572
The fur and feathers
of all divine beasts

464
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,008
aid in

465
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,412
accelerating the fusion

466
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,733
between soul and body.

467
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,533
So this means,

468
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,132
without these materials

469
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,453
from divine beasts...

470
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,973
Many cultivators would fall victim

471
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:55,533
to foul schemes.

472
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:58,816
They'll drain cultivators'
spiritual energy again?

473
00:25:59,328 --> 00:26:00,896
Set your mind at ease.

474
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:03,773
The major sects have coordinated.

475
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:05,293
The Ten Great Sects

476
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,132
will reinforce their defenses.

477
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:09,733
What about the puppet?

478
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:10,812
Any leads on it?

479
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,412
We've made progress.

480
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:14,493
Your senior just led a team out.

481
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:15,773
My senior?

482
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:17,652
Halt.

483
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:18,973
Where are you going?

484
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:20,493
To investigate the puppet.

485
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,080
It's dangerous outside.

486
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,032
Stay within the sect.

487
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:25,600
Not this again.

488
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
Why does he get all the missions?

489
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,576
Why can't I go?

490
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,040
This is for your protection.

491
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:32,412
I've declared

492
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,784
you'll inherit the sect leadership.

493
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:36,572
No one will take it from you.

494
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,720
Senior Chang De

495
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,812
will support you fully.

496
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:41,533
Rest assured of this.

497
00:26:41,693 --> 00:26:44,092
You misunderstand, Master.

498
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:45,533
Your favor protects me,

499
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,533
but I know the truth.

500
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,013
Though others flatter me

501
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:51,232
as the revered

502
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:52,572
Lady Ling Bo,

503
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,973
my cultivation and virtue

504
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,933
pale next to Senior Chang De's.

505
00:26:58,013 --> 00:26:59,612
You're my daughter.

506
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,453
Who dares claim otherwise?

507
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:04,128
Yet you make me call you Master

508
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,092
to avoid gossip,

509
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:05,852
isn't that so?

510
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:06,533
You...

511
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:07,372
Moreover,

512
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,248
I've contributed nothing meaningful

513
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,733
to our sect.

514
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:12,172
If it's a worthy cause,

515
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:13,312
no matter how hard,

516
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:14,453
I will do it.

517
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,612
Master, please let me go.

518
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:19,092
I truly want to prove

519
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,544
I'm more than the ethereal

520
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:21,412
Lady Ling Bo,

521
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:23,172
but a truly capable cultivator.

522
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:25,493
Alright.

523
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:27,412
I understand.

524
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:30,293
You've had a tough journey.

525
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:31,552
Go rest now.

526
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:34,493
We'll discuss other matters later.

527
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,352
(The Complete Works of Master Writer)

528
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,112
Kong Hou,
the Yuanji Sect is too dangerous.

529
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:55,773
The Lingyou Realm is perilous too.

530
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:56,812
You should return now.

531
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:58,372
We have everything there.

532
00:27:58,372 --> 00:27:59,936
- Good girl.
- Yes.

533
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,453
There will be time for trials

534
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:03,072
when I've cultivated another century,

535
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,640
and dark cultivators are gone. Right?

536
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,664
Lin Hu said you went for a walk.

537
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:22,624
Quite a chase for you.

538
00:28:23,773 --> 00:28:24,852
What did your master say?

539
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,453
Is he making you return?

540
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,213
If he worries for you so much,

541
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:32,092
you should leave.

542
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,253
Are you sending me away?

543
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,453
Right after I just finished

544
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,812
regulating your energy?

545
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,412
Well,

546
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:41,453
are you silly?

547
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:42,612
I won't get struck

548
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:43,773
by thunder for helping you.

549
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,120
Will you still send me away?

550
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,172
But you said you needed me

551
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:53,293
to help find your medicine

552
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,533
and protect you.

553
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,693
Do those words

554
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,892
mean nothing now?

555
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:20,652
- Welcome back, my lord.
- Welcome back, my lord.

556
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,053
- Welcome back, my lord.
- Welcome back, my lord.

557
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,453
- Welcome back, my lord.
- Welcome back, my lord.

558
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:28,453
It's all that wretched girl's fault.

559
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:30,332
She destroyed my body again.

560
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,253
And you lot.

561
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,092
Had you been more competent

562
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,892
and captured the Azure Phoenix earlier,

563
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:39,776
would I be stuck

564
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:41,092
in this wretched state?

565
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:42,453
You worthless ones!

566
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:44,493
- We have failed you.
- We have failed you.

567
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:46,493
Enough.

568
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:47,572
I shall now

569
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:48,852
enter seclusion for a period.

570
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:50,493
As for your tasks,

571
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:52,013
I needn't instruct you further.

572
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:54,372
Do not disappoint me again.

573
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,612
- Yes.
- Yes.

574
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:00,032
I'm not boasting.

575
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:00,812
Though I used to be

576
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:01,612
a mere potter,

577
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:03,013
now my puppet creations

578
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,092
are second to none.

579
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:05,253
My current skills

580
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:06,773
have reached perfection.

581
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:09,973
Look at you.

582
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:12,013
Always so reckless.

583
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:12,733
Well, Big Brother,

584
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,892
I need to get to Fengyi soon

585
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:14,973
to craft that puppet.

586
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:16,933
Big Brother, let Third Brother go.

587
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,213
Third Brother, be careful on the way.

588
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,892
It's Big Brother's way of guiding you

589
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,132
to teach you composure.

590
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:23,973
He said your last puppet

591
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,172
remarkably preserved

592
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:26,572
the original cultivation intact.

593
00:30:26,773 --> 00:30:28,053
Truly exceptional quality.

594
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:29,773
Keep working hard.

595
00:30:29,773 --> 00:30:30,496
Of course.

596
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,852
Big Brother, I'm not boasting.

597
00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:33,120
- In puppetry...
- Alright, enough.

598
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,013
Go now.

599
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,680
Then I'm off.

600
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,736
Go ahead.

601
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,213
Big Brother, earlier in the hall,

602
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:46,973
why didn't you inform Lord
about that matter

603
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:48,172
to give him some good news?

604
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:48,736
Didn't you see

605
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:50,013
how furious Lord was

606
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,332
about the phoenix matter?

607
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,132
What if we mention it prematurely

608
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:55,013
and fail to find the person later?

609
00:30:55,213 --> 00:30:56,773
We must locate the person first.

610
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:58,092
Fair point.

611
00:30:58,332 --> 00:30:59,773
But it's strange.

612
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:02,560
According to the birth chart,
that person is almost 18.

613
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,213
After your years of calculations,

614
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,533
why have you

615
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,933
never deduced before

616
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,480
that Lingyou Realm holds

617
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,696
such a talented one?

618
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:11,852
It's indeed strange.

619
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:13,412
Why does

620
00:31:13,412 --> 00:31:15,172
the spiritual root only manifest now?

621
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:17,372
We

622
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,332
need to find that person

623
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,172
to uncover the truth.

624
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,652
Yes.

625
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:41,572
Look at you.

626
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:43,493
Even injured, you remain radiant.

627
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,493
In the past,

628
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,092
you always took care of me.

629
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:52,852
Now that you're injured,

630
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:54,572
it gives me a chance

631
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:55,693
to take care of you.

632
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:05,933
Jin Ling,

633
00:32:06,612 --> 00:32:08,013
I beg of you.

634
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,652
Please wake up soon.

635
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,332
Master is gone.

636
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:17,493
Zhang Feng is gone too.

637
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:19,808
Now in the entire sect,

638
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:20,933
only I remain.

639
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:23,892
I promise you

640
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,013
when you awaken,

641
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,253
I'll grant your every wish.

642
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,812
I'll obey you completely.

643
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:37,693
(Yuanji Sect)

644
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,372
Lady Kong Hou, Huan Zong,

645
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:40,172
please wait.

646
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:42,652
Senior Zhou Xiao,

647
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:43,652
is there something else?

648
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:44,640
Earlier,

649
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,412
without discussion,

650
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:46,453
I informed Master about

651
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:47,332
the heart's blood.

652
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,824
I must apologize to all of you.

653
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,352
You do owe us this apology.

654
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:58,652
My actions stemmed

655
00:32:58,652 --> 00:32:59,652
from certainty

656
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:00,933
that Master wouldn't harm us.

657
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,812
Yet unexpectedly...

658
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,652
But I vow to you all

659
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,572
that Master has no ties
to dark cultivators.

660
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,572
He acted under coercion.

661
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:11,200
I wish no relations to sour

662
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,736
between your sects

663
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:13,696
and our sect.

664
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,092
How shameless you are!

665
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:17,760
A mere claim of coercion

666
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,812
doesn't absolve guilt.

667
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:19,973
Mark my words.

668
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,172
My young master's injuries

669
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:22,572
remain unaccounted for.

670
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:24,453
Whether relations sour

671
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:25,892
isn't ours to determine.

672
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:27,040
We've reported this

673
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,132
to our sects.

674
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:29,472
The elders and sect leaders

675
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:30,624
will deliberate

676
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,132
and decide accordingly.

677
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:35,412
(Visiting card)
By the way, it is a visiting card.

678
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:37,013
Take Jin Ling

679
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:38,493
to Huang Qi Residence

680
00:33:38,493 --> 00:33:39,572
outside Yuan City.

681
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:41,652
Master Huang Qi roams frequently.

682
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,933
You'd better go quickly.

683
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:44,933
Thank you, Lady Kong Hou.

684
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:46,848
I know

685
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:48,493
you wished to consult Jin Ling

686
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,368
about resonating
your natal spiritual tool.

687
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:51,453
But in her current state,

688
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:52,933
she cannot assist you.

689
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,053
However, you can visit Yi City.

690
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:57,572
Jin Ling once studied music

691
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,132
with Lingyou Realm's

692
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:00,892
top music cultivator, Jiao Tong.

693
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:11,200
(Yi City)

694
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:17,933
Hurry and leave.

695
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:18,933
I've told you.

696
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:19,712
Master Jiao Tong

697
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,612
sees no guests today.

698
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:21,333
Leave at once.

699
00:34:22,132 --> 00:34:23,013
Jiao Tong,

700
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:24,453
today I come

701
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,212
to settle our rivalry.

702
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:27,973
- He...
- How insolent!

703
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:43,092
You asked for this.

704
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:54,813
Arrogant fool.

705
00:35:58,772 --> 00:35:59,712
Fengyi

706
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:00,893
lies north of Yi City.

707
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:02,212
(Yi City, Fengyi City)
As we travel north,

708
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:03,493
we'll pass by.

709
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:05,184
Your medicine search can continue

710
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,533
while resolving my issue.

711
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,692
A twofold benefit.

712
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,212
Lin Hu, are you happy

713
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,172
traveling with me?

714
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:13,132
Got it.

715
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,413
Sit properly.

716
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,772
Don't fall like last time.

717
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:17,772
Last time?

718
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,053
W-Which time?

719
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,632
Just sit properly when told.

720
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:23,872
By the way, Huan Zong,

721
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:24,853
I heard

722
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:26,333
there's a tree in Yi City

723
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:27,853
growing on a bridge.

724
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,493
Legend says

725
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:29,984
if lovers walk across it together,

726
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:31,232
they'll never part.

727
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,416
Also,

728
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:33,292
Yi City people

729
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,493
are exceptionally handsome.

730
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:35,333
And

731
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,333
there are many

732
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,088
local delicacies,

733
00:36:37,088 --> 00:36:38,853
such as Donkey-Ignoring Buns.

734
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:39,936
I'm going to try them all.

735
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:41,920
How do you know?

736
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:43,893
I read it in a storybook.

737
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,280
Master Writer wrote this one

738
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,168
called Ten Thousand Perfect Places.

739
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:47,904
It's amazing.

740
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,408
Master Writer?

741
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:51,493
Impossible.

742
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:52,672
Master Writer never

743
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:53,572
wrote such a book.

744
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:54,528
I know Master Writer

745
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:55,772
better than you do, alright?

746
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:59,252
I am Master Writer myself.

747
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,292
If you were Master Writer,

748
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:06,292
then I would be the rightful sect leader

749
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,813
of Yunhua Sect.

750
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,692
I'd be Yuanji Sect's leader too.

751
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:12,373
Whatever.

752
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:20,692
Young Master,

753
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,612
you're so handsome.

754
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:23,853
(Pingyue House)
Please come

755
00:37:23,853 --> 00:37:25,132
to Pingyue House.

756
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,973
Please come

757
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:28,252
- to Zhaohua House.
- Young Master.

758
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:29,453
Free instruments for guests.

759
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,296
- Stop crowding us.
- We offer great benefits.

760
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:32,813
- Young Master.
- Choose Zhaohua House.

761
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,053
Come on.

762
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:35,212
No. We're not going.

763
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,352
We're not going anywhere.

764
00:37:36,352 --> 00:37:37,216
Huan Zong, let's go.

765
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:38,212
Let's go.

766
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:39,612
Young Master.

767
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,893
What madness is this?

768
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,112
Come to ours.

769
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:42,976
Excellent place.

770
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:44,352
Only the finest here.

771
00:37:44,704 --> 00:37:45,632
This way, please.

772
00:37:47,092 --> 00:37:48,092
Young Miss,

773
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:49,132
this way, please.

774
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:49,973
A private room.

775
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,373
What's going on here?

776
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:52,813
Why do all the women here

777
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,252
have handsome men with them?

778
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:55,813
You aren't locals, are you?

779
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:56,893
First time in Yi City?

780
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:57,533
Yes.

781
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,720
Have you heard of

782
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,572
the Hehuan Sect?

783
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:00,692
Hehuan Sect?

784
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:01,692
We know of it,

785
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:02,652
but not details.

786
00:38:02,853 --> 00:38:03,692
Here's the thing.

787
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:07,053
Yi City belongs to the Hehuan Sect,

788
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:08,256
which is ruled

789
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:09,652
by women mostly.

790
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:10,973
Hence the local custom

791
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:12,572
of women keeping male companions.

792
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:14,453
This gentleman is perceptive.

793
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:15,692
Aren't you also

794
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:17,453
with two pretty boys?

795
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:19,328
Nonsense.

796
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:22,752
Pretty boy.

797
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,864
Not in public.

798
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,132
Well,

799
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,053
(Yi City Inn)
Yi City has two wonders.

800
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:28,813
First,

801
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:30,053
Hehuan Sect's Blissful Isle.

802
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:30,772
Second,

803
00:38:30,772 --> 00:38:32,373
the world's best qin master,

804
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:33,333
Master Jiao Tong.

805
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,092
You came to visit

806
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:36,572
Blissful Isle, right?

807
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:38,432
(Yi City Inn)
We want to meet Jiao Tong.

808
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,732
Young Master,

809
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:41,184
that's not how it works.

810
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:42,933
Blissful Isle

811
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:43,933
is doable,

812
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,984
but Master Jiao Tong is always elusive.

813
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:46,692
Why?

814
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:48,373
Is it due to his odd personality?

815
00:38:48,512 --> 00:38:49,312
No.

816
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:50,572
You may not know.

817
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,096
Jiao Tong Pavilion is Yi City's

818
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,952
most luxurious
and impressive establishment.

819
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,424
It only operates at night.

820
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:57,612
Welcome.

821
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:58,453
Please come in.

822
00:38:58,652 --> 00:38:59,493
Where's Lin Hu?

823
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,252
He said he went

824
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:01,453
to buy some spiritual fruits.

825
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:05,053
Here's your tea.

826
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:06,453
Attendant,

827
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:07,872
earlier you mentioned

828
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:09,973
that entering Jiao Tong Pavilion
requires tickets.

829
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:10,533
That's right.

830
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:11,264
Moreover,

831
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:12,813
whether you meet Master Jiao Tong

832
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:14,292
depends entirely on your own fortune.

833
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,000
If fate hasn't aligned...

834
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:19,132
Fate?

835
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,092
Huan Zong,

836
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,732
he's trying to make us spend money.

837
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,092
If you want to meet him,

838
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:25,292
spending some is necessary.

839
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:26,652
When the time comes,

840
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:28,092
please guide us there.

841
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:28,973
Sir,

842
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:31,612
Jiao Tong Pavilion
only admits female guests.

843
00:39:31,813 --> 00:39:33,373
Only female guests?

844
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:34,373
That's a rule too?

845
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:35,413
No problem.

846
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:36,813
Then I'll go alone.

847
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:38,732
Jiao Tong Pavilion's
business is booming.

848
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:39,692
Tickets are hard to get.

849
00:39:39,893 --> 00:39:41,973
Our inn has special connections

850
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:42,853
to acquire tickets.

851
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,612
But the price...

852
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:45,772
Go ahead.

853
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:51,168
Twenty?

854
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,333
No.

855
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:55,413
Two hundred?

856
00:39:57,172 --> 00:39:58,172
Two thousand?

857
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:58,772
Correct.

858
00:39:58,772 --> 00:39:59,936
I won't learn from him.

859
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:01,132
I'll figure it out myself.

860
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:01,853
Just leave.

861
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:02,493
Take this.

862
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:04,252
Is it enough?

863
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,120
More than enough.

864
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,533
Not just tickets.

865
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:07,772
If you take out more,

866
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:08,973
you could even buy

867
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,212
our entire inn.

868
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:11,584
Good that it's enough.

869
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,333
You may leave.

870
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,172
Yes.

871
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:15,840
Huan Zong, that's a huge amount.

872
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:17,172
It's fine.

873
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,172
As for you,

874
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,053
focus on meeting Jiao Tong.

875
00:40:20,053 --> 00:40:21,536
Don't worry about anything else.

876
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,305
(Jade Immortal Bond)

877
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,413
I never imagined

878
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,212
after meeting you,

879
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:45,248
I'd start reading

880
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:46,336
such a romance storybook.

881
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,920
Is it true that I have feelings for you

882
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:52,512
just like the book says?

883
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:02,013
(Whom does he have feelings for?)

884
00:41:03,572 --> 00:41:05,013
Jade Immortal Bond?

885
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,533
I've read this one too.

886
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:07,264
Who'd have thought

887
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,064
you enjoy reading

888
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:09,333
romantic storybooks?

889
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:11,936
(Hairpin Tale, Jest of Fate,
Floral Anthology)

890
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,572
So many romantic storybooks?

891
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:15,333
Where did you come from?

892
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,212
Give them to me.

893
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:16,853
No.

894
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:18,612
