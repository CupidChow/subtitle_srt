15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,003
=Episode 1=

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,839
(This is Lingyou Realm,)

17
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,040
(Lingyou Realm)
(where cultivators reside.)

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,999
(All cultivators)

19
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,520
(dream of)

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,080
(ascension.)

21
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,919
(But as for me,)

22
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,680
(I don't even have a spiritual root,)

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,199
(let alone ascending.)

24
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:54,800
(My name is Kong Hou.)

25
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,320
(I believe that once I earn)

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
(enough spirit stones
for a spiritual tool,)

27
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,639
(I'll surely become)

28
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,479
(a true cultivator, too.)

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
(Don't you think)

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
(this dress)

31
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,759
(looks nice?)

32
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,799
Come on.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,560
This dress

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,199
costs only 19 spirit stones now.

35
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,320
That's right.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
Just 19 spirit stones

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,160
and this beautiful Fairy Dress

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,799
can be yours to take home.

39
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,120
Who wants one?

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,479
Raise your hands.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
We barely made

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,000
any money.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
(Ling Hui, Yunhua Sect)
You still can't

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,199
afford a spiritual tool.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,079
I came prepared.

46
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:33,984
(Liuguang Sect)

47
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,919
Isn't it...

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
This bracelet may be precious,

49
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,799
but

50
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,000
it's useless to me.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Better sell it

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
for money.

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
Good for you.

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,400
Please take a look.

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
This bracelet

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
is no ordinary accessory.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,959
Look.

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
This bracelet was once

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
worn by our top cultivator

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,519
in the Lingyou Realm,

61
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,160
Master Zhong Xi.

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Everybody knows Master Zhong Xi, right?

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,199
He's the top cultivator

64
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,479
who led Liuguang Sect's

65
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,519
Luanfeng Peak disciples

66
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,079
to subdue the Eight Corpse Kings
of Mount Beigu.

67
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,040
His fame echoes throughout

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,959
Lingyou Realm.

69
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,199
This very bracelet

70
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,160
was once...

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,199
How dare you block

72
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,639
our Elder's path?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Enough.

74
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,479
Don't frighten the commoners.

75
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,133
(Nascent Soul Elder, Yuxiao Sect)

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
(What happened?)

77
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,679
(What are they looking at?)

78
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,440
She's the bossy

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Nascent Soul Elder

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,639
of the Yuxiao Sect.

81
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
Useless.

82
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,400
My reputation

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,560
is ruined because of you.

84
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:55,400
Is she going to

85
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,440
abduct this man in broad daylight?

86
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,199
Pretty boy.

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,160
Nice figure.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,600
Did you stop my sedan chair

89
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,759
to admire my beauty?

90
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,919
Did I

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,280
startle you?

92
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,759
You're blocking the way.

93
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,400
Let me buy you a drink

94
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,160
to make amends.

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,319
Senior.

96
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,200
Please keep a distance.

97
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Pretty girl.

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,760
You want to meddle with us?

99
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
Yeah, so what?

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,960
Very well.

101
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,559
Excellent.

102
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,479
Excellent.

103
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,999
But I wonder

104
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,600
if you can handle this.

105
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,879
It doesn't matter if I can handle this.

106
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,160
My master

107
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,640
certainly can manage you.

108
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,760
Who's your master?

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Master Wang Tong.

110
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,879
She's the disciple

111
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,679
of Master Wang Tong.

112
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
The Yunhua Sect

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,200
can teach the Elder a lesson.

114
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
You look like

115
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,239
a minor rogue cultivator.

116
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,559
How dare you talk big

117
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,799
to me?

118
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,960
Are you suicidal?

119
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Actually,

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I lack the spiritual energy

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,559
to fight her.

122
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,520
I'll count to three.

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,040
Then we run.

124
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
Understand?

125
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,879
Without a fight?

126
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,160
Why should we fight when we can run?

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,840
How dare you

128
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,239
try to snatch a man from my hands?

129
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,200
Three. Run!

130
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,359
You...

131
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:39,999
Get them.

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,319
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,999
You're so good-looking.

134
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,319
They didn't hurt you, right?

135
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,439
Are you injured?

136
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,640
No.

137
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,919
Thankfully.

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,960
Check over there.

139
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,280
Hurry up.

140
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
(W-What's happening?)

141
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,400
(Spiritual energy is pouring in.)

142
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,760
(How did this happen?)

143
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
(So much spiritual energy. Amazing.)

144
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,679
Don't move.

145
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,919
If someone finds us here,

146
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,999
we'll be in trouble.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,679
(How is this possible?)

148
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,520
Let go.

149
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,919
What are you doing?

150
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:25,040
I wasn't doing anything.

151
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,119
I was just

152
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,799
trying to protect you.

153
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,679
Why did you let go?

154
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Hold on a bit longer.

155
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,999
We should keep a distance.

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
Please maintain some propriety.

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,439
After all,

158
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,760
I saved your life.

159
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,479
Why can't I hold your hands for a bit?

160
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,479
You're no different

161
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,400
from that person now.

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,319
There...

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
There is a huge difference.

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,559
That Nascent Soul Elder

165
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,600
was trying to abduct you in public

166
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,359
and take liberties with you.

167
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,679
I...

168
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:53,919
Weren't you doing

169
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,080
the exact same thing?

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,359
True.

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,640
Right,

172
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,040
you don't look like

173
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,479
you're from Yong City.

174
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,559
Are you here for fun?

175
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,679
Senior Ling Hui.

176
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,319
It's her messenger talisman.

177
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,080
I sent her to get help.

178
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
Stay close. Don't get lost.

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
I have questions for you.

180
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,479
Let's go.

181
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,919
- Stop.
- Over there. Hurry.

182
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
Pretty boy.

183
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,239
There you are again.

184
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
Seeing you

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,679
makes me so happy.

186
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,840
We're surrounded.

187
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,319
There's no escape.

188
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,280
You brat. Calling reinforcements again?

189
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,160
This time,

190
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,720
you won't be so lucky.

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,999
Interesting.

192
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
How interesting.

193
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,239
I didn't expect that

194
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,799
you're not just handsome,

195
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,160
but also quite skilled.

196
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,239
Taking you down
doesn't require any real skill.

197
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,720
The Yunhua Sect, indeed.

198
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,640
Senior Tan, forget it.

199
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,799
Better not chase them.

200
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,919
Lucky she ran fast.

201
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
(Tan Feng, Head Disciple of Yunhua Sect's Louyue Peak)
Are you alright?

202
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm fine.

203
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,120
He helped me earlier.

204
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,839
Are you alright?

205
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,120
It was so dangerous.

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,760
I didn't know you were so powerful.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
You lack spiritual energy.

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
What else could I do?

209
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,599
Kong Hou.

210
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,959
This is...?

211
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,559
I'm from the Liuguang Sect.

212
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,319
A master from the Liuguang Sect.

213
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:58,919
Kong Hou.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,599
You sneaked out again.

215
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,520
If Master finds out,

216
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,640
we'll all be in trouble.

217
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,719
Let's go back.

218
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,040
Thank you for saving her.

219
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,120
We have matters to attend to

220
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,880
back in our sect.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,760
Wait.

222
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Didn't you have

223
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,160
something to say?

224
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,679
Yeah, Senior Tan.

225
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,679
I haven't even thanked him properly.

226
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:18,640
Don't worry. It's fine.

227
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,079
Just a few words with him.

228
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,679
Master won't find out.

229
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,120
There is so much more

230
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,439
I want to ask you about.

231
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:29,319
Let me think...

232
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,719
Jingxin Bookshop.

233
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,839
Wait for me there.

234
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,096
(Jingxin Bookshop)

235
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,240
Young master.

236
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,280
Coming through.

237
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,760
I was away for a second,

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,559
and you were gone.

239
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,480
Why are you here?

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,824
(Lin Hu, Liuguang Sect)

241
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:50,679
(Jingxin Bookshop)

242
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,400
Jingxin Bookshop.

243
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,199
Why are we here?

244
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
Aren't we tracking down

245
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
that dark cultivator?

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm waiting for someone.

247
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,040
Who?

248
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,000
Who's worth the wait?

249
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,360
Gentlemen.

250
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,599
Looking for books?

251
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:06,360
The Master Writer.

252
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,839
Sorry, young master.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,240
No one has bought those books

254
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,520
for a long time now.

255
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,079
So

256
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,640
I stopped stocking them ages ago.

257
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
Why don't you

258
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,880
check the other books?

259
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,439
No need.

260
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,559
No need.

261
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,719
You don't even have a spiritual root.

262
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,799
What if you run into

263
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,959
dark cultivators out there?

264
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,360
I have to put you

265
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,000
under detention this time.

266
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,719
How come there's a barrier?

267
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,360
Heading out, Kong Hou?

268
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,760
I...

269
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,559
I just wanted to

270
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,400
stroll around the courtyard.

271
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,319
It's too stuffy in the room.

272
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,160
I just want some fresh air.

273
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,199
You're under detention.

274
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,919
I know exactly

275
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,000
what you're up to.

276
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,839
Sneaking out for fun again?

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Stay put.

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,839
No more clever ideas.

279
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:05,599
Exactly.

280
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,799
Let's go.

281
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,922
(Jingxin Bookshop)

282
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,040
Young master.

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,679
It's so late now.

284
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,079
She's clearly not coming.

285
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
I promised her.

286
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,040
Sorry, gentlemen.

287
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,319
Could you come back tomorrow?

288
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,880
We're closing for the night.

289
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,959
You're closing?

290
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,319
Young master, t-they're closing.

291
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,439
Did something happen to her?

292
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,599
That person

293
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,760
boosted my spiritual energy.

294
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,919
I wonder if it works.

295
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,319
Let's see.

296
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,719
It actually worked.

297
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,919
(Master Wang Tong, Master of Yunhua Sect's Qiyue Peak)
What worked?

298
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,719
Master.

299
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,040
Master, you came back.

300
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,919
So you broke the barrier.

301
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,839
I thought

302
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,599
I had grown more powerful.

303
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,959
Who?

304
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,919
You, of course.

305
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,319
You got beaten up?

306
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,439
It wasn't that bad.

307
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,199
Come on.

308
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,040
I'll take you somewhere.

309
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,719
Where are we going?

310
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,360
To take revenge.

311
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,440
(Yuxiao Sect)

312
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,599
Master.

313
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,559
Aren't we taking revenge
on Nascent Soul Elder?

314
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,199
With my cultivation level,

315
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,319
ten of them wouldn't stand

316
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,199
a chance against me.

317
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,160
I can turn

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,280
a Nascent Soul master into a newbie.

319
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,199
But what if she cheats

320
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,480
or uses tricks?

321
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,160
That's why we're going for
a sneak attack.

322
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,839
Master.

323
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,040
What's wrong?

324
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,439
Wait for me.

325
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,400
Don't go anywhere.

326
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I'll be right back.

327
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,959
Don't go anywhere.

328
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Elder.

329
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,599
What?

330
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,599
We found the pretty boy.

331
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,480
You did?

332
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,799
He's at the Qingquan Inn.

333
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
"Pretty boy"?

334
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,559
Oh my.

335
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,199
I forgot about him.

336
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,160
(Master, I'm going to save someone.)

337
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,199
(Don't worry about me.)

338
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,839
I've finally found you.

339
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:17,599
Young master.

340
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,719
You...

341
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm not here for you.

342
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,640
What brings you here?

343
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,719
I'm here for you.

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,079
What for?

345
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,040
Do you know

346
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
you're in grave danger?

347
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,319
No time to explain.

348
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,199
They're coming.

349
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,199
Come with me.

350
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,160
You're not in danger.

351
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,839
What? What danger?

352
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,880
What does she mean?

353
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,460
(Qingquan Inn)

354
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,160
Elder.

355
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Where is he?

356
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,919
The innkeeper said they fled.

357
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,880
Find him.

358
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,719
I don't care

359
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,160
if you tear this place apart.

360
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,360
Where are we going?

361
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,160
- Over there.
- Over there.

362
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,679
You don't have to do anything.

363
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,040
Don't worry. I got this.

364
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,880
- Over there.
- Over there.

365
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,679
- Stop.
- Get them.

366
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,040
Oh no, they're all coming.

367
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,679
Let's go.

368
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,480
It's quite windy here.

369
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,559
Be careful.

370
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
Acting nice? What's your angle?

371
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,000
My angle?

372
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,559
I just feel bad that I stood you up

373
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,799
and want to make amends.

374
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Sorry.

375
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,439
Something came up earlier.

376
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,919
Since you were busy,

377
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,640
let's forget it.

378
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,439
Right,

379
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,040
do you need to regulate your energy?

380
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,919
(Where does that come from?)

381
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,280
(She's acting)

382
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,719
(rather weirdly.)

383
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,799
Why should I do that?

384
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,000
Just do me a favor, okay?

385
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,520
Give me your hands.

386
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,240
Why do you need my hands?

387
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,120
The truth is,

388
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,199
I've been meaning to tell you.

389
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,839
I have no spiritual root.

390
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,120
No spiritual root?

391
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,919
Without a spiritual root,

392
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,240
I can't claim any spiritual tool,

393
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:33,000
let alone a chance of ascension.

394
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,120
That's why you acted that way before.

395
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,439
I also find it strange.

396
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,000
Whenever I make physical contact

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,079
with you,

398
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
the spiritual energy

399
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,040
comes rushing

400
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,199
into my system.

401
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,280
Then my spiritual energy surges.

402
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,640
I just want to

403
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,280
maintain contact with you.

404
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,160
Then I can

405
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
accumulate some spiritual energy.

406
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:53,120
But

407
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,679
I can't just take advantage of you.

408
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,199
Let's perform energy regulation.

409
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,599
I gain spiritual energy

410
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,480
and you

411
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,040
can regulate

412
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,199
your spiritual energy.

413
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,280
It's a win-win.

414
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,559
But

415
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,680
I think I'm too useless.

416
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,399
It only works

417
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,879
if I keep holding your hands.

418
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,559
Nonsense.

419
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,480
It does sound absurd,

420
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,799
but it's true.

421
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,599
All my years in the Lingyou Realm,

422
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,520
I've never heard of

423
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
such a thing.

424
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,079
Do you have

425
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,359
ulterior motives

426
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,119
and made up this excuse?

427
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,359
I...

428
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,799
You do look

429
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,639
kind of attractive,

430
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:40,760
but

431
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,920
I wouldn't go that far.

432
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,639
Kong Hou.

433
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,280
My disciple.

434
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,760
Where are you?

435
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,720
Your master?

436
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,599
Oh no.

437
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,359
He's definitely

438
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,879
going to drag me back.

439
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
Stop sneaking around. Go out there.

440
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,440
No.

441
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,760
I don't want to go back.

442
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Please help me.

443
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,920
What's in it for me?

444
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,960
I don't care.

445
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:04,280
Let's go.

446
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Kong Hou.

447
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,680
(It's already dawn.)

448
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,639
(Master must have returned.)

449
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,000
He's asleep.

450
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,599
Does that mean

451
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,200
I won't get caught?

452
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,599
What are you doing?

453
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,720
I...

454
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,000
I just...

455
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,440
Trying to regulate my energy
while I'm asleep?

456
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,599
Yeah, what's wrong?

457
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,639
It's a win-win

458
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:06,000
situation.

459
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,559
My spiritual energy

460
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,520
has increased a lot

461
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
thanks to you.

462
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
Maybe I'm as powerful

463
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
as you now.

464
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,520
You'd better

465
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,200
behave yourself.

466
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,240
Otherwise,

467
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll take forceful measures.

468
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Forceful measures?

469
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,079
Go ahead and try.

470
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:20,920
I...

471
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,839
You've got some nerve.

472
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,559
Just do me a favor.

473
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,639
Please.

474
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,079
Let me boost my spiritual energy.

475
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,920
No.

476
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,960
It would benefit

477
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,240
both of us.

478
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,399
Please.

479
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:34,520
No.

480
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,399
Young master.

481
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,280
What...

482
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,960
Why are you hugging?

483
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,920
Who are you?

484
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,119
None of your business.

485
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,399
You must be that girl

486
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:49,319
from the Yunhua Sect.

487
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,920
Well?

488
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:57,040
Young master, we have a lead.

489
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,559
Wait.

490
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,680
Let's think this through.

491
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,159
Are we really barging in?

492
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,040
Why not?

493
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,599
Let's calm down

494
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,799
and think about it.

495
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,920
There are only three of us.

496
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,760
How many of them are there?

497
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,119
At least 30.

498
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,119
Exactly.

499
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,480
Under such circumstances,

500
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,599
wouldn't it be wiser

501
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,599
to run away

502
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:17,799
than barge in?

503
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,399
We've been running all night.

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
That's right. Let's charge in.

505
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,599
Wait.

506
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,399
You transferred me spiritual energy.

507
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,720
Don't get into a fight now.

508
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
It's dangerous.

509
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,720
Are you saying that you can fight?

510
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,399
Well, I can't fight either.

511
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,399
So,

512
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,720
among the three of us,

513
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,200
only he can fight.

514
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
Will he make it?

515
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,920
What do you mean?

516
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,839
Looking down on me?

517
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,839
Or disrespecting the Luanfeng Peak.

518
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,839
Exactly.

519
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,720
Right.

520
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,319
Luanfeng Peak

521
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,240
is the top branch in the Liuguang Sect.

522
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,799
The Yuxiao Sect

523
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,000
must show some respect.

524
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:53,920
They're just

525
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,319
an affiliated organization

526
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,119
of your Liuguang Sect.

527
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,119
You remember now?

528
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,000
How did I forget that?

529
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,559
If I had remembered earlier,

530
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,599
I wouldn't have

531
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,440
dragged you around, hiding.

532
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,200
We don't need to be afraid of them.

533
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,639
Where's the pretty boy?

534
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,359
Where is he?

535
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,920
Where is he?

536
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,359
It's been an entire night.

537
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:15,720
You're all useless.

538
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
What's the point

539
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,399
of keeping you around?

540
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,559
Yunhua Sect.

541
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,599
How dare they

542
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,520
cross me like this?

543
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,680
They are not

544
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,760
showing respect.

545
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,359
They won't get away with this.

546
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,359
Yunhua Sect is here.

547
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,799
I was looking for you.

548
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,879
And you came on your own.

549
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,879
Wait.

550
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,960
What's wrong?

551
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,480
Got any final words

552
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:41,879
to say?

553
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,079
Do you know

554
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,240
who they are?

555
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,920
Pretty boy.

556
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,639
And a nobody.

557
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,520
Wrong.

558
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,040
They're the "authority" lineage.

559
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,839
No, the "orthodox" lineage.

560
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,359
Yeah.

561
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,559
The "orthodox" lineage.

562
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,159
The master and the supreme master
of Liuguang Sect's

563
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,680
Luanfeng Peak.

564
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
What a surprise.

565
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,639
My pretty boy is not just handsome

566
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,119
but also highly skilled.

567
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,559
You're an elite from the Luanfeng Peak.

568
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
I like you even more now.

569
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,119
Aren't you scared?

570
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,280
Why should I be scared?

571
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,599
Liuguang Sect

572
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,240
is our parent organization.

573
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,399
So I should be scared?

574
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,639
Don't be ridiculous.

575
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,240
Don't forget that

576
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,639
your Yuxiao Sect

577
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,280
relies entirely
on the Liuguang Sect's protection

578
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,879
to maintain its status as

579
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:44,480
Lingyou Realm's top merchant sect.

580
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,799
That's true.

581
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,680
But remember this, pretty boy.

582
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,040
The Yuxiao Sect

583
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,480
contributes massive wealth

584
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,040
to your Liuguang Sect every year.

585
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,720
Take that into consideration.

586
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,359
If you think

587
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,280
your offering to the Liuguang Sect

588
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,599
allows you to act recklessly

589
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,760
in Lingyou Realm,

590
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,119
then we don't need you

591
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,119
as an affiliated organization.

592
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,559
We will not

593
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,879
retain your offerings, either.

594
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,040
Such bold words, pretty boy.

595
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,520
I really like you.

596
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,960
But don't forget

597
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,760
that the Yuxiao and Liuguang Sects

598
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,440
shall never provoke each other.

599
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Your head

600
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
said that himself.

601
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,799
Our head did say that.

602
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,799
So...

603
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,440
So even if

604
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,240
Master Zhong Xi himself
stood before me today,

605
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,240
he should show me due respect.

606
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,280
Who do you think you are?

607
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
You're insane.

608
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,480
Are you saying

609
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,359
that even if Master Zhong Xi
were present,

610
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,119
you still wouldn't be scared?

611
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,359
(Dragon's Roar Sword.)

612
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,639
(His sword)

613
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,240
(is so intimidating?)

614
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,559
I was wrong, Master.

615
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,280
This is a misunderstanding.

616
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,799
Misunderstanding?

617
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,200
I saw it with my own eyes.

618
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,480
Stop making excuses.

619
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,079
Step aside.

620
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,720
Lin Hu.

621
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,200
Walk her through it

622
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,040
and see

623
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,159
if we misunderstood her.

624
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,319
Got it.

625
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,119
Zhou Xing.

626
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,280
You're the sister
of Yuxiao Sect Leader Zhou Cang.

627
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,680
You've always been domineering

628
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,079
thanks to your connection.

629
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,040
Three months ago,

630
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,399
you bullied people

631
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,760
in your turf,

632
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,319
causing dozens of casualties.

633
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,079
Didn't you?

634
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
A-After

635
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Zhou Cang sent you to Yong City,

636
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
you remained unchanged.

637
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,760
Exploiting local sects'

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,159
reluctance to intervene,

639
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,760
you plundered and oppressed

640
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,399
countless citizens.

641
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,200
You've done so much harm.

642
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:56,079
You're a real piece of work.

643
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,240
Real piece of work.

644
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,839
This is slander.

645
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,200
That's exaggerated.

646
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Master, you must believe me.

647
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,839
I'm innocent.

648
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:04,960
Innocent?

649
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,440
How dare you say that?

650
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,240
Go on.

651
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,159
Look.

652
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,879
These are

653
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,079
the testimonies

654
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,359
from the victims.

655
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,520
Some

656
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,159
couldn't seek justice,

657
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,520
and nearly hung themselves.

658
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,319
It was consensual.

659
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,760
I didn't force anyone.

660
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,639
I swear they were happy about it.

661
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,760
A-And this.

662
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,839
Look.

663
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:26,599
Testimonies

664
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,720
from your fellow disciples.

665
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,159
Even they couldn't tolerate it.

666
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,879
Master,

667
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,760
I realize my mistakes.

668
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,520
For my brother's sake,

669
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
please spare me.

670
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,000
Please, I beg you.

671
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Zhou Cang's sister

672
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,319
should be under 20

673
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,119
with no cultivation to speak of.

674
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:45,879
What's your deal?

675
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,839
Explain your spiritual energy.

676
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,200
C-Can I say it?

677
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,879
Confess.

678
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,079
I-I...

679
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,319
Stop stuttering.

680
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:55,920
Just say it.

681
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,599
I took pills.

682
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,280
Pills? She took pills?

683
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,599
What pills did you take?

684
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,280
Longgu Pills.

685
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,480
Longgu Pills?

686
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,240
Keep it down.

687
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,639
She took Longgu Pills.

688
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,639
You're quite something,

689
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:08,359
bullying people

690
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,480
and taking forbidden pills.

691
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,599
Where did you get the pills?

692
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,599
I-I bought those from Qing Yuan

693
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,280
in that Forbidden Forest

694
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,119
of your Yunhua Sect.

695
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:21,839
Qing...

696
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:30,639
(Yuxiao Sect)

697
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,040
This is weird.

698
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:35,639
What's wrong?

699
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,079
That Nascent Soul Elder

700
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,720
was all tough earlier.

701
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,359
Why did she back down the moment

702
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,319
you drew your sword?

703
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,359
That's because

704
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,480
he is Zhong...

705
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,119
Some people

706
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,240
only talk tough

707
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
and have no real skills.

708
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,119
That's nice.

709
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,280
You drew your sword.

710
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,079
All problems solved.

711
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,399
Poor me.

712
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,839
I just wanted a friend

713
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,399
to regulate some spiritual energy.

714
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,680
Someone

715
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,799
could easily help

716
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,839
a friend in need,

717
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,760
but he simply

718
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,040
refuses to lift a finger.

719
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,440
We're mere acquaintances,

720
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,799
hardly friends.

721
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:11,920
I'm off.

722
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,079
How can you

723
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,839
be so heartless?

724
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,520
Young master.

725
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,920
Should we look into the pills?

726
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,119
Wait for me over there.

727
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,040
What does it take

728
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,399
for you to help me?

729
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,520
I don't know how you absorb

730
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,359
spiritual energy.

731
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,639
But never take shortcuts

732
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,079
to gain cultivation.

733
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,359
Or there will be consequences.

734
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,280
I have things to do. Farewell.

735
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,079
It is weird that I can absorb

736
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,599
spiritual energy.

737
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
Never mind.

738
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,319
That Nascent Soul

739
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,720
said she bought the Longgu Pills
in the Forbidden Forest.

740
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,040
No way.

741
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Senior Tan must

742
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,159
look into it.

743
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:53,280
(Yunhua Sect)

744
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,079
Senior Tan.

745
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,200
Senior Tan.

746
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,200
Senior Tan.

747
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,359
This is weird.

748
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,440
Where did he go?

749
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,399
Isn't it obvious?

750
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,159
He must be working

751
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,280
for spirit stones again.

752
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,119
Maybe I should go alone.

753
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,159
Won't you tell Master?

754
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,792
(Forbidden Forest, Yunhua Sect)

755
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,879
(This is the Forbidden Forest?)

756
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,480
(Our Yunhua Sect)

757
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
(actually has such a place?)

758
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,119
It's fine.

759
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
Those are just

760
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,280
some demonic beasts

761
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,119
who like to scare the disciples.

762
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,359
A spiritual tool here.

763
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,079
Who are you?

764
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,559
Why are you in our

765
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,480
Forbidden Forest?

766
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,319
(Dark energy is spreading.)

767
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,839
(A dark cultivator.)

768
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
(What do I do?)

769
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,599
(With my petty spiritual energy...)

770
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,799
(Stay calm. Keep him occupied.)

771
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,839
Formation activation.

772
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:46,839
Just this?

773
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
Scared now, aren't you?

774
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,040
Surrender now.

775
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,440
(Oh no, I've met the real deal.)

776
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
Don't get cocky.

777
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,240
Just you wait.

778
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,960
I'll call Master and martial uncle.

779
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
How dare

780
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,000
you dark cultivator cause trouble here?

781
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,079
I don't have time for your games.

782
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,960
Wait.

783
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,680
Aren't you scared

784
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,399
I'll call reinforcements?

785
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:20,480
Listen.

786
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,440
People from our sect

787
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,599
are extremely powerful.

788
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,159
What reinforcements?

789
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,760
Enough blabbering.

790
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,639
It's you?

791
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,079
See?

792
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,440
Here's my reinforcement.

793
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,480
You're finished.

794
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,119
Don't leave me alone.

795
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,319
Wait.

796
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,799
Master.

797
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,599
Master.

798
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,920
(Master Qing Yuan, Yunhua Sect)

799
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,839
Don't panic.

800
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,159
Where's your composure?

801
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,240
What happened?

802
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,399
The Forbidden Forest...

803
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,280
What about it?

804
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,760
When I delivered medicine,

805
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,440
I found

806
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,799
someone there.

807
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,200
Did they discover anything?

808
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm not sure.

809
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,319
They've even

810
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,359
set up a barrier there.

811
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,000
Master.

812
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,520
We can't let anyone

813
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,280
discover our secret.

814
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,440
Where did they go?

815
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,839
Where are they?

816
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,520
So fast?

817
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Ouch!

818
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,799
This...

819
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,839
This barrier...

820
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,240
Sorry.

821
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,799
I didn't know it was you.

822
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,000
A-Are you okay?

823
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,760
You're amazing.

824
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,960
Right,

825
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,119
you're also investigating
the Longgu Pills

826
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,879
because of the Nascent Soul Elder?

827
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,280
And to catch the dark cultivator.

828
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,079
W-Where is that dark cultivator?

829
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,119
He escaped.

830
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,599
Did he set up

831
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,879
this barrier

832
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:32,720
to trap us?

833
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,359
I set up this barrier.

834
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,520
You did this?

835
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,799
So you did it to trap

836
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,119
that dark cultivator?

837
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,639
I see.

838
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:41,639
You're amazing.

839
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:42,319
I've never seen

840
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,599
such a powerful barrier.

841
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,879
You saved my life.

842
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,040
Sect Leader.

843
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,839
You did

844
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,119
something strange

845
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,680
to earn spirit stones again?

846
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,639
You look ridiculous.

847
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,359
Senior Brother.

848
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,240
Now's not the time for this.

849
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,079
What's with this barrier?

850
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,399
I just arrived myself.

851
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,480
Impressive.

852
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,200
Liuguang Sect's techniques.

853
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:11,079
That dark cultivator is named Jiusu.

854
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,440
On March 3rd, he killed

855
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,599
15 rogue cultivators

856
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,839
at Yingzhou's Feling Pier.

857
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,079
On March 9th,

858
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:17,680
he killed 30 disciples of Pingzhou's

859
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Jinxiu Sect.

860
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,200
Scared already?

861
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,960
Who's scared?

862
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm a disciple of the Yunhua Sect.

863
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,280
We vanquish demons and evil

864
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,440
and fear nothing...

865
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,319
(Spiritual energy.)

866
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
I thought you weren't scared.

867
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,559
I-I'm not scared.

868
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,440
I just got startled

869
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
by that sound.

870
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,040
Let go, then.

871
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
(Pei Huai, Master of Yunhua Sect's Wuyang Peak)
Someone from

872
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,760
the Liuguang Sect came

873
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
and set up barriers.

874
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,159
I'm afraid something went wrong

875
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,599
in the Forbidden Forest.

876
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,520
You brat.

877
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,720
What happened to your face?

878
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,000
You look just the same.

879
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,760
I'll teach you a lesson.

880
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,440
Senior Wang Tong.

881
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,960
Come back.

882
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
Pei Huai.

883
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,360
Wang Tong and I will stay here.

884
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,599
Go back with Qing Yuan first.

885
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,119
Understood.

886
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:13,920
Understood.

887
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,840
Talking back?

888
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:16,960
If it's

889
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,159
so dangerous in there,

890
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,599
what will happen to her?

891
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,320
"Her"?

892
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,520
Ling Hui.

893
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,360
Who's in there?

894
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,880
Kong Hou said

895
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,079
there were drug transactions

896
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,639
in the Forbidden Forest

897
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,520
and insisted on

898
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,679
investigating it herself.

899
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Kong Hou is in there?

900
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,360
That's right.

901
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,960
You Liuguang Sect old fools!

902
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,840
Your Luanfeng Peak is up to something.

903
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,920
Don't drag my disciple into this.

904
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,199
If so much

905
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,968
as a single hair on her head is harmed,

906
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,360
I'll pluck every strand of hair

907
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,960
from every member

908
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
of Liuguang Sect

909
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,320
and burn your sect

910
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,040
to ashes.

911
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,880
(Zhong Xi's barrier)

912
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,480
(is so hard to break.)

913
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,920
What do we do?

914
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
What if he breaks through?

915
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,920
Will you step up?

916
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,679
I'll help you.

917
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,000
Hide if you want to help.

918
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,719
Got it.

919
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:31,960
It seems

920
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,119
we can't avoid

921
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,040
this battle.

922
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,239
The world seeks to be carefree,

923
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,719
yet you seek to fight.

924
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,000
Do you really see yourself

925
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,599
as a slayer of evils?

926
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,920
No more chitchat.

927
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,000
You're not getting away today.

928
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,759
A cultivator from Luanfeng Peak

929
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:24,159
is truly extraordinary.

930
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:53,679
Impressive.

931
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,559
Master.

932
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,119
Let's talk this out.

933
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,559
If you want to live,

934
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,279
come back to Liuguang Sect with me.

935
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,880
This is the dark poison

936
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,960
I've accumulated.

937
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,159
It clashes

938
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,440
with your spiritual energy.

939
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:31,239
If you activate your spiritual energy,

940
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
it'll destroy your spiritual core.

941
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,759
The faster you circulate your energy,

942
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
the sooner you die.

943
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,079
How come I can suddenly

944
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:45,279
use a spiritual tool?

945
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,599
Was it because...

946
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,400
You wretched girl, how dare you

947
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,800
sneak-attack me?

948
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,719
What's wrong?

949
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,360
You sneak-attacked him.

950
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,400
Why can't I do the same to you?

951
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,119
I'll teach you a lesson.

952
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,159
Boost spiritual energy
with heart's blood?

953
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,759
You're truly courting death.

954
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,360
If I can kill you,

955
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,119
death would be worth it.
