=Episode 16=

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,479
Bei Jun, you do it.

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,360
Your Highness,

18
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,039
seriously?

19
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:45,679
Do it.

20
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,039
Your Highness.

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,279
Just faking it?

22
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,960
No.

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,679
Lady, did you summon me?

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,439
It's noisy outside,

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
what's happening?

26
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,040
The Second Prince

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,520
is asking the bodyguards to hit him.

28
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,719
What?

29
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,080
Who is he?

30
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,719
It's the Second Prince himself.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,439
Just faking it.

32
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,599
But the bodyguards said so.

33
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,320
They wouldn't lie.

34
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:28,960
Well...

35
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,520
Impossible.

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,920
If he truly

37
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,279
feels sorry,

38
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,320
he'd never torment himself.

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Stop it!

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,839
This...

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,719
This is my apology.

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,119
Satisfied?

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,399
Are you crazy?

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,480
Do you plan to

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,599
lock yourself

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,520
in the icehouse too?

47
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,439
If you want it...

48
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:00,920
You...

49
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,839
Stop it.

50
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,480
I keep my promises.

51
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,240
Alright.

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
You've severely injured,

53
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,640
we're even now.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,559
I accept your apology,

55
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,719
but stop tormenting

56
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,679
yourself.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,920
We're even now?

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
Yes, we're even.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,839
Do you have medicine?

60
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,040
What's wrong?

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,520
Seems you're satisfied,

62
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,599
since you're willing to tend my wounds.

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,520
Let the palace maids do it then.

64
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,719
My injury hasn't healed yet.

65
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,159
You'd do it.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,520
Bear with it.

67
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
This reminds me

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,520
of last time when I treated you

69
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,960
for your itching.

70
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,320
My itching?

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,799
Yes.

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,799
To shield me

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,120
from poisonous thorns,

74
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,719
you got severe wounds.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,399
Though terribly itchy,

76
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,120
you feigned indifference.

77
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,560
Pity

78
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,640
you remember nothing.

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,000
That

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,760
version of you

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,159
was aloof,

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,399
yet unexpected adorable.

83
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,359
Adorable?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,239
Yes.

85
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,279
But this version of you

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,599
is not adorable at all.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,599
Be gentle.

88
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,359
Be gentle.

89
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Can't even endure this?

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
You'd serve me

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
from tomorrow.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,680
No more stable duties.

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Here, Your Majesty.

94
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:21,440
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,120
Press harder.

96
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,399
Okay.

97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,960
Right.

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,039
A few days ago,

99
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,080
the Crown Prince

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,159
fell from the horse.

101
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,399
How's he now?

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,799
I heard he's awake.

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
But no others details.

104
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,799
The Second Prince's men

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,599
didn't tell a thing.

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,320
At least, he's awake.

107
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,799
An incident now

108
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,399
is ill-timed indeed.

109
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,000
Your Majesty,

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,200
the Second Prince's bodyguard
requests audience.

111
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:58,399
Granted.

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,120
Yes.

113
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,719
Your Majesty, I pay my respects.

114
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:11,239
Your Majesty.

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,279
Please uphold justice for me.

116
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,039
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

117
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,799
What does this mean?

118
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,279
The Second Prince ordered me

119
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,680
to present this person to you.

120
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:20,520
Among the steeds

121
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,919
he gifted to the Second Prince,

122
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,080
one got poisoned,

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,320
so it went wild

124
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,039
and endangered the Crown Prince's life.

125
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,320
Your Majesty, please punish this person

126
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,279
for the Crown Prince.

127
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,560
Your Majesty.

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
I am innocent.

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Your Majesty.

130
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,560
I am innocent.

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,039
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

132
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:35,919
Your Majesty.

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,919
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

134
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,719
I didn't do it.

135
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,560
Your Majesty.

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,880
The Emperor arrives.

137
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,799
Your Majesty.

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,159
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

139
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,320
You fool!

140
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
Your Majesty.

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,520
In that case,

142
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,880
you told your brother to gift

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
the steeds to Huan Zong?

144
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,919
Yes, I did it.

145
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,039
The Second Prince

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,159
always troubles you.

147
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,359
I thought a simple prank

148
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,960
would teach him a lesson.

149
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,760
I never expected
it would end up like this

150
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,039
and harmed the Crown Prince.

151
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,919
I just wanted to make a simple prank.

152
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,080
What?

153
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,799
Think you're clever?

154
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,039
Your Majesty.

155
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,279
Your Majesty.

156
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:20,000
I wanted to

157
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,399
make him lose vigilance

158
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,680
then make the fatal blow.

159
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,320
Now,

160
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,560
you've alerted him.

161
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,520
He'll surely...

162
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,839
W-What will he do?

163
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
You know it.

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
Like his mother,

165
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,399
he's a patient predator.

166
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,200
Now he must be waiting

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,239
for his chance.

168
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
Your alert

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,200
forces him to take the initiative.

170
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,839
What?

171
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,960
Kong Hou.

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,399
Kong Hou.

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,839
Where are you?

174
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,520
Kong Hou.

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,719
I'll find you.

176
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,479
Here.

177
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,320
Your Highness.

178
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,239
Your Highness.

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,039
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

180
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,839
Found you, Kong Hou.

181
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Well played.

182
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,320
You've been tricking me here.

183
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,000
Second Brother said this is a tactic.

184
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,200
You clever imp!

185
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,080
You clever imp!

186
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,239
I'll catch you.

187
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,200
Stop it.

188
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,040
Stay still.

189
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,119
Why is this person so tall?

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
My apologies.

191
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
Are you done groping?

192
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,680
Sorry.

193
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,759
I didn't know it's you.

194
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,519
Are your back injuries healed?

195
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,848
Why are you running around?

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,479
I told you

197
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,479
my injuries healed.

198
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,239
Stop nagging.

199
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:06,920
Alright.

200
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
You are quite eloquent.

201
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,040
What's so funny?

202
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Let me ask you.

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,440
Finished your studies?

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Brother,

205
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,320
grant me a day off.

206
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,800
You've promised me

207
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,119
to fly kites with me,

208
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,519
yet always break your word.

209
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,759
Just fly kites with me,

210
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,719
okay?

211
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,200
Please.

212
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,080
Exactly.

213
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,160
My master said

214
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:38,999
those who

215
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,440
stay in the study

216
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,359
with books

217
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,560
all day

218
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,639
will become dull scholars.

219
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,519
So,

220
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,639
let's go

221
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,960
fly kites.

222
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,239
Please.

223
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,119
Please.

224
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
Please.

225
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,400
Please.

226
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,560
Wait.

227
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,160
Why are you coming along?

228
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,759
Aren't we going to fly kites?

229
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,999
No one invited you.

230
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,400
Brother,

231
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,560
I want her to go with us.

232
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,119
Why can't I fly it?

233
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,759
Cheer up.

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,839
Let me show you.

235
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,440
See?

236
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,719
So you can't do it either.

237
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,680
I haven't flown

238
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,639
kites in ages.

239
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Here, I got this.

240
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:07,680
What?

241
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,879
To fly the kite.

242
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,759
At your pace,

243
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,639
we won't fly a kite

244
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,479
by sunset.

245
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
You understand nothing.

246
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,519
The weather is not suitable

247
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,599
for flying kites now.

248
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:16,320
Got it?

249
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,440
It's soaring!

250
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,960
Kong Hou is amazing!

251
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,879
Your Highness,

252
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:35,879
look, is it

253
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,599
high enough?

254
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,479
Yes.

255
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,719
I told you

256
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,440
the weather is not suitable today.

257
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,239
Besides,

258
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,320
this kite suits you two.

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,639
Too light for me.

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,440
I see.

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,519
So it's the kite's fault.

262
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,599
Exactly.

263
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,320
Your Highness,

264
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,879
let's challenge him.

265
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,420
Shall we?

266
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
Yes!

267
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,759
Brother, come on.

268
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,359
No way.

269
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,839
What if I won?

270
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,599
Your brother

271
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,280
must be scared.

272
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,320
Presumptuous!

273
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,119
Just flying a kite.

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,960
Come on.

275
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,999
Ready?

276
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,280
Go!

277
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,119
Kong Hou, go!

278
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,479
Kong Hou, go!

279
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
Your Highness,

280
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:37,200
you're not doing it well.

281
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,560
Don't gloat yet.

282
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,479
Now,

283
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,400
the real show begins.

284
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
What did I say?

285
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
Don't gloat.

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,680
Flying a kite

287
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,999
can't defeat me.

288
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,040
Be careful!

289
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,040
Kong Hou.

290
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,999
The kite is heading for the tree.

291
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,599
Bei Jun.

292
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
It's okay, I can handle this.

293
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,879
Look,

294
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
you got the kite

295
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,040
stuck in the tree.

296
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,440
Are you really

297
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,759
that clumsy?

298
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,759
Presumptuous!

299
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,759
Your Highness, look.

300
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,800
He's bullying me.

301
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
Stand up for me.

302
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,160
Brother,

303
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,519
you're wrong.

304
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,359
Kong Hou

305
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,960
retrieved your kite.

306
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,519
Moreover,

307
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,479
she's so brilliant,

308
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,280
adorable, and beautiful.

309
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
You can't bully her.

310
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,759
Clever you,

311
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,440
complaining me to the Crown Prince?

312
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,999
Look.

313
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,119
Your brother

314
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:09,639
always treats me this way.

315
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,879
Brother,

316
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,200
could you

317
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,719
treat her better?

318
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,200
She is so kind.

319
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,519
I want...

320
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,680
I want her

321
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,160
to stay by my side forever.

322
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
But I'm too young

323
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,400
to marry her.

324
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,359
But Brother, you could marry her.

325
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
Then she would

326
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,639
stay with me forever.

327
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,999
Perfect!

328
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,239
Perfect!

329
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,960
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

330
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,599
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

331
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,960
Wake up.

332
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,639
Go back to your room.

333
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
You claimed to like me before,

334
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,080
yet forgot me in an instant.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,920
Huan Zong,

336
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,920
do you truly like me?

337
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,680
Well...

338
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,519
Wait.

339
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,800
What are you doing?

340
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,599
Have something

341
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,119
to tell me?

342
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,160
Nothing.

343
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,479
I just want to ask,

344
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
when I hugged you,

345
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,119
why didn't you push me away?

346
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,080
I feared it'd wake my brother.

347
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,680
That's it?

348
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,879
What else?

349
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,719
What do you think?

350
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,639
Nothing.

351
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,999
I just want to say,

352
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
I've caused you

353
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
a lot of trouble recently.

354
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Glad that you know it.

355
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,559
Go ask others.

356
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,600
I've never treated

357
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,559
anyone like this.

358
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,999
You mean,

359
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
I'm the first

360
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,840
you've treated this way?

361
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,160
I'm so fortunate.

362
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,239
What's on your mind?

363
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,719
I mean,

364
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,400
as a palace maid,

365
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,880
overstepping your place

366
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,920
is treasonous.

367
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,440
If you dare do it again,

368
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,600
you might get beheaded.

369
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,479
You always warn me

370
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,400
that I might get beheaded.

371
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,519
Huan Zong.

372
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,999
You don't need to act

373
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,319
so fierce before me.

374
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
I understand

375
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,319
you don't want

376
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,200
to behead anyone.

377
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,880
You're kind.

378
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,880
Think you know me well?

379
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,400
You know nothing.

380
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,559
Fine, I'll stop.

381
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,799
But

382
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,600
still,

383
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,319
thank you.

384
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
Wait.

385
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,360
Answer me some questions.

386
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,319
Fine.

387
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,559
I'll be truthful where possible.

388
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,600
The Crown Prince's incident
wasn't an accident,

389
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,279
right?

390
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,519
Right.

391
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,719
The Emperor ordered it.

392
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:10,719
Right?

393
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,039
Actually, he targeted

394
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,680
me.

395
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,840
But my brother got caught in it.

396
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,319
When I first entered the palace,

397
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,960
I heard

398
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:22,600
stories

399
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,519
of you two.

400
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,319
But I didn't expect

401
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,400
there

402
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,079
would be someone so cruel

403
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,400
to his own wife

404
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
and children

405
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,759
in this world.

406
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,200
Perhaps

407
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
the power struggles

408
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,239
will change anyone

409
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,680
into someone unrecognizable.

410
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,719
I've actually forgotten

411
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,559
who I used to be.

412
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,160
No, Huan Zong.

413
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,519
You haven't changed.

414
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,479
You're still yourself.

415
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,360
You've never been

416
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
corrupted by power.

417
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,319
You only wanted
to protect the Crown Prince

418
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,559
and those around you.

419
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,799
What will you do next?

420
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Whatever you decide to do,

421
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,920
I'll support you.

422
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
How's the situation?

423
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,880
Rest assured.

424
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
I've informed everyone.

425
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,999
Greetings, Your Highness.

426
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,279
My elder brother entrusted

427
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,239
you to my care,

428
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
I will never

429
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,440
let you take risks.

430
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,360
Now we must wait.

431
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,680
When the temple's completed,

432
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,920
he'll surely immerse
himself in cultivation.

433
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,039
Then

434
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,239
it'll be our best chance

435
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,440
to take actions.

436
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,680
Yes.

437
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
We'll wait for your command.

438
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,880
Kong Hou has gone in for five days,

439
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,479
yet nothing happened at all.

440
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,279
We might force our way in.

441
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,279
Seriously?

442
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,279
We have inner demons.

443
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:56,920
What if

444
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,799
our intrusion

445
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,759
affects the Young Master

446
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,440
and Kong Hou?

447
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,799
I understand.

448
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,840
We can only wait idly here?

449
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Don't worry.

450
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,160
Kong Hou is smart.

451
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,120
She's the only one

452
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,999
without inner demons.

453
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,039
Just be patient.

454
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,519
Moreover, Wu Xi mentioned

455
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,279
time in there

456
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,319
flows differently.

457
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,039
One day here,

458
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,079
ten days in there.

459
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,719
The Concealment Pill will expire soon.

460
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Well...

461
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,559
If Kong Hou gets caught,

462
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,360
or anything happens,

463
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,440
we'll force our way in.

464
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,999
Okay?

465
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,840
Every part of the temple

466
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,279
will be constructed

467
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,400
with premium century-old timber.

468
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,719
All craftsmanship

469
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,960
will adhere

470
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,600
to the imperial highest standards.

471
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,360
When Master Jin Yue arrives,

472
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:50,079
he'll surely be pleased.

473
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,319
Tell the Second Prince to handle

474
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,039
this properly.

475
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,319
Understood.

476
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,880
Your Majesty,
Master Jin Yue has replied.

477
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,976
(Letter of Rejection
from Master Jin Yue)

478
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,440
Your Majesty, calm down.

479
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,680
Your Majesty, calm down.

480
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,200
That old fool Jin Yue!

481
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,319
I've shown utmost sincerity

482
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,120
to become his disciple.

483
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,640
Yet he keeps rejecting me.

484
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,200
How ungrateful!

485
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,360
Never mind.

486
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,440
In a few days,

487
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,799
I'll invite him personally.

488
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:39,799
What's wrong?

489
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,719
Why are you following me?

490
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,200
Because

491
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:49,759
I don't know

492
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,880
what you're going to do.

493
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,960
What I am going to do

494
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,200
is none of your concern.

495
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,799
Look,

496
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
if you don't tell me,

497
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,039
how can I protect you

498
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:58,640
well?

499
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,680
Just protect yourself.

500
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,600
Besides, it's improper if others see us.

501
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,999
There's nothing wrong with it.

502
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,600
People from your palace

503
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,239
all stroll around

504
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,079
with a bunch

505
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
of eunuchs and palace maids.

506
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,400
There's nothing special.

507
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:12,239
Besides,

508
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,680
bringing just me

509
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
is already discreet.

510
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,840
I never take any palace maids.

511
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:17,559
Besides,

512
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,160
no one would take you for a palace maid.

513
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,319
Weird.

514
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,600
If not a palace maid,

515
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,640
then what?

516
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,999
What do you think?

517
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,719
Wonderful!

518
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,519
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

519
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,680
Brother will marry Kong Hou!

520
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,559
Thinking of something?

521
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,440
Nothing.

522
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,640
Nothing special.

523
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,600
My mind remains blank.

524
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,079
Then

525
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,999
why are you blushing?

526
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,880
Not at all.

527
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,759
I was

528
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,999
just focusing

529
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,640
on recalling.

530
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
Exactly, I thought the same.

531
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,360
It'd be improper to follow you

532
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,039
all along.

533
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,120
So,

534
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,719
you should follow me instead.

535
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,319
Why would I follow you?

536
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
You'll tell me

537
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
where you want to go,

538
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,999
and I'll lead the way.

539
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:09,120
Just give me directions.

540
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,319
Fine.

541
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll go to the Crown Prince.

542
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,360
Just ahead.

543
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,239
Lead the way.

544
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,519
I see.

545
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,600
Come, follow me.

546
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,400
Your Highness.

547
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
What's happened? Why the panic?

548
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:30,112
Consort Qi sent someone
to take the Crown Prince away.

549
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:30,600
What?

550
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,559
Here, try this.

551
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,120
I made it for you.

552
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,960
I'm full now.

553
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,559
I won't eat.

554
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,960
This carries my sincere thoughts.

555
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,039
Here, Your Highness.

556
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,960
Open your mouth and eat!

557
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
Your Highness,

558
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,719
can you feel anything

559
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,039
here?

560
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:05,719
Here

561
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:07,880
lies a prince just like you.

562
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,719
But here's the difference.

563
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,039
He will become your Father's

564
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,479
most cherished son.

565
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
And you

566
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,559
will be the most pitiful child

567
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,759
in the palace.

568
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,600
Think your Second Brother

569
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,519
cares for you most?

570
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:23,680
Let me tell you,

571
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,479
it's all fake.

572
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,600
That's not true.

573
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,759
He cares for you most.

574
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:31,759
Do you know

575
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,759
your Eldest Brother

576
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,120
got killed by him?

577
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,920
One day,

578
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,680
he'll kill you too.

579
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,360
I don't believe you!

580
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,120
You will die more tragically than him.

581
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,319
Beheading is mercy.

582
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,840
Know the Lingchi execution?

583
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,680
No! I won't listen.

584
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,519
They'd wrap a fishnet

585
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,360
around your body,

586
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,319
the slice your meat

587
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,400
through the net holes

588
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,880
piece by piece

589
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,960
for three days.

590
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
You might survive,

591
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,440
but then

592
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,519
you'd only be a bloody skeleton.

593
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,319
Stop it!

594
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,239
Your Majesty.

595
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,559
What exactly happened?

596
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,640
I made

597
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,120
a bowl of fish soup

598
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
for the Crown Prince.

599
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,920
And I

600
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,239
unintentionally revealed

601
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,640
my pregnancy.

602
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
But he

603
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,319
attacked me...

604
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,640
My belly!

605
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
It aches terribly!

606
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,640
My belly!

607
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,079
Your Majesty, uphold justice for me!

608
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,039
You!

609
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Father, no!

610
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,960
You!

611
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,440
Brother.

612
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,719
I didn't mean to.

613
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,719
I really didn't.

614
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,400
I know it.

615
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,559
I trust you.

616
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,079
Don't be afraid.

617
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,559
No one can harm you.

618
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,880
Tell me

619
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,200
what happened today

620
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,279
in detail.

621
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,440
I always believe you.

622
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,719
She said...

623
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,079
She said...

624
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:47,880
Bei Jun.

625
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,920
What happened?

626
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,488
Her Highness had a miscarriage risk.

627
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:52,640
And His Majesty is furious.

628
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,999
Can you get us in?

629
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,352
We're worried about
the Second Prince and the Crown Prince.

630
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,479
Bei Jun,

631
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,880
young lady,

632
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,759
I want to help.

633
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,600
But

634
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
if I take you both in

635
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,680
and we get caught,

636
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,079
we'll all be beheaded.

637
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,600
The Second Prince is His Majesty's son.

638
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,799
He should be fine.

639
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,279
You may leave. Thank you.

640
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,759
Seems we can't get in.

641
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,920
We'll have to wait.

642
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,319
Your Majesty,

643
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,079
Her Highness is blessed.

644
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,400
The pregnancy remains stable.

645
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,239
She merely suffered a fright

646
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,479
and needs calming herbs

647
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:31,160
to recover fully.

648
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,400
Very well.

649
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,559
You may leave.

650
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:34,640
Yes.

651
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,279
Your Majesty,

652
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,079
the Second Prince is kneeling outside

653
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,079
and claiming

654
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,920
to discuss something with you alone.

655
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,840
I won't see him.

656
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,200
The Crown Prince claims

657
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,920
there might be a hidden secret

658
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,799
in this incident.

659
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,279
I said no.

660
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:57,559
You may leave.

661
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,400
Yes.

662
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,039
All of you, leave.

663
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes.

664
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,160
Your Majesty!

665
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,440
Shut up.

666
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,279
The imperial physician said

667
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,840
you had no miscarriage risk.

668
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,600
Drop the act.

669
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,479
But I acted so

670
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,600
just for you.

671
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,999
Are you tired?

672
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,440
Take a nap.

673
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,559
Brother.

674
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm fine.

675
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
Your Highness,

676
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,519
His Majesty said Consort Qi

677
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,039
needs rest for days.

678
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,600
Just put

679
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
today's incident aside.

680
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,840
The Crown Prince

681
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,279
has to be confined

682
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,559
to quarters

683
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,840
until Consort Qi recovers.

684
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:59,160
I demand to see Father now!

685
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,920
Take care, Your Highnesses.

686
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,120
Brother.

687
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,160
Fear not.

688
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm here.

689
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,479
Father!

690
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,239
My brother is young

691
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,640
and kind.

692
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,999
He'd never harm
Consort Qi intentionally.

693
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,079
There must be a misunderstanding.

694
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
Since Consort Qi got a scare today,

695
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,559
I'll kneel at the ancestral temple

696
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,960
to pray for

697
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
the unborn child.

698
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,120
I'll take my leave.

699
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,519
Let's go.

700
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,920
Brother.

701
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,120
My legs are numb.

702
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
I'll carry you.

703
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Your Majesty.

704
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,999
Your Majesty.

705
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,400
What does

706
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,759
the Second Prince mean?

707
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:23,799
Misunderstanding?

708
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,519
Does he mean

709
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,160
I'd slander

710
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,719
the Crown Prince?

711
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,999
Stand up for me.

712
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,920
You understand nothing.

713
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
He's giving me a warning.

714
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,719
If I severely punish

715
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,759
the Crown Prince

716
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,759
based on what you said,

717
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
he won't

718
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,079
let this off.

719
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,559
What does he want?

720
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,799
Does he intend to rebel?

721
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,880
Given his temperament,

722
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,400
it's not the right timing

723
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,120
to rebel now.

724
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,079
Hasty actions

725
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,479
will only harm us.

726
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
Then

727
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,600
are we letting this go?

728
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,360
Our priority now

729
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,239
is to convince

730
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,640
that Jin Yue

731
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
to assist my cultivation.

732
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
No further trouble allowed.

733
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,920
We can always find opportunities

734
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,799
in the future.

735
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,039
As for you,

736
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,239
behave yourself recently.

737
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,440
Don't cause me trouble.

738
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
Understood.

739
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:33,999
Your Highness.

740
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,920
Kong Hou.

741
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Kong Hou.

742
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,920
There, there.

743
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,559
When we return,

744
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,319
you can have treats

745
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,799
and play whatever you want.

746
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,120
What's so funny?

747
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,719
You and Lady Kong Hou

748
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:47,719
along with His Highness,

749
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,999
are like a family.

750
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,759
You know Brother will marry Kong Hou?

751
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,519
Y-Your Highness.

752
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,279
Enough.

753
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,360
Escort the Crown Prince back.

754
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,400
Your Highness.

755
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,799
Your Highness.

756
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,400
We are here

757
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,319
to escort His Highness
back to the palace.

758
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,360
No need.

759
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,920
I'll personally attend to him.

760
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,239
But...

761
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,880
Your Highness,

762
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,640
per His Majesty's decree,

763
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,519
we must escort His Highness back

764
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,759
to his confinement.

765
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,840
Brother.

766
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,799
I don't want it.

767
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:23,880
Don't worry.

768
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,479
During your confinement,

769
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,360
Bei Jun will guard you.

770
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,160
Your Highness.

771
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,880
Rest assured.

772
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,719
I will defend the Crown Prince
with my life.

773
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Where are you going?

774
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,160
Starting today,

775
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,039
no need to follow me.

776
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,319
Huan Zong.

777
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
He...

778
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,576
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Empress)

779
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,960
I told you not to follow me.

780
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,719
Why are you following me?

781
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,799
I can't figure out

782
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
why you're

783
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,999
kneeling here.

784
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,239
I kneel

785
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,880
before memorial tablets of our ancestors

786
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,719
and my mother

787
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,200
to keep him in check.

788
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,079
Otherwise, he'll do more harm

789
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,120
toward my brother.

790
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,719
Do you intend

791
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,840
to keep kneeling like this?

792
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
I'll kneel until he comes.

793
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Let me ask you,

794
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,599
when will you make your move?

795
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
What do you mean?

796
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,760
I know everything.

797
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,519
The Emperor is ruthless,

798
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,880
and you seek vengeance.

799
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,840
This doesn't concern you. Leave.

800
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,400
I told you

801
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,199
I came here for you.

802
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,320
No matter what happens

803
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,360
or what challenges arise,

804
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll be with you.

805
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,240
(The Concealment Pill's effect)

806
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,400
(is about to expire.)

807
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,904
(Memorial Tablet of the Late Empress)

808
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,079
How's it going?

809
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,240
The Second Prince is still

810
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,079
kneeling at the ancestral temple.

811
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Just let him

812
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,320
kneel.

813
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,479
Your Majesty!

814
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,440
Your Majesty!

815
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,400
Why the panic?

816
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,559
Your Majesty,
Master Jin Yue has responded.

817
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,119
Has he changed his mind?

818
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,440
(To Emperor Jing Hong,)

819
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,159
(I previously received word
from Master Hong Yan,)

820
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,960
(Yuexing Sect's leader,)

821
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,360
(that in the imperial family
of Lingyou Realm,)

822
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
(there exists an extraordinary)

823
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,320
(cultivation prodigy.)

824
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,559
(After analyzing
every imperial family member's)

825
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,760
(birth charts,)

826
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,920
(I confirm this person
to be Second Prince Huan Zong.)

827
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,999
(Liuguang Sect)

828
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,240
(is the foremost sect)

829
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,559
(in the Lingyou Realm.)

830
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:58,999
(I wish to accept
the Second Prince as my disciple.)

831
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,800
(I will nurture him diligently.)

832
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
(When he achieves mastery,)

833
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,400
(he'll bring glory
to the imperial family)

834
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,159
(and fortune to you.)

835
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,880
(I humbly request your approval.)

836
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,760
That old fool Jin Yue!

837
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,119
He refused me

838
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,639
and set his sights on

839
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,920
Huan Zong?

840
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,400
His ambitions are vicious.

841
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,280
If he achieves mastery,

842
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,360
this nation would be his.

843
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,800
I'll never permit

844
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,119
him to join Liuguang Sect.

845
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,400
Guards!

846
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,800
Pass on my decree.

847
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,559
Huan Zong, what's happening?

848
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
Someone's here.

849
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,639
They're finally making their move.

850
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,400
What?

851
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:54,720
Wait.

852
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,679
This day is inevitable.

853
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,599
Huan Zong.

854
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,240
I won't let anything happen to you.

855
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,679
Who exactly are you?

856
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,999
Why do I feel I've seen you before?

857
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:07,400
Who am I? You...

858
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,720
You'll find out later.

859
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,832
(Show No Mercy)

860
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,136
(Ancestral Temple)

861
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,199
Your Highness,

862
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,360
we'll escort you.

863
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:49,880
Huan Zong.

864
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,960
What's your plan?

865
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,679
Close your eyes.

866
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,079
What do you want?

867
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:55,920
Don't ask.

868
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:02,840
At least you'll survive.

869
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,119
Take her somewhere safe.

870
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,079
(I can't abandon my brother.)

871
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,599
Brother, where are you?

872
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,112
His Majesty summons the Crown Prince.

873
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:22,840
Resist,

874
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,440
and we'll show no mercy.

875
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,039
Brother, I'm scared.

876
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,960
Brother, where are you?

877
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,559
How's it going?

878
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,599
The Second Prince and his faction
are coming.

879
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,160
Pass on my decree.

880
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,496
The Second Prince shows no loyalty
and schemes rebellion.

881
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,360
Catch him.

882
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,119
If he resists, kill him.

883
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,760
Understood!

884
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,920
Bei Jun.

885
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,440
I don't want to go.

886
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,639
Crown Prince, don't fear.

887
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
The Second Prince

888
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,679
will come to save us.

889
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,199
I'm here, Father.

890
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,840
Brother, I'm scared.

891
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,519
Bring it on at me.

892
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,320
Let my brother go.

893
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,199
Huan Zong.

894
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,599
You defy kinship.

895
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,119
I must uphold justice and kill you.

896
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,999
You want to give in

897
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:47,960
and accept punishment,

898
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,880
or watch your brother

899
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,360
get killed?

900
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,159
Harm my brother,

901
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,159
and I'll take your life now!

902
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,039
Seize him!

903
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
The arrows are poisoned.

904
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
Protect the Crown Prince.

905
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,760
Stop the carriage!

906
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,920
What's going on?

907
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,720
Lady,

908
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,479
I was ordered to send you away.

909
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:50,679
Huan Zong.

910
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,440
Let me go.

911
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,679
Huan Zong is in danger.

912
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,119
Sorry I can't.

913
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,079
Huan Zong is in danger.

914
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,159
Let me go!

915
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,440
Let me return.

916
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,559
Kong Hou.

917
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:03,559
Calm down.

918
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,960
Think it over.

919
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
This illusion is bizarre.

920
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
If Huan Zong dies in here,

921
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:10,440
his physical body

922
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,720
may never awaken.

923
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,880
All our efforts

924
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,960
will be wasted

925
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,720
and Huan Zong will be in great danger.

926
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,159
Don't let them leave alive.

927
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,559
Your Highness.

928
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,800
Leave!

929
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,599
Bei Jun.

930
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Brother.

931
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:00,720
Brother.

932
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,599
Stop.

933
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,800
I'll deal

934
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,639
with them myself.

935
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,999
Brother, it hurts.

936
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:11,840
It's okay.

937
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,720
It's okay.

938
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:15,999
I'm here.

939
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:17,519
I'm here.

940
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,039
It's okay.

941
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,440
Brother, I'm tired.

942
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:32,519
Please stay here

943
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,440
with me.
