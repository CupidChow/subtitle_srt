16
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,068
Huan Zong?

17
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:51,749
Huan Zong.

18
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:53,708
Huan Zong.

19
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:56,908
Why are you here?

20
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,188
I was about to ask you.

21
00:01:58,188 --> 00:01:59,348
Why are you here?

22
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:00,188
I live here.

23
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:01,708
I live here too.

24
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,828
I thought

25
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,029
I wouldn't see you again

26
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:04,669
since we didn't

27
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:05,949
set a specific time or place.

28
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:07,109
Looking for me?

29
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,109
Of course.

30
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:09,189
This afternoon,

31
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,669
I left in too much of a hurry.

32
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,629
But who would've guessed

33
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,349
we actually have such fate

34
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,548
to meet here?

35
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:15,469
Wait for me.

36
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,949
I'm coming to see you right now.

37
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,308
What are you doing, Lin Hu?

38
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:44,469
Master Zong,

39
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,148
you don't actually believe

40
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:47,428
what she just said, do you?

41
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,308
She might have been
in too much of a rush

42
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,148
and forgot to set a place with me.

43
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,069
Oh, come on.

44
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:53,868
I told you.

45
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,748
If she really saw you
as a friend, she'd...

46
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:57,229
Never mind.

47
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,148
You always delude yourself anyway.

48
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:01,949
I heard that.

49
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,509
Who are you?

50
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,189
I was about to ask you the same thing.

51
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,389
Could I have been mistaken?

52
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,868
Sorry! My apologies.

53
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,229
Huan Zong. Huan Zong.

54
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:49,389
Huan Zong.

55
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:52,748
Why is it you again?

56
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,509
Lady,

57
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,028
may I ask what exactly do you want?

58
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,389
I-I'm sorry! So sorry!

59
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:56,949
Senior,

60
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:57,828
I didn't mean to.

61
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:58,708
From now on, I'll...

62
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,548
Well done, Huan Zong.

63
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,389
You actually dared to kid me.

64
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:15,109
This is absolutely hilarious!

65
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,349
That's enough.

66
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:17,589
Master Zong,

67
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,308
I was helping you vent your anger.

68
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:21,469
Do I look like I need your help?

69
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,428
Anyway,

70
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,909
even if what she said earlier

71
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,628
was all true,

72
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:25,428
her presence here

73
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,789
must be out of ulterior motives.

74
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:27,589
Besides,

75
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,829
didn't her master say

76
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:31,149
she's just using you?

77
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,308
Whether it's using or not,

78
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,029
I'll know it after meeting her.

79
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:43,829
Come in.

80
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,589
Why mess with me like this?

81
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:46,269
Huan Zong,

82
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,548
don't you want to see me?

83
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,029
Yes, I do.

84
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,068
Then why did you...

85
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,909
Could it be

86
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:55,988
that you got angry

87
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:57,229
because I left in such a hurry

88
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,748
this afternoon?

89
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,269
So you wanted to punish me?

90
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:06,469
I thought you didn't want to see me.

91
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:07,868
That's not true!

92
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,508
How could I not want to see you?

93
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,789
I really

94
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:11,829
was being too careless.

95
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,068
I was just saying earlier

96
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,308
that I was about to find you.

97
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:16,388
Come in first.

98
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:17,909
Let's talk inside.

99
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:21,909
Long time no see.

100
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,068
It's late at night.

101
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:25,029
Why does a young lady

102
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,188
like you come here?

103
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:28,589
I'm obviously here to see Huan Zong.

104
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,229
Huan Zong, listen.

105
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,349
Since leaving the mountain,

106
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,548
I've encountered so many

107
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:34,868
interesting things.

108
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,349
By the way, Huan Zong,

109
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:40,628
how are your injuries?

110
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,188
Has your martial uncle

111
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,709
collected all those spirit herbs?

112
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,909
It's not that easy.

113
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,669
If it were simple,

114
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,868
would we need to come here?

115
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:50,829
It's okay.

116
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,269
Can't rush it.

117
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:53,548
If you really

118
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:54,308
feel uncomfortable,

119
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,748
I can help you regulate your energy.

120
00:05:58,068 --> 00:05:59,589
I knew it!

121
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,349
Straight to energy regulation.

122
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,948
Did you come just to say that?

123
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,269
I know

124
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,149
you don't want to do this either.

125
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,149
But

126
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,789
with my current spiritual energy,

127
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,709
even if I wanted to help you,

128
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,308
I might not be able to do it.

129
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,428
My master feared

130
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,948
I'd be struck by thunder.

131
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:18,789
So he sealed several
of my major acupoints.

132
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:19,748
Now, I'm not

133
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:20,589
the same as before.

134
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,388
Even if I caught you,

135
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:23,388
I might not be able

136
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:24,748
to absorb spiritual energy.

137
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,789
Listen to that. She's still lying.

138
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,909
Anything else?

139
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:32,068
Anything...

140
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:34,269
Anything else?

141
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:35,628
Forget it then.

142
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,589
(Huan Zong must be having)

143
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:39,909
(a hard time finding the herbs.)

144
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,149
(That's why he looks)

145
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,149
(so upset.)

146
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,469
(I should cheer him up.)

147
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:45,868
Huan Zong. Huan Zong.

148
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:46,909
You know what?

149
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,308
The room next to mine

150
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,269
has a bird living in it.

151
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:51,068
It's super noisy.

152
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,308
Let me imitate it for you.

153
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:57,589
Alone I lie. Alone I rise.

154
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:58,669
Alone I sit.

155
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,508
Who suffers loneliness like me?

156
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,109
It even sings.

157
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,548
Isn't that fascinating?

158
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,988
They say it's a phoenix.

159
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,029
Phoenix?

160
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:11,149
A phoenix lives next to you?

161
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:11,948
Exactly!

162
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:13,149
So that means

163
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,508
the phoenix is across from us?

164
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:15,349
What?

165
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,229
You're interested in the phoenix?

166
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,109
That's no ordinary phoenix.

167
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,948
That's the Azure Phoenix!

168
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:21,669
Its feathers

169
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:22,388
are an ingredient

170
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,388
for Master's medicine.

171
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:24,948
It's a medicinal ingredient?

172
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,229
I'll go back right now

173
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:28,909
and quietly...

174
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:29,589
Enough.

175
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,388
Stop being impulsive.

176
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:32,388
No.

177
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,349
I mean

178
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:34,029
I'll negotiate

179
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,388
with it properly.

180
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,029
It keeps me awake all night.

181
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,669
What's wrong with taking some feathers?

182
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,948
Those aren't ordinary feathers.

183
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,029
Just wait for my good news.

184
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:48,669
I told you.

185
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,988
She came for energy regulation.

186
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:51,068
You don't believe me!

187
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:51,868
Huan Zong.

188
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,149
Your concealment spell works great.

189
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,149
Can you teach me?

190
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:58,188
No.

191
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:02,029
Huan Zong, please teach me.

192
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,388
Huan Zong,

193
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:04,628
teach me, please.

194
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,628
Lin Hu,

195
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:07,829
you teach her.

196
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,229
This concealment spell really works.

197
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,068
Now that I'm in a good mood,

198
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,229
the phoenix's singing

199
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,709
doesn't even feel annoying anymore.

200
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,188
Phoenix. Phoenix.

201
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,469
Azure Phoenix.

202
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:27,868
What now?

203
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,988
You've been singing all night.

204
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,189
Aren't you tired?

205
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,469
Can't I sing to relieve boredom?

206
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:36,589
If you're bored,

207
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,508
how about I chat with you?

208
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,549
Then come over here.

209
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,469
Why is there another barrier here?

210
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,148
They set it up.

211
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:04,668
I'm suffocating in confinement.

212
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:05,748
No wonder

213
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:07,508
you sing nonstop at night.

214
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:09,429
But

215
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:12,429
you look unique.

216
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,949
What good does being unique do?

217
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,668
I'm going to die soon.

218
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,189
Are you sick?

219
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:20,949
People from Zhaohan Sect
want to kill me.

220
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,508
Haven't you heard?

221
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,148
The head of Zhaohan Sect

222
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,109
loves making stuffed animals.

223
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,788
No way!

224
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,868
I did hear

225
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:33,069
that their head enjoys collecting

226
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,668
preserved plant specimens.

227
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,508
But animals...

228
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:38,988
I never expected

229
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,549
her to be so cruel.

230
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,829
Please save me.

231
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:42,709
Save me.

232
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:46,268
Well, then...

233
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:48,949
How can I break this barrier?

234
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,508
This barrier was set by Ling Bo

235
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,589
personally.

236
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,829
With a water spiritual root,

237
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:54,668
she excels at turning water into ice.

238
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:55,589
That's why the barrier

239
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,148
is like eternal frost

240
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:58,109
and indestructible.

241
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,748
Not even true fire can break through.

242
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,429
But there's one thing it fears.

243
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:05,189
What?

244
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,189
Tears.

245
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:09,349
Tears?

246
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,309
What are you trying to do?

247
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,268
I am going to bed.

248
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:16,268
Don't think I don't

249
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,309
know what you're up to.

250
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,388
We just got here,
and you're already after the maids.

251
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,148
Your intentions are really...

252
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:22,028
Master Zong,

253
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,309
you can't really be pinning

254
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,988
your hopes on Kong Hou, can you?

255
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:25,549
Do you think

256
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:26,388
she can get those

257
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:27,148
bird feathers?

258
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,788
Regardless of whether she gets them,

259
00:10:28,788 --> 00:10:30,268
you mustn't steal.

260
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,229
Okay, okay, I get it.

261
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,268
Get some rest early.

262
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,988
I'm going back to sleep.

263
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:35,949
No stealing!

264
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,109
Got it. Good night.

265
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,988
This phoenix is still just a bird.

266
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,868
It should sleep in a cage.

267
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,868
Why is there only one bed?

268
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,349
Could it be...

269
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,069
Why is it you?

270
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,549
You shameless fool!

271
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,309
First you tease my maids, and now...

272
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:31,388
I...

273
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,589
I'll kill you!

274
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:40,109
I forced these tears out
with great effort.

275
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:42,189
You'd better keep your promise.

276
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:43,908
Once you leave this barrier,

277
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:45,549
you must give me one

278
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,589
of your feathers.

279
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,709
It's fine if your strike

280
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:57,949
splits me in half.

281
00:11:57,949 --> 00:11:59,469
But if you break the table,

282
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,229
you'll have to pay.

283
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:01,469
I can afford it.

284
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:04,469
Wait, stop!

285
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:06,268
Let me explain.

286
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,028
I didn't mean

287
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:07,829
to come this late.

288
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,189
Besides, I didn't see anything.

289
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:09,829
Oh, really?

290
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,868
So you wanted to see?

291
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:11,988
You lecher!

292
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:13,388
Wait. Be reasonable, okay?

293
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:13,949
You're still

294
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:14,788
a Zhaohan Sect fairy,

295
00:12:14,788 --> 00:12:15,949
yet all you know is killing.

296
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,109
If needed, I'll let you see

297
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:17,949
me in return. Fair?

298
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,549
Shameless! You fool!

299
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:20,309
What'd you say?

300
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,109
Don't leave!

301
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,748
Give me a feather!

302
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,148
You promised

303
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,309
to give me a feather.

304
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,109
You stupid bird!

305
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,189
You broke your promise!

306
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,028
We agreed on a feather!

307
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,069
You really believed that?

308
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,028
Bye, little fool.

309
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,988
You stupid bird! Liar!

310
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:37,988
Chase it now!

311
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,429
- Yes, senior sister!
- Move, run!

312
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,589
You let it escape?

313
00:12:47,908 --> 00:12:48,788
I just got here.

314
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,069
So, it was you?

315
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:53,868
I-I didn't.

316
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,549
Kong Hou,

317
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:56,988
is this some concealment spell

318
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,469
you set up?

319
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,148
Why were you messing
with concealment spell for no reason?

320
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,868
You tricked me into going to her room.

321
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:10,549
Master Zong,

322
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:11,988
I told you we shouldn't

323
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:12,628
teach her.

324
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,469
But you insisted.

325
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,709
You taught her the spells.

326
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,069
Now you're being fooled by her.

327
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:17,429
- I was...
- How dare you say that?

328
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:21,549
You're in cahoots?

329
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,549
What "cahoots"?

330
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:23,868
I told you I just arrived.

331
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,148
Who knows whether you

332
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,309
sent him to distract me,

333
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,788
- and her for the phoenix?
- I...

334
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,028
Speak! What's your scheme?

335
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,589
W-What are you doing?

336
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,829
Ling Bo,

337
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,229
drawing weapons over nothing

338
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,109
benefits neither of us.

339
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:45,709
(His cultivation is profound.)

340
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:46,748
What right do you have

341
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:47,788
to do this to Huan Zong?

342
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:48,668
You wanted to make

343
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:49,508
the phoenix

344
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:50,868
into a specimen.

345
00:13:50,908 --> 00:13:52,429
It was begging me for help.

346
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:53,589
Don't talk nonsense.

347
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,028
The phoenix told me itself.

348
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:56,109
Are you trying to deny it?

349
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:56,788
Enough.

350
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:58,829
This matter is too strange.

351
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:00,589
If there are hidden details,

352
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,109
we hope you won't conceal them.

353
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,388
The phoenix deceived you all.

354
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,788
Our prestigious Zhaohan Sect

355
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:10,388
would never

356
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,988
commit such heinous acts.

357
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:13,268
If this were true,

358
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,709
may heaven strike me dead first.

359
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,709
(That's true.)

360
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,148
(She helped me)

361
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,589
(capture scavengers earlier.)

362
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,469
(She's probably not evil.)

363
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,388
Then why did you

364
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:23,589
capture the phoenix?

365
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,469
Mating.

366
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,349
Mating? Well...

367
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,229
Isn't that even more heinous?

368
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,628
There's only one phoenix in the world.

369
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:32,788
How would you mate it?

370
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,189
Ten years ago,

371
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,988
we found

372
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:37,429
another female in the Fufeng realm.

373
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,668
The phoenix's body holds treasures.

374
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,309
If we manage to mate it...

375
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:42,788
Wouldn't that benefit everyone?

376
00:14:42,788 --> 00:14:44,028
Why's it unwilling then?

377
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:46,628
It doesn't like that female.

378
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,349
Doesn't like...

379
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:49,229
What's so funny?

380
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:51,868
It seems to me

381
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,469
you tried to steal it and failed.

382
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:55,349
Who's stealing?

383
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,589
If you can't get it back,

384
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:57,748
I'll kill you all.

385
00:14:57,748 --> 00:14:59,028
Explain yourself properly.

386
00:14:59,028 --> 00:14:59,788
Who stole any bird?

387
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:01,388
I told you. It's medicine.

388
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:02,429
Huan Zong,

389
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:03,668
do something.

390
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:04,628
Save us.

391
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:06,229
You caused this trouble.

392
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,668
Now you want help?

393
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,628
Fine, I'll think of something.

394
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:23,028
With so many people here,

395
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:24,469
they're not being helpful.

396
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:25,628
These people

397
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:26,429
are all here

398
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,469
to flatter Zhaohan Sect.

399
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,229
They're rogue cultivators
after all. How...

400
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:30,549
What are you saying?

401
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,748
We searched all night

402
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,028
and didn't find anything.

403
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,788
How dare you gossip here?

404
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:35,668
Let's go.

405
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:45,508
You lying bird.

406
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,829
How dare you trick me?

407
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:48,589
When I catch you,

408
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,668
I'll pluck out every
last feather of yours!

409
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,309
You pissed me off the most.

410
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,868
Even a bird could fool you.

411
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,229
Yet here you are picking flowers?

412
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,469
I just wanted

413
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,189
to gather food that birds love to eat.

414
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,709
It's been starving all night.

415
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,788
It might get hungry now.

416
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:04,028
It won't eat

417
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,429
your messy offerings.

418
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,589
What does it prefer then?

419
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,508
Thank you, Ling Bo.

420
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,309
We await your guidance.

421
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,109
What makes

422
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:23,268
this fruit special?

423
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:24,628
The phoenix

424
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:25,469
is particular.

425
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,868
It only eats this spiritual fruit.

426
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:28,388
Near Qiu City,

427
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,868
it only grows here.

428
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,469
So you're implying

429
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:35,189
if it wants to keep escaping,

430
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:36,949
it needs to eat first.

431
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:38,589
So it won't go far right now?

432
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:39,309
Exactly.

433
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,148
Let's split up and search.

434
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:42,709
You,

435
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:44,868
come with me.

436
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:46,268
Until we find the phoenix,

437
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:47,469
stay within my sight.

438
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:48,589
Why me?

439
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,829
Wait.

440
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,109
Aside from being picky,

441
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,309
any other habits?

442
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,229
It's lustful.

443
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,268
Go.

444
00:16:59,268 --> 00:16:59,988
I...

445
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:05,228
Huan Zong,

446
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,708
the bird's lustful.

447
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,349
I heard that.

448
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,029
Why emphasize that?

449
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:20,349
Huan Zong,

450
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,029
what's wrong with you?

451
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,309
Did I upset you somehow?

452
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:25,908
The phoenix's claw marks.

453
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,309
It means it was here recently.

454
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,309
You got clues on my face?

455
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:39,948
No.

456
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,069
Then stop distracting my search.

457
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,029
Is it because I didn't send

458
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,029
a messenger talisman

459
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:50,349
and you got angry?

460
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,109
No.

461
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,069
Look.

462
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,269
You're doing that thing again,

463
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,349
grunting single-word replies.

464
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,509
Let me explain.

465
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,948
I didn't send messenger talismans

466
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,589
because all my messenger talismans

467
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,228
slipped into the river.

468
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:05,309
Into the river?

469
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:06,109
Yes.

470
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,789
The wind was raging that day,

471
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,269
blowing all my messenger talismans

472
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,148
straight into the current.

473
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:14,109
Liar.

474
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,228
I'm not lying.

475
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,148
You're angry.

476
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:23,829
I'm furious too!

477
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,269
Someone promised to contact me,

478
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:27,109
but guess what?

479
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,109
No messages at all.

480
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,868
Someone made grand vows

481
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,468
that if anything happens,

482
00:18:31,468 --> 00:18:33,029
he would just message me.

483
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:33,908
Turns out

484
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,109
it was all empty words.

485
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:37,428
I did send messages.

486
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,589
Then why didn't I get them?

487
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,309
When did you send them?

488
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,829
I'm not lying.

489
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,069
I never received anything.

490
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:50,388
What's going on?

491
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,708
This makes no sense.

492
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,428
Ask yourself that.

493
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,549
Maybe they were also

494
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,549
blown into the river

495
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,468
like your talismans.

496
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:01,428
Never mind.

497
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,029
Let Huan Zong

498
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,109
cool down first.

499
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:07,628
Ridiculous!

500
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:08,589
You

501
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,029
got outsmarted by Kong Hou?

502
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,388
Ling Bo,

503
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,948
haven't you heard?

504
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:15,029
Good swimmers drown,

505
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,989
and big ships sink in puddles.

506
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,188
I almost thought

507
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,589
I'd see the Azure Phoenix.

508
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:21,989
You confessed it yourself.

509
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:23,509
I knew you coveted the phoenix

510
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:24,388
with ill intentions.

511
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,029
You flirted with Yue He first,

512
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:28,908
and then broke into my chambers.

513
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:30,708
No.

514
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:31,948
I've explained to you.

515
00:19:31,948 --> 00:19:32,829
My feelings for you

516
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,749
contain no improper thoughts whatsoever.

517
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:35,549
You mustn't...

518
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:51,468
There's a bird over there.

519
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:52,428
It seems

520
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,029
to be in a foul mood.

521
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:55,668
Does it have expressions?

522
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,349
How can you tell it's in a foul mood?

523
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,868
I learned a bit

524
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,269
of spiritual beast art

525
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:01,309
from Master Pei Huai.

526
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,989
How about we go ask it?

527
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:06,989
How do we ask?

528
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:12,069
Just try.

529
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,749
Did you happen to see

530
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,228
a phoenix yesterday?

531
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:22,309
It looked rather peculiar.

532
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,228
If you get the message,
please answer me.

533
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:34,228
Yes, it was here.

534
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,468
It fooled me and ran off

535
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,668
after breaking my heart.

536
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:42,549
That phoenix is truly lustful.

537
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,109
Yesterday, it sweet-talked

538
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,269
this poor female bird.

539
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,309
Now it's long gone.

540
00:20:48,468 --> 00:20:49,829
You understand bird language too?

541
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,549
I certainly don't.

542
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,428
But I have this treasure.

543
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,349
Master Pei Huai gave it to me.

544
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,549
I can communicate
with normal spiritual beasts

545
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,468
and birds through it.

546
00:20:58,468 --> 00:20:59,468
If you like it,

547
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,269
I'll give it to you.

548
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:01,349
None of that matters.

549
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:02,789
The bird doesn't matter either.

550
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,989
What matters now is finding the phoenix.

551
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,989
Have you heard the saying

552
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:13,029
"Lust clouds judgment"?

553
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:15,749
Why are you pulling me?

554
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:16,349
Let go.

555
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,749
Do you think I want to pull you?

556
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:19,829
You were about to fall.

557
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:21,228
You're the one who pulled me.

558
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:24,309
You're so annoying.

559
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,188
You're calling me annoying?

560
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:27,309
I'm the annoyed one here!

561
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:28,188
Don't you dare

562
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,029
get me wrong.

563
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,708
People may think

564
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,708
I did something to you.

565
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,509
Don't you dare think

566
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:32,388
I want to do anything

567
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:32,908
or like you.

568
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,868
- I...
- Let me tell you. I don't...

569
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:46,188
You're a demon cultivator?

570
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:47,948
What's wrong with that?

571
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:48,868
Nothing.

572
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:49,989
It's just that I

573
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,029
have always despised
demon cultivators most.

574
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,789
You're weaker than a demon cultivator.

575
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:54,948
- How infuriating is that?
- You...

576
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:11,509
Huan Zong, look.

577
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,228
Will this really work?

578
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,829
Of course.

579
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,188
Look at this head, this body

580
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,309
and these claws.

581
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,668
Doesn't it resemble
a charming female bird?

582
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,829
Relax and watch.

583
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:25,109
It'll definitely attract

584
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:26,309
that phoenix.

585
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:28,309
Then I'll wait and see.

586
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,468
There's an extra flower here.

587
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,388
Should I show you another trick?

588
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,188
You've known me for so long.

589
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,948
I'm much stronger now than before.

590
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,668
Turn into a butterfly.

591
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:47,109
Where's the butterfly?

592
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:50,069
L-Let me check.

593
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,349
Could it be

594
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:53,468
I chanted the wrong spell?

595
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:54,668
No way.

596
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,468
W-What...

597
00:22:58,148 --> 00:22:59,029
Bee!

598
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:11,989
Let me tell you again.

599
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:14,549
I don't know why,

600
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,948
but I truly didn't receive

601
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,349
your message talisman.

602
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,789
I didn't ignore you on purpose.

603
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,148
Then can you get up and talk properly?

604
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:23,829
But I've always wanted

605
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:24,789
to talk to you properly.

606
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,109
You ignored me first.

607
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,749
This position works fine too.

608
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:28,989
At least you'll behave.

609
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:31,829
You are already injured,

610
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:33,549
yet you still

611
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,628
get so angry.

612
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:37,148
Aren't you worsening your condition?

613
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:38,908
I asked you to regulate energy.

614
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:40,188
But you refused to do that.

615
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:41,388
Take care

616
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,388
of yourself properly.

617
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,708
So you won't make me worry.

618
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,908
Are you that eager
to regulate energy with me?

619
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,309
Of course!

620
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,948
I've seen you before,

621
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:52,708
suffering alone while regulating energy.

622
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,069
But

623
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,789
even if it's painful,

624
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,148
you still refuse
to regulate energy with me.

625
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,269
Fine, if you don't want
to do that, then don't.

626
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,269
Anyway, my master

627
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,948
already sealed my acupoints.

628
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:04,868
Even if I wanted to,

629
00:24:04,868 --> 00:24:06,628
I might not be able to do that.

630
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:07,269
Your master

631
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,948
really sealed your acupoints?

632
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:09,789
Yes.

633
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,509
He said if not,

634
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,069
he wouldn't let me leave the mountain.

635
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:14,188
But it's fine.

636
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,549
We can work together.

637
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:16,948
Let's collect all those

638
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:18,428
medicinal ingredients.

639
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,868
You're not mad at me now?

640
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,148
Could you stop pinning me down?

641
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:26,069
Oh, right.

642
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:28,029
Let's find that phoenix now.

643
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,668
Its feathers are too precious to ignore.

644
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:36,908
Since you're a demon cultivator,
smell this.

645
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,109
Isn't it the bowl

646
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,029
of that phoenix?

647
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,948
Why make me smell it?

648
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,789
I left in a hurry

649
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:46,789
without hunting dogs.

650
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:47,749
Your nose

651
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:49,148
should work just as well.

652
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:52,829
Anyway,

653
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:54,228
this phoenix is a demon.

654
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,989
It's hidden its aura since leaving.

655
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,668
Even if I could detect it,

656
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,269
I wouldn't help you.

657
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:02,269
You think the phoenix

658
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,388
is an idiot?

659
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,309
Even if it didn't hide its aura,

660
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:06,228
all your perfumes

661
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:07,989
along the way

662
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:09,228
would have masked it all.

663
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:11,228
Even if I want, I can't detect it.

664
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:13,789
You...

665
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:14,789
What are you doing?

666
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:15,708
Are you serious?

667
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:16,668
What?

668
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:17,428
Stay still.

669
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:59,468
Blossoms swaying, willows bending.

670
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:03,349
Dewdrops falling, peonies blooming.

671
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:08,109
Bees sip honey, hearts...

672
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,228
Are you sure the bird likes this song?

673
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:14,309
We're luring the bird into our trap.

674
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,589
Naturally, we cater to its preferences.

675
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,468
Where did you learn all this?

676
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:21,228
From Master Writer's storybooks.

677
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:22,388
Practical application.

678
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,468
I don't think

679
00:26:23,468 --> 00:26:24,829
he would approve of this.

680
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,628
Why hasn't the phoenix come yet?

681
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,509
Could it be

682
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:35,789
it thinks my song is too direct?

683
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:38,668
That can't be.

684
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:44,428
One tilts her cloud-like hair,

685
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:48,789
heedless of the falling hairpin.

686
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:51,549
Was this line also written
by Master Writer?

687
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:53,388
Of course not.

688
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,509
This was written by his rival.

689
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,029
He has rivals?

690
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:06,309
Master Zong.

691
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:24,668
Come into my treasure pouch now.

692
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:27,589
Got it!

693
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:28,789
Got it! We got it!

694
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,468
Now that we've caught the phoenix,

695
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:32,708
let's all

696
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:33,349
play a game

697
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:34,388
to relax.

698
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,948
I'll demonstrate or describe something,

699
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:39,428
and you all guess what it is.

700
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:40,708
Huan Zong, you join too.

701
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:41,668
Alright.

702
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:44,148
Okay, starting now.

703
00:27:44,188 --> 00:27:44,948
First question.

704
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:48,789
- The phoenix.
- The phoenix.

705
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:49,789
Twirling lotus pose!

706
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,069
Phoenix! Phoenix!

707
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:51,868
Right? Am I right?

708
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:53,309
Correct! Second question.

709
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,208
This one...

710
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,069
- Snowy owl!
- Is it a snowy owl?

711
00:27:59,069 --> 00:27:59,628
Snowy owl.

712
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:03,589
A word.

713
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:06,269
Why leave?

714
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:06,989
What's going on?

715
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,428
I knew something was wrong.

716
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:13,148
You reveal it?

717
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:14,349
About me.

718
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:15,349
You told them?

719
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:16,708
What is it?

720
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,428
Well...

721
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,989
About that day when you...

722
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:22,708
Stop talking.

723
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:25,549
I keep my promises.

724
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,148
How could I possibly reveal it?

725
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:28,749
So your final question earlier

726
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:29,708
was not about that?

727
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:31,549
That last question earlier?

728
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:32,989
The answer was a snowy owl.

729
00:28:32,989 --> 00:28:33,868
Didn't everyone get

730
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:34,789
the answer already?

731
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:37,029
I meant the sound you mimic

732
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,428
with those spiritual fruits.

733
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:39,668
The call of a snowy owl

734
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:40,468
sounds like that.

735
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:42,948
Alright.

736
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:45,309
The Azure Phoenix is rare.

737
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,628
Once I escort the phoenix

738
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:47,628
back to the inn,

739
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:48,829
I'll give you a feather.

740
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:50,708
Really?

741
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,069
That's awesome!

742
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:52,908
Only one feather.

743
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:54,029
Don't push your luck.

744
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:54,948
Alright, alright!

745
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,349
One feather.

746
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:57,789
One will suffice.

747
00:28:58,749 --> 00:28:59,829
Why are you here?

748
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:02,668
Master Zong sensed
someone following you,

749
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:03,668
so he came to check

750
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:04,628
for your safety.

751
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:06,188
What were you discussing merrily?

752
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:07,069
Nothing.

753
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,069
Tell us.

754
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:08,829
It's nothing.

755
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:09,789
Look.

756
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:12,228
Someone broke

757
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:12,908
my mechanism.

758
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:14,549
My feather!

759
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:22,908
Ling Bo.

760
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,829
This...

761
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,188
What's wrong?

762
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,029
What's happening?

763
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,908
Why is everyone...

764
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,908
It's a sedative.

765
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:28,589
Even we

766
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:29,549
can barely hold on.

767
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:30,549
How can you, a beginner,

768
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:31,749
appear completely unaffected?

769
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:32,428
Before leaving,

770
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,549
my master gave me

771
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:34,388
a special elixir

772
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:35,829
that makes me immune to all poisons.

773
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:37,589
I thought he was lying.

774
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,349
It's you?

775
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:52,829
You hid your cultivation level.

776
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,228
You're above Nascent Soul.

777
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,188
Who are you?

778
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:00,589
Lin Hu, Kong Hou.

779
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:01,628
Stay here.

780
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:02,349
I'll chase him.

781
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:03,228
- Wait!
- I'll go with you!

782
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:14,908
Don't let him escape!

783
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:21,428
You bird thief!

784
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,069
(Frost Poison?)

785
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,029
(No other choice.)

786
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:32,908
(I must cure her now.)

787
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:33,948
Forgive my intrusion.

788
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:54,080
(Guests Feel At Home,
Guests Flock Like Clouds)

789
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,069
Huan Zong. Huan Zong.

790
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:07,069
You're awake.

791
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,989
Huan Zong, where's the phoenix?

792
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:13,948
Ling Bo promised me

793
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:15,029
that once we catch it,

794
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:16,309
she'd give me a feather.

795
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,948
You want its feather so much?

796
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:20,829
Of course!

797
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:21,789
It's an ingredient

798
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:22,829
in your medicine formula.

799
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:23,549
Huan Zong.

800
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:24,868
How is it?

801
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:26,228
Did you catch the phoenix?

802
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:28,309
Yes.

803
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,708
Here it is.

804
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:31,789
Ling Bo sent it over

805
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,668
after we got here.

806
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,109
That's good.

807
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:43,789
Kong Hou.

808
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:44,789
Though I helped you

809
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:46,188
clear the frost poison,

810
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:47,668
your cultivation is weak.

811
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:49,388
You need time to recuperate.

812
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,148
Also, let me remind you.

813
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,188
You've just left the sect.

814
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:55,069
These dark cultivators are cunning,

815
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:56,309
full of wicked schemes.

816
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:58,269
You need to be more vigilant next time.

817
00:31:58,269 --> 00:31:59,549
Don't let your guard down

818
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,269
and charge ahead recklessly.

819
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,509
Understood.

820
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:18,749
Let me make this clear first.

821
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:20,309
That was an emergency.

822
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,069
So I did that.

823
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,029
I-I know.

824
00:32:23,468 --> 00:32:25,948
But that was my first kiss.

825
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:27,069
Are you kidding me?

826
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,309
It was just a brief touch.

827
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,388
Just a brief touch?

828
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:31,188
We...

829
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:32,749
My lips hurt.

830
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:33,668
How could I draw it out

831
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:34,549
without force?

832
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:35,468
Besides,

833
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:37,668
if you went to a physician
while injured,

834
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:38,269
he'd

835
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,549
remove your clothing. Then...

836
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:40,989
Stop talking!

837
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,549
You poisoned people

838
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,228
and stole Zhaohan Sect's phoenix.

839
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:55,628
You used despicable methods

840
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:56,668
and acted rampantly.

841
00:32:56,868 --> 00:32:58,509
Speak! Who are you really?

842
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,789
Why steal the phoenix?

843
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:01,628
Stop laughing!

844
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,948
I don't have time to waste.

845
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,428
If you confess now,

846
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:05,749
I might spare your life.

847
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:06,628
The crowd outside

848
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:08,029
are those you've wronged.

849
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:09,589
If I throw you out there,

850
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:10,468
they'll pummel you,

851
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,708
making your death miserable.

852
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,148
Why go through the hassle?

853
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,109
This.

854
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:18,148
This.

855
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,549
Recognize this?

856
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:21,349
Luanfeng Peak

857
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:23,069
has certain methods
for dark cultivators.

858
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,428
I'm sure you've heard the stories.

859
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,948
Now that you're

860
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,309
in Zhaohan Sect's custody.

861
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,388
Ling Bo is graciously

862
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:30,749
offering you a chance.

863
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,388
If you cooperate fully,

864
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,829
we'll keep this civilized.

865
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:35,549
If you refuse to cooperate,

866
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:38,428
we'll handle it our way.

867
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,468
You won't like our methods.

868
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:51,668
By the way,

869
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,668
why are you so calm?

870
00:33:56,628 --> 00:33:58,549
Do you kiss people often?

871
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:59,908
Of course not!

872
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:03,989
So that was your first time too?

873
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:14,268
You're already this old,

874
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:16,109
and it was your first kiss?

875
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:18,788
Oh, please.

876
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:19,869
You should rest more.

877
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:20,949
Get some proper rest.

878
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,188
Huan Zong,

879
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:24,429
let me ask you.

880
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:25,708
Have you ever

881
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,909
been with someone before?

882
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:29,909
Why ask that?

883
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:31,989
I-I'm just curious.

884
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,949
Curiosity.

885
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,429
Curious?

886
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:35,628
I won't tell you.

887
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:38,469
Then you haven't.

888
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,509
You hadn't kissed.

889
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:42,429
Not kissing doesn't mean anything, okay?

890
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,668
People who truly love each other

891
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,909
always kiss.

892
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:50,509
An expert now?

893
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,989
I read it in storybooks.

894
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,469
Master Writer's books

895
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,429
don't mention that.

896
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:55,748
I meant those

897
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,748
romance storybooks.

898
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:59,069
Those stories clearly say

899
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:00,869
when true lovers

900
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:01,668
meet each other,

901
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:03,308
their hearts race,

902
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:04,069
and then

903
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,549
they long to kiss.

904
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:06,949
Such storybooks

905
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:07,869
mislead people.

906
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,268
You should discard them.

907
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:12,148
Maybe one day,

908
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,949
you might crave them yourself.

909
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:15,308
Actually, I...

910
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:16,188
I am...

911
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:19,148
What?

912
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:22,909
Don't.

913
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:24,109
What's wrong with him?

914
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:27,109
What happened?

915
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,228
Useless trash.

916
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:34,909
Can't even steal a phoenix.

917
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,469
Where's that cultivator?

918
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,029
Wasn't he locked up here earlier?

919
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,509
It's a puppet.

920
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:14,828
He self-destructed just now.

921
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:15,869
That's how he ended up.

922
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:17,509
I never expected

923
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:19,429
this guy was actually a puppet.

924
00:36:19,828 --> 00:36:20,549
But

925
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,429
how could anyone

926
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,668
turn a living person

927
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:24,268
into a puppet?

928
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:25,869
That's utterly cruel.

929
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:27,429
Must be dark cultivators' doing.

930
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,268
If they'd stolen the phoenix, fine.

931
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:30,389
But failing that,

932
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,148
they just crushed him
to destroy evidence.

933
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:41,069
Brother,

934
00:36:41,188 --> 00:36:42,869
the Lord will return soon.

935
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:44,949
Without the Azure Phoenix,

936
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:47,069
what should we do in the future?

937
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:49,308
Naturally, we must prepare

938
00:36:49,828 --> 00:36:51,668
other grand gifts for the Lord.

939
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:57,748
I just reported the situation
to the sect.

940
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,469
They should soon

941
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:00,069
find leads.

942
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,308
Strangely enough,

943
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:05,869
do you think those puppets

944
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:07,148
self-destructed for no reason?

945
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:10,228
I'm wondering

946
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,109
what these dark cultivators really want.

947
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:14,828
The trail ends here.

948
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,549
With Jiusu dead,

949
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,148
who knows what the dark cultivators

950
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,188
are so arrogant about.

951
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:21,109
Better safe than sorry.

952
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:22,949
Yes.

953
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:24,228
It seems this journey

954
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,389
won't be peaceful.

955
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:27,708
Finding the medicine first.

956
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,308
You may leave now.

957
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:30,188
Yes.

958
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,148
Ling Bo.

959
00:37:38,828 --> 00:37:39,989
As you instructed,

960
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,228
we've sent messages

961
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,589
about the incident to the sect.

962
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:43,869
The Azure Phoenix carriage

963
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:44,828
is ready.

964
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,029
We can depart anytime.

965
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:46,708
Good.

966
00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:48,708
With dark cultivators
appearing suddenly,

967
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,188
be extra cautious on the road.

968
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:51,188
Don't let other sects

969
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,549
look down on our Zhaohan Sect.

970
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:53,389
Understood.

971
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:01,069
Thank you for what happened

972
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:01,748
yesterday.

973
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:05,708
So you know how to say thank you.

974
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,188
What's so funny?

975
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:18,909
Nothing.

976
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:19,949
I just think

977
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,828
after such a major incident yesterday,

978
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:22,989
you can still

979
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:24,628
maintain such grandeur

980
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,389
and such grace today.

981
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,549
It is impressive.

982
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:28,668
Look at you,

983
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:30,148
so clueless about the world.

984
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:32,469
This is the bearing of a major sect.

985
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:33,429
Okay.

986
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:35,188
Ling Bo, the fairy
with a major sect bearing,

987
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:35,828
farewell.

988
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:37,429
Hope we never meet again.

989
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:39,469
Let's go.

990
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,389
Someone outside, right?

991
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:51,069
