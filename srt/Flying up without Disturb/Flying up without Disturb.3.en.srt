=Episode 3=

16
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,419
Young Master.

17
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,619
Young Master.

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,459
Didn't you

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,300
just take medicine?

20
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,539
Why are you taking it again?

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,860
The medicine

22
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,660
isn't working?

23
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,380
I'll tell Master.

24
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,459
He must have a solution.

25
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,020
Don't disturb Master.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,699
But...

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,220
I'll feel better soon.

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,819
This makes no sense.

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,060
Luanfeng Peak brims
with spiritual energy.

30
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,900
Why do I feel worse

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,340
after meditating?

32
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,100
Could it be that only she...?

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,620
Right!

34
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,660
Dress.

35
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,539
(It's Liuguang Sect again?)

36
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,100
(It's haunting me!)

37
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,699
All packed up?

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,259
Master.

39
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,380
It's all set now.

40
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,460
I'll set off

41
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,900
tomorrow morning.

42
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,699
Leaving in such a hurry?

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,940
Master.

44
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,940
I don't want to leave.

45
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,819
If so,

46
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,660
stay and keep me company.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,100
Master!

48
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,940
I'm just kidding.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,739
I understand

50
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,699
you need to see
Lingyou Realm's splendor,

51
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:32,739
experience customs,

52
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,739
make friends,

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,500
and observe

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,620
how other sects operate.

55
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,340
This will temper your character

56
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,500
and aid your cultivation.

57
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,019
But before you depart,

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,819
I have two crucial suggestions

59
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:48,739
for you.

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
First,

61
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,019
when traveling,

62
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,220
never overextend yourself.

63
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
If you can't win,

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,620
fleeing is the wisest choice.

65
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,979
Understood. I'll flee when needed.

66
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,139
Second,

67
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,100
the most vital suggestion.

68
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,139
Come.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,060
Sit here.

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,460
To prevent you from recklessly

71
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,340
absorbing spiritual energy outside,

72
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:19,340
I must

73
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,299
seal key acupoints in your body.

74
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,820
Must you, Master?

75
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,299
If you refuse,

76
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,340
how could I let you

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,780
venture out unprepared?

78
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,499
Besides, who else would shield you

79
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,820
from thunder strikes
like me and your senior brothers?

80
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,379
I see.

81
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,340
I agree.

82
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,700
They know Kong Hou attracts lightning,

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,299
yet those Liuguang Sect members

84
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,379
still stubbornly

85
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,220
cling to her shamelessly!

86
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,820
Well...

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,979
Don't lay a finger

88
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:08,939
on Kong Hou!

89
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,456
(Tian Yuan)

90
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,939
Young Master.

91
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,299
Kong Hou

92
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,539
hasn't answered your message?

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,100
Do you think

94
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,340
something happened to her?

95
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,100
What could happen to her?

96
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,939
Young Master.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,979
You should focus on

98
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,260
healing your injury.

99
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,140
If not for her,

100
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,900
with your strength,

101
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,379
you wouldn't have been hurt by Jiusu.

102
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,619
If your injury isn't treated,

103
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,820
it'll hinder your ascension.

104
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,780
Then...

105
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,100
Well...

106
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,260
Never mind.

107
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,820
I was joking.

108
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,419
Young Master. Don't take it seriously.

109
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,820
But you're right.

110
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,419
Given her temperament,

111
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,499
she might cause trouble

112
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:06,859
within the sect.

113
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,419
Oh please!

114
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,140
You're clearly worried about her.

115
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,660
I first met her

116
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,460
in the Forbidden Forest of Yunhua Sect.

117
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,460
Within her sect territory.

118
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,539
But the Yunhua Sect

119
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,460
must have multiple dangerous areas.

120
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,859
Young Master.

121
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,419
Have you even been listening to me?

122
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,340
Enough.

123
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,499
You go check Yunhua Sect now.

124
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,660
I go to Yunhua Sect?

125
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:28,859
Why...

126
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,020
Why should I?

127
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,979
Go check

128
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,619
if she returned safely.

129
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:33,580
Wait,

130
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,739
she might've just been

131
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:36,539
too busy to reply to your message.

132
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,499
Or she's hanging out

133
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,619
and forgets to respond.

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,299
I'll go.

135
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,736
(Yunhua Sect)

136
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,660
It's time to say goodbye.

137
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,619
Off you go.

138
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,179
Oh, Kong Hou.

139
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:04,820
Master.

140
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
I've already taught you

141
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,539
how to use these magical tools before.

142
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,140
Remember it well.

143
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,299
If danger comes,

144
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,499
protect yourself at all costs.

145
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,660
I'll remember, Master.

146
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,539
Good.

147
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,780
That's good.

148
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:22,739
Kong Hou.

149
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,979
Kong Hou.

150
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,979
Tan Feng.

151
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:25,499
Ling Hui.

152
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,179
Kong Hou.

153
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,700
Kong Hou.

154
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,660
We pooled these spirit stones for you.

155
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:30,499
Take them.

156
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,820
This is so touching!

157
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,820
Kong Hou is still so young.

158
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,539
How could you

159
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:36,739
let her go on a solo journey?

160
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:38,780
What if she gets hurt?

161
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,859
Kong Hou.

162
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,820
When I earn enough spirit stones,
I'll come find you.

163
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:43,660
Deal.

164
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,739
Take care of yourself, Kong Hou.

165
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,460
Send us messages often.

166
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,900
Don't worry.

167
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,100
I definitely will.

168
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,460
It's getting late.

169
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Time to depart.

170
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,020
Master.

171
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,859
I'm leaving now.

172
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,900
Ouch!

173
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,780
It hurts!

174
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,820
Liuguang Sect's techniques.

175
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:28,260
What are you to Liuguang Sect?

176
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:28,780
Senior.

177
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm Lin Hu from Liuguang Sect,

178
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,419
sent by my young master

179
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,899
to find Kong Hou.

180
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,580
Ouch!

181
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,580
Your young master?

182
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,460
The one Kong Hou met
in the Forbidden Forest?

183
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,540
Yes, exactly!

184
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,060
Ouch!

185
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,940
Alright.

186
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,460
Ease up!

187
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,019
I haven't even gone looking for you,

188
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,820
yet you dare show up here.

189
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:45,700
Exactly!

190
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,499
Looking for us?

191
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:47,220
Why?

192
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,180
Let me make this clear.

193
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,899
Kong Hou has left for her journey.

194
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,420
Stop bothering her!

195
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,060
She has left?

196
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,820
One more thing,

197
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,100
don't even

198
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,460
mention your young master again!

199
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,619
I haven't met him yet,

200
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:58,420
but if I do,

201
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,820
I'll definitely punch him!

202
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,779
Senior,

203
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,460
don't think you can bully us

204
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:03,580
just because you're old!

205
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,379
My young master

206
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,540
is concerned about Kong Hou,

207
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,139
so he sent me to check on her.

208
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,019
He's concerned?

209
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,259
Why didn't he come then?

210
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:10,060
Sending you instead?

211
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,580
I...

212
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,379
And you keep

213
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,100
calling him "young master."

214
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,779
Who is he at Liuguang Sect?

215
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:16,659
How arrogant he is!

216
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,499
He won't even tell us his name.

217
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:19,499
I...

218
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,739
Don't say anything.

219
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,499
Are you spouting nonsense,

220
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,700
pretending to be from Liuguang Sect?

221
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,540
Old man, stop your nonsense!

222
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,460
Our Liuguang Sect

223
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,580
would never do such things.

224
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,139
I can't say my young master's name

225
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,739
because...

226
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:31,899
Because of what?

227
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:32,779
Because...

228
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,659
I just can't say it!

229
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,220
Never mind.

230
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,899
You don't need to explain.

231
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,619
I'm going to teach you a lesson
right now!

232
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,979
Old man, you hit me!

233
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,659
Listen up!

234
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,499
The reason

235
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,460
Kong Hou was

236
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,940
with your young master

237
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,580
was simply

238
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,139
to enhance her spiritual energy

239
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,259
and awaken her natal weapon.

240
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,859
She wanted to leave sooner.

241
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,300
And now she's already

242
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
gone for her trials!

243
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,379
Why would she
need your young master now?

244
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,100
Who do you think you are?

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,019
Don't think
your young master is delightful.

246
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,965
(Tian Yuan)

247
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,499
You're back.

248
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,859
How did it go?

249
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,739
Why are you looking down?

250
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:28,739
I'm talking to you.

251
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,340
Young Master, I was beaten up!

252
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:35,540
Her master got mad

253
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,619
when he heard you sent me.

254
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,619
She left for her trials,

255
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,700
and her master beat me.

256
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,100
How can you still

257
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,619
focus on writing books?

258
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,420
This proves

259
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,659
her cultivation has improved.

260
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,580
Good news.

261
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,899
Her wish is fulfilled.

262
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Young Master, this is urgent!

263
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,739
Why are you still worrying about her?

264
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,859
We've been deceived!

265
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,379
What nonsense!

266
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,540
It's true!

267
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,139
I swear!

268
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:00,460
Her master said it himself!

269
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,379
Listen up!

270
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:02,820
The reason

271
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,259
Kong Hou was with your young master

272
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:05,979
was simply

273
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,820
to enhance her spiritual energy

274
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,659
and awaken her natal weapon.

275
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:10,979
I initially thought

276
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,739
she helped you regulate energy

277
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,180
for your health,

278
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,540
but now I realize

279
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:16,739
she just wanted you

280
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,499
to help her
enhance her spiritual energy.

281
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,139
(It's alright. As long as she's safe.)

282
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
(Then it's time for me to depart.)

283
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,528
(Yuan City)

284
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,300
He is dead!

285
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:35,779
He's dead!

286
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,779
Dead!

287
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,379
Dead!

288
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,499
What happened up ahead?

289
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:40,659
Make way!

290
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:41,379
Let me through!

291
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,499
Look, he's dead!

292
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:54,779
Let's go take a look.

293
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,300
What did he eat earlier?

294
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,820
This is it.

295
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
Just burdock root.

296
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,100
We ate this all the time as kids.

297
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,540
Never had problems.

298
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,820
Burdock root? Nonsense!

299
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,180
This is toxic wood!

300
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,340
Though similar to burdock root,

301
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,379
it's highly poisonous.

302
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,180
Poisonous!

303
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,060
If mortals eat this,

304
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,659
toxins will rage through their veins.

305
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,700
They will die.

306
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:23,979
It's surprising

307
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,859
to find someone here who knows this.

308
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,180
Just know a little about it.

309
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,580
Young Master.

310
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,139
Isn't he dead?

311
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,259
You don't understand.

312
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:33,460
If I can extract

313
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,619
the toxins from his body,

314
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,700
he can be revived.

315
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:36,979
You can extract the toxins?

316
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,460
I've never heard

317
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,779
that cultivators and healers

318
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:40,899
can do such things.

319
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,100
Young Master.

320
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,300
Why is this guy so cryptic?

321
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,619
I think he's probably

322
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,460
locating the poison

323
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,619
through acupoint analysis.

324
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:52,420
You guessed right.

325
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,100
He's alive!

326
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,899
He's alive!

327
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,060
What an amazing physician!

328
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,979
Very impressive.

329
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,139
Thank you, sir.

330
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,019
Thank you, sir.

331
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,100
Everyone, disperse now.

332
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,540
What an amazing physician!

333
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:09,820
Senior, please wait!

334
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,100
Let's go.

335
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,700
What can I do for you?

336
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,859
I've traveled
through Lingyou Realm for years

337
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,420
and seen many things.

338
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:19,979
But I've never seen

339
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,779
such unfathomable medical skills.

340
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,899
Indeed.

341
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,979
May we have your name?

342
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:26,060
It's our honor to know you.

343
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,019
My name

344
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,019
carries weight.

345
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,979
A mere Nascent Soul cultivator

346
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:31,859
isn't worthy to ask.

347
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:32,899
What?

348
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
You can actually
discern my cultivation level?

349
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,700
Speak your purpose quickly.

350
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm severely injured.

351
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:41,659
I beg for your healing.

352
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,739
I can't even

353
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,019
perceive his cultivation level.

354
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,259
I won't treat you.

355
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,859
Old man.

356
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,220
This guy is really...

357
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,300
Young Master.

358
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:08,820
You mean

359
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,139
that old man

360
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:11,340
is Master Huang Qi?

361
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,899
In today's Lingyou Realm,

362
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,139
the only one

363
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,580
whose medical skills are that incredible

364
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,060
must be him.

365
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
Then why did he

366
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,739
refuse to treat you?

367
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,019
How should I know?

368
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:26,580
Look,

369
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,259
that old man won't treat you.

370
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,379
Kong Hou won't help you

371
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:30,580
with your energy regulation.

372
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,779
What do we do now?

373
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,100
Who's there?

374
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:38,420
What a coincidence!

375
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,540
It really is you guys.

376
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,859
Why is it you again?

377
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:41,940
I overheard you seeking

378
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,700
Master Huang Qi.

379
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,300
Is it because your poison

380
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,019
still lingers?

381
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,460
Let me take you to see him.

382
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,340
Master Huang Qi

383
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,940
refused to treat me.

384
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,940
That old man was utterly arrogant.

385
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,499
He just refused directly.

386
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,060
He won't treat you?

387
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,940
But don't worry.

388
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,739
I've got a plan.

389
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,100
I'll take you there.

390
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,300
What's wrong today?

391
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,580
Seeing all these

392
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,180
little trinkets around,

393
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,379
you don't even want to buy.

394
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,460
Actually, I just...

395
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,300
Master, what's wrong?

396
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,139
Having stomach issues again?

397
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:16,979
Master.

398
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,820
You've got a run all day.

399
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,060
Let's find a physician.

400
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:23,060
Just diarrhea.

401
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,259
No need to see physicians.

402
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,300
Later, I'll get some pills

403
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,019
from Huang Qi.

404
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:26,540
I'll be fine.

405
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,300
Huang Qi?

406
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,100
Wait.

407
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,220
What now?

408
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,060
Huang Qi?

409
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
The so-called greatest physician,

410
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,499
Master Huang Qi?

411
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:35,019
Greatest Physician?

412
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,019
My foot!

413
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,060
He's just

414
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,220
a cranky old man.

415
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,779
That's all.

416
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,859
Wait.

417
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,779
- What now?
- Master.

418
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,100
I've heard rumors

419
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,259
that Master Huang Qi

420
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,820
enjoys traveling widely.

421
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,739
His whereabouts are elusive.

422
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:48,700
How do you know

423
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,700
where he lives?

424
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,739
I saw him just days ago.

425
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,580
He's been wandering around Yuan City.

426
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,379
I arranged his accommodations myself.

427
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,859
You have a way?

428
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,499
What's your plan?

429
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:00,899
However,

430
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,940
it is

431
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,820
getting dark now.

432
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:03,859
Master Huang Qi

433
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,220
has an eccentric temperament.

434
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:05,979
If we visit him

435
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,499
in the dead of night,

436
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,540
we might anger him.

437
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,580
That'd be unfortunate.

438
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,899
Is trusting me so difficult?

439
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,139
I genuinely have a way

440
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:19,820
to meet Master Huang Qi.

441
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,859
Come with me tomorrow,

442
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:22,899
and you'll know yourself.

443
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:48,460
Hot.

444
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,659
No need to rush.

445
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,139
We won't take yours.

446
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:00,739
Want some?

447
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
It's delicious.

448
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,100
Eat while it's hot.

449
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,979
In your mouth,

450
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:05,379
it'll melt instantly.

451
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,859
I'm fasting.

452
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:08,699
Oh right.

453
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,859
I forgot.

454
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,980
Want some?

455
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,060
No need.

456
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,780
Thank you.

457
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:14,780
I'm also fasting.

458
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,020
By the way,

459
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,219
after knowing you this long,

460
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:18,780
I still don't

461
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,899
know your name.

462
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,540
I'm...

463
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm Huan Zong.

464
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,699
Huan Zong.

465
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:36,219
That's a lovely name.

466
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,699
Enough.

467
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:38,899
We're not that close.

468
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,100
Don't try to approach me.

469
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,540
Go eat over there.

470
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,020
I'm going to meditate.

471
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,820
What are you doing?

472
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,899
I just...

473
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,260
Don't be nervous.

474
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,780
I noticed you're injured.

475
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,580
Lean on my shoulder

476
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,100
to rest.

477
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,899
It'll be comfy.

478
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,580
Don't tell me you suspect

479
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,419
I'll try to regulate your energy

480
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,179
while you're asleep?

481
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,859
Relax.

482
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,780
Our clothes separate us.

483
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,340
I can't absorb your energy.

484
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,659
Direct skin contact
is required for that.

485
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,179
Never mind.

486
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,580
I won't touch you.

487
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,939
I'll just sit here.

488
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
I'm full.

489
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,300
Going to sleep now.

490
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,459
Huan Zong, wake up!

491
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,340
Something's happening.

492
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:03,300
What is it?

493
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,619
Look over there!

494
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,699
Blue Silver Flowers!

495
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,419
I thought

496
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:26,619
it was some fearsome beast.

497
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,020
Just some flowers?

498
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,980
The glowing blue field

499
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,020
looks rather beautiful.

500
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,020
Not fast enough.

501
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:44,859
Again.

502
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,300
Not fast enough.

503
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,459
Still not fast enough.

504
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,020
Listen well.

505
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,699
If your sword strikes

506
00:20:58,939 --> 00:20:59,859
aren't faster

507
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,139
than these flowers' death rate,

508
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:02,820
no rest for you.

509
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,379
Why did it stop glowing?

510
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,139
Their blooming period is brief.

511
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,100
It only lasts minutes.

512
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,419
Nothing special to see.

513
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,260
But it's quite wonderful.

514
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,219
Are you kidding me?

515
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,540
Do you have to dress up
before seeing an old man?

516
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,980
You'll find out why later.

517
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:52,704
(Huang Qi Residence)

518
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,659
Master, do you enjoy the massage?

519
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,219
Master, do you enjoy the massage?

520
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:10,659
You must be Master Huang Qi, right?

521
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
No.

522
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't speak to me.

523
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,432
Old man.

524
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:17,179
You're dressed like Huang Qi herbs.
Yet you're not Master Huang Qi?

525
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:18,060
Nobody believes that.

526
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,899
You...

527
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:27,540
Thank you.

528
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,576
(I don't save handsome men.)

529
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,899
What's so funny?

530
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,859
It's a bit exaggerated.

531
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,740
My master once told me

532
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,859
that Master Huang Qi
has a peculiar temper.

533
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
He especially detests handsome men.

534
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,859
Someone as good-looking as Huan Zong

535
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,419
would definitely displease him.

536
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,899
However,

537
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,580
someone adorable like me

538
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,139
is welcomed everywhere.

539
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,980
I'm Kong Hou from Yunhua Sect.

540
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,619
Greetings, Master Huang Qi.

541
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,419
You're Kong Hou?

542
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,179
You know me?

543
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:25,419
Wang Tong mentioned you.

544
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:27,740
You are indeed quite adorable.

545
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,500
Master, you're very famous.

546
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,580
Ever since I was young,

547
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,419
I've heard

548
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:39,260
about your countless life-saving deeds.

549
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:39,859
They say

550
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:40,619
any patients

551
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:42,859
who are gravely ill

552
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,699
will recover

553
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,340
after your treatment.

554
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:46,419
Therefore,

555
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:47,899
I'd like to ask you

556
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,179
to treat my friend.

557
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,459
Flattery won't work.

558
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,100
No way.

559
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,780
I won't save him.

560
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,939
No way.

561
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:54,300
I won't save him.

562
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,139
No way.

563
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,540
- No way.
- Master!

564
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,379
No way.

565
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,260
No way.

566
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,820
Master.

567
00:23:58,859 --> 00:23:59,939
Please treat him.

568
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,580
I won't save him.

569
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:03,300
Please save him, Master.

570
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,899
Master, just examine him once.

571
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,980
Saving a life

572
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,419
is a truly noble act.

573
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:08,500
Look at how young he is,

574
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,419
yet he is gravely ill.

575
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,780
He hasn't even married yet.

576
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,780
What a pity!

577
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,340
Don't be fooled by his good appearance

578
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,260
and rosy complexion.

579
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,340
It's all a facade.

580
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,219
Truthfully,

581
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,500
his vitality's nearly exhausted.

582
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,899
Please save him.

583
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:20,300
Master.

584
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,379
Stop babbling.

585
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,659
You're young

586
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:23,619
yet so talkative.

587
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:25,300
How can you be so thick-skinned?

588
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,619
When traveling,

589
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:29,699
thin skin won't get you far.

590
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,419
Master.

591
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,219
We admire your medical prowess

592
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,419
and traveled great distances

593
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,939
just to have you

594
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,100
examine him once.

595
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,419
No matter what you say,

596
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,659
I won't save him.

597
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,060
Master.

598
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,379
How can you be like this?

599
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,659
You can be handsome,

600
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,179
but others can't be good-looking?

601
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,020
You think

602
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,379
I'm handsome?

603
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,580
Of course, you are!

604
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:04,939
Throughout the entire Lingyou Realm,

605
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:06,219
you are

606
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,540
the most handsome person.

607
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,020
Even Master Wang Tong

608
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,459
comes after you in looks.

609
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,939
Let alone Huan Zong.

610
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Don't you agree?

611
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:15,540
Wang Tong

612
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,379
can't hold a candle to me.

613
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:19,740
Considering you are

614
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,939
his disciple,

615
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,379
I'll grant your request.

616
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,619
However,

617
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:26,820
you must

618
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,619
meet one condition.

619
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:30,820
What is it?

620
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,619
Hey, give me a hand.

621
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,260
Lately, I've been

622
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,060
developing a new medicinal formula.

623
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,300
But it's missing one crucial

624
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,899
catalyst ingredient.

625
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,419
If you can find it for me,

626
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:51,219
not many needed,

627
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
just one,

628
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,020
then I'll treat him.

629
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
What's this precious ingredient?

630
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,419
It's exceptionally rare

631
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,100
to see it.

632
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Many physicians

633
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,179
never encounter it
in their entire lives.

634
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:25,980
It's called...

635
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,419
Blue Silver Flower?

636
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,100
How did you know its name?

637
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,780
Not only do I know the name,

638
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,100
I've got plenty!

639
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,100
This flower smells rather nice.

640
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,020
I'll pick some for Ling Hui

641
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
to make scented powder.

642
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,780
Is it edible?

643
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:51,899
The fragrance is delightful.

644
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,899
I can

645
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:54,820
make flower pastries with it.

646
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,340
How do you have so many?

647
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:13,219
Well?

648
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:14,020
Is this enough?

649
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:15,500
- Sure!
- I'd like to keep some

650
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,580
for Ling Hui.

651
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:17,619
It's sufficient!

652
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:18,540
From now on,

653
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,219
if you are ill,

654
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,540
just come to find me.

655
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,699
Kong Hou is impressive.

656
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,619
You said your name was Huan Zong.

657
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,300
But in Lingyou Realm,

658
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,100
only Master Zhong Xi of Liuguang Sect

659
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:55,300
possesses such profound cultivation.

660
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,780
To be frank,

661
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:58,300
I'm Zhong Xi.

662
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,699
Well...

663
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:12,899
Please speak directly.

664
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,939
After the poison
damaged your spiritual core

665
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,659
and you activated spiritual energy,

666
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,859
your current condition

667
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:20,980
is extremely perilous.

668
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,659
Yet your complexion suggests

669
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,780
you've consumed

670
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
some medicine
stabilizing your spiritual core.

671
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,659
That day at the sect,

672
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,699
my master gave me a vial

673
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:31,820
of pills you made

674
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,619
to temporarily suppress the toxins.

675
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,219
This elixir

676
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,260
can boost your energy.

677
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,100
At best,

678
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:42,899
it could only

679
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:44,139
alleviate your pain.

680
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,899
When I was injured,

681
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:47,580
Kong Hou

682
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,020
helped me regulate my energy.

683
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,500
Energy regulation?

684
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,100
Your spiritual core is damaged.

685
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,379
What good does that do?

686
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,699
After her energy regulation,

687
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
I felt better.

688
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,619
But I had a relapse.

689
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,179
When Lin Hu attempted energy regulation,

690
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:06,500
it proved ineffective.

691
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,939
I initially suspected

692
00:29:09,699 --> 00:29:10,980
she wanted to drain

693
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,939
my spiritual energy.

694
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,659
I see.

695
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,179
The one who was in Harmony Sync

696
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:18,659
with Kong Hou

697
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,300
is you.

698
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,859
What's Harmony Sync?

699
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,780
A rare cultivation state

700
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,340
requiring perfect alignment.

701
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:29,699
Two destined individuals,

702
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,340
merely through contact,

703
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,340
can absorb ambient spiritual energy.

704
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,419
But with your high cultivation level,

705
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:36,820
such meager spiritual energy

706
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,740
went unnoticed by you.

707
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:40,699
Destined individuals?

708
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,100
What defines that?

709
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,899
The Harmony Sync

710
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,740
remains obscure to most.

711
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,619
I only read a little

712
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,780
in an ancient book

713
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
by chance.

714
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,340
Perhaps

715
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:53,659
no one in this world

716
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,179
will ever know how profound it is.

717
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,459
In this world,

718
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:59,419
there exist no two other people

719
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,980
who could reach that cultivation level.

720
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:03,859
I simply never imagined

721
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,899
the Harmony Sync would also serve

722
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,260
to stabilize your spiritual core.

723
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:09,100
(So, that's how it is.)

724
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:12,580
May I ask another question?

725
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,179
How did you know Kong Hou

726
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,379
and I could reach that level?

727
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,100
It was Kong Hou's master

728
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,859
who told me.

729
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,060
That day,

730
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,300
he sensed something weird

731
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,820
and sent me a message.

732
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,419
But Kong Hou

733
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,659
is not strong mentally.

734
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,139
After that, her spiritual energy surged.

735
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:33,619
She endured three thunder strikes.

736
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,219
During her trial,

737
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,419
had they not protected her,

738
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,859
Kong Hou wouldn't have survived.

739
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:42,020
(So that's what happened.)

740
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,939
I now understand

741
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:46,020
the root of Kong Hou's condition.

742
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:48,179
From this day forth,

743
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,699
I shall never again

744
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:50,980
let her regulate my energy.

745
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,859
I possess

746
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,699
excellent medical books.

747
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,540
I need to study them thoroughly

748
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,459
to devise a method

749
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,060
to heal your spiritual core.

750
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,980
Stay here while I'm in retreat

751
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:09,179
for ten days.

752
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,139
By the way,

753
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,580
since you have nothing else to do,

754
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,300
tend to the field

755
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,939
outside my herb garden.

756
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,899
Clear the weeds,

757
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:19,260
so I may plant herbs later.

758
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,179
Rest assured,

759
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,580
we'll complete the task.

760
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,580
Master Huang Qi

761
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,899
must be a lazybones.

762
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,340
This field is full of weeds.

763
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:41,020
He's never cleared them, has he?

764
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,899
We need his help.

765
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,340
Doing chores is reasonable.

766
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,500
But my back's breaking.

767
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,340
I can't even stand straight.

768
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,659
No one's rushing you.

769
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:49,699
Take your time.

770
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,020
I have an idea

771
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,260
to clear all weeds

772
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,619
without manual labor.

773
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:56,980
We won't need to toil.

774
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:58,780
What is it?

775
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:12,740
Watch.

776
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,820
Problem solved.

777
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,060
Within an hour,

778
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,899
we'll be finished.

779
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,899
Truly, within an hour.

780
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:25,899
The paddy field

781
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,500
can be burning?

782
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,020
Who told you

783
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,139
water prevents fires?

784
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:30,939
You used true fire, right?

785
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,859
Well,

786
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,340
how could I know?

787
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,580
That was a tiny flame

788
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,540
from Elder Qiu Shuang

789
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,100
for forging.

790
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:39,060
The true fire differs completely

791
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,219
from earthly fire.

792
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:42,980
What do we do now?

793
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,419
Huan Zong, think of something!

794
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:45,340
No solution.

795
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,080
Well,

796
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,020
when Master Huang Qi walks out

797
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,379
and sees his field

798
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:50,300
burnt out,

799
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,020
he might refuse to help you.

800
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,699
It's alright then.

801
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,619
I'll find out another way.

802
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,540
I can't believe it.

803
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,699
There's no food

804
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,100
anywhere!

805
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,060
These cultivators

806
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,419
develop a bad habit of fasting.

807
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,260
I'm starving!

808
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm starving.

809
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,100
(However,)

810
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:48,540
(before a permanent cure,)

811
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,939
(without Kong Hou's help)

812
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,820
(with stabilizing your spiritual core,)

813
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,740
(you will have a relapse.)

814
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,139
(I can teach you)

815
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:58,060
(how to suppress it
through self-regulation.)

816
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,540
(But you will)

817
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,260
(feel a lot of pain.)

818
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:04,540
(You must consider carefully.)

819
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,779
Huan Zong.

820
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:21,779
Are you alright?

821
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,819
Huan Zong.

822
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,580
Huan Zong.

823
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,580
Huan Zong, I'm coming in.

824
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,739
Get out.

825
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,540
Let me check on you inside.

826
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,219
Huan Zong, I'm coming in!

827
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,619
Huan Zong.

828
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:41,860
What's happening to you?

829
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,860
Is it serious?

830
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,940
Let me help.

831
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,580
(Kong Hou wouldn't have survived.)

832
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,299
Leave.

833
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,540
I won't go.

834
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,659
Let me help.

835
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,339
Huan Zong.

836
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:53,699
Huan Zong.

837
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,259
Huan Zong.

838
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,339
Let me in!

839
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,460
Wait!

840
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,020
Lin Hu, wait a moment!

841
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,179
What's wrong with your young master?

842
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:10,299
He didn't let me in.

843
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,580
What exactly happened?

844
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,500
Speak!

845
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,299
Master Huang Qi said

846
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,739
my young master's illness

847
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,420
hasn't fully healed yet.

848
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,900
It could relapse at any moment.

849
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,299
Helping him regulate energy

850
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,219
may attract thunder strikes to you.

851
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,100
So he has to

852
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,380
regulate his energy himself.

853
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,659
Meanwhile,

854
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,179
he will feel a lot of pain.

855
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:32,739
Has his condition

856
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:34,339
worsened this much?

857
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,619
What do we do now?

858
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,779
Well...

859
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,299
Kong Hou.

860
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,659
Huan Zong.

861
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,380
Huan Zong, open the door!

862
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,179
Huan Zong.

863
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,739
I need to see you.

864
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,779
Huan Zong.

865
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,980
Huan Zong.

866
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,619
Huan Zong.

867
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,020
Huan Zong.

868
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,339
Huan Zong.

869
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,299
Huan Zong.

870
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,139
Why didn't you tell me?

871
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,699
Answer me!

872
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:32,420
Why keep this from me?

873
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:34,259
Because I'm fine.

874
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,739
Huan Zong.

875
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,339
Let me help.

876
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,699
Remember what your master

877
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:39,540
taught you?

878
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,580
I remember.

879
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:41,819
But now you...

880
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:42,619
No.

881
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,699
Why can't we try?

882
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,420
After I help regulate your energy,

883
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,299
you can help improve my cultivation.

884
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,860
Once my mental power improves,

885
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,259
everything will be fine.

886
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,900
Even if three thunder strikes

887
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,460
come down,

888
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,020
you'll be there to block them, right?

889
00:36:56,139 --> 00:36:57,819
You'll shield me then,

890
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,580
okay?

891
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,139
It's too risky

892
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,779
for both of us.

893
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:14,619
Huan Zong.

894
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,100
Nobody knows what will happen to me.

895
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:18,819
Don't you realize your current state...

896
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:23,779
Your present condition matters most!

897
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,299
Instead of worrying about future me,

898
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:27,139
focus on your current condition!

899
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:30,580
I said I'm fine.

900
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,619
You are fine?

901
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:36,020
You always claim you're fine.

902
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,540
You really see yourself

903
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,020
as an indestructible sword

904
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:41,020
for vanquishing demons
and upholding justice?

905
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,420
That is

906
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:50,699
my duty.

907
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:52,900
Huan Zong,

908
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,179
you're a living person,

909
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,659
not a blade,

910
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,819
not a sword,

911
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,299
nor a weapon!

912
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,460
For the last time,

913
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,819
this doesn't concern you.

914
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,819
How could it not concern me?
How could I not care about you?

915
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,100
- We're friends.
- Ten days later,

916
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,900
Huang Qi will finish his retreat.

917
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,299
Then, you and I

918
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:19,619
will go our separate ways.

919
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,699
Let's part ways here.

920
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,580
Fine.

921
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:26,699
Whatever.

922
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,020
I don't care.

923
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:30,259
Ten days later,

924
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,699
let's part ways.
