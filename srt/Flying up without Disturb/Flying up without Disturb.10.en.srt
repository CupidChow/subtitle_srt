(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

17
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:10,241
Why does everything
require spirit stones?

18
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,241
Madam, please.

19
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:11,882
Please.

20
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:17,042
I still think that one's better.

21
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:18,402
Truly nice.

22
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,122
Look, that one's good.

23
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,122
How could there be a barrier here?

24
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,681
It seems it's the real Jiao Tong.

25
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,081
Jiao Tong,

26
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,402
I'm here to meet you.

27
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,722
Please open the door.

28
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:42,961
Come in.

29
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:11,081
Jiao Tong?

30
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,241
Jiao Tong?

31
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,241
Jiao Tong,

32
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:26,081
haven't you got up yet?

33
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,042
Come in, Madam.

34
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:31,722
Perhaps

35
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,921
you should put some clothes on first.

36
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,562
Catching cold would be unfortunate.

37
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,882
How intriguing.

38
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,442
Madam.

39
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,562
Jiao Tong?

40
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,602
You're really young and accomplished.

41
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,321
Despite your youth,

42
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,202
you visit Jiao Tong Pavilion

43
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:20,762
with such lavish generosity.

44
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,962
It's truly my honor.

45
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,321
No, no.

46
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:25,962
The honor is entirely mine.

47
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,361
But Jiao Tong,

48
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,522
please just call me Kong Hou.

49
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,441
I'm not a Madam.

50
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:32,722
I obtained this token

51
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:33,681
from a lady

52
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:34,602
in exchange.

53
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,282
I merely assisted her briefly,

54
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,241
and she gifted me

55
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:38,042
this token.

56
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,481
I see.

57
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,121
It matters not.

58
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,681
All visitors are welcome guests.

59
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,082
I shall ensure

60
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,361
you leave fully satisfied.

61
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,921
Well, actually,

62
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,722
I came

63
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,202
to ask for your help.

64
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:53,001
No rush.

65
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:54,602
We have plenty of time.

66
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:55,801
Let us sit

67
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,522
and discuss in detail.

68
00:04:58,762 --> 00:04:59,402
Okay.

69
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,602
Finest qin master in the land?

70
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,522
Jiao Tong Pavilion seems ordinary to me.

71
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:05,722
Good thing you didn't go.

72
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,241
Who knows

73
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,241
what would've happened.

74
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,001
Why say that

75
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:08,962
at such a time?

76
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,921
Don't worry.

77
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:10,881
Kong Hou will be fine.

78
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:11,762
With her quick wit,

79
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:12,561
you needn't worry.

80
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:15,522
A toast to you first.

81
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:18,241
May you retain your youth forever

82
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,602
and have endless good fortune.

83
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,762
Your skin

84
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,282
is so soft and flawless.

85
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,842
It's really enviable.

86
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:36,642
Right?

87
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,082
This snow cream was crafted

88
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:39,361
by Senior Ling Hui.

89
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,881
Jiao Tong, do you like it?

90
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,361
Shall I give you some?

91
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:43,121
I've brought it.

92
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,642
But what I desire

93
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,561
may not be just the snow cream.

94
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:52,962
And...

95
00:05:58,402 --> 00:05:59,602
Jiao Tong,

96
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:00,801
what do you like?

97
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,921
I've brought various delicacies

98
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,121
and entertainments galore.

99
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,441
I'll get you one of everything.

100
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:07,121
Your generosity shines bright.

101
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,202
However,

102
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:09,801
as you've come seeking diversion here,

103
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,881
it's only proper

104
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,801
I ensure your complete satisfaction.

105
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:16,042
How could I accept your gifts?

106
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,681
Come on. Another toast to you.

107
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,522
You just mentioned

108
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:31,962
you came to ask for my help.

109
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:33,842
What is it?

110
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,402
Here's the thing.

111
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:41,962
This is my natal spiritual tool,

112
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,121
phoenix-headed konghou.

113
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:43,962
Yet regrettably,

114
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,402
I still can't make it resonate.

115
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,522
I heard you are

116
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:47,881
a master of musical arts.

117
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:48,801
So

118
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,921
I want to ask for your help.

119
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,801
Please

120
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:51,881
instruct me.

121
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,241
Please.

122
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:00,402
My expertise lies
in the scorched-tail guqin.

123
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:03,162
As for phoenix-headed konghou...

124
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,481
You don't know

125
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,561
how to play the konghou?

126
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,842
Not exactly.

127
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,722
I have some basic knowledge
of the konghou.

128
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:21,522
You scared me.

129
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:23,001
That's perfect then!

130
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:28,082
To awaken your natal spiritual tool,

131
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,762
spiritual resonance is crucial,

132
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,441
but first and foremost,

133
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,082
your musical skills must be proficient.

134
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:37,321
Musical skills...

135
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:39,241
I'll teach you.

136
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,962
Come on.

137
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,762
Come.

138
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:52,481
Let's try.

139
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,042
Your slender fingers

140
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,762
with rounded fingertips

141
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:11,001
are perfect for plucking the strings.

142
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:13,202
No need to rush.

143
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:19,801
Take your time.

144
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:23,642
Second,

145
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,561
if no one else is around

146
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,082
and you are with Jiao Tong

147
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,241
in a room alone,

148
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,441
don't let him get close to you.

149
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,042
Well, Jiao Tong.

150
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,561
Maybe you demonstrate first?

151
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,321
I'll observe from here.

152
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,122
Very well.

153
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,321
Though your konghou is exquisite,

154
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,002
as this is my first attempt,

155
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,441
some adjustments may be needed.

156
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,642
Why not wait a moment,

157
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,002
and let me fetch my personal instrument?

158
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,122
Okay.

159
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:33,081
That really scared me.

160
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:35,321
This man

161
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,721
acts so strangely.

162
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:39,561
It's just playing qin,

163
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,362
yet he keeps breathing near my ear.

164
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,042
Is there something wrong with him?

165
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,242
My lady,

166
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,762
I'm truly sorry.

167
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:53,961
I forgot

168
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:54,882
that yesterday

169
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:56,122
I lent my konghou

170
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,681
to Xi Tang.

171
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:58,841
Then

172
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:00,482
let's go find him now.

173
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,042
Xi Tang isn't in Yi City today.

174
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:04,681
He'll return tomorrow.

175
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:05,961
Perhaps

176
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,242
you could

177
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,002
stay here tonight,

178
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,921
and I'll personally instruct you

179
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,282
after their return tomorrow.

180
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,482
No need, really.

181
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,242
I'll come tomorrow then.

182
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:16,081
That's fine.

183
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:18,601
Then I'm sorry.

184
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:27,801
To express my regret,

185
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,482
allow me to offer another toast to you.

186
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,642
No need for formalities.

187
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:34,402
Cheers.

188
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:52,482
My lady,

189
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,402
please try Yi City's specialties.

190
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,522
Now that you mention it,

191
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,642
I won't be polite.

192
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:59,961
I am rather hungry now.

193
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,242
This is our honey lotus root.

194
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,482
(What's wrong?)

195
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,441
(The spiritual infusion)

196
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,841
(should have taken effect by now.)

197
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,282
(But she...)

198
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:17,042
(Was the dosage insufficient?)

199
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:29,402
Meeting you has been

200
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,642
a most fortunate encounter.

201
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,841
Another toast to you!

202
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,441
Once you leave your cup,

203
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,721
don't drink from it again.

204
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,002
Jiao Tong,

205
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,002
why do I suddenly feel

206
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,122
so cold?

207
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,482
What's causing this?

208
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,561
Is there a draft here?

209
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,042
My deepest apologies for this lapse.

210
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,362
Please wait a moment.

211
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,081
(I would like to see)

212
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,321
(if Huan Zong was right.)

213
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:03,002
(If you really dared to poison me,)

214
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,362
(you'll pay for this.)

215
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,762
Come on, Jiao Tong.

216
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:14,201
Cheers.

217
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,441
You drink well.

218
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:41,122
How about another cup?

219
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,561
Sure!

220
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,282
Huan Zong was right.

221
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,841
You're truly suspicious!

222
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,642
Your face...

223
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:21,122
My face...

224
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,042
Hey, girl!

225
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,122
It's you!

226
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:28,042
You switched the wine cups.

227
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:30,762
Why did you poison the wine?

228
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:31,961
What do you want?

229
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,362
What do I want?

230
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,601
What do I want?

231
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:42,642
I'll peel your pretty face off.

232
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:45,961
How's that?

233
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:53,201
Help!

234
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:00,841
Someone, help!

235
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,642
Let's see how far you can get!

236
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:42,681
Stay back!

237
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,282
Give me back my face!

238
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:49,721
Kong Hou,

239
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,042
how are you?

240
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,002
Huan Zong, I'm fine.

241
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,601
Look, Jiao Tong.

242
00:14:58,601 --> 00:14:59,522
Look at his face.

243
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,002
He attacked me just now.

244
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:01,841
It was him!

245
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,801
Let me take you back first.

246
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,321
Lin Hu will deal with him.

247
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,162
Let's go.

248
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,642
Got it. Leave him to me.

249
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:26,762
No.

250
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,642
Just now, Jiao Tong's face

251
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,961
was about to split open.

252
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:31,282
I must go back and see

253
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:32,482
what he truly looks like.

254
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:33,882
No.

255
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:37,081
W-Why?

256
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:41,522
Because...

257
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:43,162
I'm injured.

258
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:44,961
Where are you injured?

259
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:45,921
Show me.

260
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:46,762
Are you okay?

261
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:47,522
Maybe it's because

262
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,362
I used spiritual energy earlier.

263
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:50,882
My chest hurts.

264
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:51,642
Chest?

265
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:52,561
My leg also aches.

266
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,441
Leg?

267
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:54,561
My head feels fuzzy.

268
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:55,561
What should we do?

269
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:57,482
Then maybe we should go back first?

270
00:15:58,882 --> 00:15:59,642
Let's go back.

271
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:00,642
Help me up, please?

272
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:01,441
Okay.

273
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,362
My head...

274
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,162
Slowly.

275
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,482
I was fine earlier.

276
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:08,122
So you're Jiao Tong?

277
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:09,242
Turn your head.

278
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,561
Let me see

279
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:11,961
how handsome you really are.

280
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,601
It's you?

281
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,482
How could it be you?

282
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,721
I never imagined

283
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:54,801
we'd meet again

284
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,681
like this.

285
00:16:58,681 --> 00:16:59,321
You...

286
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,841
Why are you still doing this?

287
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:08,242
So

288
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,242
you will kill me?

289
00:17:26,282 --> 00:17:27,242
Huan Zong.

290
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,682
Huan Zong, are you alright?

291
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:31,042
Huan Zong,

292
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,361
you used spiritual energy

293
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,161
just now, right?

294
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,482
Should I regulate your energy?

295
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:36,522
It's fine.

296
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,601
Just some energy blockage.

297
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:40,002
What should we do?

298
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:44,641
Maybe

299
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,722
pat my back?

300
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,682
Okay, I'll try.

301
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:49,762
Come, sit.

302
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,482
Does this feel better?

303
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,002
Much better.

304
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:20,682
Kong Hou,

305
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:24,922
I shouldn't have

306
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:26,202
let you go alone today.

307
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:28,722
It was not your fault.

308
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:29,442
Besides,

309
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,841
if you hadn't warned me

310
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,121
in advance,

311
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:33,641
I might have fallen for it.

312
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,042
You have no idea

313
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:36,601
how Jiao Tong acted.

314
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,242
After downing a cup of wine,

315
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,282
his entire face started peeling off.

316
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,561
That scared me half to death.

317
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,321
That's not what I meant.

318
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,202
I mean

319
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:58,762
I won't let you...

320
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,442
I mean

321
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,321
from now on,

322
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:15,442
you mustn't stay alone
in a room with any man.

323
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:16,641
Even if you do,

324
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,561
never let him get close to you.

325
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:19,482
Understand?

326
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:21,121
But right now,

327
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,682
aren't we sharing this very room?

328
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,762
Are you saying

329
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,361
this shouldn't be allowed, either?

330
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,722
I see now.

331
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:37,401
I'll follow your instructions

332
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,482
in the future.

333
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,081
If I must be alone

334
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,321
with a man,

335
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,922
I'll maintain proper distance.

336
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:44,722
We're different.

337
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:47,762
How are we any different?

338
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:50,242
It's just...

339
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:55,121
Just different.

340
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,042
Huan Zong,

341
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,482
I was teasing you.

342
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,161
We

343
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,801
are very, very good friends.

344
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,401
Of course, we can stay together.

345
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:07,321
Moreover,

346
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:08,561
whenever

347
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,801
I'm with you,

348
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,561
I feel completely at ease.

349
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:17,841
We

350
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,601
are just good friends?

351
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:27,442
Huan Zong.

352
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:30,321
Huan Zong?

353
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:34,762
Why is your face so red?

354
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:44,442
Are you angry

355
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:46,242
because I teased you just now?

356
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:48,962
No.

357
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:50,002
Then why

358
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:51,401
is your face so flushed?

359
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:54,881
I won't joke with you anymore,

360
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,801
is that better?

361
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:13,498
(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

362
00:21:16,202 --> 00:21:16,762
Who's there?

363
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:17,641
Show yourself!

364
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,321
Don't kill me.

365
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:20,242
Don't kill me.

366
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,242
I'm just a servant here.

367
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:28,561
I won't kill you.

368
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,361
What happened here?

369
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:31,361
Just now,

370
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:32,401
Jiao Tong

371
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,522
fought with someone.

372
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:35,361
His face was terrifying,

373
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,002
all peeling off.

374
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:39,202
I never thought he'd harm people.

375
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,922
He even took that lady.

376
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:41,722
Lady?

377
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:42,881
Where was she taken?

378
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,482
Two young masters

379
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,161
saved her.

380
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:48,121
What about Jiao Tong?

381
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,522
I don't know.

382
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:50,641
I saw it with my own eyes.

383
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:52,841
I truly know nothing anyway.

384
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:54,962
It was the newly arrived young master

385
00:21:54,962 --> 00:21:55,841
who let him escape.

386
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,922
Let him escape?

387
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:12,561
Stop pacing.

388
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,601
Jiao Tong's nothing special.

389
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,841
Lin Hu can handle him.

390
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:18,282
Then why isn't he back yet?

391
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:20,081
Sit down for a game.

392
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:21,361
Wait for him calmly.

393
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:23,282
Fine.

394
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,002
I'll show you how to lose.

395
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:43,801
Your way of playing

396
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,002
is rather unique.

397
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:46,482
Of course.

398
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:51,081
Okay.

399
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,601
Huan Zong, I've won.

400
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:00,962
How's this a win?

401
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:02,841
One, two, three, four, five.

402
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:03,762
Five in a row.

403
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:04,922
This means I win.

404
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:06,682
Aren't we playing Go?

405
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,442
You didn't specify earlier.

406
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:12,922
Cheating, are you?

407
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:14,282
I won't stoop to your level.

408
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,682
You accuse me of cheating,

409
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:18,682
yet you never mentioned

410
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:19,601
that I didn't blame you

411
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:20,482
for not telling me

412
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,881
you are Master Writer.

413
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:23,522
What's there

414
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:24,722
to hide about?

415
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:26,482
You are Master Writer,

416
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:29,121
such a brilliant storybook writer.

417
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:30,922
Brilliant?

418
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,321
Except for you,

419
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:35,242
no one reads my books anyway.

420
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,641
I get it.

421
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,321
So you kept it from me

422
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:40,641
because no one buys your books,

423
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,601
and you

424
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:42,962
feel ashamed,

425
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:43,641
right?

426
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:46,682
Young Master.

427
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,042
Lin Hu, you're back.

428
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:52,482
Young Master.

429
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:53,722
It has been settled.

430
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:54,682
Considering

431
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:55,641
we're both foxes,

432
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,202
please leave its corpse intact.

433
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:58,321
Foxes?

434
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,361
So Lin Hu, you're a demon cultivator?

435
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:01,801
What's wrong?

436
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,522
You won't be like those people

437
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:05,161
who would harm demon cultivators, right?

438
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,682
What did they do?

439
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,762
Holding prejudice?

440
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,722
Demon and human cultivators,

441
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:11,922
as long as they're righteous,

442
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:12,841
to me,

443
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:14,042
they're all the same.

444
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,002
Besides,

445
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,801
demon cultivation
is extremely difficult.

446
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,682
So, it's impressive.

447
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:19,482
Really?

448
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:21,881
Thank you.

449
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:22,762
But

450
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,522
since you're a demon cultivator,

451
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:25,601
how did you

452
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:26,922
know Huan Zong?

453
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,922
Isn't Liuguang Sect...

454
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:30,242
That's enough.

455
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:31,361
Why so many questions?

456
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,002
Master Zong, I'll take my leave.

457
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:12,482
You're truly hideous-looking.

458
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:14,161
Who said that?

459
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,641
How are you improving

460
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:37,522
so quickly now?

461
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,042
You are just too inept.

462
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,881
You've secretly learned
from Master, right?

463
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:44,682
No.

464
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:46,801
Then that means

465
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:48,242
you found your cultivation partner,

466
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:48,742
right?

467
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,321
It's not that easy to find one.

468
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:51,361
I merely

469
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:52,881
captured a few female cultivators.

470
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:54,841
The dual cultivation

471
00:25:55,002 --> 00:25:56,321
is actually quite fascinating.

472
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:57,641
What?

473
00:25:58,282 --> 00:25:59,482
Female cultivators?

474
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:01,641
What? Angry with me?

475
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,841
Next time, I'll definitely take you.

476
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:07,161
What?

477
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:09,801
Female cultivators?

478
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,081
Actually, what he did wasn't wrong,

479
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,722
right?

480
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:24,762
We've all

481
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:26,361
taken human form recently.

482
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:27,722
This method

483
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,042
helps enhance our cultivation.

484
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,881
I've seen many demon cultivators

485
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,801
who did the same thing

486
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:33,841
to facilitate cultivation.

487
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:34,601
I...

488
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,522
I could do that too, couldn't I?

489
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,641
Such intense sword energy.

490
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:44,682
Why are you copying me?

491
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:47,561
I want to be like you.

492
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,401
You can't be like me.

493
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,722
You're a demon cultivator.

494
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:53,282
What's wrong with that?

495
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:54,561
Look down on demon cultivators?

496
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,762
Even as a demon cultivator,

497
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,282
you shouldn't casually steal

498
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:00,282
others' achievements.

499
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,401
If you truly want to be like me,

500
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:04,881
everything must be achieved

501
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:05,881
through your own efforts.

502
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:06,801
Understand?

503
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,401
Lin Hu, where are you?

504
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:39,762
Come drink with me.

505
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:44,161
Young Master,

506
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:45,361
do you have

507
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,522
anything to say?

508
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:47,601
No.

509
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:49,641
Just drinking alone
makes me feel lonely.

510
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:51,161
I wanted your company.

511
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:54,722
I...

512
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:55,641
No need to explain.

513
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,841
I trust you,

514
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:59,002
and the cultivation path you've chosen.

515
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,161
Never mind. Don't come.

516
00:29:07,522 --> 00:29:09,482
Huan Zong, what are you
doing at this hour?

517
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,202
Drinking?

518
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,522
Didn't you say you're fasting
and won't drink?

519
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,242
Just occasionally.
A small amount won't hurt.

520
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:19,762
Then why didn't you invite me?

521
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:20,762
I want some too.

522
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,002
Trust me?

523
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:36,081
Useless fool.

524
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,242
You couldn't even handle

525
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,121
such a simple task.

526
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:42,641
Master, I am incompetent.

527
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:44,282
I failed to make proper arrangements.

528
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,002
But don't worry.

529
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:46,881
As long as they

530
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:47,841
stay in Yi City,

531
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:48,682
they won't escape.

532
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:49,682
I humbly request

533
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:51,682
that you speak kindly of us
before the Lord.

534
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,722
Please don't punish us.

535
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:54,841
Considering your years

536
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,762
of devotion to the Lord,

537
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:58,641
I'll let this slide.

538
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,081
But if you fail again...

539
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:02,401
I'll accept any punishment.

540
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:15,401
Stop.

541
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,081
You're Jiao Tong?

542
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,282
Who are you?

543
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,042
Ling Bo from Zhaohan Sect.

544
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,561
So you're Lady Ling Bo

545
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:25,801
from Zhaohan Sect.

546
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,361
What do you want from me?

547
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,202
Why did you capture that lady?

548
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:30,401
Lady Ling Bo,

549
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:32,321
are you meddling in others' affairs?

550
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,121
What's this

551
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:35,922
got to do with you?

552
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:38,042
She belongs to Yunhua Sect.

553
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,561
How dare you seize someone
from Yunhua Sect?

554
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:41,801
What's your real purpose?

555
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:42,881
My purpose

556
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,442
is none of your concern.

557
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:47,161
But if you don't leave now,

558
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:49,161
even Zhaohan Sect members

559
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:51,081
won't be safe from me.

560
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:52,202
How dare you!

561
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:01,922
I'll come back for you after things

562
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,242
are settled tomorrow.

563
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:09,482
I can't let it go to waste.

564
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:42,682
Huan Zong.

565
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,321
Huan Zong.

566
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,242
I'm here.

567
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:49,242
Actually,

568
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:51,522
I've always envied
your bond with Lin Hu.

569
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:53,042
You're always together.

570
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,522
Though he calls you "Young Master",

571
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:56,922
I know

572
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,962
you're truly

573
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:01,801
close friends.

574
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:04,601
When I was at Yunhua Sect,

575
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,641
I had close friends too.

576
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,161
My senior brothers,

577
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,361
sisters, and I

578
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,081
were always together

579
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,841
just like you and Lin Hu.

580
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:15,202
I was really happy back then.

581
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,161
By that logic,

582
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,282
I should envy you.

583
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:25,081
Envy me?

584
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,482
Why?

585
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:28,242
Because you have many friends.

586
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,161
Unlike me.

587
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,161
Day and night,

588
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:37,881
I trained rigorously with my master.

589
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:39,881
Even now,

590
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:41,522
I barely have time

591
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,161
to interact with juniors.

592
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,042
So Huan Zong,

593
00:32:45,202 --> 00:32:46,762
were you brought to Liuguang Sect

594
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,522
when you were very young?

595
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,321
I was already grown that year.

596
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:52,002
But after family troubles,

597
00:32:52,242 --> 00:32:52,962
my master took me

598
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,482
to Liuguang Sect.

599
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:01,442
♪Time engraves into rings♪

600
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:02,601
All these years,

601
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,121
only Lin Hu stayed by my side.

602
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,922
So strictly speaking,

603
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:08,242
he's my only

604
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,242
true friend.

605
00:33:12,841 --> 00:33:14,282
But it's different now.

606
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:15,361
I'm your friend too.

607
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:18,042
Now, you have two friends.

608
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:21,561
Yes.

609
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:23,962
Now, there's you too.

610
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:26,881
Actually,

611
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,081
you've always hidden

612
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,202
Master Writer identity

613
00:33:29,202 --> 00:33:30,482
because you think

614
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:32,321
a Luanfeng Peak cultivator

615
00:33:32,321 --> 00:33:33,682
shouldn't do that, right?

616
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:39,601
But I don't think so.

617
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,161
I've told you before,

618
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,202
you're a person,

619
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:44,482
not a sword.

620
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,922
You have the right to do whatever

621
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:47,161
you want to do.

622
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:49,242
If you still feel

623
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,801
a bit embarrassed about it,

624
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,801
I can help you hide

625
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:54,282
your identity as Master Writer.

626
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:54,801
However,

627
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,242
you must promise me one thing.

628
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,081
What is it?

629
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,722
You must finish

630
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:02,722
new storybooks soon.

631
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:03,881
I've been waiting too long.

632
00:34:03,881 --> 00:34:04,962
I'm desperate to read them.

633
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,641
If you write new storybooks,

634
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:07,841
I'll help keep

635
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:08,561
this secret safe.

636
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:11,362
Okay.

00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:11,922
You almost fell.

645
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:13,601
Wake up.

646
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:17,601
Huan Zong,

647
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,201
why was I lying on your lap?

648
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,281
What's wrong with you?

649
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,161
My legs went numb from you
lying there all night.

650
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:29,042
Then let me

651
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,442
massage them for you.

652
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:35,882
No need.

653
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,241
Why not?

654
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:41,561
Because

655
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,121
we should keep a distance.

656
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,482
But remember this.

657
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:56,121
You don't need to massage me,

658
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,482
and never massage others.

659
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:58,281
Understand?

660
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,601
I'll remember.

661
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:03,882
Where's Lin Hu?

662
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,402
Lin Hu, you're back.

663
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:16,322
Come on. Let's drink.

664
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:20,761
We...

665
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:21,641
We'll be

666
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:23,002
friends for life,

667
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:23,641
right?

668
00:36:25,721 --> 00:36:27,121
But I'm telling you.

669
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:28,761
I can't continue today.

670
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:31,241
It's time for me to sleep.

671
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:34,601
Lin Hu, where are you going?

672
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:36,241
Breakfast.

673
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,322
Don't touch my seeds.

674
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:39,402
Why are you taking my seeds?

675
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:40,922
Give them to him.

676
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:41,882
Here you go!

677
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:45,962
You two, good night.

678
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,042
- Good night.
- Good night.

679
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:51,882
Huan Zong,

680
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,922
why are you bidding him goodnight?

681
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,161
If he sleeps
in that water vat all night,

682
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:59,042
he'll definitely wake up sore tomorrow.

683
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,042
Then he'll start yelling

684
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,402
at us again.

685
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,241
Foxes have flexible bodies.

686
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,161
Sleeping in a vat won't harm him.

687
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:07,802
True.

688
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:08,922
Wait.

689
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:10,402
He ate so many of my seeds.

690
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:11,802
He finished them all.

691
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:12,962
I'll buy you more.

692
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,681
No. I don't want it.

693
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:17,002
I want revenge.

694
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:20,601
Look.

695
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:22,761
Look!

696
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:24,842
Why's this guy sleeping here?

697
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:27,042
He probably did something wrong,

698
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,561
so he was stripped by his wife

699
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,522
and got kicked out.

700
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,482
W-What happened?

701
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,161
Oh, my.

702
00:37:32,522 --> 00:37:33,522
Are you alright?

703
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:43,121
W-What are you doing?

704
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:44,121
What's there to see?

705
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:46,641
Stop looking!

706
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:47,561
Everyone, stop looking!

707
00:37:48,402 --> 00:37:49,402
What's going on?

708
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:50,081
Let's go.

709
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:51,721
Everyone, show's over.

710
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:53,522
My apologies for the scene.

711
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:54,922
Alright, Lin Hu.

712
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:55,922
I've already apologized.

713
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:57,522
Don't be angry anymore.

714
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:58,322
Have some seeds.

715
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,761
I wouldn't dare be angry.

716
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:02,241
Seeds?

717
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:04,522
Yesterday, someone

718
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:05,802
treated me so harshly

719
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:07,121
over some seeds.

720
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:11,002
Sleeping in a vat all night
causes neck pain.

721
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,201
Are you okay?

722
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,042
Have some seeds.

723
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:14,962
I told you before.

724
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,922
Lin Hu is the embodiment of a fox.

725
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:18,561
Sleeping in a vat isn't a big deal.

726
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:20,322
Young Master,

727
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:21,201
when did you learn

728
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,522
to bully me together with her?

729
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,322
You've changed.

730
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,042
Search your conscience and tell me.

731
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:26,761
Among all the people
in the Liuguang Sect,

732
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:28,561
who doesn't know
that I'm the best to you?

733
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,121
Yes, yes. You are the best to me.

734
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,121
Lin Hu.

735
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:34,962
Yesterday, your young master

736
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:36,962
was so happy

737
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:38,721
while moving the vat with me.

738
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:39,802
He also moved it?

739
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:41,482
Really?

740
00:38:41,842 --> 00:38:44,081
I had a few drinks yesterday
and couldn't handle it.

741
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,522
I can't remember anything.

742
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:46,922
Is that true?

743
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:48,121
Huan Zong,

744
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,601
you've truly gone bad.

745
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:51,042
You've also learned to play dumb.

746
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,721
Oh, come on, Kong Hou.

747
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,721
He learned it all

748
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:54,601
from you.

749
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:56,081
He learned to play dumb from you.

750
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,322
Alright, this is for you.

751
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:01,802
Sword manual?

752
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:04,281
I knew you were the best to me.

753
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:05,681
You are forgiven.

754
00:39:06,081 --> 00:39:07,161
Give it to me.

755
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:13,161
Who are you?

756
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,561
I'm a Hehuan Sect disciple.

757
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,042
I've come to find Lady Kong Hou.

758
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:16,922
Looking for Kong Hou?

759
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,482
Kong Hou, she's coming for you.

760
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:20,442
Coming for me?

761
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:21,362
What's the matter?

762
00:39:21,681 --> 00:39:23,362
Are you Lady Kong Hou?

763
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:24,681
Yes, what's wrong?

764
00:39:24,802 --> 00:39:25,721
I heard

765
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:26,681
that you were frightened

766
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:27,522
in Hehuan Sect.

767
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:29,281
Master Ouyang feels deeply sorry.

768
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:30,442
So she sent me here

769
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:31,522
to invite you to a banquet.

770
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,641
She wants to apologize
to you personally.
