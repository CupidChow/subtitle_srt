16
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:48,873
I don't think

17
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:49,793
it's as dangerous

18
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:50,513
as it sounds.

19
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:52,313
Don't make hasty judgments.

20
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:53,393
Better be careful.

21
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:54,714
Got it.

22
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,033
I'll scout ahead.

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,634
No one knows what it's like

24
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,914
in there.

25
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,593
If we get separated...

26
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:05,313
We won't.

27
00:02:05,714 --> 00:02:07,074
I'll find you.

28
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:09,314
I trust you.

29
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:33,393
Why is the fog getting thicker?

30
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:34,553
Indeed.

31
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,194
I can't see anything ahead.

32
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:37,673
If there are traps here,

33
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:39,034
none of us can escape.

34
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:40,594
Lady Ling Bo,

35
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:41,594
what should we do?

36
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,874
Should we proceed or not?

37
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:44,034
The fog is unnatural.

38
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:45,634
Lady Ling Bo, please tell us

39
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,673
what to do.

40
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:47,754
- Absolutely!
- Absolutely!

41
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:48,474
Your call.

42
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:48,993
Guide us.

43
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:49,673
- Make the call.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,034
It's fine. Trust your instincts.

45
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:54,534
Let's go.

46
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:56,154
I don't rely on intuition.

47
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,434
I can't think of

48
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:58,953
a safer approach.

49
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:00,113
Why bother?

50
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,393
Can't we just charge in?

51
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:03,314
I must prioritize everyone's safety.

52
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:07,713
Let me scout for you.

53
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:16,673
Wait for me.

54
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:17,314
Wait.

55
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:18,354
Wait.

56
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:19,874
Let's see how it goes.

57
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:20,993
I don't hear anything.

58
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:21,634
It's fine.

59
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,314
The silence is what's frightening.

60
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:25,154
So you're a coward after all.

61
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:27,273
That's what you think of me?

62
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,074
Let me prove myself to you.

63
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:33,273
Come on, don't be upset.

64
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:34,393
Zhou Xiao.

65
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,034
What's that noise?

66
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:48,194
It's fine. Don't be scared.
I'm here for you.

67
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:49,233
Let's go, then.

68
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:03,233
Huan Zong,

69
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,273
why are we

70
00:04:04,273 --> 00:04:05,793
suddenly alone?

71
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,793
I think they got scattered

72
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,953
in the thick fog.

73
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:13,354
It's fine. Don't be scared.

74
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:14,914
Just hold onto me.

75
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,234
With you here, I'm not scared.

76
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,393
I'm not scared at all.

77
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,634
Not at all.

78
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:22,794
Good for you.

79
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:23,953
Let's

80
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:25,754
follow this path onward

81
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,074
and may find the entrance.

82
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:27,754
Alright.

83
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:38,393
Huan Zong,

84
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:39,674
why haven't we seen

85
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:40,874
anyone from other sects?

86
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,074
Where did they go?

87
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,874
I think the secret realm is a formation

88
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:45,874
that teleports visitors

89
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,393
to different locations.

90
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,953
What an expansive formation.

91
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:51,713
Impressive.

92
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,114
But there are so many places

93
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,074
to search.

94
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:56,033
Where to look for

95
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,634
the Cloudseeker Twig and Merfolk Scale?

96
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,114
It was never meant to be easy.

97
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,994
Let's stay alert.

98
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,033
There might be

99
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,314
traps and deadly mechanisms.

100
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:09,194
Huan Zong.

101
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:09,953
Look.

102
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:12,033
Bo Yuan Residence.

103
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:14,033
(Bo Yuan Residence)
Why would

104
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,273
Immortal Bo Yuan

105
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:17,074
live in such a desolate place?

106
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,314
There's nothing here.

107
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,994
He truly has...

108
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,314
A unique taste.

109
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,513
Indeed. Eccentric tastes.

110
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:25,953
Stay alert.

111
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,114
Let's keep going.

112
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:32,634
Careful.

113
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:45,913
But remember this.

114
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:48,794
This place may look simple

115
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:50,074
and unoccupied.

116
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,434
But the simpler it seems,

117
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,754
the more dangerous it can be.

118
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,194
Exactly.

119
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,794
A master like Immortal Bo Yuan

120
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:58,833
would create formations

121
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,794
that are absolutely top-tier.

122
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:02,393
I wonder

123
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,833
how Lin Hu is doing now.

124
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,593
He should be fine.

125
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:08,314
You know what?

126
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,554
A thousand years ago, Immortal Bo Yuan

127
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:11,953
clashed with demon cultivators,

128
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:13,434
who often fought

129
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,273
cultivators from the Lingyou Realm.

130
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:17,194
Since Lin Hu is a demon cultivator,

131
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:18,353
he'll likely receive

132
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,513
special treatment here.

133
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,353
So he's in serious trouble?

134
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:24,874
He should be okay.

135
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:28,554
Stop striking me.

136
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,554
Come on.

137
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,273
It's been thousands of years.

138
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,314
Why are you still

139
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:35,634
so harsh on a demon cultivator?

140
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,153
Just stop, okay?

141
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:40,434
Stay away from me.

142
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,074
What are you

143
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,033
shouting there?

144
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:43,554
Lady Ling Bo.

145
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,593
Help me.

146
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,593
What are you doing?

147
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,913
I got thunder strikes.

148
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:50,473
Where?

149
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:51,874
Show me the burns.

150
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:52,674
Not there.

151
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:53,473
Immortal Bo Yuan

152
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,874
hates demon cultivators so much?

153
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:56,353
He's throwing thunder strikes at me.

154
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,513
What can we do?

155
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,554
Why don't you leave?

156
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:00,674
No way!

157
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:01,353
I came for

158
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,273
an important mission.

159
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:03,153
I can't just leave.

160
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,713
Then suffer through it.

161
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,074
You're so heartless.

162
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:08,194
Can't you help me?

163
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:08,874
How?

164
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:09,434
I...

165
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,393
I bet you wouldn't

166
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,353
tell anyone about it.

167
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:13,913
Whatever.

168
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:14,953
Sorry.

169
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:16,353
What are you doing?

170
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:17,833
Do me a favor, please.

171
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,153
Why do I care

172
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:20,554
if you're getting thunder strikes?

173
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:21,353
Die for all I care.

174
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:23,194
Don't go.

175
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:23,713
Wait.

176
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,114
Do you have a death wish?

177
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:26,554
Come on, stop moving.

178
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:27,114
Listen.

179
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,153
The secret realm

180
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,194
is against me.

181
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,353
I can avoid thunder strikes next to you.

182
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:32,153
If you won't

183
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,273
- let me hold you,
- Let go.

184
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,674
I'll just stay close. Okay?

185
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,473
Why are you clinging to me?

186
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:37,634
Lecher.

187
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:38,593
Who's a lecher?

188
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:39,194
I'm targeted

189
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:40,634
by the thunder strikes.

190
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,353
But it doesn't target you.

191
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:43,473
How dare...

192
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:44,713
Ouch.

193
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,473
What is this?

194
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,353
A demon mark.

195
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,794
Tell you what.

196
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,554
We're bound now.

197
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:04,593
I warn you,

198
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:05,554
remove this mark

199
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:06,434
right now.

200
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:07,754
I can't.

201
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:08,953
You can't?

202
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:09,913
Didn't you cast this?

203
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:10,713
You can't undo it?

204
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:11,833
To remove this mark,

205
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,913
I need Young Master's assistance.

206
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,074
I can't undo it alone.

207
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:20,194
Then what good are you?

208
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:21,434
I'll kill you now.

209
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,634
Wait, don't.

210
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:25,634
You can't kill me.

211
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:27,314
The demon mark binds us.

212
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:27,953
We share

213
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:28,994
life and death now.

214
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:30,353
Kill me and you'll die, too.

215
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:34,514
Sure, I won't kill you.

216
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:40,074
T-That was way too harsh.

217
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,074
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

218
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,633
Huan Zong.

219
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:01,713
Look.

220
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,593
That tree is just like

221
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,833
the Cloudseeker Twig

222
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,633
in the books.

223
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,674
We already found the Cloudseeker Twigs?

224
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,034
Cloudseeker Twigs.

225
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,074
Tree trunks show dark violet hues.

226
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:18,873
Branches twist and curl.

227
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:20,993
Thick at the base
and tapering at the tips.

228
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,993
Leaves and flowers
share that deep purple.

229
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,473
Tiny as new sprouts.

230
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:25,833
That's how the tree

231
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,993
in this sphere looks.

232
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:28,593
But

233
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,674
the book also says

234
00:09:30,794 --> 00:09:33,274
that the Cloudseeker Tree
reaches five zhang tall.

235
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:35,593
The sphere is less than five cun.

236
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:36,833
Does it contain

237
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,674
a different world?

238
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,753
(This is my abode.)

239
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,953
(Only Void Unity stage cultivators
may enter.)

240
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,434
(Lesser cultivators, know your limits.)

241
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:56,434
So this is

242
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,154
Immortal Bo Yuan's former residence.

243
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:58,914
I didn't know

244
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:00,713
he actually lived inside a sphere.

245
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,833
He had an eccentric taste.

246
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:06,434
But Immortal Bo Yuan

247
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:07,434
is utterly

248
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:08,753
arrogant,

249
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:09,753
only welcoming

250
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:11,074
cultivators

251
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,274
at the Void Unity stage.

252
00:10:12,753 --> 00:10:14,314
He's just making things difficult,

253
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,953
showing treasures
but keeping them beyond reach.

254
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,593
I guess

255
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:19,794
he didn't want

256
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,314
to be disturbed.

257
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:22,674
Wait.

258
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:23,633
Huan Zong.

259
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,953
Spirit Division,
Void Unity, Great Perfection.

260
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,434
You're at peak Spirit Division stage.

261
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,353
Though

262
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:31,554
I'm nowhere

263
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:32,633
near your level,

264
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,274
I did gain the recognition of

265
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,753
the phoenix-headed konghou.

266
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,353
Are you suggesting

267
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,753
that we might break through this barrier

268
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,434
with Harmony Sync?

269
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:43,194
It's worth trying.

270
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:44,194
Alright.

271
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,034
Huan Zong, look.

272
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:14,353
We managed to get in.

273
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,154
Harmony Sync worked perfectly.

274
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,233
The tree is enormous.

275
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:25,314
Oh no, I forgot something.

276
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,314
What did you forget?

277
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,473
An axe.

278
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:28,674
What for?

279
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:30,154
With a tree this size,

280
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,274
I need an axe

281
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,274
to chop it down.

282
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:33,794
What do we do?

283
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,794
I didn't expect

284
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,633
to encounter something like this.

285
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:40,914
This will suffice.

286
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:44,034
I was way off.

287
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:45,233
And cruel.

288
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:47,593
Stop pacing back and forth.

289
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:48,633
Take a break.

290
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:56,034
Such a great opportunity,
and we're guarding the gates.

291
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:57,274
Isn't it nice?

292
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,314
It's easy work.

293
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:01,833
After all these years,

294
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:02,833
how come you're still

295
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,993
so spineless and aimless?

296
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,914
H-How am I aimless?

297
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,554
I-I work hard for spirit stones.

298
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:10,034
We have different aspirations.

299
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:10,633
Alright?

300
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:13,034
Different aspirations?

301
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,993
Then why even come here?

302
00:12:15,074 --> 00:12:16,473
Keep grinding for spirit stones.

303
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:20,914
Honestly,

304
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:22,554
why did you come?

305
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:24,233
You're using Kong Hou

306
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,233
as an excuse.

307
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:28,113
You must have...

308
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,314
W-What?

309
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,314
You must have found

310
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:34,554
a way to profit

311
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:36,034
from the secret realm.

312
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:38,353
Yeah, let's just go with that.

313
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:45,353
Your messenger talisman is here.

314
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:46,154
Open it.

315
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:48,154
In a while.

316
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,434
I'll help you.

317
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:50,414
You...

318
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:52,514
(Tan Feng, where is Kong Hou?)

319
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,713
(You promised to bring)

320
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:54,713
(her here ages ago.)

321
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:57,154
(Where is she? Where?)

322
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,394
What's that sound?

323
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,953
Over there. Let's check.

324
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:19,593
Be careful.

325
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:21,034
Got it.

326
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,434
Ling Bo?

327
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,233
Lin Hu.

328
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:29,194
Ling Bo.

329
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:31,353
Ling Bo.

330
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:34,314
What happened?

331
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:35,674
Lin Hu.

332
00:13:35,674 --> 00:13:37,314
It's a formation. Don't panic.

333
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,074
Ling Bo.

334
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,034
You entered a formation. Stay calm.

335
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:44,914
Try reciting

336
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:46,434
your sect's formation incantation.

337
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,593
Jin Ling.

338
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:56,753
That's her flute.

339
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,593
Is she in danger?

340
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,434
Jin Ling.

341
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,674
Jin Ling.

342
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,794
Jin Ling.

343
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:07,753
Jin Ling.

344
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:15,154
Let me help you.

345
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:20,473
Thank you.

346
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,113
You're welcome.

347
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:22,833
May I know your name?

348
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,384
Chi Si, Rogue Cultivators Alliance.

349
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:25,353
We met outside

350
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:26,514
the secret realm.

351
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,154
Thank you for saving me.

352
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:29,514
My junior is in peril.

353
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:30,473
Catch up later.

354
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:31,194
Wait.

355
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:32,674
Let me come with you

356
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:33,713
to help.

357
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,314
Alright.

358
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,154
Huan Zong.

359
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:38,674
We only need the Merfolk Scale now.

360
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,677
(Storybook)

361
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:48,953
To think we'd find

362
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,554
something like storybooks

363
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,394
in Immortal Bo Yuan's residence.

364
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:53,753
Don't tell me

365
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,074
it's a spiritual tool.

366
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:00,154
I think

367
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,993
this is just a regular storybook.

368
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,113
He was probably reading it

369
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:04,914
during the breaks

370
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,593
when he was tired of cultivating.

371
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,593
I thought

372
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:10,953
Immortal Bo Yuan

373
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,314
only focused on

374
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,794
studying spiritual arts.

375
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:14,713
Who'd have thought

376
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,194
that he read storybooks too?

377
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,314
Now he sounds

378
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:19,674
more like a human.

379
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:20,992
(Heart's Ballad)

380
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,794
Huan Zong, look.

381
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,394
The edges of this book

382
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:25,713
are worn from his reading.

383
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,713
Clearly,

384
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:27,633
this must've been

385
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,914
his favorite storybook.

386
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,113
Would it be inappropriate

387
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,274
to take all his favorite items

388
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,993
out of the secret realm

389
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,794
with me?

390
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:38,713
It's alright.

391
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,154
He left us

392
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,953
these treasures to benefit

393
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,434
the Lingyou Realm.

394
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,113
Then I'll take them all.

395
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:45,713
After all,

396
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:46,794
we earned our way in.

397
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:47,394
Right?

398
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:48,434
Yeah.

399
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,873
So many spiritual fruits here too.

400
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:54,473
Turns out Immortal Bo Yuan

401
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:55,753
knows how to enjoy life.

402
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,233
Had he not ascended,

403
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,993
you two

404
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:01,873
would've been great friends.

405
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,713
Then we shouldn't

406
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,154
mock his eccentric tastes anymore.

407
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:06,593
Since we

408
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:07,794
would have been close,

409
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,593
we should say...

410
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:10,674
What?

411
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,194
That he has a refined taste.

412
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,353
That he's interesting,

413
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,554
witty, and humorous.

414
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:16,514
Alright.

415
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:18,314
Lin Hu.

416
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:20,713
Lin Hu.

417
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,274
Formation incantation.

418
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:27,953
Right, the formation incantation
Lin Hu mentioned.

419
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:33,593
Qian's three unbroken lines
open heaven in the northwest.

420
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:36,394
Kun's six broken segments
divide earth in the southwest.

421
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:39,554
Gen's inverted bowl
aligns mountains in the northeast.

422
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:42,034
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes to the east.

423
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,914
Qian's three unbroken lines
open heaven in the northwest.

424
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,888
Kun's six broken segments
divide earth southwest.

425
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,392
Gen's inverted bowl
aligns mountains northeast.

426
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,312
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes east.

427
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:14,393
Open.

428
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:17,954
That's the incantation.

429
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,714
Why doesn't it work?

430
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:23,873
Zhen's upright bowl
brings thunder strikes to the east.

431
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,633
Where is the exit?

432
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:26,913
I've said it so many times.

433
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,353
Thunder strikes in the east...

434
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,554
Lin Hu.

435
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,514
Ling Bo.

436
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,714
Lin Hu.

437
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:33,593
Ling Bo.

438
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,433
Lin Hu.

439
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,673
Lin Hu.

440
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,193
- Are you alright?
- You alright?

441
00:17:37,193 --> 00:17:37,794
I thought

442
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:38,994
I'd never see you again.

443
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:40,193
A-Are...

444
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:41,833
Are you worried about me?

445
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:44,873
Our Zhaohan Sect is a model

446
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:46,193
among the Ten Great Sects.

447
00:17:46,193 --> 00:17:47,954
As the leader of the Zhaohan Sect,

448
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:48,474
I must

449
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:49,714
ensure your safety.

450
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:50,954
Come on,

451
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,954
stop being so formal.

452
00:17:53,234 --> 00:17:53,794
You can't

453
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,074
find the exit either?

454
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:57,673
I don't think

455
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:58,994
your incantation

456
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,034
works at all.

457
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:00,754
People say

458
00:18:00,754 --> 00:18:02,673
that Immortal Bo Yuan
follows his own whims

459
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,274
and never acts conventionally.

460
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,433
If we keep repeating the standard

461
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,474
incantations,

462
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:08,954
we'll never find the exit.

463
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:10,833
So what should we do?

464
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:12,954
There is nothing else to do.

465
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:15,833
I see.

466
00:18:15,913 --> 00:18:17,314
We can try some

467
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:18,633
unconventional incantations.

468
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,314
Like what?

469
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,034
The moon sets, and crows caw.

470
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:24,913
I'll spend money to get out of here.

471
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,554
I've never heard of

472
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:28,554
such an incantation.

473
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:29,514
It's just a rhyme,

474
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:30,994
not an incantation.

475
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:31,954
I just wanted to try.

476
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:34,673
What nonsense.

477
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,714
If I'm spouting nonsense,

478
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:37,514
why don't you

479
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:38,554
come up with something?

480
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:40,794
The general marches south with valor,

481
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,474
with a sharp sword at his waist.

482
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:43,314
What was that?

483
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:44,234
An ancient poem.

484
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,714
You recited storyteller rhymes.

485
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:46,994
Can't I recite poems?

486
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:48,514
I know poems too.

487
00:18:48,954 --> 00:18:50,433
Before my bed, moonlight pools...

488
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,234
Enough.

489
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,193
Forget it.

490
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:53,433
It's not working.

491
00:18:54,913 --> 00:18:56,673
Nothing works.

492
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,474
What should we do?

493
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:58,113
We've tried

494
00:18:58,113 --> 00:18:58,633
everything.

495
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,554
I have an idea.

496
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:00,274
What is it?

497
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,113
Let's wander around.

498
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,314
What?

499
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:04,633
Come on. Let's go.

500
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,554
Are you serious?

501
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:15,833
I've never seen

502
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:16,714
such a beautiful

503
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:17,754
cup set.

504
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,714
It looks familiar.

505
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:20,393
I recall

506
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,234
reading about it in a book.

507
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,673
The Jiufeng Sect had this cup set.

508
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:26,274
Pour plain water in,

509
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,873
and it transforms into aged liquor.

510
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,913
What an amazing treasure.

511
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,393
I don't think

512
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:35,954
the water turned into liquor.

513
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,113
It's nothing special.

514
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:38,554
Try it.

515
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:42,234
It's too spicy.

516
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:43,314
It's really liquor.

517
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,274
Well,

518
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:47,873
Huan Zong,

519
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,754
I like these, too.

520
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,873
Just keep them.

521
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,954
Then I'll take them.

522
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,673
Jin Ling.

523
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:00,913
Zhou Xiao.

524
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,633
You seem anxious.

525
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:04,433
Does Jin Ling's flute melody

526
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:05,913
carry any special meaning?

527
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,074
She is a music cultivator.

528
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:10,314
We once made a pact

529
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:11,554
that if she's in danger,

530
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,994
she'd play this tune to alert me.

531
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:14,016
I don't mean to pry,

532
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,193
but Zhou Xiao,

533
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,153
Jin Ling

534
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:17,274
is not just

535
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,234
an ordinary junior to you, right?

536
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:19,954
It's fine.

537
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:20,873
Jin Ling and I

538
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:22,274
are getting married.

539
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:23,714
No wonder you're so worried.

540
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:24,393
Don't worry.

541
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,074
She will surely

542
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,153
overcome this adversity.

543
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,314
We'll find her.

544
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,833
Thank you for your comfort.

545
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:36,153
Chi Si, look.

546
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:39,833
Oh no.

547
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,034
We've entered a formation.

548
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:42,873
That's right.

549
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,193
There are

550
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,754
no landmarks around us.

551
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:46,633
We must stay close

552
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,554
to each other.

553
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:48,714
At this critical moment,

554
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:49,913
we must stay calm.

555
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:51,314
Chi Si...

556
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:55,754
Chi Si, where are you?

557
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:57,034
Are you alright?

558
00:20:57,113 --> 00:20:58,873
I'm fine. I'm trying to get out.

559
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,314
This formation is strange.

560
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:01,633
Let's both try to get out.

561
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:02,353
Don't worry.

562
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,353
We'll definitely get out.

563
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:07,113
The spiritual fruits

564
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:08,514
must be a thousand years old.

565
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:09,673
They still look fresh.

566
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:13,873
So sweet.

567
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,673
This is no ordinary spiritual fruit.

568
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,994
This Hongjian fruit

569
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:18,633
is born once every millennium.

570
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,593
So, does it boost

571
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,393
my spiritual energy?

572
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,274
Of course.

573
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:25,113
Then I will

574
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,393
take them all back

575
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,833
for our sect's
senior brothers and sisters.

576
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:30,113
Alright.

577
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:32,074
Let's leave now.

578
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:32,794
Alright.

579
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,913
(I've stored my life's mastery here.)

580
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,314
(Master them and apply them to use.)

581
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,113
(Only by passing trials may you leave.)

582
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:41,633
(Those who fail the trials)

583
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,474
(shall remain trapped for eternity.)

584
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,954
What does it mean?

585
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,554
Immortal Bo Yuan

586
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,074
assumes that since we've entered,

587
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:50,034
we must be capable of mastering

588
00:21:50,034 --> 00:21:51,193
his life's work

589
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,314
and passing it on

590
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,673
to benefit the Lingyou Realm.

591
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,913
If we fail to learn it,

592
00:21:56,673 --> 00:21:58,714
we might never get out.

593
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,113
We may be trapped for life?

594
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,113
So...

595
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:04,113
So many books.

596
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:05,554
How could we possibly

597
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:06,633
learn everything?

598
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,034
And he wants us to

599
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,954
"master them and apply them to use"?

600
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:12,554
No way.

601
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,113
How about this, Huan Zong?

602
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:15,554
Let's try

603
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:16,833
Harmony Sync again

604
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:18,153
and see if we can get out.

605
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,794
I don't think it will work.

606
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:20,873
Immortal Bo Yuan

607
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:22,113
must have set

608
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:23,714
specific formations here.

609
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,274
If he says that we can't

610
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:26,673
get out,

611
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:28,113
I think he means it.

612
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:32,714
Let's just stay here

613
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:34,514
and try to learn

614
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:36,754
the techniques.

615
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,954
Did we make it out?

616
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,274
Did we make it out?

617
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:46,954
Why don't you test it

618
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,034
to find out?

619
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:48,754
Test it?

620
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:49,673
How?

621
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:51,794
Ouch.

622
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:52,954
You said, "Test it."

623
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,754
- I...
- I tested it.

624
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,593
See? I'm amazing, right?

625
00:22:58,593 --> 00:22:59,833
J-Just average.

626
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:01,994
After all, it doesn't
require much wisdom

627
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,314
to wander about.

628
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,153
You simply got lucky.

629
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:06,954
Then why didn't you have

630
00:23:06,954 --> 00:23:08,274
such good luck?

631
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,193
Enough.

632
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,554
I don't need

633
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,074
your appreciation.

634
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,113
What's that sound?

635
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,314
Did you hear that?

636
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,794
When constructing
and analyzing a hexagram,

637
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:29,393
make sure the "placement of the self"
is unharmed.

638
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:31,913
One's destiny is shaped by experiences.

639
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:34,314
One must not speculate arbitrarily.

640
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:36,514
Focus on the Day Stem
in hexagram interpretation.

641
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:38,193
The Day Stem represents "me".

642
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,593
The Stems, Branches,
Lessons, and Evolutions

643
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:41,794
all evolve around "me".

644
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,673
If the First Lesson appears

645
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,353
within the Three Evolutions...

646
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:52,034
Huan Zong.

647
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:54,153
I just remembered

648
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:55,913
that Immortal Bo Yuan

649
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,074
was the only cultivator

650
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:58,873
to ascend in millennia.

651
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,113
If we could master

652
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:01,514
all his techniques,

653
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,153
wouldn't we become

654
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:04,954
the greatest cultivators

655
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:06,274
in this world?

656
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:08,234
I don't think so.

657
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:10,433
After studying these texts,

658
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:12,353
I realized

659
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:13,754
that these techniques

660
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,673
may have been revolutionary

661
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:17,554
millennia ago.

662
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,193
But now,

663
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,353
only some theories

664
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:22,593
remain valuable.

665
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:24,873
These techniques

666
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:27,034
look outdated to me.

667
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,873
Don't say that.

668
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:31,633
If he hears you,

669
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:32,873
he'll get upset.

670
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,673
Then he surely

671
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,833
won't let us out.

672
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,193
So, what can we do?

673
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,153
We have to

674
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:39,754
keep studying.

675
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:45,280
(Qin Residence)

676
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:58,314
Y-You're covered in leaves.

677
00:24:58,314 --> 00:24:59,153
What's so funny?

678
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:00,873
Look at you. You're covered in leaves.

679
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:01,833
Come on.

680
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,393
What's so funny?

681
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:06,714
You're not much better.

682
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:07,794
Look.

683
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,633
Look here.

684
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,754
Full of leaves.

685
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:11,754
Who said that

686
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,034
she was lucky?

687
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:13,673
Well,

688
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:14,633
we found no exit

689
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:15,714
and got trapped here.

690
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,754
Are you blaming me?

691
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:17,673
I wasn't looking

692
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:18,514
for the right exit.

693
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:19,673
That was your idea.

694
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,074
You didn't object to it.

695
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:22,754
Enough.

696
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,034
Let's not bicker now.

697
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,193
We'd better find a way out.

698
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,193
What kind of place is this?

699
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,673
Are you alright?

700
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,393
I'm fine.

701
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:46,433
Are you alright?

702
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,314
What's happening?

703
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,554
Isn't it obvious?

704
00:25:51,714 --> 00:25:52,954
This courtyard is set

705
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:53,913
in special barriers.

706
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:55,314
We can't get out.

707
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:56,353
Of course,

708
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,754
I know there are barriers.

709
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:01,673
That hurts, huh?

710
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:05,514
We somehow entered

711
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:06,514
and got trapped.

712
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:07,113
How are

713
00:26:07,113 --> 00:26:08,034
the others doing?

714
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:08,833
Calm down.

715
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:10,714
I bet Immortal Bo Yuan

716
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,074
has some serious issues.

717
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:13,994
Let's look around

718
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,113
and see if we can

719
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:15,754
get out.

720
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,433
What's going on?

721
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,474
How did I get here?

722
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:34,514
Ouch.

723
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,514
It's not a dream.

724
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:38,113
Wasn't I just

725
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,633
studying with Huan Zong?

726
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:42,833
Get up.

727
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,153
Huan Zong?

728
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:44,994
Weren't we

729
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,833
studying at Immortal Bo Yuan's place?

730
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,034
How did we get here?

731
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,314
This is all your fault.

732
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:53,514
You dozed off while studying.

733
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,633
How can you accompany me
through secret realms?

734
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,034
Listen up.

735
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:58,353
You'd better go home.

736
00:26:58,514 --> 00:26:59,393
Don't hold me back.

737
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:00,913
What do you mean?

738
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,794
You kicked me out of the secret realm?

739
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:04,593
Of course, I did.

740
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,593
But you're mostly to blame.

741
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,074
Well,

742
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:09,754
I've never seen such a talentless

743
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,314
mediocre cultivator

744
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:12,754
like you.

745
00:27:12,913 --> 00:27:14,234
You'd better go home.

746
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,314
Don't embarrass your sect.

747
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:15,913
You...

748
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:17,554
I merely

749
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,833
nodded off

750
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,673
while reading.

751
00:27:20,714 --> 00:27:22,274
Why are you so harsh?

752
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,633
Besides,

753
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:25,193
I've always been

754
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:26,833
poor at studying.

755
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,274
I'm trying my hardest.

756
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:29,554
You're trying your hardest?

757
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:31,393
Struggling to read a book?

758
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:32,153
How stupid

759
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,393
are you?

760
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:34,714
All the cultivators

761
00:27:34,714 --> 00:27:35,833
in the Lingyou Realm

762
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:37,314
work harder than you.

763
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:38,754
But I...

764
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:40,353
But what? No excuses.

765
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:42,034
Stop blabbering. Get going.

766
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:43,873
Wait.

767
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,873
Since when did you

768
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:47,514
become so talkative?

769
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:48,673
And

770
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:49,833
you've never spoken

771
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,034
like this before.

772
00:27:58,314 --> 00:27:59,314
Haven't I...

773
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,193
Haven't I always been like this?

774
00:28:04,153 --> 00:28:04,873
No.

775
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:06,714
You're not Huan Zong.

776
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,994
Don't you dare say that.

777
00:28:09,074 --> 00:28:10,593
Who am I if I'm not Huan Zong?

778
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,353
When Huan Zong speaks to me,

779
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:13,913
he's never so...

780
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:15,954
Besides,

781
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:17,474
even if I'm slow

782
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:18,994
and often make mistakes,

783
00:28:19,153 --> 00:28:20,193
Huan Zong

784
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:21,593
never looks down on me.

785
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,514
When I'm with him,

786
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:24,673
I always feel

787
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:26,153
very secure.

788
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,353
So cheesy.

789
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:36,873
Now I get it.

790
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:37,954
What did you get?

791
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:40,074
Immortal Bo Yuan sent you

792
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,514
to test me.

793
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:44,514
I knew

794
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,193
Immortal Bo Yuan wouldn't let us out

795
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,514
by just memorizing

796
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:48,593
some texts.

797
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:50,113
Tell me.

798
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:51,274
Did you do the same

799
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:52,274
to Huan Zong?

800
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:53,714
He's pure of heart.

801
00:28:53,794 --> 00:28:55,234
Don't you bully him.

802
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,353
You spout such cheesy lines

803
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,474
so smoothly. Eww.

804
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:01,514
Where is he?

805
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:02,794
What did you do to him?

806
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:03,754
And

807
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:06,474
who are you?

808
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:09,593
Clever girl.

809
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:11,554
Who I am doesn't matter.

810
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:12,833
What matters is

811
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:14,593
that I'm here to test you two.

812
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:16,393
And let me remind you.

813
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:17,234
That guy

814
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:18,913
is way smarter than you think.

815
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,794
So,

816
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:22,794
I passed your test?

817
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:25,353
When can I

818
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:26,234
see him, then?

819
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,193
You're so...

820
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:31,314
Never mind. Too bothered to explain.

821
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,193
Anyway,

822
00:29:32,593 --> 00:29:33,913
you passed this test.

823
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:34,673
Therefore,

824
00:29:34,994 --> 00:29:36,314
get lost now.

825
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:42,274
Well?

826
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:43,353
Found anything?

827
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:44,554
Nothing at all.

828
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:45,833
Just filth everywhere.

829
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,890
(Stele Inscription)

830
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:51,074
Over there.

831
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:57,314
I slaughtered
countless demon cultivators

832
00:29:57,393 --> 00:29:59,074
and captured the rest.

833
00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:01,754
Their souls were sealed here,

834
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:03,314
guarded by this stele.

835
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:05,074
The strong demonic aura
made this mansion

836
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,193
inhabitable.

837
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,353
Thus, I repurposed it
as a containment site

838
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:10,514
to house passing demonic creatures.

839
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:14,314
So Immortal Bo Yuan

840
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,794
houses demonic creatures here?

841
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,393
Demonic creatures?

842
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,193
But I'm not a demon cultivator.

843
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:22,593
Why am I here then?

844
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,554
He keeps saying "demonic creatures".

845
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,034
Not all demon cultivators are evil.

846
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:28,153
I haven't even

847
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,593
eaten a chicken.

848
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:31,193
I only eat spiritual fruits.

849
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,274
What else does he want?

850
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:36,873
So this is why

851
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,314
I got pulled in here.

852
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:40,234
Ling Bo.

853
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:44,994
Am I right?

854
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:45,873
You heard me.

855
00:30:52,794 --> 00:30:53,433
I...

856
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:54,714
I don't know how

857
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:56,234
I became like this.

858
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,314
You know what?

859
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:59,074
These little ears

860
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,554
look quite charming on you.

861
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,393
See? All fluffy.

862
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,353
Adorable.

863
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:10,554
Is it because of this mark?

864
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,274
Our bloodlines merged.

865
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:13,113
Plus the intense

866
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:14,433
demonic aura here.

867
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:15,193
That's why

868
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:16,153
I became like this.

869
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:25,193
Maybe...

870
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:26,593
Maybe?

871
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:28,673
Probably...

872
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:30,074
Probably?

873
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,794
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps?

874
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:33,954
Perhaps, that's why.

875
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,353
Lin Hu, you lousy fox.

876
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,193
I'll kill you!

877
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:37,314
Wait.

878
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:38,913
I-I don't know

879
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:39,913
what happened.

880
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:41,353
If you really turn into a fox,

881
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:42,393
you'll be

882
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:43,474
the prettiest fox among us.

883
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:44,474
Who wants to be a fox?

884
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:45,714
I'm a Zhaohan Sect disciple.

885
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:46,274
How dare you

886
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,514
demon cultivator bully me?

887
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:48,873
- Stop.
- Don't...

888
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:49,474
How dare you

889
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,393
bully me?

890
00:31:50,393 --> 00:31:51,074
I dare not.

891
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:51,714
Stop running.

892
00:31:51,714 --> 00:31:52,593
Lady Ling Bo, wait.

893
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:53,633
Calm down, will you?

894
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:54,833
Let me explain.

895
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,234
Trying to escape?

896
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:56,913
I...

897
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:00,794
What's wrong?

898
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:02,074
Are you okay?

899
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:04,554
I...

900
00:32:04,994 --> 00:32:06,754
I swear I don't know what happened.

901
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,353
If you're still angry,

902
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,673
beat me up.

903
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:20,514
I've never

904
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,633
formed a demon mark before.

905
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,113
This is my f-first time.

906
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:26,833
I swear.

907
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:29,314
This is my first time.

908
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,833
It's my first time.

909
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,234
Don't be upset.

910
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:34,193
Worst-case scenario,

911
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,433
I'll undo it for you.

912
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:38,153
Undo it?

913
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:42,193
Didn't you say you couldn't undo it?

914
00:33:02,633 --> 00:33:03,994
This is unbearable.

915
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:07,994
Hang in there.

916
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:32,673
It must have

917
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:34,314
drained much of your spiritual energy.

918
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:35,554
Are you alright?

919
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:38,034
I'm fine.

920
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,994
I'm at least a Nascent Soul.

921
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:41,193
This is nothing.

922
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:42,433
Are you leaving?

923
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,074
What will you do

924
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:45,714
if I leave?

925
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:46,554
How do you get out?

926
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:47,994
Don't worry.

927
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:48,954
Young Master

928
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,074
will definitely find me.

929
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,353
Yeah.

930
00:33:51,554 --> 00:33:52,433
I'll ask your

931
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,673
Young Master to help...

932
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,034
With what?

933
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,153
Why are you so nagging?

934
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:57,074
Are you leaving or not?

935
00:33:57,074 --> 00:33:58,593
Leave before I change my mind.

936
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,234
She just left like that,

937
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:05,274
leaving me alone

938
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:07,034
in this demon cultivator's tomb.

939
00:34:07,193 --> 00:34:07,833
Women.

940
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,153
Women are ruthless.

941
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:14,834
Why did you come back?

942
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:21,074
I mean,

943
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:23,074
you suddenly returned and startled me.

944
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,874
You were too absorbed

945
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:26,673
in muttering to yourself.

946
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:29,633
Why did you come back?

947
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:33,153
I can't get out.

948
00:34:33,394 --> 00:34:34,554
No way.

949
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:39,153
I see, though we undo

950
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:39,874
the demon mark,

951
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:40,713
you still carry

952
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:41,514
some demonic aura.

953
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,273
What should we do then?

954
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:45,874
I have an idea.

955
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:46,753
Reestablish

956
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,273
the demon mark connection,

957
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,633
then I'll draw out

958
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,313
the demonic aura.

959
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:52,474
Stop lying to me.

960
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:54,793
I'm not lying. It's your call.

961
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:55,354
Stay and wait

962
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,354
for it to fade

963
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:57,354
if you want.

964
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:00,673
How long will that take?

965
00:35:01,954 --> 00:35:02,554
Forget it.

966
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,474
It'll be dark soon.

967
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,193
The secret realm gets terrifying.

968
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:07,593
Why don't you

969
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:08,554
sleep here tonight?

970
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,074
You're safer close to me.

971
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:11,394
Rest assured.

972
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:12,233
At dawn tomorrow,

973
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:12,874
it might

974
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:14,193
have dissipated.

975
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:22,834
Chi.

976
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:24,233
Thank you so much.

977
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:26,554
Don't mention it.

978
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:28,554
Cultivators should support each other.

979
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:29,273
It's only proper.

980
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,954
Thanks to your profound cultivation,

981
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:34,313
we broke the formation

982
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:35,313
and found Jin Ling.

983
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,354
You flatter me.

984
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:39,034
Zhou Xiao.

985
00:35:39,074 --> 00:35:40,313
It took you so long

986
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:41,914
to break a simple formation?

987
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,554
Shame on me.

988
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:45,994
I was

989
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:47,193
merely lucky

990
00:35:47,193 --> 00:35:48,113
and stumbled upon

991
00:35:48,153 --> 00:35:49,153
the exit.

992
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,394
Right, Lady Jin Ling.

993
00:35:51,434 --> 00:35:52,713
Did you happen to see

994
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:53,834
any unusual items

995
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:54,713
down there?

996
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,753
They say that
Immortal Bo Yuan hides treasures

997
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,793
behind every mechanism.

998
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:00,153
Yeah.

999
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:00,834
I discovered

1000
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:01,994
a treasure chest

1001
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:02,793
and brought

1002
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,753
everything back.

1003
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:11,616
(Heaven and Earth Swordplay)

1004
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:16,273
- Heaven and Earth Swordplay!
- Is it a powerful technique?

1005
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:18,233
They say this swordplay

1006
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:19,313
was created by

1007
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:21,113
an ascended sword cultivator
3,000 years ago,

1008
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,994
featuring the pinnacle of swordplay.

1009
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:24,313
Whoever masters it

1010
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,113
can overturn the Heaven

1011
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:27,153
and Earth.

1012
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,034
But the sword cultivator ascended

1013
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,834
and his sword manual got lost.

1014
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:31,793
What remains

1015
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:32,713
are merely legends

1016
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:33,593
of the swordplay.

1017
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,074
They say whoever obtains it

1018
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:36,994
will gain fame across the realm

1019
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,994
and ascend to immortality.

1020
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:40,673
Zhou Xiao.

1021
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:52,034
Please accept this manual

1022
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:53,673
as a token of gratitude.

1023
00:36:53,834 --> 00:36:54,673
I, Chi Si,

1024
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,074
have never been one for greed.

1025
00:36:56,074 --> 00:36:56,753
I think

1026
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:57,673
we should

1027
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,554
study it together.

1028
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,914
Besides, you discovered

1029
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,354
this sword manual.

1030
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,834
You are truly magnanimous.

1031
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,233
Alright then.

1032
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:07,753
I'll make thousands of copies

1033
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:08,914
of this manual

1034
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:09,713
and deliver them

1035
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:10,793
to every major sect.

1036
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:14,793
This mirror

1037
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,474
is placed alongside the manual.

1038
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,273
I bet there's something to it.

1039
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:19,793
Here's what you didn't know.

1040
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:20,874
This mirror

1041
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:21,673
is remarkable.

1042
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:23,074
It reveals one's past.

1043
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:24,394
Care to try it?

1044
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:26,313
No need.

1045
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:28,313
Zhou Xiao, why don't you try it?

1046
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:28,874
Zhou Xiao.

1047
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:29,593
No need.

1048
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:30,233
Zhou Xiao.

1049
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:31,793
I just want to know you better.

1050
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:32,474
Look into it.

1051
00:37:32,673 --> 00:37:33,394
Try it, please.

1052
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:34,074
No, thank you.

1053
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:35,434
Ling Bo.

1054
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,034
I've cleaned the room for you.

1055
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:37,593
You can

1056
00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:38,633
rest there tonight.

1057
00:37:40,874 --> 00:37:41,434
Here.

1058
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:46,074
Eat.

1059
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:57,313
What's wrong? You don't like it?

1060
00:37:57,313 --> 00:37:59,313
I don't want it. I have no appetite.

1061
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:00,673
You don't want it?

1062
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:01,793
What do you want then?

1063
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:04,874
I want

1064
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:06,753
something bloody,

1065
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,034
dripping wet,

1066
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:10,273
with bones...

1067
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:11,593
Chicken drumsticks.

1068
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:13,313
You...

1069
00:38:13,554 --> 00:38:15,273
You've grown so much like a fox.

1070
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:22,034
I-I didn't...

1071
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:22,994
Ling Bo.

1072
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:24,753
That's not what I meant.

1073
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,593
I meant no offense.

1074
00:38:37,074 --> 00:38:37,834
Well,

1075
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,074
a wild goose

1076
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:40,113
flew by.

1077
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,954
I caught it and grilled it for you.

1078
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:43,713
I-I left it there.

1079
00:38:44,193 --> 00:38:45,753
Just have it.

1080
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:48,753
Be it chicken or goose

1081
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:49,633
drumsticks,

1082
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:50,593
it's fine to indulge.

1083
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:52,313
Many cultivators

1084
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,713
don't practice fasting.

1085
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:54,874
The Yunhua Sect members

1086
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:56,354
consume all manner of delicacies

1087
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:57,874
from sky to land

1088
00:38:57,874 --> 00:38:59,074
without consequence.

1089
00:38:59,153 --> 00:38:59,874
Actually,

1090
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,193
demon cultivators

1091
00:39:01,193 --> 00:39:02,113
aren't as terrible

1092
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,193
as you imagine.

1093
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:08,994
I won't eat.

1094
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:12,113
Come on.

1095
00:39:12,273 --> 00:39:13,153
If you don't eat,

1096
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:14,874
I'll feel terrible.

1097
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,793
I understand the craving

1098
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:17,994
for raw flesh

1099
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,793
when a demonic aura possesses you.

1100
00:39:19,914 --> 00:39:21,113
Don't suppress it.

1101
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,233
Suppressing it

1102
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,753
only worsens the agitation.

1103
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:25,313
Just relax and eat.

1104
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:26,354
After that,

1105
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:27,713
we'll leave this cursed place.

1106
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:28,633
I'll take this secret

1107
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,593
to my grave.

1108
00:39:29,593 --> 00:39:30,153
Alright?

1109
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,233
Once the demonic aura dissipates,

1110
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:34,713
you're still the gorgeous, elegant,

1111
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:36,313
generous, highly cultivated,

1112
00:39:36,313 --> 00:39:37,474
and noble Lady Ling Bo.

1113
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:38,113
Right?

1114
00:39:56,554 --> 00:39:58,593
