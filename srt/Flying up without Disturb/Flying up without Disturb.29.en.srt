Master.

17
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:43,096
Go to the cave.

18
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:44,616
Master.

19
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:45,816
Master Zhong Xi

20
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,096
is imprisoned now,

21
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,497
but he is the top cultivator

22
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,417
in the Lingyou Realm.

23
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,137
I...

24
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:53,417
You cannot kill him,

25
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:54,976
nor harm him.

26
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:56,976
You only need to...

27
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,256
Understood. Rest assured.

28
00:02:01,376 --> 00:02:02,137
I take my leave.

29
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:13,656
Who are you?

30
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,656
I'm here to kill you.

31
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,017
Did Jiusu send you?

32
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,577
The Lord is celebrating
the victory over Liuguang Sect.

33
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:20,936
He has no time for you.

34
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,456
What?

35
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,936
Jiusu has gone to the Liuguang Sect?

36
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:26,097
If Sovereign Kong Hou

37
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:26,896
didn't go on

38
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,297
a killing spree,

39
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,097
it would take us

40
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,616
quite an effort.

41
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,736
Kong Hou?

42
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:35,257
Kong Hou killed?

43
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,697
Where is Kong Hou?

44
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,368
The Sovereign and the Lord

45
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:39,257
are celebrating.

46
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,216
Impossible.

47
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,977
Answer me.

48
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:48,768
What exactly did Jiusu do

49
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,616
to Kong Hou?

50
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,257
The Sovereign sent me.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,614
Get lost.

52
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:57,736
Hurry!

53
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:58,656
You!

54
00:02:58,736 --> 00:02:59,857
How dare you not to move!

55
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:00,456
How dare you!

56
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,056
Stop.

57
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:02,417
Who's there?

58
00:03:02,537 --> 00:03:03,656
How dare you meddle with me?

59
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:05,257
He's Master Zhong Xi.

60
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,417
- Move!
- Hurry!

61
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,537
How is it, Chang Le?

62
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,056
Zhong Xi, what are you doing here?

63
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,056
Master.

64
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,577
Do not trust

65
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,656
this demon.

66
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:21,056
After the Kong Hou from the Yunhua Sect

67
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,377
arrived the Liuguang Sect,

68
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,616
she went on a killing spree,

69
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:27,176
severely injuring Master Jin Yue.

70
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:29,377
Do not trust her.

71
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,216
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't come closer.

72
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,456
Tell me.

73
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,336
Did you go to the Liuguang Sect

74
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,697
and go on a killing spree,

75
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,417
injuring my master?

76
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:50,848
I only went to bring them

77
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:51,616
back here.

78
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,216
I have given instructions

79
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,417
to treat them well.

80
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,577
How could this happen?

81
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,336
Zhong Xi,

82
00:03:58,817 --> 00:03:59,697
trust me.

83
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:01,977
Then why would he say that?

84
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,736
I really did nothing.

85
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,097
- Zhong Xi.
- Go away!

86
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:17,377
Zhong Xi,

87
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:18,697
don't blame me.

88
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:21,416
There's something fishy about this.

89
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:23,536
I did not harm them.

90
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:25,817
I will prove it to you.

91
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,497
What about the person you sent?

92
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,177
My lord,

93
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,017
after Zhong Xi hearing his words,

94
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,416
he went to confront Kong Hou.

95
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:35,937
Do you think

96
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,137
Zhong Xi really doubts Kong Hou?

97
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,377
If he doesn't,

98
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,144
you still have

99
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:43,617
a brilliant backup plan.

100
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:46,937
You're right.

101
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,536
He must believe what the people

102
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,216
from the Liuguang Sect say.

103
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,536
I just did it

104
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,336
for Kong Hou.

105
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:57,177
Let me go!

106
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,216
Thanks to my sister.

107
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:02,377
I used her to capture people.

108
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:03,896
With little effort,

109
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,696
we can capture people

110
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,617
from the Liuguang Sect.

111
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,536
Shameless!

112
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:10,976
If that demon

113
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:12,737
didn't threaten us

114
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,137
with the Master's life,

115
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:15,976
we'll fight you to death.

116
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,776
Quite loyal.

117
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:20,937
If we send someone

118
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,336
like him to Zhong Xi,

119
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:23,896
he must believe it.

120
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:25,976
He's clearly not a liar.

121
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:28,416
Demon! What do you want?

122
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:29,776
Nothing much.

123
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:31,776
Just need you to deliver some words

124
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,096
to Master Zhong Xi.

125
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:36,536
Wu Bei.

126
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:37,976
Yes, my lord.

127
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:41,737
What do you want?

128
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:43,216
Let me go!

129
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:44,017
Let me go!

130
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,617
After taking this pill,

131
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,577
you'll think whatever the Lord wants you

132
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:49,937
to think.

133
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:02,776
Remember.

134
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,856
After the Kong Hou from the Yunhua Sect

135
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:06,617
arrived the Liuguang Sect,

136
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,377
she went on a killing spree,

137
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,776
severely injuring Master Jin Yue.

138
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:12,456
Do not trust her.

139
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:17,096
After the Kong Hou from the Yunhua Sect

140
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:18,776
arrived the Liuguang Sect,

141
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,216
she went on a killing spree,

142
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,656
severely injuring Master Jin Yue.

143
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,096
Do not trust her.

144
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:25,617
Wu Bei.

145
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,456
Make some injuries on him.

146
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,737
Don't let Master Zhong Xi

147
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:32,697
think we're nice.

148
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,377
Yes, my lord.

149
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,617
Kong Hou.

150
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:11,017
What have you done to me?

151
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:12,817
Stop struggling.

152
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:15,856
These ropes are specially made by Jiusu.

153
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,096
You can't break free.

154
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,456
Kong Hou.

155
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,776
Do you...

156
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,536
There's something fishy about this.

157
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,177
I know you're furious

158
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,577
about your fellow's death.

159
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:26,937
But,

160
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:27,856
trust me.

161
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,336
I'll definitely find the evidence.

162
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,368
I'd never kill

163
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:31,257
any sect member.

164
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:36,057
Jiusu.

165
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:39,456
You two,

166
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,377
where are you

167
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,017
heading to?

168
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,896
To seek death?

169
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,577
Take the Lamp to the Young Master.

170
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:49,257
I'll handle him.

171
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:50,017
Take it.

172
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:51,577
No way.

173
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,776
So many people here.

174
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,057
You can't fight them all alone.

175
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,937
I have nine lives. Don't worry.

176
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,577
- But you only have one left.
- Enough.

177
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,096
Have you made up your mind?

178
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:01,216
Lin Hu?

179
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,497
Kong Hou, release me.

180
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:04,737
I need to save them.

181
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,617
It's not a wise move

182
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,017
to fight Jiusu now.

183
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:08,617
Give me a moment.

184
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:09,617
Give me a moment.

185
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,456
What's the Soul Anchoring Lamp?

186
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,456
If it's meant for Kong Hou,

187
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,057
give it to me then.

188
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,737
No way.

189
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:35,176
Ling Bo.

190
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,497
(Why did he grow)

191
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:46,144
(so powerful)

192
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,416
(in such short time?)

193
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,137
Kong Hou, release me.

194
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,296
I need to save them.

195
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,137
Ling Bo.

196
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:03,816
Ling Bo.

197
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,097
Ling Bo.

198
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,896
Leave now!

199
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:30,737
No.

200
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,257
Never.

201
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,097
I won't leave you.

202
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:34,857
No.

203
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,097
Ling Bo.

204
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,936
Zhong Xi, no matter what happens,

205
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,296
you must trust me.

206
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,017
Kong Hou.

207
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,536
Kong Hou.

208
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,656
Jiusu, wait!

209
00:09:57,936 --> 00:09:58,816
I should take

210
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,896
their lives myself.

211
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,257
You'd kill them?

212
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:05,416
Kong Hou.

213
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,776
Help them up.

214
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,337
Lin Hu.

215
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,497
K-Kong Hou.

216
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:17,576
What do you want?

217
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,296
You've fallen into my hands today.

218
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:22,776
You really have bad luck.

219
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,656
We got you the Soul Anchoring Lamp.

220
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,257
Do you know what we've gone through?

221
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,896
I never asked you to do so.

222
00:10:27,896 --> 00:10:28,656
Alright.

223
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,097
You want to kill?

224
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:31,896
Then kill me.

225
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:32,977
Let Ling Bo go.

226
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:34,056
Kill me.

227
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,977
Then I'll kill you first.

228
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:38,536
No.

229
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,056
I decided to do so.

230
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,176
Just kill me.

231
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,337
Ling Bo.

232
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,257
Then you two die together.

233
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,936
You're overestimating yourselves,

234
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,457
simply seeking death.

235
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:06,617
Kong Hou.

236
00:11:07,257 --> 00:11:08,512
Since they want to be a pair

237
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,536
of pathetic lovers,

238
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,137
let's bury them together.

239
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,320
Burying them

240
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,656
would be too merciful.

241
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,896
Leave their corpses
to rot in the wilderness.

242
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,816
These two are truly detestable.

243
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,656
The Ascension Ceremony's approaching,

244
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,097
yet they came to cause trouble.

245
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,656
Disgusting!

246
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,416
Kong Hou,

247
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,017
you've become

248
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,737
very different from before.

249
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,576
How so?

250
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,576
Am I not the sister

251
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,217
you never trust?

252
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,097
I never said I didn't trust you.

253
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:39,497
I've always trusted you.

254
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:40,457
Trust me?

255
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:41,857
Fine.

256
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,800
Then take me to cultivate

257
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,176
the Dark Cloud Tablet tomorrow.

258
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:49,457
Okay.

259
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:50,977
Tomorrow,

260
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:52,480
we'll cultivate

261
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,337
together,

262
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:54,816
and ascend sooner.

263
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:04,497
Zhong Xi.

264
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:05,457
Zhong Xi.

265
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,097
I was delayed by Wu Bei,

266
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,776
and just got rid of him.

267
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,176
Did you

268
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,217
ever go to Liuguang Sect

269
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:17,936
to kill my fellows and injure my master?

270
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:19,217
What happened

271
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,576
to Lin Hu and Ling Bo?

272
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,176
I swear to you,

273
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:23,776
I've never harmed

274
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,457
anyone from Liuguang Sect.

275
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,617
Nor did I kill Lin Hu or Ling Bo.

276
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,097
Anyway,

277
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,497
I'll explain

278
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,857
everything

279
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,696
to you properly.

280
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,377
Come with me.

281
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:58,576
Master Zhong Xi.

282
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,017
It's really Master Zhong Xi.

283
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:00,617
Master.

284
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,696
I'm glad that you're fine.

285
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:02,776
Are you all okay?

286
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:04,416
Ask them yourself

287
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:05,936
what I did

288
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,017
at Liuguang Sect.

289
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:09,816
Were you all captured by Kong Hou?

290
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:10,816
Yes.

291
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,617
That demon Kong Hou

292
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:13,617
brought us here.

293
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,656
Did she torment you?

294
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:18,257
Well, no.

295
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,056
What did she do

296
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,137
at Liuguang Sect?

297
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,936
Did she kill or injure

298
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,296
our master?

299
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,257
She only came with dark cultivators

300
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,457
to threaten us

301
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,137
with your life,

302
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,977
demanding ten disciples

303
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,137
to come here with her.

304
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:37,017
The head was worried about you,

305
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:38,536
so we came here willingly.

306
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,896
You came here willingly?

307
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,536
Then what about Chang Le?

308
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:44,377
When I saw him,

309
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,656
he was barely alive,

310
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,377
accusing Kong Hou killed our fellows

311
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,457
and injured our master.

312
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:51,296
You mean Senior Chang Le?

313
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,617
He was taken yesterday

314
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,257
by Wu Bei

315
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,217
and never returned.

316
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,400
- Yes.
- Exactly.

317
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:18,816
Ling Bo.

318
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:19,977
Ling Bo, wake up.

319
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:22,848
- Ling Bo.
- Lin Hu.

320
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,257
Lin Hu.

321
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,728
Lin Hu.

322
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:41,696
Where are we?

323
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:45,896
Are we in the netherworld?

324
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:46,497
I...

325
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:47,457
I don't know

326
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:48,816
if this is the netherworld.

327
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,097
D-Don't cry.

328
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:54,656
D-Don't cry.

329
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:59,217
I never imagined I'd die like this.

330
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,217
D-Don't cry.

331
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,760
I haven't even surpassed

332
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,176
Senior Chang De,

333
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,696
or become the Head yet.

334
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,712
- Don't cry. Calm down.
- Why would I die?

335
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:08,656
Calm down, Ling Bo.

336
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,536
I haven't even

337
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:13,816
been kissed by someone I love.

338
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,296
S-Stop crying, Ling Bo.

339
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:17,337
Ling Bo.

340
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,536
What did you do?

341
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:38,337
I...

342
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,497
I don't know either.

343
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:52,857
Ling Bo, look.

344
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:53,760
A firefly.

345
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,097
Enough. You!

346
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,257
- What did you do to me?
- It hurts!

347
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:58,416
Ghosts don't get hurt.

348
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,457
Ghosts don't get hurt.

349
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:00,512
But it really hurts!

350
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:01,137
Ling Bo.

351
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:03,936
Ling Bo, it really hurts.

352
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,497
We're not ghosts yet.

353
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,137
What?

354
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:08,296
Wait.

355
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,097
It hurts.

356
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:11,056
Does this hurt?

357
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:12,737
Does this hurt?

358
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:14,737
I told you

359
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,344
- w-we can feel...
- How dare you pinch me!

360
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,737
- How dare you!
- It hurts!

361
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:19,737
Ling Bo.

362
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:20,536
Look.

363
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:21,696
Are my hands warm?

364
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:27,137
Yes.

365
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:27,857
Right?

366
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:29,257
We're still alive.

367
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:30,416
Exactly.

368
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,017
- Alive.
- Alive.

369
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:35,097
But didn't Kong Hou

370
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,536
just kill us?

371
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:38,097
Let me check.

372
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:39,936
Healed.

373
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:41,176
Doesn't hurt.

374
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,176
M-Mine doesn't hurt too.

375
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,257
Neither do you?

376
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,097
(Meet at Qingquan Inn)
Meet at Qingquan Inn

377
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,576
(in Yong City in three days.)
in Yong City in three days.

378
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,337
This handwriting...

379
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,097
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou.

380
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,737
Xiao Pei secretly told me

381
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:05,737
about this path.

382
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:07,536
This is where I sent

383
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,457
Lin Hu and Ling Bo away.

384
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,497
You didn't kill them?

385
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:15,497
They should be waking up soon.

386
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,177
It's Lin Hu's messenger talisman.

387
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,897
Young Master, Ling Bo and I are safe.

388
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,096
Kong Hou saved us.

389
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,417
Now we're going to confront

390
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,017
who tried to kill you.

391
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:37,217
Wait.

392
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:41,017
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:42,897
I misunderstood you

394
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,417
and hurt you.

395
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:48,296
Don't mind it.

396
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:51,177
Anyone in this situation

397
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,336
would instinctively

398
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,136
misunderstand me,

399
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:56,457
even for just a moment.

400
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,417
Sometimes I wonder

401
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,816
when I will

402
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,056
break down.

403
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:09,536
Then I'll go mad, lose my mind

404
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,136
even give up.

405
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:13,177
Now,

406
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,497
the one who should trust you

407
00:18:15,497 --> 00:18:16,417
is me.

408
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,336
The one who shouldn't doubt you

409
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:20,217
is also me.

410
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:22,816
Yet I...

411
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:28,776
Sorry, Kong Hou.

412
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:31,136
The entire Lingyou Realm

413
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:32,697
sees you as a traitor.

414
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:36,336
I should support you.

415
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:39,737
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:44,856
The entire Lingyou Realm

417
00:18:44,856 --> 00:18:46,296
sees me as a traitor.

418
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:48,296
I thought

419
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:50,616
I still had you.

420
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:11,816
It will never happen again.

421
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:15,697
This is all my fault.

422
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:20,497
(Yunhua Sect)
Senior,

423
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:22,217
as your instructions,

424
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,897
I've added four more barriers

425
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:26,657
to prevent dark cultivators
from invading again.

426
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:27,536
Good.

427
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,177
Tan Feng and Ling Hui got captured.

428
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,136
The disciples are in low spirits,

429
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:37,657
even slacking off on their cultivation.

430
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:40,816
- Master.
- Master.

431
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,096
Kids.

432
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,897
With me here,

433
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:45,776
Yunhua Sect will stand.

434
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,136
Cheer up

435
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,257
and focus on cultivation.

436
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,616
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,177
Senior,

438
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,296
you must be exhausted.

439
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,336
Perhaps

440
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,136
go to rest early.

441
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,977
How could I rest?

442
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,217
So many matters happened.

443
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,136
I can't rest in ease.

444
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,296
Are you

445
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:19,177
worried about Kong Hou?

446
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,056
Kong Hou has been thoughtful.

447
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,376
I remember

448
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,977
when her birthday came,

449
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:14,497
we would

450
00:21:14,497 --> 00:21:17,017
ask what gifts she desired.

451
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,417
Yet she always

452
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,897
only requested storybooks.

453
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:23,336
Indeed.

454
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:25,136
I remember

455
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:26,056
you gifted her

456
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:27,816
a hair ribbon.

457
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,497
She tied it in her hair

458
00:21:29,737 --> 00:21:30,977
and beamed with joy.

459
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:32,697
She even came

460
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,336
to show it off to every one of us.

461
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:37,257
She'd engrave every small kindness

462
00:21:37,257 --> 00:21:39,136
in her heart.

463
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:41,897
She keeps all those gifts

464
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:44,217
you gave her in a chest.

465
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,056
Among all my disciples,

466
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:49,257
she's the most well-behaved,

467
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,417
most obedient,

468
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:51,737
and most considerate.

469
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:52,856
Indeed.

470
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,856
Kong Hou is truly a nice kid.

471
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,977
I wish she isn't the bloodline

472
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:01,977
of dark cultivators.

473
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,657
What's wrong with that?

474
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,184
She can't choose it

475
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:05,897
herself.

476
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:07,217
It's not her fault.

477
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,497
Alright.

478
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:11,136
Senior, calm down.

479
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:13,017
I'm aware of all this.

480
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:14,776
Then why did you say so?

481
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:52,416
The Dark Cloud Tablet
doesn't just amplify

482
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,737
the Ascension Array's energy,

483
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:56,257
also contains ancient spiritual relics.

484
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:57,897
Truly amazing.

485
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,417
Jiusu, may I see it?

486
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:11,816
(Wind, Ox, Horse.)

487
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,177
(Inch of Land.)

488
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:14,816
(Timely Rain.)

489
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:16,257
(Grain Grows.)

490
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:29,457
Hand it over first.

491
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:30,536
We'll continue tomorrow.

492
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,897
Jiusu, don't be petty.

493
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,457
Let me check a while longer.

494
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,217
We'll continue tomorrow.

495
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,536
Don't rush on cultivation.

496
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:41,417
Don't make excuses.

497
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,616
Fine, I won't look.

498
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:29,576
(Jiusu's power grows every day.)

499
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:31,576
(I must find the final herb,)

500
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:32,497
(Dragonblood Herb)

501
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:34,776
(to restore Zhong Xi's spiritual core.)

502
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:45,897
(Where would Jiusu hide)

503
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,217
(the Dark Cloud Tablet?)

504
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:01,816
Wind, Ox, Horse. Inch of Land.

505
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:04,177
Timely Rain. Grain Grows.

506
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:18,217
Found it.

507
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:20,457
Jiusu hid this well.

508
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,497
Why are there

509
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:50,816
so many cabinets here?

510
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:52,776
How to search it?

511
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:01,096
Dragonblood Herbs thrive in shade,

512
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,177
avoiding bright light.

513
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,257
See this orb?

514
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:18,296
It's the Solar Radiance Orb,

515
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:19,897
plant nemesis.

516
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:24,457
Under its radiance,

517
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,296
within half an incense stick's time,

518
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,576
all your leaves will

519
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:32,017
fall off.

520
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,017
Within an incense stick's time,

521
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,737
you'll wither entirely

522
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,136
and die.

523
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:39,697
My lord,

524
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:40,992
I saw Kong Hou

525
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:41,816
entered again.

526
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,217
Right after cultivating with you,

527
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:44,697
why would she sneak back in?

528
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,376
Nothing seems suspicious here.

529
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:52,497
I set up a barrier.

530
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,697
My lord, no offense.

531
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:56,697
Is it possible

532
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:58,177
she broke your barrier?

533
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:03,457
What's it saying?

534
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:05,457
Blood.

535
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,657
Blood.

536
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:08,816
Blood?

537
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:10,977
What blood?

538
00:27:11,616 --> 00:27:12,576
Are you

539
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,376
suggesting

540
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:17,056
Dragonblood Herbs craves blood?

541
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,017
My blood

542
00:27:20,897 --> 00:27:22,096
is freshest.

543
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:26,897
If you grant me

544
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,217
one Dragonblood Herb,

545
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,376
I'll offer my blood as tribute.

546
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,217
Thank you.

547
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:57,697
How would this happen?

548
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,376
The Dragonblood Herbs

549
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,616
cannot leave the secret realm?

550
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:06,016
(Everything is in balance.
No pain, no gain.)

551
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,217
Everything is in balance.

552
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,897
No pain, no gain.

553
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,576
What does it mean?

554
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,136
My lord, look!

555
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,856
She did break your barrier.

556
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:22,136
If she didn't mean ill,

557
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,737
why broke your barrier?

558
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:26,257
She's suspicious.

559
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,257
Oh no, they've spotted me.

560
00:28:31,257 --> 00:28:32,096
Kong Hou!

561
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,257
What are you doing?

562
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:36,776
Are you blind?

563
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,937
Can't you see me
practicing the Ascension Array?

564
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,257
Your sudden intrusion

565
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,217
nearly caused my qi deviation.

566
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:43,417
You're lying.

567
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,136
My lord, she's hiding something.

568
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:47,776
Seeking death!

569
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:49,728
You've sown discord

570
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,737
again and again.

571
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:52,776
Deserve death!

572
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:53,457
Enough.

573
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:55,257
Just a misunderstanding.

574
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:58,217
I've been practicing it for so long,

575
00:28:58,257 --> 00:28:59,497
yet can't master it.

576
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:01,017
I simply wanted

577
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,217
to practice more.

578
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,177
If you disapprove,

579
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,776
I'll cease.

580
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,937
Let none of us ascend then.

581
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,497
My lord,

582
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:21,977
don't nurture a viper in your bosom.

583
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,937
She must be scheming something.

584
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:29,856
Hurry.

585
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:31,096
Move!

586
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:34,536
Move!

587
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:37,504
Hurry!

588
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:38,376
Behave.

589
00:29:43,136 --> 00:29:44,672
Outrageous!

590
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,977
Not here.

591
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:52,616
Move!

592
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:55,457
I never expected

593
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:57,217
Yong City would be like this.

594
00:29:58,657 --> 00:30:00,737
It's all Jiusu's fault.

595
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,616
Zhong Xi, what's wrong?

596
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:19,336
During last night's cultivation,

597
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,737
my energy flow reversed.

598
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:23,576
Reversed?

599
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,616
How do you feel now?

600
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,697
Chaotic energy surges within.

601
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,136
This won't do.

602
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:31,977
I'll regulate your energy.

603
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,776
(The Harmony Sync)

604
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:38,056
(requires utmost tranquility.)

605
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:40,096
(You got disturbed last night.)

606
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:42,457
(It disrupted your energy,)

607
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:43,737
(causing energy flow reversed.)

608
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:44,576
(Moreover,)

609
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:46,497
(your spiritual core remains unstable.)

610
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:47,937
(Immediate cultivation needed.)

611
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,376
Zhong Xi, how do you feel now?

612
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:19,217
Much better now.

613
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:20,296
By the way,

614
00:31:20,376 --> 00:31:21,897
there's something I must tell you.

615
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:24,257
In Jiusu's
Dark Cloud Tablet's secret realm,

616
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,697
I found the Dragonblood Herb.

617
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,336
Once I obtain it,

618
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:29,257
I can restore your spiritual core.

619
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,296
Thank you, Kong Hou.

620
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,457
I've told you.

621
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:37,017
No need for thanks between us.

622
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,536
Then I won't say it.

623
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:46,977
Kneel!

624
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,376
- Kneel!
- Kneel!

625
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:49,856
Beat them hard!

626
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:50,697
Stop!

627
00:31:53,136 --> 00:31:55,136
Why haven't I seen you before?

628
00:31:55,177 --> 00:31:56,616
There are many you've never seen.

629
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,417
Mind your business.

630
00:31:57,536 --> 00:31:58,536
What do you mean?

631
00:31:58,536 --> 00:31:59,697
The Sovereign has emphasized

632
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:01,417
she wanted healthy, strong cultivators.

633
00:32:01,497 --> 00:32:02,697
Yet you beat them hard.

634
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:03,856
How will she cultivate then?

635
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:05,056
Then tell us,

636
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,217
what should we do now?

637
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:07,257
The Sovereign needs

638
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:08,937
intact spiritual energy vessels,

639
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,776
not these barely-living wrecks!

640
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:12,457
We'll take them.

641
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,440
You'd get some more.

642
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:14,616
Take them.

643
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:15,217
Go!

644
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,376
- Move!
- Move!

645
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,417
Stop playing dead!

646
00:32:18,697 --> 00:32:19,457
Get up!

647
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:20,376
Move!

648
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:21,952
Move!

649
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:23,096
Look.

650
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:24,257
Stop!

651
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:26,417
You're not one of us.

652
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:28,497
Who are you exactly?

653
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,728
We're the ones
who beat down wicked people!

654
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,576
Where's Kong Hou now?

655
00:32:37,217 --> 00:32:38,576
She's remained in her room

656
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:39,576
without coming out.

657
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:42,296
Good then.

658
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:43,657
Just make sure she behaves

659
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,977
until the Ascension Ceremony.

660
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:47,737
My lord, I think

661
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:48,417
Kong Hou

662
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:50,177
has never behaved.

663
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:51,257
With her doors shut,

664
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,937
who knows what she's scheming?

665
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:54,376
I think

666
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:55,576
we should

667
00:32:55,576 --> 00:32:57,657
send people to monitor her.

668
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,497
What could she scheme

669
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,217
in her room?

670
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:07,816
Alright.

671
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:09,257
You may leave now.

672
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:10,776
Understood.

673
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:34,017
Thank you both for saving us.

674
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:35,457
No need. Leave now.

675
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:36,616
Farewell.

676
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:43,737
Let me handle

677
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:44,497
the fighting.

678
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:45,417
You'd stay behind me.

679
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,217
What? Think I'm weak?

680
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,576
We fight together!

681
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:50,017
I don't think you're weak.

682
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:51,017
But

683
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,776
fighting is too dangerous for you.

684
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:53,696
Then,

685
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,816
you can stay behind me

686
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:55,897
and I'd protect you.

687
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:57,177
I know you're a fighter

688
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:58,616
and your cultivation is advanced.

689
00:33:58,776 --> 00:33:59,737
But

690
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:03,816
I want you to stay behind me.

691
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:05,376
Let me handle

692
00:34:05,497 --> 00:34:06,616
such dangers from now on.

693
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,176
I know.

694
00:34:10,497 --> 00:34:12,897
I know what you mean.

695
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:15,497
Actually,

696
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:18,096
I have something to tell you.

697
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:19,417
G-Go ahead.

698
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:21,857
That day at the Dark Cultivator Hall,

699
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,497
you shielded me from Jiusu.

700
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,377
At that time, I thought

701
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:26,417
I couldn't just

702
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:28,136
be someone you protect.

703
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:29,777
I have to protect you too.

704
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:31,216
From now on,

705
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:33,736
we face everything together.

706
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:35,696
And...

707
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:37,777
- I...
- Ling Bo.

708
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:39,937
- I...
- I don't even know

709
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:40,897
what to say now.

710
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:41,616
You know I...

711
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:44,297
- I haven't finished.
- You go on.

712
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,337
Actually,

713
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:49,377
I really like you.

714
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,777
And I want to stay with you.

715
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:54,417
Like me?

716
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:57,417
Want to stay with me?

717
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:12,497
You dummy.

718
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,417
I...

719
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:19,777
Then would you marry me?

720
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:21,984
It's an honor for you

721
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,256
to marry me.

722
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,417
Yet you're hesitating?

723
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,216
I-I'm not hesitating.

724
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:27,777
Ling Bo.

725
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:30,897
Don't you mind
that I'm a demon cultivator?

726
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,817
We've faced death together.

727
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:34,216
Why would mind such things now?

728
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:37,897
Well? Do you want it?

729
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,497
Yes.

730
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:40,777
Yes, I do.

731
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,256
I really do.
