16
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,262
Why did you come?

17
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:43,501
Of course,

18
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,102
for the Ascension Ceremony.

19
00:01:45,342 --> 00:01:46,822
The ascension's coming,

20
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,102
I strongly advise you
to be extra cautious.

21
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,742
On the day of ascension,

22
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,822
not the slightest error
can be tolerated.

23
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:53,781
I understand.

24
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,542
Do you come just to say that?

25
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,141
And Kong Hou.

26
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,622
Beware of Kong Hou

27
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,861
allying with Zhong Xi.

28
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:06,021
Zhong Xi's cultivation
is nearly depleted.

29
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,221
He's useless now.

30
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,062
Even if Kong Hou loves him,

31
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:10,062
so what?

32
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:12,781
It's normal for girls

33
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,261
to have a crush.

34
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,862
I advise you to act with caution.

35
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,701
Kong Hou is my sister.

36
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,302
We share one mind,

37
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:21,821
and won't fail anything.

38
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,941
Share one mind?

39
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,101
She obeys you now

40
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,022
only because

41
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,381
you're using Zhong Xi as leverage.

42
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,022
When has Kong Hou ever

43
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,261
treated you as her brother?

44
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,941
That's not up to her.

45
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:35,941
With the critical event approaching,

46
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,781
arrogance and imprudence
might defeat you.

47
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:39,622
Act with caution.

48
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:40,462
Enough.

49
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:41,862
Got it.

50
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,661
I think

51
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,622
you should leave.

52
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:47,261
If anyone discovers you,

53
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:48,701
that would truly

54
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,902
ruin the ascension.

55
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,302
No need for concern.

56
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:53,182
I'll act with caution.

57
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,501
Keep close watch on Kong Hou.

58
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:56,902
If the ascension fails

59
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,342
because of her,

60
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:01,541
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

61
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,541
Dragonblood Herb.

62
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,701
This time,

63
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,422
I have to take you with me.

64
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,062
Before my journey,

65
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,221
my master gave me

66
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,342
this Infinite Divine Water.

67
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:25,536
If a cultivator

68
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,661
drinks this,

69
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:28,381
he'll gain limitless spiritual energy

70
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:29,981
for a brief period.

71
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,501
I'll trade this with you.

72
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:33,302
How about it?

73
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,462
It failed again.

74
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,821
This is called the Ruxian Fruit,

75
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,501
the most popular spiritual fruit

76
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:00,422
in Lingyou Realm.

77
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,821
You'll love it.

78
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,461
This is the Fairy Dress,

79
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,021
my most precious possession.

80
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,102
Nothing works.

81
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,862
What do you want?

82
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:54,742
(The Harmony Sync)

83
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:56,782
(truly can revive the dead.)

84
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:05,501
What do I do

85
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,662
to make you accept this trade?

86
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:08,901
Kong Hou,

87
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:10,862
stay calm.

88
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:12,622
Earlier,

89
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,742
when consulting that healer,

90
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,662
I recall him mentioning

91
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:23,182
these divine herbs
disdain worldly things.

92
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,102
He said

93
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,862
they prefer...

94
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,422
Today is your lucky day.

95
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:37,341
Even Zhong Xi has never heard me

96
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:39,501
play the phoenix-headed konghou.

97
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:18,622
This time,

98
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,261
you must come with me.

99
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:43,701
Great!

100
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,501
I did it!

101
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,141
Kong Hou.

102
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:50,701
Zhong Xi,

103
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,701
I have a surprise for you.

104
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:53,982
What surprise?

105
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:58,341
I obtained the Dragonblood Herb

106
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,742
from the secret realm.

107
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:00,742
Here.

108
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,141
You must've gone through
a lot to get this.

109
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:19,782
Did you encounter any dangers?

110
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,141
What danger

111
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,581
could there be?

112
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:24,581
I just wanted to surprise you.

113
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:25,302
About

114
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:27,862
the Harmony Sync

115
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:28,862
you've been studying,

116
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:29,901
any progress?

117
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,021
Speaking of Harmony Sync,

118
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,461
let me show you something.

119
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:35,422
Come with me.

120
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:38,062
Look.

121
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,141
Why do

122
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:43,141
the flowers grow on the stones?

123
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:44,222
Watch carefully.

124
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,302
Zhong Xi, you've mastered it.

125
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:52,662
Does this mean

126
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:53,782
we can counter

127
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:55,141
Jiusu's Ascension Array?

128
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:56,862
Currently, I

129
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,542
can only achieve this much.

130
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,302
But if we work together,

131
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,182
we could surely

132
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,542
give Jiusu a surprise

133
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,381
on his Ascension Array.

134
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:26,622
Fantastic!

135
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:28,062
Then once Young Master

136
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:29,701
restores his spiritual core,

137
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,222
he can definitely

138
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:31,862
subdue Jiusu.

139
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,581
Harmony Sync?

140
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,142
I've never heard of this before.

141
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,461
Zhong Xi and I

142
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,662
need practice more.

143
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:40,581
Hope we'll have enough time.

144
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,701
I came to you

145
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,581
because

146
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,941
I need your support

147
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,701
for this operation.

148
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,101
While Zhong Xi and I

149
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,542
are fighting against Jiusu,

150
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,341
we need someone

151
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:51,821
to rescue the sect disciples.

152
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,101
We got this.

153
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:53,782
Don't worry.

154
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,552
This operation is perilous.

155
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,472
Be extra cautious.

156
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:58,902
You and Zhong Xi

157
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:00,662
are the one who will
face the real danger.

158
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:01,542
Don't worry.

159
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:02,581
Lin Hu and I

160
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,872
will spare no effort.

161
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,856
How is your preparation

162
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,062
going?

163
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,542
When will you activate the array?

164
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,941
Your Eminence, My Lord.

165
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,741
The ones we selected
from the Ten Great Sects

166
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,502
are all high-level cultivators

167
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,542
from each sect.

168
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,502
They can be used

169
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,621
to power the Ascension Array.

170
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:53,741
Bring them in.

171
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:54,701
Yes.

172
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,221
Kneel now.

173
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,341
Greet the Lord and the Sovereign.

174
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,902
We'd never

175
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,302
kneel to dark cultivators.

176
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:19,302
What did you say?

177
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:21,902
Don't even dream of us

178
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:22,941
aiding your ascension.

179
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,502
Ling Hui.

180
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:26,701
I don't think Kong Hou has changed.

181
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,062
Neither do I.

182
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:33,861
Please endure a little longer.

183
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:34,821
Tan Feng.

184
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,461
How can you still be so naive?

185
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:37,782
Take a good look

186
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,062
at her.

187
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,741
I have

188
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:44,621
no patience for your drivel.

189
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:46,981
Jiusu,

190
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,101
since you've brought them all here,

191
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,662
are you prepared

192
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:51,821
to activate the array?

193
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:52,502
Exactly.

194
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:54,941
Are you ready?

195
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:56,782
If yes,

196
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:58,422
at dawn tomorrow,

197
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,101
we'll activate the array.

198
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,262
Okay. Tomorrow it is.

199
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,422
Kong Hou.

200
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:17,941
You came.

201
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:20,221
Zhong Xi,

202
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,981
you look much better than before.

203
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,062
Has your spiritual core

204
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:25,056
been restored?

205
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,341
It's fully restored.

206
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:28,621
All thanks to you.

207
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:30,821
Without your help,

208
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,902
I couldn't get all the spirit herbs
or restore my spiritual core.

209
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:35,101
However,

210
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,461
even with my spiritual core restored,

211
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,262
we still don't master

212
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,662
the Harmony Sync.

213
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,101
Jiusu will

214
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,662
activate the Ascension Array tomorrow.

215
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,542
Let's make the most of tonight.

216
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,302
Maybe we can achieve it.

217
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:55,872
Stop it.

218
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,302
I've told you

219
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,861
Kong Hou will send us a signal.

220
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,502
I'm worrying.

221
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,502
What if...

222
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,302
I'm just saying,

223
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:03,981
what if they

224
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:05,408
can't handle Jiusu?

225
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:07,262
Kong Hou said

226
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:08,221
they've found

227
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,542
a way to subdue Jiusu.

228
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,182
Don't worry.

229
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:10,861
But...

230
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,542
Enough.

231
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,382
Anyway,

232
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,701
they told us to wait here.

233
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,341
Then do as they said.

234
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:17,741
Fine.

235
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,101
Your call then.

236
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,581
How about

237
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:21,861
finding you something fun?

238
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,142
Something fun?

239
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:25,502
We're in the middle

240
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,621
of nowhere.

241
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:27,821
Where's the fun?

242
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,142
Wait here.

243
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,461
Stay put. Wait here.

244
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,221
Stay put. Wait here.

245
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,182
Where are you going?

246
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,182
Wait for me.

247
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,341
Why isn't Lin Hu back yet?

248
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,221
Finding fun takes this long?

249
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:46,902
You're back.

250
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:48,461
For you.

251
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,221
What's this?

252
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:51,302
Grass?

253
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,821
This isn't ordinary grass.

254
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,382
This is called Fox Laugh Grass.

255
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:56,864
Fox Laugh Grass?

256
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:58,782
Most people don't know,

257
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,182
but we foxes fear it most.

258
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,341
So,

259
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:08,782
why give me this?

260
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:09,502
Well,

261
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,624
didn't you say

262
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,744
we're getting married?

263
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,382
I should give you some betrothal gifts.

264
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:14,821
So you gave me this grass?

265
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:15,621
I told you

266
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,861
it's not ordinary grass.

267
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,701
If you make me eat this,

268
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,902
I'll obey your every word.

269
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:21,821
Then,

270
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,341
I'll lose all awareness.

271
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:29,502
If you lack money,

272
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:30,502
just tell me.

273
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:31,542
I have money.

274
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,581
What did you say?

275
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,662
E-Even if I lack money,

276
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:36,502
I'd earn

277
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:37,568
mountains of gold

278
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,382
- for you.
- Alright.

279
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,741
I get your sincerity.

280
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:41,701
Alright.

281
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,142
Is this grass

282
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,821
- that amazing?
- Absolutely.

283
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:46,701
Try it if you...

284
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:48,864
Alright.

285
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:55,502
Act cute.

286
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,741
Impressive.

287
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:04,741
Zhong Xi,

288
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,741
if your Harmony Sync

289
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,302
destroys the Ascension Array,

290
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:10,581
what will happen

291
00:14:11,262 --> 00:14:12,182
to Jiusu?

292
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,542
Reduced to ashes.

293
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:17,662
Kong Hou,

294
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:18,981
I know

295
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:21,302
this pains you.

296
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,422
But if...

297
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:24,621
I understand.

298
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,461
It feels so unreal to me.

299
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:29,461
Everything that's happened

300
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,062
feels like a dream.

301
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,382
Before, I had no family

302
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,022
and never felt upset.

303
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,022
Because

304
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:40,022
I had Master,

305
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:42,502
senior brothers, senior sisters,

306
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,461
and fellows.

307
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,302
I have so many people who cherished me.

308
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:48,821
And I had you.

309
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:49,941
But now,

310
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,461
I found my brother.

311
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,022
He's evil,

312
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:56,182
but...

313
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:58,981
I often wonder

314
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:00,581
if I should

315
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,142
treat my brother

316
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:03,741
better.

317
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:04,741
After all,

318
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:06,502
that's

319
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:09,022
what family should do.

320
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:10,461
But Kong Hou,

321
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:12,782
in this world,

322
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,461
there's nothing you should

323
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:16,861
or must do.

324
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,062
Just follow your heart.

325
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,221
That's the only right way.

326
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:22,902
If you truly

327
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,461
can't harm him,

328
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:27,341
I would never

329
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:28,821
force you

330
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:31,101
to do so.

331
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:33,302
Deep down,

332
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:35,701
I hope to stop him

333
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:37,382
from committing wicked deeds.

334
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,461
But if I fail

335
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,542
to stop him,

336
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:40,821
then he must face

337
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:41,981
the consequences he deserves.

338
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,422
What are the consequences I deserve?

339
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:54,701
Do you really think

340
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,022
I knew nothing

341
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,302
about your

342
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:00,221
secret meetings?

343
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,581
What a pity.

344
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,581
I fail to drive a wedge between you.

345
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:04,861
Otherwise,

346
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,981
I wouldn't need to make such efforts.

347
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:08,662
I advise you to stop now.

348
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,142
Stop now?

349
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:12,941
Stop what?

350
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:14,581
The Ascension Array

351
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,680
will never stop

352
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,941
because of the two of you.

353
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:20,621
Kong Hou,

354
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,741
only Zhong Xi's death

355
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:23,981
will make you obedient

356
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,382
to activate the array with me.

357
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:26,621
I remember

358
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,981
I planted a Gu parasite

359
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,542
inside you.

360
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,662
You've expelled the Gu parasite?

361
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,262
So,

362
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:48,621
you've restored your spiritual core?

363
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,182
I forgot to mention

364
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:52,581
my cultivation level

365
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,861
has surpassed Void Unity.

366
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:55,662
Even you've restored
your spiritual core,

367
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,422
you can't defeat me either.

368
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,701
I know my current strength

369
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:01,941
can't kill you,

370
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,861
but even so,

371
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:05,901
I'll fight you

372
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,421
to the end.

373
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,621
Seek death?

374
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,141
I'll grant you.

375
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:11,782
Don't harm him.

376
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:12,861
Move!

377
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:14,581
Kong Hou.

378
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:31,262
Zhong Xi!

379
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:44,942
Zhong Xi.

380
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,181
Zhong Xi.

381
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,821
Zhong Xi, look at me.

382
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:51,942
Are you okay?

383
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:53,262
Don't scare me.

384
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:55,062
You'll be fine.

385
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,181
I won't let anything happen to you.

386
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,782
- Zhong Xi.
- I didn't expect I'm so useless.

387
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:02,621
Take care

388
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:04,942
of yourself.

389
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:07,262
No!

390
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,222
Don't leave me!

391
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,861
Don't leave me!

392
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,168
I won't let you die.

393
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:16,341
Zhong Xi.

394
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:20,222
- Don't leave me.
- Kong Hou, stop it.

395
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:21,742
He's dead.

396
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:22,661
I advise you

397
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,062
to obey.

398
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,062
After ascension,

399
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:27,782
you can do

400
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,222
whatever you want.

401
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:31,702
But if you defy me,

402
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,381
and I'll make you

403
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:35,982
suffer.

404
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,062
Zhong Xi.

405
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:45,222
Zhong Xi.

406
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,062
I won't let you die.

407
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:51,581
There must be a way.

408
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:54,022
They must be a way to save you.

409
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,782
They must be.

410
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:57,821
Master Huang Qi.

411
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:00,821
He once said

412
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,062
the Phoenix Essence could

413
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:04,702
save you.

414
00:19:06,222 --> 00:19:08,222
As long as I extract
my Phoenix Essence...

415
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:12,581
Zhong Xi.

416
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,542
I will definitely save you.

417
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:03,742
Zhong Xi.

418
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,621
After extracting the Phoenix Essence,

419
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,181
my time will be running out.

420
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,062
But

421
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:18,022
you must live on for me.

422
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:33,942
Everything's done?

423
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:38,341
Kong Hou,

424
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,702
cheer up.

425
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:41,702
After ascension,

426
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,982
these worldly worries will vanish.

427
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:44,942
Look!

428
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,062
We're about to ascend.

429
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,222
I've been waiting for this day

430
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,222
for so long.

431
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,421
Had we reunited earlier,

432
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:58,462
we might have ascended long ago.

433
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:01,141
Without me,

434
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:03,222
you could still ascend.

435
00:21:03,302 --> 00:21:04,502
It's not the same.

436
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,502
Our joint cultivation,

437
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,581
and blood sacrifices

438
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:09,262
of the Ten Great Sects' elite disciples,

439
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,222
will make the ascension smoothly.

440
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,421
If our parents knew

441
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,861
we siblings work together like this,

442
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:17,262
they'd be pleased.

443
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,262
The dead are gone.

444
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:23,742
What's there to be pleased?

445
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,782
Fine, whatever.

446
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,742
I have matters to attend to.

447
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,702
You stay here and figure out

448
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,062
if it's worth it

449
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:35,782
for a man.

450
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:06,462
(I...)

451
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:10,542
(I'm still alive.)

452
00:22:17,821 --> 00:22:18,821
Zhong Xi!

453
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,341
Look at me.

454
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,661
Don't scare me.

455
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:23,381
You'll be fine.

456
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,381
I won't let you die.

457
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,942
(Wasn't I killed by Jiusu?)

458
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:29,421
(How is this possible?)

459
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:35,542
(Kong Hou.)

460
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:37,861
(Kong Hou.)

461
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:08,982
Whose Heavenly Tribulation?

462
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:13,062
Sovereign Kong Hou?

463
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,942
Kong Hou?

464
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:19,942
How could she withstand
such thunder strikes?

465
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:22,222
Any misstep

466
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:24,302
would kill her.

467
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,302
Who's advancing their cultivation level?

468
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,901
Only a few people
in the Dark Cultivator Hall can

469
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:34,302
advance their cultivation level.

470
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:35,821
Is it...

471
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,341
It's Zhong Xi.

472
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,421
Impossible.

473
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:42,022
The Phoenix Essence

474
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:43,502
could revive the dead.

475
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:45,222
But it requires three days

476
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,421
to take effect.

477
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:49,462
He's revived already?

478
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:51,542
But how can he withstand

479
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,262
the thunder strikes?

480
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,222
Kong Hou.

481
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,581
Were you advancing
your cultivation level just now?

482
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:33,861
No.

483
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:35,742
Such thunder strikes...

484
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:37,062
It must be Zhong Xi.

485
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:38,336
He's dead.

486
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:39,742
How could he do so?

487
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,542
You're being delusional.

488
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:43,542
Then what's going on
with the thunder strikes?

489
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,341
Wu Bei.

490
00:24:44,502 --> 00:24:46,141
Are you questioning me again?

491
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:48,942
I wouldn't dare.

492
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,262
You clearly do.

493
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:53,462
Another word,

494
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,702
and I'll sacrifice you to the array.

495
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,022
The ascension is approaching.

496
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,341
I won't allow anyone

497
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,062
to disrupt my ascension.

498
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,621
The Ten Great Sects' disciples

499
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:06,141
must be nearby now.

500
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,302
Jiusu,

501
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:08,421
no time to waste.

502
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,222
Let's depart now

503
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,181
to avoid complications.

504
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:40,581
What's this?

505
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:41,661
A messenger talisman?

506
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,702
Why is it so weird?

507
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:43,904
It is Liuguang Sect's

508
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:44,581
talisman.

509
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:47,381
An emergency messenger talisman
requires heart's blood to activate.

510
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:48,576
Young Master must be

511
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:49,581
in danger.

512
00:25:49,702 --> 00:25:50,661
I need to go with you.

513
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:51,581
No, it's too dangerous.

514
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:52,462
Kong Hou told us

515
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,542
to wait here for her.

516
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,341
If she arrives

517
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:55,982
and finds no one here, that'd be bad.

518
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,581
Well, I'll go find Young Master.

519
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,621
You'd stay here.

520
00:25:58,982 --> 00:25:59,942
Alright.

521
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:03,742
Be careful.

522
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,181
Be careful! I'll wait for your return.

523
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,542
Move!

524
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,942
Move! Hurry!

525
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:16,782
Hurry up!

526
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,581
- Hurry!
- Or I'll kill you!

527
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:20,542
Don't touch me.

528
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:22,942
Let me tell you the truth.

529
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:23,821
Even Zhong Xi

530
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:24,982
is no match for us.

531
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:26,502
How dare you oppose us?

532
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:27,222
Move!

533
00:26:39,742 --> 00:26:40,942
Master Zhong Xi.

534
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:43,661
Don't stay here.

535
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,861
You two go back now.

536
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:45,782
- What about you?
- But...

537
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:46,861
I'll go save Kong Hou.

538
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:47,942
I'll go with you.

539
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:48,621
No way.

540
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:50,048
Jiusu's cultivation level

541
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:51,141
has reached Void Unity.

542
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:52,502
I'll go alone.

543
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:54,381
You two go back now.

544
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,262
Get reinforcements.

545
00:26:55,502 --> 00:26:56,302
Go now.

546
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:57,101
Alright.

547
00:26:59,101 --> 00:26:59,808
- Go!
- Go!

548
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:00,576
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

549
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:01,472
Hurry!

550
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,462
Zhong Xi is still alive.

551
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,421
He rescued all the disciples.

552
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,141
My lord, terrible news!

553
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,341
Zhong Xi released
all the sect disciples!

554
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:33,581
What did you say?

555
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:36,101
Zhong Xi released
all the sect disciples!

556
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,621
Wasn't he dead?

557
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:40,262
You were there

558
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,621
when he died.

559
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,421
And I possess no power

560
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:44,742
to revive the dead.

561
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:46,661
Then why is he still alive

562
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:48,302
and even rescued the disciples?

563
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:50,621
Your people

564
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:52,141
escort the disciples.

565
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:53,782
What now?

566
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:55,702
The disciples

567
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,101
escaped?

568
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,742
You claim Zhong Xi rescued them,

569
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,181
so where's the evidence?

570
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:03,302
Quite eloquent.

571
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,421
You're still making excuses.

572
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:06,742
My lord,

573
00:28:06,982 --> 00:28:08,421
Kong Hou has never

574
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:09,661
truly submitted to you,

575
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,784
nor has she ever

576
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,621
truly sided with you.

577
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:14,462
Kong Hou,

578
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:16,101
after his death,

579
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,381
you stayed in that cave

580
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:18,341
with him for a period.

581
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:19,341
What did you do?

582
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,421
If you judge me guilty

583
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:22,942
based on a messenger talisman,

584
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:25,861
then I have nothing to say.

585
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:28,022
Guards!

586
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:29,222
Go check the cave.

587
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:30,181
My lord,

588
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,141
I'll go check it myself.

589
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:38,502
(It seems everyone's safe now.)

590
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:40,502
(Now I can rest easy.)

591
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:52,901
My lord,

592
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:54,782
Zhong Xi isn't in the cave at all.

593
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:55,901
He escaped.

594
00:28:57,381 --> 00:28:58,222
Kong Hou,

595
00:28:58,621 --> 00:28:59,821
how do you explain this?

596
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:01,702
Where have you hidden him?

597
00:29:02,861 --> 00:29:03,702
Kong Hou,

598
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:05,901
I demand an explanation now.

599
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,782
You would rather trust him

600
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,421
than me, your sister.

601
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:12,821
Perhaps

602
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,542
someone

603
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,381
intentionally hid

604
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,341
Zhong Xi's corpse

605
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,022
to frame me.

606
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:20,381
If you

607
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:21,581
refuse to trust me,

608
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:24,022
then punish me.

609
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:25,262
My lord,

610
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,022
Kong Hou must have colluded

611
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:27,861
with Zhong Xi

612
00:29:27,982 --> 00:29:29,141
to ruin

613
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:30,621
your ascension.

614
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:32,341
Wu Bei,

615
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:33,581
I suspect

616
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,542
you hid

617
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,502
Zhong Xi's corpse

618
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,381
to frame me

619
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:40,062
and sow discord

620
00:29:40,062 --> 00:29:41,942
between Jiusu and me,

621
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,462
so you can ascend with him.

622
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,581
What a scheme!

623
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,621
But remember.

624
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,381
Without me,

625
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,702
none of you will ascend.

626
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:56,861
What?

627
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:57,901
Even now,

628
00:29:57,901 --> 00:29:59,861
you still try to slander me?

629
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:01,901
My lord,

630
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:04,421
I swear I harbor no such intentions.

631
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,421
- We cannot spare Kong Hou.
- Wu Bei.

632
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,462
How dare you!

633
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:10,661
You've repeatedly framed me.

634
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:11,702
And now

635
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,421
you even try to distort the facts?

636
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:14,141
Enough!

637
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,392
The ascension's coming,

638
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:21,381
stop the quarrel.

639
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:22,381
Guards!

640
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:23,782
Take Kong Hou away.

641
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:24,942
Who dares?

642
00:30:31,502 --> 00:30:32,381
My lord,

643
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,421
this is suspicious.

644
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:36,381
We cannot spare Kong Hou.

645
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,542
I need her

646
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:41,141
Phoenix Essence for ascension.

647
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:43,341
We'll talk later.

648
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:46,181
(Yunhua Sect)
Kong Hou,

649
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:48,421
my beloved disciple.

650
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,861
How could you do so?

651
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,302
- I...
- Master Wang Tong.

652
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:53,821
Tan Feng

653
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:54,821
and Ling Hui are back.

654
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:55,742
Really?

655
00:30:58,144 --> 00:30:58,656
Master.

656
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,101
- Master.
- You're back.

657
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,341
Are you injured?

658
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:04,101
We're fine.

659
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:05,861
Good then.

660
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,621
How did you escape?

661
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:08,782
Master Zhong Xi

662
00:31:09,022 --> 00:31:10,341
saved us.

663
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,901
He's gone to save Kong Hou now.

664
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:12,982
Master Zhong Xi has

665
00:31:12,982 --> 00:31:14,262
gone to save Kong Hou?

666
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:15,901
We must assist him.

667
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:16,861
- Master.
- Master.

668
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:18,462
Master,

669
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:20,062
Master Zhong Xi warned us

670
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:21,502
Jiusu has reached

671
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:22,821
the Void Unity.

672
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:25,462
Void Unity?

673
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,022
Then no one

674
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:28,302
can defeat him

675
00:31:28,302 --> 00:31:29,542
in the entire Lingyou Realm.

676
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:33,702
What happened?

677
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,502
Zhong Xi revived

678
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:37,621
and released all the disciples.

679
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:39,502
Now we have no one to power the array.

680
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:40,581
What should I do?

681
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:46,942
I'll find the people.

682
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,222
You'll activate the array

683
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:50,181
tomorrow as scheduled.

684
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,782
The spiritual energy is impure,
but we can get more people

685
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,901
to make up for that.

686
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,901
Okay, let's do it this way.

687
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,861
My time is running out.

688
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:00,942
I must ensure

689
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:02,581
Jiusu activates the Ascension Array.

690
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,782
(Who's there?)

691
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:52,181
Stop there!

692
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:21,101
Who is this person?

693
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:22,421
So formidable.

694
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:30,262
Where were you?

695
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,861
Taking a stroll.

696
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:34,381
It's late,

697
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:35,661
just stay put.

698
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:37,581
I've decided

699
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,821
to resume the Ascension Array tomorrow.

700
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:41,302
But we have

701
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:42,702
no disciples to power the array.

702
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:44,782
How will you proceed?

703
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:46,022
I have my ways.

704
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,581
Just get prepared.

705
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:56,982
Did he

706
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,022
capture

707
00:33:58,022 --> 00:33:59,181
other disciples?

708
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:05,141
Master!

709
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:05,901
Master!

710
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,661
We received a message. Jiusu is about to
activate the Ascension Array.

711
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:09,661
Zhong Xi has gone there.

712
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,101
Master Jin Yue just sent word.

713
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:11,904
They've set off.

714
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:13,101
Let's hurry to join them.

715
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,301
In that case,

716
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,301
let's set off now.

717
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:15,862
Yes.

718
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:29,781
The time has come.

719
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:31,221
Let's begin.

720
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:35,181
But

721
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,741
we lack disciples to power the array.

722
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:37,862
Don't worry.

723
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,062
They are coming soon.

724
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,496
No one can stop us

725
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,301
from ascending.

726
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,221
They are coming?

727
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:50,462
Kong Hou,

728
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:52,382
after all our preparation,

729
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:53,781
today

730
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:56,141
is our day of ascension.

731
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:00,022
Okay.

732
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,022
Jiusu.

733
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:02,902
I'll go with you.

734
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,741
The major sects' disciples have arrived.

735
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:33,088
What?

736
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,781
You're sacrificing all their lives

737
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:35,661
to power the array?

738
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:39,502
The spiritual energy is impure,
but we can make up for that

739
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:41,221
with more people.

740
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:56,301
Kong Hou,

741
00:35:57,342 --> 00:35:58,822
we're about to succeed.

742
00:35:58,982 --> 00:35:59,822
Jiusu.

743
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:01,542
You know what?

744
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:04,382
I've lost my Phoenix Essence.

745
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:05,701
What did you say?

746
00:36:06,022 --> 00:36:06,982
With just me alone,

747
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:08,382
the power of Harmony Sync

748
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:09,902
can't stop you.

749
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:11,382
But

750
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:14,581
if I sacrifice my life,

751
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:16,781
the Harmony Sync's power

752
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:18,661
will multiply infinitely.

753
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,022
What's going on here?

754
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:37,942
You've committed too many evils.

755
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,621
I must eliminate you

756
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,261
for Lingyou Realm.

757
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:45,022
And I'll

758
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,261
die soon.

759
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:49,101
Jiusu.

760
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:50,902
I'll die

761
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:53,902
with you.

762
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:57,382
Kong Hou.

763
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:00,342
We're siblings.

764
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,822
I trusted you so much.

765
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,301
Can't believe you...

766
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,141
Kong Hou,

767
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:10,062
have you forgotten

768
00:37:10,902 --> 00:37:12,181
I've doted on you

769
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,022
when you were young?

770
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,502
Whether I forgot or not,

771
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:20,462
today

772
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:23,741
I must do this.

773
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,221
Kong Hou,

774
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,062
let's ascend together

775
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,022
and become Lingyou Realm's strongest.

776
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,141
Isn't it good?

777
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,701
You know your ascension

778
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:37,942
would ruin

779
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,542
the Lingyou Realm.

780
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:41,141
By then,

781
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:43,502
mountains and rivers would dry up.

782
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,022
Birds and beasts would perish.

783
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:48,781
And everyone in Lingyou Realm

784
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:50,462
will all die.

785
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:51,942
I'll never allow

786
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:52,982
that!

787
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:54,462
Kong Hou.

788
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:57,221
I just wanted revenge.

789
00:38:00,902 --> 00:38:01,701
Fine.

790
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,261
Kong Hou,

791
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,621
I'll do as you said.

792
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:08,621
No more revenge.

793
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,342
No more ascension.

794
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:12,781
You beat me.

795
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:14,301
Satisfied?

796
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:15,581
Come.

797
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:18,462
Come.

798
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,181
Let's leave together.

799
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:28,301
It seems

800
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:31,581
you're determined to kill me.

801
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:34,221
Fine!

802
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,062
In that case,

803
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:39,062
I'll make you

804
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,581
and all those righteous sects

805
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:43,168
die with me!
