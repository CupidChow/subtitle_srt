(Fengyi)

17
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,398
Huan Zong, look!

18
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,719
Why does she have so much energy?

19
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,638
Never feel tired.

20
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:53,918
Young Master.

21
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,159
What was that phoenix symbol

22
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,159
emerged when Kong Hou

23
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,118
underwent tribulation?

24
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:01,918
Probably some charm

25
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:02,879
her master set up

26
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,558
to shield her from thunder strikes.

27
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,959
Thunder strikes?

28
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,519
It was really powerful.

29
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,279
My whole back still hurts
from getting hit.

30
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,638
To block dark cultivators

31
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,439
and even us now.

32
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:14,078
So ungrateful!

33
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,958
Huan Zong, Lin Hu, hurry up!

34
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:17,758
Let's go.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,836
(Haoqing Temple)

36
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,758
This is our Liuguang Sect's

37
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,999
branch in Fengyi.

38
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:28,719
The message about Cloudseeker Twig

39
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,198
came from them.

40
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:31,319
Elder.

41
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:35,758
Greetings, Elder.

42
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,238
Greetings, Senior Lin Hu.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,198
This must be

44
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:38,839
the new prodigy

45
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,839
Elder recently took in.

46
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,478
How could I possibly be

47
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:42,719
Huan Zong's disciple?

48
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,039
We're good friends!

49
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,478
- Friends?
- Greetings, Elder Kong Hou.

50
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,478
I'm an Elder too!

51
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:51,518
Come on.

52
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:53,599
Take these.

53
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,119
Thank you, Elder Kong Hou.

54
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,198
Keep working hard.

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,879
Huan Zong, let's go!

56
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,518
Do you know the exact location?

57
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:09,518
A beggar

58
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:10,599
said that Cloudseeker Twig

59
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:11,918
is in Fengyi.

60
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,039
But he didn't specify

61
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,078
where it is.

62
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,358
You believed a beggar's words?

63
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:17,599
He's no ordinary beggar.

64
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,358
He's famous among rogue cultivators.

65
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,599
Hating

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,358
constraints,

67
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,319
he wanders around the streets

68
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,238
with beggars,

69
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,159
calling himself "Old Beggar".

70
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,439
If you call him by his name,

71
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,279
he gets mad.

72
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,358
Where is he now?

73
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,678
Haven't seen him

74
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:32,879
since that one meeting.

75
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,678
Did you infiltrate the beggar groups

76
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:36,559
to gather information?

77
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,478
Lady Kong Hou.

78
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:39,904
No, Elder Kong Hou.

79
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,159
You might not know.

80
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,039
Beggars in Fengyi are complicated.

81
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,559
Though an official sect,

82
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,758
they are very united.

83
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,399
It split into East

84
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,119
and West factions.

85
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,518
We orthodox sects

86
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:50,518
can't infiltrate

87
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,559
either group.

88
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,439
- Here.
- Thank you.

89
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,839
Do you know anything

90
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:58,198
about the Cloudseeker Twig?

91
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,238
No.

92
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,039
That's okay.

93
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,238
What are you doing?

94
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,478
Just some questions.

95
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:09,999
Stop running!

96
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,439
Just a few questions!

97
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:12,439
Go away!

98
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,119
- Get out!
- Hurry!

99
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:14,879
- Go!
- Go!

100
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,358
Young Master.

101
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,438
I've talked to several.

102
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:22,399
Either they didn't know

103
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,678
or they ran immediately.

104
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:24,079
Could

105
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,599
the information be mistaken?

106
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,238
Liuguang Sect disciples

107
00:04:28,238 --> 00:04:29,519
always act prudently.

108
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,199
It couldn't.

109
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:31,678
Stop!

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,719
I earned the chicken leg

111
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,599
fair and square!

112
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:34,639
I won't give it!

113
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:36,478
This is West Faction territory.

114
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:37,998
You crossed borders!

115
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,039
- Catch him!
- Stop!

116
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,079
Stop!

117
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,118
Senior...

118
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:43,839
Stop it.

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,678
- You little brat!
- After him!

120
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,599
Get him!

121
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,998
Kong Hou's storage pouch?

122
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:49,918
How could she leave

123
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:50,839
something so important?

124
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,399
Senior!

125
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,839
It's been months.

126
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,998
I missed you so much!

127
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:10,478
Senior.

128
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,918
I brought you delicious roast chicken.

129
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,199
Roast chicken?

130
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,079
You're so sweet.

131
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,399
Grateful girl.

132
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,238
Try it.

133
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,839
Is it good?

134
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,839
I haven't eaten

135
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,118
such good roast chicken in ages.

136
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,798
Slow down, Senior.

137
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,159
Don't rush.

138
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,998
Let me wipe your mouth.

139
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:33,438
You're getting it everywhere.

140
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:35,456
Who's there?

141
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,358
Huan Zong? Why are you here?

142
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,039
I was about to ask you.

143
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,399
It's midnight.

144
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,199
What are you doing?

145
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,159
Meeting

146
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,998
a beggar in secret?

147
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,678
Who are you calling a beggar?

148
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,159
I'm her Senior!

149
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,438
So you're that Young Master?

150
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,998
I knew you were suspicious.

151
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,519
Are you eyeing Kong Hou?

152
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,199
No!

153
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,719
Senior, it's not what you think.

154
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,599
Let me explain

155
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,159
when we get back.

156
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,199
Senior.

157
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,358
I'll find you a place

158
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:08,798
to clean up properly.

159
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,039
Here's my room.

160
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,599
Alright, we're here.

161
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:14,558
You can go now.

162
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,998
We have matters to discuss.

163
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,759
I also have matters with her.

164
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,678
You...

165
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:20,478
Senior.

166
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,358
Just let him in.

167
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:22,878
Besides,

168
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,438
we're on Liuguang Sect's territory.

169
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,039
Alright.

170
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,959
Come with me.

171
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:31,199
Let's go.

172
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,918
I found it in your front room.
Keep it safe.

173
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,678
So you picked it up.

174
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,639
No wonder

175
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,798
I couldn't find it anywhere.

176
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,959
Be careful.

177
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,872
Don't lose it again.

178
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:45,878
Understood.

179
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,678
Today

180
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,599
I was too careless.

181
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,079
Thank you, Huan Zong.

182
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,318
What did you say?

183
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:54,438
You're an outsider.

184
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:55,079
Don't lecture

185
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,998
my junior!

186
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,159
And you.

187
00:07:58,358 --> 00:07:59,358
A young girl

188
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:00,238
being so close

189
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:00,959
with a stranger?

190
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,678
Improper.

191
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,839
Senior.

192
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:05,318
Huan Zong isn't a stranger.

193
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,878
He's one of us.

194
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,639
Huan Zong,

195
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,678
this is Tan Feng,

196
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,719
my Senior.

197
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:13,918
Hi, Senior Tan Feng.

198
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:14,959
I'm not your senior.

199
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,478
Senior,

200
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,238
Huan Zong means no harm.

201
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,448
You're too naive.

202
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,528
You don't realize
what intentions he harbors.

203
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,928
He starts sending you message talismans
before you left.

204
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:25,678
He clearly knew...

205
00:08:27,558 --> 00:08:29,318
So you're saying

206
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,639
my messenger talismans from Huan Zong

207
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:34,759
were hidden by you?

208
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:35,718
No.

209
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,239
No.

210
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,558
It wasn't me.

211
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:39,718
It was Master.

212
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,999
He feared you'd be deceived

213
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,198
so he hid the talismans.

214
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,438
But this guy didn't give up,

215
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:44,359
even sent people.

216
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,078
Master and I

217
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,438
barely drove him off.

218
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:47,999
And now he's stuck to you

219
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:48,718
like glue!

220
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:51,639
Huan Zong.

221
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,039
You even sent someone

222
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,239
down the mountain to find me?

223
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:56,438
Yes.

224
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,999
Huan Zong, you're so nice.

225
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,479
Kong Hou.

226
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:03,639
Don't be fooled by him!

227
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:05,119
Senior.

228
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,198
Do you know

229
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,159
if Huan Zong hadn't protected me

230
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,239
all this way,

231
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:11,718
you wouldn't even see me now.

232
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:12,999
Senior.

233
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,718
Senior.

234
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:16,198
If you keep this up,

235
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,598
I won't talk to you.

236
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,798
It's for your own good.

237
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,239
I understand.

238
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,039
By the way,

239
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,399
why are you here?

240
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:30,558
Speaking of this,

241
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:31,279
it's because

242
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,558
of the message you sent back.

243
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,639
We suspect that Yuanji Sect is connected

244
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,479
to those exploding

245
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,838
grey-robed cultivators

246
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:37,558
in Qiu City.

247
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,119
So the sect

248
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,399
sent people to investigate.

249
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,759
Masters.

250
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,119
By investigation,

251
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,239
I discovered

252
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,039
that the cultivator

253
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,399
was originally a beggar in Fengyi.

254
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:47,359
He was fed

255
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,239
by dark cultivators

256
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,318
to reach Nascent Soul

257
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,519
and sent to cause chaos.

258
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,318
If that's the case,

259
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,958
you'll have

260
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,318
to go to Fengyi

261
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:57,359
and investigate further.

262
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,438
I won't fail.

263
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:00,399
Wait.

264
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,239
Those beggars

265
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,159
stick together

266
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,798
and distrust outsiders.

267
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,039
To investigate,

268
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,598
you'll need to join their ranks.

269
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:13,239
Wait.

270
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,198
If the sect

271
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,239
assigned Senior Wu Chuan,

272
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:18,119
why are you here instead?

273
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:21,479
Look at Wu Chuan.

274
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,039
With his dignified bearing,

275
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,239
he looks nothing

276
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:26,598
like a beggar.

277
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,359
Exactly.

278
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,078
Nothing like.

279
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:28,718
Absolutely.

280
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,718
If he goes begging,

281
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,838
he'll starve to death.

282
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,039
We need someone convincing.

283
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,598
Yes. Find someone who looks the part.

284
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:48,999
Me?

285
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,958
Masters

286
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:51,678
really have

287
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,479
sharp eyes.

288
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,759
Who else but you could play a beggar?

289
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:56,678
I'm telling you.

290
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:57,318
When I saw you

291
00:10:57,318 --> 00:10:58,678
in this disguise,

292
00:10:58,678 --> 00:10:59,879
I almost thought you'd

293
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,838
really become a beggar.

294
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,359
This is called scouting,

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,279
okay?

296
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:06,039
You little brat.

297
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,519
Dare mock me after just days apart?

298
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,359
- Senior! Never again.
- Stop there.

299
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,119
Stop!

300
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,759
Senior. Don't!

301
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,279
Stop!

302
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,279
Huan Zong! Help!

303
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:13,279
Stop there.

304
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:13,918
Huan Zong!

305
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:14,678
Senior Tan Feng.

306
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,639
We still have our mission.

307
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,119
Sit down. We need a plan.

308
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,399
Senior,

309
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,239
you're truly remarkable.

310
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,958
We need to figure out

311
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,838
how to help you

312
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,999
drop the beggar disguise.

313
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,159
There is one solution.

314
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,078
But it requires

315
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,198
team work.

316
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,879
Here, take a look.

317
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,399
This is a tracking talisman.

318
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,479
If we discreetly place it

319
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,918
on those beggars,

320
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,279
we can

321
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,399
track down whoever

322
00:11:48,598 --> 00:11:49,558
is behind all this.

323
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,159
Incredible.

324
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,598
You're truly brilliant.

325
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,639
Of course.

326
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,519
The phrase "wise and mighty"

327
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,239
were invented for me.

328
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,958
I heard Liuguang Sect disciples
are all strong.

329
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,078
Help me draw talismans.

330
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:11,718
That won't do.

331
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,558
Huan Zong isn't well.

332
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,838
He can't overexert himself.

333
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:16,359
I'll draw for you.

334
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,078
You worry about him

335
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,399
but not me tiring out?

336
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,558
He's injured.

337
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:26,838
Look.

338
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,918
Coming out at night,

339
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:28,999
you may get cold.

340
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,078
Let me walk you home.

341
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:31,759
Come on.

342
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,759
Lin Hu, draw for him.

343
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,279
Kong Hou.

344
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:37,119
Kong Hou!

345
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,759
I'll draw for you. Come on.

346
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,159
I'm feeling unwell.

347
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:44,639
Is your injury

348
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,999
acting up again?

349
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,198
You shouldn't have come out tonight.

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,479
I'm fine. Don't worry.

351
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,159
Get some rest.

352
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,519
By the way,
where will Tan Feng sleep tonight?

353
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,999
He...

354
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,558
He can share my room.

355
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:03,999
What?

356
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,639
Outside my door.

357
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:07,838
When I was little,

358
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,119
I feared sleeping alone.

359
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,039
Senior often slept outside my door.

360
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,678
Now that we're traveling,

361
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:14,438
he'll worry about me too.

362
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,239
So

363
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,078
he'll sleep

364
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:17,078
outside my door.

365
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,279
But you're grown now.

366
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:20,718
Letting him sleep outside

367
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:21,759
isn't appropriate.

368
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,039
That's true.

369
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:24,678
Can he share a room

370
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,759
with Lin Hu?

371
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:26,479
That works.

372
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,718
Then sleep earlier.

373
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,678
I'll go help him with talismans.

374
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:31,558
Wait.

375
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,798
Does

376
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,078
your sect

377
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,039
have any talismans

378
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,718
for insomnia?

379
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,318
No, actually.

380
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:43,999
What's wrong?

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,558
I feel

382
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:47,718
a little dizzy

383
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:48,879
yet not sleepy.

384
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,039
I have an idea.

385
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,479
When I was young,

386
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,039
I used to have trouble sleeping too.

387
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,039
Back then,

388
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,718
seniors would tell me stories.

389
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,279
Perhaps

390
00:13:58,318 --> 00:13:59,918
I can tell you one.

391
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,479
This doesn't feel right.

392
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:02,438
You're already weary.

393
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,279
Just a few hours of being awake.

394
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,039
It's okay.

395
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,519
That won't do.

396
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,438
Being unable to sleep

397
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,718
is painful.

398
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:09,479
Well,

399
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,838
let me tell you

400
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,078
a short tale.

401
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:12,678
Okay.

402
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:13,519
In the past...

403
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:18,279
Why aren't you drawing?

404
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,639
I'm not here for this.

405
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:23,958
Then why come?

406
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:25,718
To supervise you.

407
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:26,999
Supervising me?

408
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,918
Do you know

409
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,879
I am

410
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,639
one of the top disguise masters

411
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,598
in the Lingyou Realm.

412
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,318
Supervising me?

413
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,438
Such bold words.

414
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,558
All right.

415
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,198
Don't you believe me?

416
00:14:40,438 --> 00:14:41,159
I'm telling you.

417
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,198
These days,

418
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,318
there was another guy

419
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,598
disguised as a beggar.

420
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,239
He's the renowned chief disciple

421
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:51,198
of Zhaohan Sect,

422
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:52,958
Chang De.

423
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,759
Chang De of Zhaohan Sect?

424
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,879
Yes.

425
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,198
These past two years,

426
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,119
he's been making waves.

427
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:01,318
Everyone knows his name.

428
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,838
But so what?

429
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,759
He still got caught by the beggars,

430
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,318
shoved into a blanket and kicked out

431
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,039
like trash.

432
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,239
But I

433
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,438
infiltrated them.

434
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,318
If you hadn't shown up,

435
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,198
I'd have become a leader soon.

436
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,279
(Chang De came here too?)

437
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,558
(What about Ling Bo?)

438
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,598
Did you see his junior,

439
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:21,438
Ling Bo?

440
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:22,239
No.

441
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,384
Maybe I didn't recognize her.

442
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,318
Alright, that's it.

443
00:15:26,598 --> 00:15:27,479
You got this.

444
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,558
I'm off to find Kong Hou.

445
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,519
Wait, wait!

446
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,639
Senior Tan Feng.

447
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,438
You're skilled at this,

448
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,159
but I'm not.

449
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,119
You must teach me.

450
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:37,198
I'm already exhausted.

451
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,039
I can't draw.

452
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,598
Besides,

453
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,798
I have more urgent matters.

454
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:40,359
I need to go

455
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,639
find that brat Huan Zong.

456
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:43,999
Senior Tan Feng.

457
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:46,359
Young Master just recovered.

458
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,399
He's resting.

459
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,119
Must be asleep.

460
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,119
You're such a master

461
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,759
in Lingyou Realm.

462
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:51,798
It's rare

463
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,318
I get to learn from you.

464
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:53,918
Please

465
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,198
show your technique

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,359
and let me admire.

467
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:00,879
Well-mannered.

468
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:01,718
Come on.

469
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,879
I'll show you once.

470
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:17,918
Leaving?

471
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,119
I thought you were asleep.

472
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:23,438
It's fine.

473
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,198
Go find your senior.

474
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,279
He must be waiting.

475
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,438
Can you sleep now?

476
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,078
No worries.

477
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:31,598
If I can't sleep,

478
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:33,759
I'll just meditate.

479
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,678
Meditate, now.

480
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:37,239
Huan Zong.

481
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,519
I've told you

482
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,639
so many stories.

483
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:41,479
Why are you still not sleepy?

484
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:43,479
I don't know.

485
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:44,879
It doesn't matter.

486
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:45,639
Don't worry.

487
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,119
A day or two won't kill me.

488
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:47,558
It's okay.

489
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,359
No. Wait.

490
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,359
I've still got plenty of stories.

491
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,519
Let me think of another.

492
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:54,999
Alright.

493
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,318
Let me think.

494
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,239
Got one.

495
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:00,039
I guarantee

496
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,359
you've never heard it.

497
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:04,479
Once upon a time,
there were two families

498
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,118
locked in generational hatred.

499
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:07,638
But

500
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:09,039
their son and daughter

501
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,398
fell in love.

502
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,158
The parents...

503
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:18,479
I'm not sleepy.

(came to the sect,)

(I feared sleeping alone at night.)

00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,318

it was your senior watched over you.

519
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,318
Now let me do it.

520
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:21,239
(Roast chicken)

521
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,358
Line up!

522
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:23,759
No pushing!

523
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:24,838
Enough for everyone.

524
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:25,999
No need to rush.

525
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:26,999
Take in order.

526
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,039
Everyone gets one.

527
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:31,118
Here.

528
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,558
- Thank you!
- Thanks.

529
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:33,158
Take this.

530
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:36,118
- Mine.
- Mine.

531
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:38,199
Careful.

532
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:38,759
Thank you.

533
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:39,638
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

534
00:18:39,638 --> 00:18:40,279
Here.

535
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,999
Take and leave!

536
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:43,638
Line up!

537
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:44,479
Stop grabbing!

538
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:46,598
Stop!

539
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,078
Stop it!

540
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:48,759
This is West Faction's territory!

541
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,759
Why are you pushing me?

542
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:50,679
Nonsense!

543
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,558
Look at the city gate.

544
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,398
It's clearly

545
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,199
our

546
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,158
East Faction's domain!

547
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:54,719
Pah!

548
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:55,638
West Faction!

549
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,439
East Faction!

550
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,118
West Faction!

551
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,199
East Faction!

552
00:18:58,798 --> 00:18:59,679
West! West!

553
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:04,719
Stop yelling!

554
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,479
Stop!

555
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:08,279
Whether East Faction or West Faction,

556
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,039
everyone gets one roast chicken.

557
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,199
No grabbing. Form a line!

558
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,199
No way!

559
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,398
Ever since their East man

560
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:14,959
broke off the engagement with our girl,

561
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:15,759
we West Faction

562
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,078
swore to never forgive them!

563
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,318
We people choose partners freely.

564
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,999
Unless marriage is finalized,
it's not breaking an engagement!

565
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,039
Pah!

566
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,358
Chicken's not even passed out.

567
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,919
Huan Zong, what should we do?

568
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:46,999
There's another way.

569
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:48,759
Go.

570
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,239
Stop fighting! Stop!

571
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,199
Lin Hu's impressive.

572
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,959
He's got real skills.

573
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,118
All of you, stop fighting!

574
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,199
Stop it!

575
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:31,158
If this continues,

576
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:32,199
it'll get worse.

577
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:33,798
We must stop them.

578
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,318
Huan Zong.

579
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:35,919
Remember

580
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,039
the story I told you?

581
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,598
Which one?

582
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:40,239
Follow me.

583
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:43,838
Stop!

584
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,598
Huan Zong, act in a play with me.

585
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,519
The one

586
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,039
I told you yesterday.

587
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,279
There were two families

588
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,318
in generational feud.

589
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:54,759
But their son and daughter

590
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:55,558
fell in love.

591
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,759
They planned to die together

592
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,558
to end the families' hatred.

593
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:03,919
Acting?

594
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:04,759
I don't know how.

595
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:05,598
No worries.

596
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:06,838
Just follow my lead.

597
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,959
Someone's going
to jump off the city gate!

598
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,558
Help!

599
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,679
A jumper at the city gate!

600
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,759
This...

601
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:18,878
Who is it?

602
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,358
Why are they jumping?

603
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:24,118
Watch carefully.

604
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,798
Everyone!

605
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,358
Everyone!

606
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,959
Huan Zong and I, Kong Hou,

607
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,838
we truly love each other.

608
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:34,999
What?

609
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,158
Love each other.

610
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,519
What? Love each other?

611
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:37,959
You...

612
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:38,439
Don't.

613
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:39,878
It's an act!

614
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,838
An act, got it?

615
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:45,878
We love each other!

616
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,759
Love?

617
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:50,239
Quiet, quiet.

618
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,798
This is true love!

619
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,118
Now,

620
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,838
if we can't be together in this life,

621
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,439
we'll jump

622
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,398
from this city gate.

623
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:03,598
We'll stay together

624
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,878
even in the underworld!

625
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:08,558
This won't do.

626
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,208
The East and West are feuding factions.

627
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,199
Quick!

628
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:13,878
Hug me!

629
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:16,479
Like this?

630
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,679
Tighter.

631
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:21,039
They're still acting. It's fine.

632
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,479
Like this?

633
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,999
Now caress my...

634
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:25,878
Caress my hair.

635
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,078
Why are you so stiff?

636
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:30,679
Can't you be gentler?

637
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,558
Passion. Got it?

638
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,759
Weren't you going to jump?

639
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:40,759
Why aren't you jumping?

640
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:43,158
- Yeah! Jump!
- Jump!

641
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,039
Jump!

642
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,279
Why this reaction?

643
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:48,519
Why aren't they moved at all?

644
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,279
Our acting must be unconvincing.

645
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,638
Everyone!

646
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,999
Please listen.

647
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:56,999
Huan Zong and I, Kong Hou,

648
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,598
we truly love each other.

649
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:00,878
We have but one wish.

650
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:02,158
To

651
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:04,638
get married!

652
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:06,598
Get married?

653
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,999
She...

654
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:09,039
It's an act.

655
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:11,199
Everyone present here

656
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,039
is our witness.

657
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,999
We wouldn't be separated.

658
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:18,838
Huan Zong, will you marry me?

659
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,679
Will you?

660
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,160
Yes, I will.

661
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,638
Everyone!

662
00:23:31,158 --> 00:23:32,679
He agreed!

663
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,118
He agreed to marry me!

664
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,199
(She wants me to play along.)

665
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:39,558
(But they... Well...)

666
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:41,479
Right! We shouldn't...

667
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:42,398
We can't keep

668
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:43,439
the feud going.

669
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:43,959
Exactly!

670
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,759
Don't let lovers die for the feud.

671
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,679
East and West factions

672
00:23:47,878 --> 00:23:49,519
must end this enmity.

673
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,078
We must!

674
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:51,959
If they die because of this,

675
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,999
we're all guilty!

676
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:57,039
- Exactly!
- This must stop!

677
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,558
We can't watch lovers

678
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:01,999
jump before our eyes.

679
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,199
This girl...

680
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,479
I think I saw her earlier.

681
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,959
Yes! I saw her too!

682
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:08,558
Me too!

683
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,519
Are they lying?

684
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:11,558
Huan Zong, what should we do?

685
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:12,479
Now

686
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:13,878
they doubt us again.

687
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,118
No choice.

688
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:25,558
They kissed!

689
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,719
He really kissed her!

690
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:33,398
Come down now.

691
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,439
Come down!

692
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,078
We'll stop fighting.

693
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:39,919
Senior Tan Feng!

694
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:41,158
Wake up, Senior Tan Feng!

695
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,358
You're awake.

696
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:43,519
What are you doing?

697
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,239
I am...

698
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,078
Look, roast chicken.

699
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:50,878
What now?

700
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:51,398
Help me up.

701
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,199
Hurry!

702
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,558
Really delicious!

703
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,999
What now?

704
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:58,959
Where's Kong Hou?

705
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,039
How would I know?

706
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:01,118
I have to go.

707
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,078
Search yourself.

708
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:05,479
Where's Kong Hou?

709
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:06,999
Kong Hou!

710
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:10,759
Admit fault or not?

711
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:12,398
Senior,

712
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:13,479
Huan Zong and I

713
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,118
are truly just

714
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:16,039
close friends.

715
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,638
Nothing like what you think.

716
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:18,358
Can good friends

717
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:19,318
hug and kiss casually?

718
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:20,759
You don't know it,

719
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:21,878
and he didn't refuse!

720
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:23,358
I already told you.

721
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:24,199
He's not a good man.

722
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,199
Kong Hou.

723
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,558
Listen to me.

724
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:27,479
Stay away from him,

725
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,558
okay?

726
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:30,398
It wasn't his fault.

727
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:31,878
I forced him to act this out.

728
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:32,519
Senior,

729
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,239
please don't blame him.

730
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,078
You're still defending him?

731
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,479
You're completely under his spell.

732
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:38,838
I'll knock some sense into you.

733
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,039
Huan Zong.

734
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,798
Senior Tan Feng.

735
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:46,878
It's all my fault today,

736
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:48,199
not hers.

737
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,158
This is our sect business.

738
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:51,638
You have no right to interfere.

739
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:53,638
Let go!

740
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:01,318
Huan Zong.

741
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:03,558
Let go. I'm fine.

742
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,039
Forgive me.

743
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,439
You...

744
00:26:09,199 --> 00:26:09,959
Senior Tan Feng.

745
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,039
Don't be mad.

746
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:12,919
If you're angry,

747
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,039
just take it out on me.

748
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,878
But I want to make something clear.

749
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:17,959
Regarding today's events,

750
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,479
Kong Hou wasn't wrong at all.

751
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,878
She actually deserves credit.

752
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,078
Credit?

753
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,999
She used the food distribution

754
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,358
to send tracking talismans.

755
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,679
That's the first merit.

756
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,039
Second, during the chaos,

757
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,679
she improvised a whole act

758
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,838
to distract everyone.

759
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:36,759
Third, the disputes

760
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:38,919
between East and West factions

761
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:40,439
are completely resolved.

762
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:42,719
Even if she did good,

763
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,118
she must keep propriety.

764
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,118
Listen.

765
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:46,919
Stay away from her from now on.

766
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,039
Don't want to see you again.

767
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,838
That's impossible.

768
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:50,919
What did you say?

769
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:53,519
Because

770
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,318
I want to see her.

771
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,999
Who do you think you are?

772
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,199
You want to see her?

773
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:00,838
I...

774
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,118
I suppose I'm her friend.

775
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,158
Senior Tan Feng.

776
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,838
I know you care for her.

777
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:09,039
But Kong Hou

778
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,318
has now grown up.

779
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,039
She can make her own choices.

780
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,398
So I won't stay away from her.

781
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:15,878
I'll continue accompanying her

782
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:16,878
on her journey.

783
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,638
Show me your hand.

784
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,239
It hurts.

785
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:27,318
Let's go get you medicated.

786
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,878
This will sting. Hold still.

787
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:34,999
It's fine.

788
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:35,759
You

789
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,199
took a hit for me.

790
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,679
Besides, Senior Tan Feng

791
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:39,919
wouldn't hit me seriously.

792
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:43,838
Why does it hurt so much?

793
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:45,719
Stay still.

794
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:48,358
Huan Zong.

795
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:49,798
I remember

796
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,039
in the Forbidden Forest,

797
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:52,479
you were injured too.

798
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,118
Then you just

799
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:54,878
waved your hand

800
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,199
and then, your wounds healed.

801
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:58,039
Can't you do that for me too?

802
00:27:58,158 --> 00:27:58,719
Alright?

803
00:27:59,118 --> 00:27:59,519
The ruler

804
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,798
is specifically for punishment.

805
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,638
The wounds caused are different

806
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,199
from cuts or scrapes.

807
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,199
Not so easy

808
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:07,479
to heal.

809
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,398
You must apply medicine properly.

810
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,318
Endure it.

811
00:28:10,838 --> 00:28:11,638
I've never

812
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,598
been struck with a ruler before.

813
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:15,638
But Huan Zong,

814
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,838
how do you know so much about this?

815
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,158
Were also a naughty kid before

816
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,638
and often got beaten

817
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,838
with a discipline ruler?

818
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,039
Not at all.

819
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:26,959
I know this because

820
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,919
when disciples of Luanfeng Peak

821
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,679
disobey orders,

822
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,158
I'd hit them with ruler.

823
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,479
You hit them?

824
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:37,039
Ouch!

825
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,039
If it hurts too much,

826
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,318
hold onto me.

827
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,439
Harder, it's fine.

828
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:50,519
Huan Zong.

829
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,199
You're so nice to me.

830
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:57,239
Back on the tower,

831
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:58,479
you cooperated so well.

832
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:01,598
If you hadn't kissed me right then,

833
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:02,358
nobody

834
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:03,919
would've believed us.

835
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,358
You're so good at acting.

836
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:10,519
What if

837
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,519
it's not an act?

838
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:18,759
Not an act?

839
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:21,519
Then what was it?

840
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,296
Never mind.

841
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,439
You'll understand later.

842
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,199
This is so great.

843
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:31,039
Indeed.

844
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:35,638
Sis,

845
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,558
tell me.

846
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:38,158
Why aren't you staying

847
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:39,398
in that broken temple tonight?

848
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:44,158
Here.

849
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:46,759
Haven't you heard?

850
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:49,158
That temple's haunted.

851
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:50,759
No way.

852
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:53,039
An old widower from the east city

853
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,439
has been living there.

854
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:55,598
Days ago,

855
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:56,959
he came back late

856
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,158
from begging

857
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,679
and saw a haunting.

858
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,759
It scared him

859
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:02,959
half-mad.

860
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,999
Maybe he's just

861
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:06,878
making up stories.

862
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:07,759
Anyway, I won't

863
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,558
go back there.

864
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:09,398
If you dare,

865
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,558
go with them.

866
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,279
Haunted?

867
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,199
Maybe it's dark cultivators.

868
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,199
I need to check.

869
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:21,439
Y-You...

870
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,439
Let me see.

871
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,398
It really is you, Lady Ling Bo!

872
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,078
What happened to you?

873
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:30,759
To be honest,

874
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,919
this beggar look

875
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,279
suits your temperament.

876
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:34,598
Stop talking nonsense.

877
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:35,318
Or I'll rip off

878
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:36,239
your fox tail.

879
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:37,999
Why are you dressed this way?

880
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,439
I'm investigating clues.

881
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,638
No room for vanity here.

882
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:41,838
Investigating?

883
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,558
Lady Ling Bo of Zhaohan Sect

884
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,798
plays beggar

885
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:47,479
for merit?

886
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:50,759
You always call me a stinky fox.

887
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,279
Which of us smells worse now?

888
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:53,358
You...

889
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,118
Alright.

890
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:54,959
Stay back.

891
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:56,199
What's the status?

892
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:57,798
If you hadn't shown up,

893
00:30:57,798 --> 00:30:59,078
I would've finished already.

894
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,558
What's that supposed to mean?

895
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:01,638
Too many people there,

896
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:02,638
I couldn't talk.

897
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:03,878
Or I won't come here!

898
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,919
Just get to the point.

899
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:07,759
Those beggars

900
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,759
are suspicious.

901
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:09,598
Be careful

902
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:10,598
while you're with them.

903
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:12,118
I don't need your warnings.

904
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,279
Let's exchange messenger talismans.

905
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,638
Contact me if you need help.

906
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,638
Think I can't handle it?

907
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:19,999
I mean

908
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,239
you gave the roast chicken

909
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,336
with tracking talismans.

910
00:31:22,336 --> 00:31:24,224
No tracking talismans,
no messenger talismans.

911
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,638
If danger comes, what can you do?

912
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,158
Tracking talismans?

913
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,959
So it was you all along.

914
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,919
Handing out chicken

915
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,078
and tracking talismans.

916
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:34,638
What are you acting?

917
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:35,679
To monitor

918
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,919
their movements!

919
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,759
Alright.

920
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:40,679
Take it.

921
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:41,838
If anything happens,

922
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:42,919
contact me immediately.

923
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:44,959
Alright, I'm leaving.

924
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,239
Keep it safe.

925
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,519
Remember to message me.

926
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,798
Be careful!

927
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:51,158
Well,

928
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:52,519
still charming.

929
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,158
It's an act.

930
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:13,679
An act.

931
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:23,439
Then...

932
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,959
What if it's not an act?

933
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:29,078
Not an act?

934
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:30,719
Then what is it?

935
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,279
Kong Hou.

936
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:42,959
Listen to me.

937
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,919
Stay away

938
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,919
from him.

939
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:46,279
Senior Tan Feng.

940
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:47,439
Huan Zong and I

941
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,158
are truly just

942
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,158
close friends.

943
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,078
Nothing like what you think.

944
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:40,439
(He's been gone so long,)

945
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,318
(still not back yet.)

946
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,318
(Has something happened to him?)

947
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:01,358
Senior, eat some fish.

948
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,558
No.

949
00:34:06,318 --> 00:34:08,078
Senior, try this bun.

950
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,399
No.

951
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,598
Eat this chicken leg.

952
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:16,718
No.

953
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:18,758
Senior Tan Feng.

954
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,039
I remember

955
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,238
that's your favorite.

956
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,558
Why aren't you eating?

957
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,479
You don't have

958
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,319
to remember that.

959
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:28,078
I'm just your senior,

960
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:29,919
not your

961
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,039
"close friend".

962
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:39,678
Senior.

963
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,238
I was wrong.

964
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,479
I'm apologizing.

965
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:46,399
Senior Tan Feng.

966
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:48,198
Kong Hou's apologized.

967
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,319
Your words yesterday

968
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,359
worked wonders.

969
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,039
You should be happy. Why be angry?

970
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:53,319
Don't want chicken leg?

971
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:53,839
Here,

972
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:55,359
try a duck leg.

973
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:56,118
Here.

974
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,439
What?

975
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,238
Okay, fine.

976
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:00,678
We're talking.

977
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:01,479
Why you bother?

978
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,439
Senior Tan Feng.

979
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:05,238
What exactly

980
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:06,238
do you want us to do?

981
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:07,999
"Us"?

982
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,399
Are you saying

983
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,758
"us"?

984
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:11,799
Now am I

985
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:12,879
the outsider?

986
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:13,638
I-I...

987
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:15,758
That's not what I meant.

988
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:16,359
Don't explain.

989
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:17,359
Even if

990
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,598
Master's here today,

991
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:19,839
he can't compare with them!

992
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,078
Senior!

993
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,319
Tears won't help.

994
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,359
When you were making mistakes,

995
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,238
I couldn't stop it.

996
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:34,758
I'm better off letting go.

997
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:42,519
Senior.

998
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:44,359
I'm sorry.

999
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,959
From now on,

1000
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,198
I won't bother you anymore.

1001
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:51,118
Where are you going?

1002
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:57,118
Stubborn girl!

1003
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,198
Fine, just go!

1004
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:01,598
But

1005
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:04,118
Kong Hou's new here.

1006
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:05,399
She may run into danger.

1007
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,158
She said you're close.

1008
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,799
Maybe

1009
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,278
the deeper

1010
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,718
the affection, the harsher the scolding.

1011
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:20,558
I've lost my appetite.

1012
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,399
There's been talk

1013
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,439
of dark cultivators in Fengyi.

1014
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:27,399
Well, I'd better go check.

1015
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:28,118
Dark cultivators?

1016
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,558
Young Master.

1017
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,479
Quite the performance.

1018
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,598
The world down mountains

1019
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:37,879
really rubs off on people.

1020
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,238
Even you've learned to act.

1021
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:41,439
Kong Hou!

1022
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:43,519
Kong Hou!

1023
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:44,439
- Young Master.
- Kong Hou.

1024
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,319
Lady Kong Hou

1025
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,839
is still a young girl.

1026
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:49,238
Girls are sensitive

1027
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:50,598
and prone to overthinking.

1028
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:51,479
Overthinking

1029
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,598
leads to rash decisions.

1030
00:36:52,638 --> 00:36:54,118
What if she encounters

1031
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:55,399
dark cultivators?

1032
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,198
What should we do?

1033
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:56,558
Stop

1034
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:57,519
such ominous words!

1035
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:58,839
Danger? Dark cultivators?

1036
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,158
I'm her Senior!

1037
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:01,638
I know she's sharp.

1038
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,118
Fine.

1039
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,839
Don't worry.

1040
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:05,558
By our presence,

1041
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:06,479
Kong Hou will be fine.

1042
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:06,999
Right.

1043
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:08,519
Go search her.

1044
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,158
Or you have to pay.

1045
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:11,758
Have to pay.

1046
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:12,919
Let's go.

1047
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:14,758
Kong Hou!

1048
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:15,519
Where's she?

1049
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,718
Will she be okay?

1050
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,278
- Kong Hou!
- Where are you?

1051
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:18,919
Louder!

1052
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,319
- Kong Hou!
- Kong Hou!

1053
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:20,919
Tan Feng.

1054
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:22,238
Kong Hou.

1055
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:26,158
Are you okay? Where did you go?

1056
00:37:26,439 --> 00:37:27,959
I may have been harsh,

1057
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:29,439
but you can't be so reckless.

1058
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:30,919
I was worried sick!

1059
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:34,399
Kong Hou, are you alright?

1060
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,718
I'm fine.

1061
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,078
Good.

1062
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,198
After you left,

1063
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:39,158
Senior Tan Feng

1064
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:40,319
almost lost his mind.

1065
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:43,399
I-I didn't.

1066
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:44,558
Not at all.

1067
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,959
You don't seem happy.

1068
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:47,879
I know

1069
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,479
undercover work

1070
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,198
has you tired and hungry.

1071
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,118
Back at Yunhua Sect,

1072
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,519
whenever you were upset,

1073
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,799
you'd get constipated.

1074
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:56,999
So I figured

1075
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:59,078
this time was no different.

1076
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:01,078
That's why you were being difficult.

1077
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:01,638
I bought

1078
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:02,479
some laxative

1079
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:03,598
spiritual fruits.

1080
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:04,319
Here.

1081
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,359
Interesting.

1082
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:07,558
In the same sect,

1083
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,248
one constipated, and one with diarrhea.

1084
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:11,439
Tan Feng.

1085
00:38:11,758 --> 00:38:13,439
Don't be mad.

1086
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,359
Your chest is glowing.

1087
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:18,238
Are you going to explode?

1088
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:19,359
Exploding?

1089
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:20,758
This is a tracking jade pendant.

1090
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,118
It glows if a tracking talisman

1091
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:22,999
is activated.

1092
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,519
