Go!

19
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:06,835
What is it?

20
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:08,852
I told you before.

21
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:10,173
I'm also a music cultivator.

22
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,093
So I'd like to seek your advice.

23
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:13,493
What could I possibly teach you?

24
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:15,132
Your Yunhua Sect is so powerful.

25
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:16,493
They can't teach you properly?

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,053
But I genuinely...

27
00:02:18,053 --> 00:02:19,012
Zhou Xiao is in danger.

28
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,213
Stop talking to me.

29
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:21,012
I...

30
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:50,773
Zhou Xiao!

31
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:52,053
Senior Zhou Xiao!

32
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,132
Senior Zhou Xiao, are you okay?

33
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:54,893
Senior Zhou Xiao!

34
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,572
What are you going up there for?

35
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:00,292
Senior Zhou Xiao.

36
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,412
How are you feeling?

37
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:02,176
Senior Zhou Xiao?

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,572
No, I...

39
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:08,453
Even that didn't work?

40
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,453
Looks like I need
to use my ultimate move.

41
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,732
The back mountain compound
is heavily guarded.

42
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:16,972
If we force our way in,

43
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,292
we'll definitely make noise.

44
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,373
But apart from this,

45
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,504
nowhere else has clues

46
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:22,613
about the dark cultivators.

47
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:23,412
Young Master,

48
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,132
should we break in or not?

49
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:26,613
Don't alert them yet.

50
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,572
Keep watching Kong Hou
and the others these days.

51
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:30,933
Zhou Xiao

52
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:32,692
has ulterior motives.

53
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,613
Look at you.

54
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:40,512
What exactly

55
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,812
will make you resonate?

56
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,213
Senior Zhou Xiao.

57
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:50,373
You're still injured.

58
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,493
Why come to me now?

59
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,893
Is there something urgent?

60
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:53,572
My master

61
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,012
feels bad for the poor reception.

62
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,373
Being Yunhua Sect's old friend,

63
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:57,280
he has a gift

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,213
for Yunhua Sect.

65
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,104
Please come with me

66
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,532
to the Treasure Hall to fetch it.

67
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:01,933
But...

68
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,972
No need to decline.

69
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:03,904
It's a gesture

70
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:04,832
from our entire sect.

71
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:07,732
Then I'll accept graciously.

72
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:13,056
(Treasure Hall)

73
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:13,653
This way.

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,088
(Treasure Hall)

75
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,136
(Treasure Hall)

76
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,412
Zhou Xiao,

77
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,932
your Treasure Hall

78
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,333
is so grand.

79
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:44,773
Compared to our sect's,

80
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:46,093
it's equally impressive.

81
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,736
And there are so many rare treasures.

82
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:49,532
You flatter me.

83
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:51,392
My master collected them

84
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,532
through great efforts.

85
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:53,852
He believes

86
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:55,172
that for a large sect like ours,

87
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:56,128
without some

88
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,013
presentable treasures,

89
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,213
it's hard to command respect

90
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,972
or establish ourselves in Lingyou Realm.

91
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,133
Zhou Xiao,

92
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,932
your sect

93
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,292
has so many treasures

94
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,453
and abundant spiritual veins.

95
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:08,893
And your disciples cultivate

96
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,133
with great diligence.

97
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,732
I believe given time,

98
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,333
you'll surely prosper more.

99
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,333
(Her heart is so pure and kind.)

100
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,453
(Yet I...)

101
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,013
(Forgive me, Lady Kong Hou.)

102
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,412
What's this?

103
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,072
Danger! Run!

104
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:30,813
What happened?

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,592
- Lady Kong Hou.
- Anyone outside?

106
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:35,424
Stop banging.

107
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,488
What's going on?

108
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,160
Weren't we just

109
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,152
looking at treasures?

110
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,016
Why suddenly...?

111
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:42,880
The Treasure Hall

112
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,848
has an alert barrier.

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,056
We must have

114
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:45,824
touched something

115
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:46,449
to trigger it.

116
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,539
Then... Could it be what I...?

117
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,859
The trickier thing is

118
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,272
that once the barrier is triggered,

119
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,227
it only opens from the outside.

120
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,008
It was intentional?

121
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:02,907
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

122
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,227
After that person triggered the barrier,

123
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,496
he locked the door and left.

124
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,948
There were no further actions.

125
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,227
Can that barrier

126
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:12,308
be opened?

127
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:13,188
It can.

128
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,907
It only requires some spiritual energy.

129
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:17,628
Good, keep watching.

130
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,667
Remember.

131
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:19,628
Do not alert them

132
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,667
unless utterly necessary.

133
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:21,707
But if...

134
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:23,027
But if

135
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,428
Lady Kong Hou is in danger,

136
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:26,147
I'll break the barrier to save her.

137
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:26,827
Got it.

138
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,428
How on earth can we get out?

139
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,548
Normally,

140
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:40,907
tomorrow morning,

141
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,188
disciples will come to clean.

142
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:45,347
What?

143
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,948
You mean

144
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,068
we have to stay in this Treasure Hall

145
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,827
until tomorrow morning?

146
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,787
How about this,

147
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:57,787
Zhou Xiao?

148
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:59,188
Let's join forces

149
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,188
to break the barrier

150
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,144
with spiritual energy.

151
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:03,667
Lady Kong Hou,

152
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,428
a unique spell

153
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,748
of our sect has been cast

154
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:07,827
on this barrier.

155
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,108
With our current cultivation,

156
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,347
we can't open it from inside.

157
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,347
Unless Master were here.

158
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,736
But now...

159
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,188
S-So we

160
00:07:15,188 --> 00:07:16,787
really have to stay here

161
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:18,560
all night?

162
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:19,648
Exactly.

163
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,104
Zhou Xiao,

164
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,868
why does it seem like

165
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,428
you aren't too worried?

166
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:35,388
When I was young,

167
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,587
I got locked up often.

168
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:37,868
I was scared at first.

169
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,328
Then I learned the door

170
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,868
would open by dawn at the latest.

171
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:41,787
The fear faded.

172
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,027
No more fear.

173
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,628
If this weren't

174
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,227
your sect's place

175
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:50,748
and I feared

176
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,227
damaging these treasures,

177
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:53,152
I would've

178
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,520
already taken out

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,832
all my spiritual tools

180
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,548
to test them one by one.

181
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,787
I refuse to believe

182
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:01,907
we couldn't break

183
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:03,347
your barrier.

184
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,628
Right.

185
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,667
Lady Kong Hou,

186
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,480
this is indeed our sect's

187
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,428
extremely,

188
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,496
extremely important place.

189
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,280
Thank you for holding back.

190
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:18,267
Forget it.

191
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:19,628
Blame me instead.

192
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,347
My curiosity

193
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:24,147
and recklessness

194
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,248
brought this on us.

195
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,330
(Treasure Hall)

196
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:29,628
Treasure...

197
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:31,936
Treasure Hall.

198
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,027
Zhou Xiao is interesting.

199
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:36,348
He trapped himself with Kong Hou

200
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,088
on purpose.

201
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,427
This man

202
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,896
looks presentable,

203
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,016
but he's up to no good.

204
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:45,440
(Treasure Hall)

205
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,267
How is it?

206
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:50,464
Young Master is so nagging.

207
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:51,868
I already said,

208
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:52,640
I'll act at once

209
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,187
if Lady Kong Hou is in danger.

210
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,508
He never cared this much about me.

211
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:01,440
(Treasure Hall)

212
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:15,712
Today, we must

213
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,216
clean the Treasure Hall thoroughly.

214
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,260
Otherwise...

215
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,780
Zhou Xiao? Lady Kong Hou?

216
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,060
Why are you here?

217
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,099
What's going on?

218
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,499
Yesterday, I took Lady Kong Hou
to pick a gift.

219
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:28,780
We triggered the barrier.

220
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,619
You two stayed here

221
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,859
the entire night?

222
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,499
An unmarried man and woman alone?

223
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,140
An unmarried man and woman?

224
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,688
Wait.

225
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,544
Are you misunderstanding something?

226
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:37,244
Senior Zhou Xiao,

227
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,240
do you perhaps

228
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,968
have feelings for Lady Kong Hou?

229
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:40,819
Exactly.

230
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,140
How could you do this?

231
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,819
Mao Mao.

232
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,699
Stop talking nonsense.

233
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,300
We were

234
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,560
together all night,

235
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,540
but nothing happened.

236
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,619
Nothing happened at all.

237
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,619
I swear nothing happened.

238
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,099
Why does it feel like

239
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,099
I'm making the situation worse
by explaining?

240
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,780
Senior Zhou Xiao, you...

241
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,020
You actually slept together?

242
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,380
No.

243
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,420
- No.
- No wonder Zhou Xiao

244
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,219
- Not at all.
- didn't return all night.

245
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,420
He was having a secret rendezvous here.

246
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,859
No, that's not true.

247
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:15,940
Zhou Xiao,

248
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,984
explain this properly.

249
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:18,528
We truly

250
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:19,940
had no improper contact.

251
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,099
Lady Kong Hou,

252
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,260
last night

253
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,536
was an accident,

254
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,540
but I do...

255
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,739
Wait.

256
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:31,140
Zhou Xiao,

257
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,459
have you lost your mind?

258
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,219
Last night

259
00:10:33,219 --> 00:10:34,859
you were acting perfectly normal.

260
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't let those ridiculous

261
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,560
'male-female propriety' notions

262
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,900
mess with your head.

263
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,780
S-Snap out of it.

264
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,619
Senior Zhou Xiao, Lady Kong Hou,

265
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,499
listen to me.

266
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:45,900
Given the situation,

267
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,459
let our sect leader decide.

268
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,380
What do you think?

269
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

270
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,540
- Let our sect leader decide.
- Yes.

271
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:51,660
What?

272
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:54,619
- So,
- Yes. Let our sect leader decide.

273
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,380
this is the Yuanji Sect's purpose.

274
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,940
Impressive.

275
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,140
Kong Hou

276
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,940
is in big trouble now.

277
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,780
Rules make order.

278
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,619
Decorum must be maintained.

279
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:10,420
You...

280
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,940
What have you done?

281
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,464
You've...

282
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:15,136
You've ruined

283
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,339
Lady Kong Hou's reputation.

284
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:18,540
Lady Kong Hou,

285
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,619
I'm terribly sorry.

286
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,280
It's not that serious.

287
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,900
Master Shuang Qing, you exaggerate.

288
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,619
I do?

289
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,699
The situation demands severity.

290
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,300
However, we are the Yuanji Sect.

291
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,859
Lady Kong Hou, rest assured.

292
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:31,140
We would never

293
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,699
act so irresponsibly.

294
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,300
I will definitely give you

295
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,648
and the Yunhua Sect

296
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:36,579
a proper resolution.

297
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:38,300
What resolution?

298
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,180
We don't need it.

299
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:39,900
You do.

300
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,140
How couldn't you?

301
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,464
Wait, Master...

302
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:43,060
Silence.

303
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,020
She doesn't. You do.

304
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,619
And you don't.

305
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,540
She doesn't. You do.

306
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,940
You don't. But she needs it.

307
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:50,619
It's really nothing.

308
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,896
Cultivators don't fuss
over trivialities.

309
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:53,780
I don't mind at all.

310
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,944
Besides,

311
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,699
nothing happened at all.

312
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,060
How could 'nothing happen'?

313
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,020
You were in this situation.

314
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,060
Well...

315
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,459
Good girl. Innocent young lady.

316
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,300
At this moment,

317
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,140
you should stop making excuses for him.

318
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:12,864
For your innocence

319
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:14,819
and your happiness,

320
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,380
I'll make the decision.

321
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,979
I'll make the decision for you.

322
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,020
Zhou Xiao,

323
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,420
immediately and right now,

324
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,496
marry Lady Kong Hou.

325
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,984
(Kunze Hall)

326
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,000
(Joy)

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,272
(Kunze Hall)

328
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,712
(Joy)

329
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,339
Don't waste your efforts.

330
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,420
To think the Yuanji Sect

331
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,224
would resort

332
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,420
to such shameless tactics.

333
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,300
You clearly set me up.

334
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,140
All to force me into marrying Zhou Xiao.

335
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,336
Why exactly

336
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:03,459
am I so alluring to you?

337
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,979
Do I possess some hidden treasure?

338
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,579
Or is it because

339
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm a disciple of Yunhua Sect?

340
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,420
We must obey Master's order.

341
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,072
Senior Zhou Xiao is a good man.

342
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:17,339
A good man?

343
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,420
Would a good man scheme
to force a marriage?

344
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,579
He'll treat you well.

345
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,180
Aren't you afraid

346
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:26,780
of provoking Yunhua Sect's wrath?

347
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,979
The die is cast.

348
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,699
However

349
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,020
unconventional your sect may be,

350
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:31,459
you still value face.

351
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:36,579
And what about you?

352
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,140
Do you feel no resentment at all?

353
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:45,699
I know

354
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:47,780
you have feelings for him.

355
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:49,499
You're fellow disciples

356
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,020
who grew up together.

357
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,619
It's an irreplaceable bond.

358
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:53,859
Your connection

359
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,979
transcends any ordinary relationship.

360
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
Lady Jin Ling,

361
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,579
deep down, you must know

362
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,859
that Zhou Xiao doesn't truly

363
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:01,984
have feelings for me.

364
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,819
Even if we marry,

365
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,099
he'll never find true happiness.

366
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,736
(Joy)

367
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,859
But our master taught us from childhood

368
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,140
to aim for the greater good

369
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,219
and to put the sect first.

370
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,328
But what if your master

371
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,459
is wrong about this?

372
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,739
My master always told me

373
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,099
that though I'm a part of Yunhua Sect,

374
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,140
I must remain true to myself.

375
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,420
If after all cultivation,

376
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,699
one can't even preserve

377
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,900
their own true heart,

378
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,979
then tell me,

379
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,420
what's even the purpose of cultivation?

380
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,459
Lady Jin Ling,

381
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:37,180
if you do have feelings for Zhou Xiao,

382
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,540
you should fight

383
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,940
to be with him forever.

384
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,859
I believe

385
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,819
the one wearing this bridal gown

386
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,180
should be you.

387
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,424
Master. Master.

388
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,180
Master,

389
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,168
Yuanji Sect

390
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,224
forces me into marriage.

391
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,140
Come quickly.

392
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,464
Their square-faced

393
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:11,296
Master Shuang Qing

394
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:12,160
is the culprit.

395
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:13,540
Square-faced?

396
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,832
This is dignified solemnity.

397
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,020
Master. Master.

398
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:22,688
Master,

399
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,219
Young Master and I are fine.

400
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,856
We're traveling in Sanshu City.

401
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,859
Yuanji Sect has been most hospitable.

402
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,832
We even met

403
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:30,339
Yunhua Sect's Lady Kong Hou.

404
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:39,819
Young Master, let's crash the wedding.

405
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:41,420
Look.

406
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,424
As anticipated, our messenger talisman

407
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:44,499
was intercepted.

408
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,792
This proves Yuanji Sect

409
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,260
is definitely shady.

410
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:48,544
Moreover,

411
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,208
we don't know Shuang Qing

412
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,300
and Yuanji Sect's schemes

413
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,380
or if they're related

414
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,619
to the dark cultivators.

415
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,260
But

416
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,780
forcing Kong Hou into marriage

417
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,819
is an undeniable fact.

418
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,979
Young Master,

419
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,480
we must help

420
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,459
Lady Kong Hou.

421
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:06,592
Besides,

422
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,420
Master Song He

423
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,540
and her master, Wang Tong,

424
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,099
are actually good friends.

425
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,352
By all means,

426
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:14,208
we can't just stand by.

427
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,099
How should we do it?

428
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,619
How should we do it?

429
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:20,859
Well,

430
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,296
let's just...

431
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,579
I mean, I've never

432
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,592
done this before.

433
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:27,424
But,

434
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,140
I guess

435
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,219
we should wait until they

436
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,264
begin the ceremony,

437
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,192
and then we storm in.

438
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,219
We cut through everyone,

439
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,699
and rescue Lady Kong Hou.

440
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,420
Or perhaps we should

441
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,219
wait until the dead of night

442
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,819
when Lady Kong Hou is asleep.

443
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,632
Then we'll stealthily

444
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:42,300
carry her away.

445
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,224
Either way,

446
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:44,896
we mustn't

447
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,080
let the Yuanji Sect villains

448
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,944
succeed.

449
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:47,872
Right?

450
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,739
By your logic,

451
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,180
we're the real villains.

452
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,180
Then tell me

453
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,260
what we should do

454
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,380
if nothing works for you.

455
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,979
Let's wait longer.

456
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,540
Given Kong Hou's personality,

457
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,616
she won't submit easily.

458
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:11,936
(Joy)

459
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
Lady Kong Hou,

460
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,539
marriage

461
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,779
is never just a matter

462
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:49,699
between two people.

463
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:50,779
Perhaps

464
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,380
this is our destined fate.

465
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:14,979
Jin Ling?

466
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,499
What's wrong?

467
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:17,820
Am I not good enough?

468
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,180
What's going on?

469
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:21,219
Where's Lady Kong Hou?

470
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,180
Senior Zhou Xiao,

471
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,219
do you really like her?

472
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,779
Are you truly content

473
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,219
to spend your life with her?

474
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,699
What does that matter?

475
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:31,860
Stop the fuss.

476
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,100
Where is Lady Kong Hou?

477
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,420
Senior Zhou Xiao,

478
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,259
do you truly not know,

479
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:37,459
or are you pretending?

480
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,580
I have feelings for you.

481
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,979
We must obey Master's order.

482
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,900
I'll ask you one last time.

483
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,820
Where is Lady Kong Hou?

484
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,112
Don't hide behind

485
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:54,860
your orders.

486
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,192
Today I'll go with you

487
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,140
to see Master.

488
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,140
Senior Zhou Xiao,

489
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,180
I don't believe

490
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,059
there's no place for me in your heart.

491
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,380
She escaped?

492
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,140
She did?

493
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,580
She actually did?

494
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,848
How could a Foundation-stage cultivator

495
00:19:54,848 --> 00:19:56,380
break through the barrier?

496
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,660
What happened?

497
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,739
Perhaps

498
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,259
she has some special spiritual tool.

499
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,660
No matter what she possesses,

500
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,059
mobilize all disciples

501
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,620
and find her at all costs!

502
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:08,380
Yes.

503
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,420
Follow me.

504
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:14,459
Find her!

505
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,180
Do you think today's feast

506
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,900
will still happen?

507
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,779
That depends

508
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:21,219
on whether the bride escapes.

509
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,620
Let's get prepared anyway.

510
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:24,896
Agreed.

511
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:25,728
Mao Mao,

512
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,900
bring in those two vegetable baskets.

513
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,180
Get to work.

514
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:52,299
Who's there?

515
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,340
C-Catch birds.

516
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,820
C-Catch birds.

517
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,739
Who are you?

518
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,459
Z-Zhang Feng.

519
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,096
M-My father... My father...

520
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,712
Zhang Feng? Your name is Zhang Feng?

521
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,940
Your father is Master Shuang Qing?

522
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,856
I never expected Master Shuang Qing

523
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,624
to have such

524
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:15,820
a simple-minded son.

525
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,499
Young Miss.

526
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:18,336
Young Miss, help me catch them.

527
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:20,860
Keep it down.

528
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,979
It's completely dark now.

529
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,739
The birds have all gone to sleep.

530
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,900
Listen, be good.

531
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,872
I'll give you something tasty.

532
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:28,480
How about it?

533
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:37,792
Is it good?

534
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,448
Slow down.

535
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:41,664
Why are you out here

536
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:42,340
at this time?

537
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,420
I-I want to play with the birds.

538
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,380
There are none inside.

539
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,699
I want to go out.

540
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,259
Sneak out.

541
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,940
Can't let them find out.

542
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,340
Sneak out to play with birds?

543
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,940
Besides the main gate,

544
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,976
do you know

545
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:55,779
any other way out?

546
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,340
Yes.

547
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,299
Mao Mao?

548
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,660
No wonder it took you so long.

549
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,900
You fell asleep here.

550
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,720
H-How did I fall asleep?

551
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:11,940
Get up and work now.

552
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,340
Stop dawdling.

553
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,900
Come on.

554
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:15,900
Let's go.

555
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:17,792
Young Miss, come.

556
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:19,019
Where is it?

557
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,219
Just ahead.

558
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:21,340
A-Ahead.

559
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:26,699
Young Miss, over here.

560
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:28,340
This?

561
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:31,779
You go back first.

562
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,100
It's too late now.

563
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,380
The birds are asleep.

564
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,520
Wait until the dawn.

565
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,459
When you wake up,

566
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,660
the birds will be up too.

567
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,620
By the way,

568
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,352
you mustn't tell anyone

569
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:41,088
that you saw me.

570
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,219
A secret.

571
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,736
Yes, a secret.

572
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,728
Sure.

573
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,019
A secret.

574
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:47,660
Right.

575
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:48,380
A secret.

576
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,080
What's this?

577
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,704
Let me go.

578
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,860
Huan Zong, why did it take you so long?

579
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,100
Sorry, I'm late.

580
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,219
These vines are dangerous.

581
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:01,059
The flowers...

582
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:01,739
I know.

583
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:04,180
Give me your hand.

584
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:25,820
You're fine. Get up.

585
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,140
Go back with them

586
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,940
to buy some time.

587
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:31,499
Leave the rest to me.

588
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,059
I'll find a way.

589
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:33,940
Trust me.

590
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,968
I think

591
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,059
I saw something over there

592
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
just now...

593
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,739
Huan Zong?

594
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:50,018
(Joy)

595
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,272
(What exactly are the vines)

596
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:03,380
(in that flower field?)

597
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,400
(Absorbing spiritual energy with them)

598
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,720
(clearly isn't what proper sects)

599
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,539
(would do.)

600
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,440
(Why would Yuanji Sect)

601
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,499
(act so viciously?)

602
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:13,140
(Did they force me to marry Zhou Xiao)

603
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:14,779
(to drain my spiritual energy?)

604
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,539
(But I barely have
any spiritual energy.)

605
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,180
Lady Kong Hou,

606
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,739
you ran away on your wedding night.

607
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,912
How can Zhou Xiao

608
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:31,979
face others now?

609
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,259
Fate is heaven-ordained.

610
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,259
You two make a perfect match.

611
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,580
A golden couple destined to be.

612
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,860
Treasure this bond.

613
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,539
(How theatrical.)

614
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,660
(Never mind.
I'll follow Huan Zong's plan)

615
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,019
(to buy some time.)

616
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:49,632
I...

617
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,424
Don't you know

618
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,992
marriage is a major event?

619
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:55,779
This is my first wedding.

620
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,539
You need to give me some time to adjust.

621
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,660
Besides,

622
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,140
for such a major life event,

623
00:26:00,544 --> 00:26:01,824
even if the sect elders

624
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:02,660
can't be present,

625
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,380
the proper rituals
must still be observed.

626
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,140
We mustn't rush the wedding.

627
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,299
Anyway,

628
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:09,344
the wedding

629
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:10,624
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

630
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,979
I must have a grand ceremony.

631
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:23,328
Fine. I'll give you your grand ceremony.

632
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,219
But Lady Kong Hou,

633
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,499
you must keep your word.

634
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,019
Otherwise...

635
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,140
Wait.

636
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,720
Undo the immobilization spell

637
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,620
on me at least.

638
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:37,760
It'll naturally wear off

639
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,424
in two hours.

640
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,979
This girl is cunning.

641
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,620
- No more mishaps.
- Senior Zhou Xiao.

642
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
She must not escape.

643
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,779
Understood.

644
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:20,544
He told me to buy time.

645
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,140
What should I do next?

646
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,416
Why hasn't Huan Zong come yet?

647
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,496
What do you want?

648
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:39,200
It's too stuffy.

649
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:40,820
Can't I get some fresh air?

650
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,580
Well...

651
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:44,100
I'm hungry.

652
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,820
You should

653
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,900
at least give me some food.

654
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:46,940
H-How about this?

655
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,420
You can escort me there.

656
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,979
I won't try to escape.

657
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,180
Eat something.

658
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,180
I had it specially prepared.

659
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,820
They're your favorites.

660
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,979
I can't sway my master's decisions.

661
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,660
Yuanji Sect has lingered

662
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,380
outside the Ten Great Sects for years.

663
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,739
My master has exhausted every effort,

664
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,499
but over the past decade,

665
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,420
our disciples
have shown mediocre talent.

666
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:17,792
That's why

667
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,660
he sought external support.

668
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,100
If I marry you,

669
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,112
our sect

670
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,340
could gain aid from your sect.

671
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:24,660
It would elevate our standing

672
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,900
in Lingyou Realm.

673
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,340
How long have you

674
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,299
been targeting me?

675
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:31,180
Back in Qiu City.

676
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,340
After the Zhaohan Sect's phoenix case,

677
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,940
your reputation soared.

678
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,219
And that's how we traced

679
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,499
your movements after leaving your sect.

680
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,979
The previous dark cultivators

681
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,979
were our sect members in disguise.

682
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:44,180
All this

683
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,779
was to make us acquainted.

684
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,288
You must be out of your minds.

685
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:49,056
True.

686
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,660
Though you don't care for me,

687
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,420
I must

688
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:55,699
marry you regardless.

689
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,340
Therefore,

690
00:28:58,656 --> 00:28:59,488
you trapped us

691
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,779
together in the Treasure Hall.

692
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,176
Your sect

693
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:04,019
certainly went...

694
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:05,900
to extremes.

695
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,140
That's creative.

696
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,768
Master's obsession runs deep,

697
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,944
but it's all for

698
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:11,779
our sect's sake.

699
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,100
As the chief disciple,

700
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,019
I must

701
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,380
share Master's burdens.

702
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,739
You promised earlier

703
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,940
to stay willingly.

704
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,539
From today onward,

705
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,459
I'll treat you well.

706
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,380
You orchestrated all this

707
00:29:24,192 --> 00:29:25,059
just to

708
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:27,420
boost Yuanji Sect's glory?

709
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:32,940
Then why did you

710
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,380
use those vines to harm me?

711
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:35,620
Vines?

712
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,019
Harm you?

713
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,820
You didn't?

714
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,416
I...

715
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,264
This one

716
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,940
was found by you outside the city.

717
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,259
This one was found just now.

718
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,299
Both flowers

719
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:05,580
are identical.

720
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:08,100
The formation is sinister and cruel.

721
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,176
Only the dark cultivators

722
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,520
well-versed in herbal poisons

723
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,259
could achieve it.

724
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,459
Go to Huang Qi Residence

725
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,340
and have Master Huang Qi examine them.

726
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:17,940
Right away.

727
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,620
Young Master, where are you going?

728
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,180
To find Kong Hou.

729
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,299
Wait.

730
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,699
She's definitely
under tight surveillance now.

731
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:28,640
If you go now,

732
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,900
what if you get caught?

733
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:30,979
Besides,

734
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,340
your health is still weak.

735
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,140
Don't go.

736
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,728
Stay put

737
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,420
and wait.

738
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,979
She'll be scared alone.

739
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:36,580
Wait.

740
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,779
Whether she's afraid...

741
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:43,345
(Joy)

742
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,459
Huan Zong, you're finally back.

743
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,219
I thought they might have...

744
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:37,219
Don't worry.

745
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:38,739
They can't catch me.

746
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:41,779
What happened?

747
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,779
This room's

748
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,059
decorations have changed?

749
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,699
It was all festive earlier.

750
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,019
It annoyed me to look at.

751
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,019
Besides,

752
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,420
you aren't really getting married.

753
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,259
Enough.

754
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,420
I'll escort you out.

755
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,180
Escort me out?

756
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,900
I'm not leaving.

757
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,072
Those Yuanji Sect people

758
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:00,699
first tried to force me into marriage,

759
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,499
and then dragged me to the flower field,

760
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,940
nearly killing me.

761
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,820
I must stay

762
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,459
to uncover the truth.

763
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:07,420
Moreover,

764
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,384
actually, I...

765
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:19,136
(The security outside is so tight.)

766
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,320
(How did you get in?)

767
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,340
(I enter where I wish.)

768
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,820
(When can we get out?)

769
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,180
(What's your next plan?)

770
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,272
(Any discoveries?)

771
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:35,539
(What's Yuanji Sect's goal?)

772
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:40,416
We wait.

773
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,739
We've made progress.

774
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,499
Have some patience.

775
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Lift your clothes.

776
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,328
Let me check your injuries.

777
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,779
Lift my clothes?

778
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,240
What are you doing?

779
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,299
What do you think?

780
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:16,779
I want to examine the wounds

781
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:17,632
where the vines

782
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:19,100
drained your spiritual energy.

783
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,059
Y-You should've said so earlier.

784
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:31,136
Turn over.

785
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:36,979
Strange.

786
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,380
There's no trace at all.

787
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,499
Something just occurred to me.

788
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,328
When I was

789
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:48,979
trapped by the vines,

790
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,720
the flower that bloomed...

791
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:53,088
I've seen Jin Ling wear it before.

792
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:02,140
But it can't be Jin Ling.

793
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,380
She's always wanted me gone.

794
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,619
Jin Ling.

795
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,139
Jin Ling, wait.

796
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,032
I-I never imagined

797
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:45,499
things would turn out like this.

798
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,860
This matter isn't yours
nor Senior Zhou Xiao's to decide.

799
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,740
Nor mine.

800
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:51,700
Another thing.

801
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,216
Do you remember

802
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,099
wearing this flower before?

803
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,539
Right.

804
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,072
When we met

805
00:34:59,072 --> 00:34:59,979
in Sanshu City,

806
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:01,340
I was wearing it.

807
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:02,720
Then do you recall

808
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,539
where you obtained it?

809
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,780
I found it

810
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:08,608
in the flower field.

811
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,619
Flower field?

812
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:10,900
Are you sure?

813
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,820
When I was there earlier,

814
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,260
I nearly...

815
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:20,979
Let me go.

816
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:23,744
Are you saying

817
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:24,900
you almost got killed there?

818
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,872
Do you know

819
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,940
who grows this flower?

820
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,900
Kong Hou,

821
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,579
may I borrow this flower?

822
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,780
How is that possible?

823
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,900
How could this flower be problematic?

824
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,940
And these vines...

825
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,380
It's you.

826
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:11,900
Why are you here?

827
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,776
I wonder
if Senior Zhou Xiao will like it.

828
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Senior Jin Ling.

829
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,499
Coming.

830
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,700
I wanted to kill you back then.

831
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,780
But you got lucky.

832
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,740
W-Why exactly do you...

833
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,300
Jin Ling asked me for that flower.

834
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,380
She must know something.

835
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,880
She must be investigating on her own.

836
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,179
We need to find her quickly.

837
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,700
She hasn't moved for a long time.

838
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,860
She may have gone elsewhere.

839
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,019
The field is there.

840
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:20,979
Lady Kong Hou.

841
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:21,940
Why did you come out?

842
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,780
Senior Zhou Xiao,

843
00:37:22,912 --> 00:37:23,680
enough talking.

844
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,579
Jin Ling is in danger.

845
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:25,499
What happened to her?

846
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:26,240
Let's go.

847
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,300
Please don't.

848
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,856
Today you came

849
00:37:29,888 --> 00:37:31,059
to me yourself.

850
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,860
If I don't kill you,

851
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,300
wouldn't that waste your goodwill?

852
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,179
You chase. I'll tend to Jin Ling.

853
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:46,820
After him.

854
00:37:48,979 --> 00:37:49,740
Jin Ling?

855
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,820
Are you alright, Jin Ling?

856
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,216
Jin Ling, wake up. Jin Ling?

857
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:58,619
Who exactly are you?

858
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,780
Why did you hurt Jin Ling?

859
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,979
You know the terrain so well.

860
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,820
You're from Yuanji Sect.

861
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,179
Why is your spiritual energy so weak?

862
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:55,620
You visited that field too?

863
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:56,820
No.

864
00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:58,900
I haven't been to the flower field.

865
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:02,048
Forgive my rudeness.

866
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:10,688
