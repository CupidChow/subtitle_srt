16
00:01:57,763 --> 00:01:58,763
What is this place?

17
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,203
Why did you bring me here?

18
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:01,524
From now on,

19
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,084
this will be your residence.

20
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,003
You did well just now.

21
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:09,884
Thanks to you.

22
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:10,884
It was my duty.

23
00:02:11,963 --> 00:02:12,844
But Kong Hou, you...

24
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:14,044
Aren't you supposed

25
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,324
to address me respectfully.

26
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,523
Alright, Your Eminence.

27
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:20,404
It seems you will soon

28
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:21,763
understand the joy of power.

29
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:23,243
Power

30
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:25,363
is indeed a good thing.

31
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,404
Though you say so,

32
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,724
I can feel

33
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,083
that you're not very familiar

34
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,363
with having power.

35
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:32,683
You used to follow

36
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:34,324
those so-called righteous sects,

37
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:35,844
running around.

38
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,164
You shouldn't do that again.

39
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:38,763
From now on,

40
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:40,044
you are the Sovereign.

41
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,363
leading the Yueluo Clan.

42
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,643
Life and death

43
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:44,324
are within your grasp.

44
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,083
This power

45
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,243
is the trust given to you by the clan.

46
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,604
Appreciate it well.

47
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:53,763
Trust?

48
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,284
So, what do they mean

49
00:02:58,643 --> 00:02:59,963
by that?

50
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:03,404
It's for your safety.

51
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:06,044
Aren't you still suspicious of me?

52
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,884
But do you think I care?

53
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:11,523
Anyway, I'm tired.

54
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,004
I don't want to be disturbed.

55
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:14,483
Take them with you

56
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:15,523
and leave.

57
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:16,683
Your Eminence.

58
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:18,884
Didn't you

59
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:21,004
hear my words?

60
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,803
You just said

61
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:26,324
you wanted me to taste the power.

62
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:28,884
Brother, didn't you?

63
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:30,004
Alright,

64
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:31,604
if it makes you happy.

65
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,004
I feared you weren't used to

66
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,004
your new identity.

67
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,564
It seems I've overthought it.

68
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,363
We've recognized each other.

69
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,044
There's plenty of time ahead.

70
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,483
(I wonder how Zhong Xi is doing.)

71
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:57,404
Master.

72
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:00,083
Master.

73
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:01,523
How is Young Master doing?

74
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,803
Our leader is still treating him.

75
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:05,324
His condition is still unstable.

76
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,564
You're being too inconsiderate.

77
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,164
Even if it was for him,

78
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:12,444
you shouldn't have

79
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:13,444
helped them escape.

80
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:15,923
If we hadn't found that you were

81
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:17,164
in contact with him,

82
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,164
we almost couldn't save Zhong Xi.

83
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:19,923
I...

84
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:22,683
Forget it.

85
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,764
I have to discuss matters with Heng Yan.

86
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:27,284
You wait here.

87
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,084
Yes.

88
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:44,524
Your injuries are so severe.

89
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,164
Zhong Xi,

90
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,363
whether you can pull through this

91
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,604
will depend on you now.

92
00:04:59,243 --> 00:05:00,084
Master.

93
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,524
Master Zhong Xi has returned.

94
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:05,483
Did you know?

95
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:08,204
I was just about to go see him,

96
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:09,483
but you summoned me here.

97
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:11,683
Ling Bo,

98
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,204
you're too emotional.

99
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:20,644
About me covering their escape,

100
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:22,683
Master, you already know?

101
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:23,883
Previously,

102
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,483
I already covered up for you.

103
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:26,683
Because you and Kong Hou

104
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,003
are casual acquaintances,

105
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:29,604
you let her go.

106
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,363
You really shouldn't have done that.

107
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,644
Master, please trust me.

108
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:35,563
It's not because

109
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:36,644
she and I

110
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:37,524
are acquaintances.

111
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:39,443
You're too naive.

112
00:05:40,604 --> 00:05:42,044
What if you get deceived?

113
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:43,404
I'm not deceived.

114
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,164
I chose to do that myself.

115
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,084
Kong Hou hasn't learned evil skills.

116
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:48,604
Nor has she harmed anyone.

117
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,604
Why does Lingyou Realm

118
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:50,563
reject her?

119
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:52,644
It's my fault

120
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,084
for spoiling you

121
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,003
excessively.

122
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,084
You actually secretly
release a dark cultivator!

123
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:58,164
Do you realize

124
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,524
what calamities your actions

125
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:00,923
might bring to Lingyou Realm?

126
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,084
You're gambling

127
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:04,284
with the safety
of the entire Lingyou Realm!

128
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,084
Do you understand?

129
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:05,883
No, I don't.

130
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:07,644
If we don't protect

131
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:08,844
a living person like Kong Hou,

132
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:09,764
then what exactly

133
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:10,844
have we

134
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,123
been claiming

135
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,524
to protect?

136
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,644
Master,

137
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:16,443
I'll thoroughly investigate

138
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:18,243
and prove Kong Hou's innocence to you.

139
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:20,084
I'm not

140
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,524
being reckless.

141
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:22,883
Go if you must.

142
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:25,323
You'll understand me

143
00:06:25,323 --> 00:06:26,844
only after hitting the wall.

144
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:29,003
I know you care about me.

145
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:31,844
But I beg you

146
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,044
to trust me.

147
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,644
Your master scolded you, right?

148
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:50,883
But

149
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,243
I know what I'm doing.

150
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:54,363
From now on,

151
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,404
keep your distance
from Young Master and me

152
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,563
to avoid further trouble.

153
00:06:57,563 --> 00:06:59,404
What's done is done.

154
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:00,404
Besides,

155
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,604
I didn't act for your sake.

156
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:03,844
All I want now is to know

157
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,164
what happened

158
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:06,284
after they left.

159
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,164
Why was

160
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:08,563
Master Zhong Xi gravely injured?

161
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:11,604
He was hurt by Kong Hou,

162
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:12,724
and then she left with Jiusu.

163
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:13,604
What?

164
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:15,563
I'm not sure either

165
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:17,483
if we make a mistake

166
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,964
in helping them escape.

167
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,084
Kong Hou.

168
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,204
Mother.

169
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,563
Your Eminence.

170
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,003
Who are you?

171
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,443
I'm Xiao Pei,

172
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:31,724
sent by Lord Jiusu

173
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,044
to serve Your Eminence.

174
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,764
Serve me?

175
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:36,644
You're watching me, aren't you?

176
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:38,563
I wouldn't dare.

177
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:40,004
Lord Jiusu

178
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,644
has received news from Lingyou Realm

179
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:42,764
and sent me

180
00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,203
to invite you to see him and talk.

181
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:46,044
Seeing you resting earlier,

182
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,524
I dared not disturb you.

183
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,404
Since I'm your leader,

184
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,563
ask him to come to my place

185
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:54,364
and talk to me.

186
00:08:55,644 --> 00:08:57,364
I'll be waiting here.

187
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:05,563
Kong Hou.

188
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,364
I heard Zhong Xi

189
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:09,884
suffered serious injuries.

190
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,484
Such meaningless news

191
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:14,284
need not be repeated.

192
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:18,843
What's this?

193
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,404
The cultivation manual

194
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:22,443
of our clan.

195
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,603
Let us practice it together.

196
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:25,843
One day,

197
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,563
our cultivation will grow a lot.

198
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,244
I don't need it.

199
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:31,443
Your Eminence.

200
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:32,683
This manual

201
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:33,923
contains centuries of wisdom

202
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,644
from our ancestors.

203
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:37,443
It could

204
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:39,044
enhance your cultivation.

205
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:40,923
I said I don't need it.

206
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:43,404
I don't need it at all.

207
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,244
I have Five Spiritual Roots,

208
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:46,963
so improving my cultivation

209
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,603
is effortless.

210
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,644
I don't need this manual.
Take this away.

211
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:52,723
Kong Hou.

212
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:55,164
Your constitution isn't just talent.

213
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:56,963
It's also a responsibility.

214
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,364
I've told you before.

215
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:00,004
Address me properly.

216
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:01,644
Then I implore Your Eminence

217
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,723
to shed outdated beliefs swiftly

218
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:04,884
and reconsider

219
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:06,364
your current standing.

220
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,203
Behind you now

221
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:09,803
stand countless clan members.

222
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,803
I don't need your elaboration.

223
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,484
I'm fully aware.

224
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:14,683
For now,

225
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:15,884
take those two at the door

226
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:16,884
away from me.

227
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,443
They were assigned

228
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,563
to take care of you

229
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:22,923
and help you adjust.

230
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:25,284
When acclimated,

231
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,524
you may replace them

232
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,044
as you wish.

233
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,484
Do you believe

234
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,164
Kong Hou is truly as portrayed?

235
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,164
Whether she is or not,

236
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,484
as a demon cultivator myself,

237
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,083
I understand well

238
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:04,683
the pain of lowly origins

239
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:06,124
scorned and reviled

240
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,484
by others.

241
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,124
Now, Young Master

242
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,404
is gravely injured.

243
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:12,284
Well...

244
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:14,124
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

245
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:15,244
If you think

246
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:16,323
the world scorns you, fight

247
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:17,244
to prove them wrong.

248
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,764
If the path is rocky,

249
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:19,963
trample it beneath your feet.

250
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:22,083
You once asked me

251
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:22,963
if helping Kong Hou

252
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:23,764
was a mistake.

253
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,044
Now, I answer you clearly.

254
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:26,443
We did no wrong.

255
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:28,404
Were it another cast aside,

256
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,683
not Kong Hou,

257
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:30,764
I'd act the same.

258
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:31,603
I'd help them

259
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,323
because it's right.

260
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:34,203
Well...

261
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,723
Both Master Zhong Xi and Kong Hou

262
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,404
need you.

263
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,244
Come on.

264
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,244
Stop being sentimental.

265
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:45,683
Wait.

266
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:48,323
Hey,

267
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,563
I'm not sentimental.

268
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,963
What makes you think so?

269
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:56,803
Ling Bo.

270
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,164
You're back.

271
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,603
Do you need something?

272
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:05,443
It's nothing urgent.

273
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:09,124
Then why come?

274
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:12,203
I just want to see you.

275
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:15,923
If you're free,

276
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:17,843
visit your Master instead.

277
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,203
Master?

278
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:20,923
I met him this morning.

279
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,484
The leader and Master Song He

280
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:23,723
regulated his energy already.

281
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:24,764
He'll recover fully.

282
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:26,484
Good.

283
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:29,244
Anything else?

284
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,364
It's getting late.

285
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,083
You should go back and rest.

286
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:36,843
Ling Bo.

287
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:40,884
I'm ashamed.

288
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:42,203
All these years,

289
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,603
we've drifted apart.

290
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:46,563
Ah, I heard

291
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:47,884
your master's health

292
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,323
has improved greatly.

293
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:55,044
Indeed. When I last wrote to you...

294
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:03,563
Anyway, back then,

295
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,723
my master's condition

296
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:05,884
was truly dire.

297
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,164
But years of recuperation

298
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:09,484
have restored her fully.

299
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,203
I'm glad to hear that.

300
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,443
I shall

301
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:14,764
visit her

302
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:15,963
another day.

303
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,364
Well?

304
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,244
Master Zhong Xi is still sleeping?

305
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,723
The ground's dirty. Mind your dress.

306
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,443
You're sitting here too.

307
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:45,284
You seem

308
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:47,364
different somehow.

309
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,803
Let's cut to the chase.

310
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,364
What brings you here?

311
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,484
Though it's not a good time,

312
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:59,244
the situation is urgent.

313
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:00,284
I truly can't think of

314
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:01,284
any other solution.

315
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:03,603
What do you want to say?

316
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:04,723
Why are you hesitating?

317
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,244
Well...

318
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,124
Spit it out!

319
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:11,083
Just say it!

320
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:11,963
Lin Hu,

321
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,484
could you do me a favor?

322
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:14,284
Well,

323
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:18,364
a favor?

324
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,284
You suddenly asking for my help

325
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:23,683
gives me an ominous feeling.

326
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,044
Don't worry.

327
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:30,404
Could you stay with me?

328
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:31,683
What?

329
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,083
Can you, Lin Hu?

330
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,404
Is it possible?

331
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,404
You...

332
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,364
You spring this on me.

333
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:40,884
I...

334
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:43,083
I need a moment to process.

335
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:43,683
Well...

336
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,404
You're misunderstanding this completely!

337
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:46,884
Not literally being together,

338
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:48,803
just pretending!

339
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:50,364
We pretend to be?

340
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,004
Pretending to be with you?

341
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:55,323
What do you mean?

342
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,524
It's all because of Xiao Dong!

343
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,843
He's a fool.

344
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:01,004
He told my master

345
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,603
that he wanted to marry me.

346
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:03,323
What?

347
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:05,603
He actually did that?

348
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:09,203
Did your master agree?

349
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:11,843
Of course not!

350
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,404
Well, that's good.

351
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,524
But Xiao Dong

352
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:16,764
is as stubborn as a mule.

353
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,884
No reasoning gets through to him.

354
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,484
He insists on marrying me.

355
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,404
I gave him the cold shoulder,

356
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:23,443
but it didn't work.

357
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,044
What a headache!

358
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:27,603
That's why I came to you.

359
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:29,923
So,

360
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,723
you want

361
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,723
to pretend to be with me

362
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:34,764
to trick Xiao Dong?

363
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:37,563
No, no way!

364
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,364
This isn't acceptable!

365
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:41,004
Fine.

366
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:42,603
If you truly

367
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:43,723
feel uncomfortable about it,

368
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,843
I'll handle it myself.

369
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,603
It's not like that.

370
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:48,284
Ling Bo,

371
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:51,284
I didn't mean that.

372
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,443
Ling Bo, listen...

373
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:55,764
Ling Bo, I...

374
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:34,404
Kong Hou.

375
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:39,552
Your Eminence.

376
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,164
What

377
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,004
brings you here?

378
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:43,764
As your leader,

379
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,723
I own the entire place.

380
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:47,923
I can go anywhere I want.

381
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:50,124
You're right.

382
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:52,683
But I was cultivating myself earlier.

383
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:54,404
If I hadn't noticed you,

384
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:55,764
I fear I would have hurt you.

385
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,203
What's there to fear?

386
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:00,164
When my dark energy went berserk before,

387
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:04,123
did I not harm others then?

388
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:08,244
You came to see me

389
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:09,724
because your dark energy

390
00:17:09,924 --> 00:17:11,244
is almost out of control

391
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:12,323
and has intensified.

392
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,204
You need more spiritual energy, right?

393
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,204
You promised earlier

394
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,163
that if I returned with you,

395
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:19,204
you'd teach me

396
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,643
how to control the dark energy.

397
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,004
But now,

398
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,563
after all this time,

399
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:24,924
you still haven't

400
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:25,964
taught me how.

401
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,284
Why would I deceive you?

402
00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:31,363
Bring them in.

403
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:33,244
Move.

404
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,123
Kneel.

405
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:39,883
What are you doing?

406
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,403
I'll show you now

407
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,643
how to control the dark energy.

408
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,563
I need you to tell me

409
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,964
how to control the dark energy,

410
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,244
not to have you

411
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,363
cruelly harm others.

412
00:18:00,724 --> 00:18:01,924
After the seal was broken.

413
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,724
You regained your true nature.

414
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,964
The techniques we practice are unique.

415
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:07,083
Therefore,

416
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:09,284
they demand certain sacrifices.

417
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:09,964
Well,

418
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,244
this is how to control dark energy.

419
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:24,444
Your Eminence.

420
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:26,123
These two

421
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,524
were carefully chosen for you.

422
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,004
Their spiritual energy is huge.

423
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,244
Release them.

424
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:34,204
Your Eminence.

425
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,204
Are you pitying them now?

426
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,044
Release them immediately!

427
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,764
You're despicable!

428
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:51,323
For our kind,

429
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,004
compassion

430
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,883
is the most dangerous weakness.

431
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,684
It will destroy you.

432
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,163
But don't worry.

433
00:18:58,563 --> 00:19:00,004
You're young and innocent.

434
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:02,883
Time will teach you.

435
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,284
This world

436
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:05,724
is cruel.

437
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:09,004
Only the strong devour the weak.

438
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,083
I'd rather never understand

439
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,403
your twisted principles.

440
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,603
I know you don't understand.

441
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:18,284
But do you know

442
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,044
what our people

443
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,163
have been suffering?

444
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:22,883
Failing to control dark energy.

445
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,403
Living like monsters!

446
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,563
All of this

447
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,323
was caused

448
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:28,724
by those hypocrites.

449
00:19:29,444 --> 00:19:30,964
We take cultivators' spiritual energy

450
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:32,924
to retaliate.

451
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,163
What are you implying?

452
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:37,123
You mean

453
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,524
they're to blame?

454
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,403
Speak plainly!

455
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:41,444
Now

456
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:42,924
is not the time

457
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:43,883
to tell you everything.

458
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:44,964
One day,

459
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:47,163
you'll understand everything.

460
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:50,883
For now,

461
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,244
please absorb spiritual energy.

462
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:57,563
I'll never

463
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,204
follow your ways.

464
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,044
Fine.

465
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:03,524
Since that's your choice,

466
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:05,524
these cultivators

467
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:06,484
are useless.

468
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:08,764
Just kill them.

469
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:09,524
Don't you dare!

470
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:11,764
I am

471
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:13,083
your leader.

472
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:14,643
You shall

473
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,563
follow my rules.

474
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:18,204
Or else,

475
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:19,563
I won't stay

476
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:21,044
anymore.

477
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:30,724
Your Eminence.

478
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,843
I overstepped earlier.

479
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,764
If you refuse

480
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,083
to absorb spiritual energy,

481
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,964
you will have to

482
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,163
endure the pain.

483
00:20:58,244 --> 00:20:59,563
Young Master is not awake yet.

484
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,484
Yet trouble arises again.

485
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,163
Why must Xiao Dong

486
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,603
fancy Ling Bo?

487
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:08,484
He even sought her master's approval.

488
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,083
Well,

489
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:10,684
what if

490
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,484
her master allows him

491
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:13,524
to marry Ling Bo?

492
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:17,284
What should I do?

493
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:17,724
Well...

494
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:21,484
Is Master Zhong Xi awake?

495
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,123
Why are you at my door?

496
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,843
I-I was passing by for medicine.

497
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:29,444
Passing by?

498
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:31,392
Where's the medicine?

499
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,403
Tell me the truth!

500
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:34,964
Well,

501
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:37,004
you wanted my help, right?

502
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,964
You declined earlier.

503
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,044
I've changed my mind.

504
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,603
Let me talk to Xiao Dong.

505
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:45,123
Truly? You'll help?

506
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:45,843
Sure. I can't

507
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:46,964
watch you stay

508
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,123
with Xiao Dong.

509
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:51,843
Come on.

510
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:52,964
Why the silence?

511
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:54,444
Will you marry him?

512
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:55,803
What are you talking about?

513
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,163
You know it.

514
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:58,244
Have you thought of that?

515
00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:59,004
What thoughts?

516
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:00,444
Of marrying him.

517
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:02,044
I've heard of it.

518
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:02,843
You two were...

519
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:03,563
That's not true.

520
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:07,004
Really?

521
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:09,044
If there is something
between him and me,

522
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:09,924
why would I need you?

523
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,643
I'm glad that it's true.

524
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:28,724
The two of you...

525
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:31,684
What is this?

526
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:35,044
Xiao Dong, listen,

527
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,244
given the current situation,

528
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:37,323
it's difficult to explain.

529
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,724
Actually, Ling Bo and I

530
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,724
are already

531
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:41,163
in love.

532
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,323
With so much happening lately,

533
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,083
we feared
announcing it would be improper.

534
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:48,044
So, we never make it public.

535
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:49,803
Exactly.

536
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,444
But we realize

537
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,563
if we don't,

538
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:53,603
you'll misunderstand.

539
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,444
So today, we must make it clear.

540
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,204
Ling Bo and I

541
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:58,244
are already together.

542
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:00,044
I am the one Ling Bo loves.

543
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:01,964
And she is my beloved.

544
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:03,563
We love each other.

545
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,363
Why are you laughing?

546
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:09,204
You think I'm lying to you?

547
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:11,883
Do you think

548
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:12,883
that if you and Lin Hu

549
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:13,883
pretend to be together,

550
00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:14,964
it will make me give up?

551
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,123
You can't deceive me, Ling Bo.

552
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:18,643
Nor can you

553
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:19,524
alter my resolution.

554
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:22,524
You and Lin Hu

555
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:24,244
aren't together.

556
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:25,803
Who says we're not?

557
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,403
Who says we're not?

558
00:23:29,484 --> 00:23:30,323
If you're with him,

559
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:31,363
what do you see in him?

560
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,843
Lin Hu is a demon cultivator.

561
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:35,643
Pardon?

562
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:36,244
Oh,

563
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,484
I don't mean to disparage you.

564
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:39,083
But even if

565
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:40,563
I don't mind,

566
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:43,004
your Master would never
allow you two to be together.

567
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:44,603
Lin Hu is a demon cultivator,

568
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:45,803
but he is righteous.

569
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:47,684
His methods seem unorthodox,

570
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:49,843
yet he holds firm principles.

571
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:50,843
He's loyal,

572
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,004
willing to follow Master Zhong Xi.

573
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:53,843
Whatever

574
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,204
the difficulties,

575
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,363
he never betrays Zhong Xi.

576
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:57,603
He's kindhearted,

577
00:23:58,044 --> 00:23:59,403
ensuring no one near him

578
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,123
comes to harm.

579
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,484
Most importantly,

580
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,044
he's responsible.

581
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:05,444
In the secret realm,

582
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,563
when I lost control,
he severed his own tail

583
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:08,603
to save my life

584
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:10,764
instead of

585
00:24:10,764 --> 00:24:12,163
abandoning me.

586
00:24:14,403 --> 00:24:14,883
You...

587
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:15,883
Don't cut in.

588
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:18,123
She's not done.

589
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,323
I haven't finished yet.

590
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,403
She hasn't finished.

591
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:23,724
Though

592
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,123
you often tease me

593
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:26,724
and contradict me,

594
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:27,684
I still

595
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:30,004
don't dislike you for it.

596
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:31,524
In fact,

597
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,403
I enjoy being

598
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:34,284
with you.

599
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,163
So do I.

600
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:39,724
It seems

601
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:44,004
you genuinely like him.

602
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:46,004
So, Xiao Dong,

603
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,843
Ling Bo and I

604
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,044
are already together.

605
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,603
And I'll be with her

606
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:52,924
forever and always.

607
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:00,204
I understand now.

608
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,044
- He understood.
- He understood.

609
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,204
He understood.

610
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:05,444
However,

611
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,004
I'll prove that I love her
more than you do.

612
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:09,924
And I'm more deserving

613
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:10,803
to be with her.

614
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:12,444
- Are you kidding?
- Save your words.

615
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,123
I'll make you

616
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:14,924
feel my love.

617
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:16,524
I'll make you change your mind.

618
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,083
Xiao Dong.

619
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:19,284
- Actually...
- Stop it.

620
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:22,643
I'm taking the disciples

621
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:23,323
for training.

622
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:25,724
We'll talk later.

623
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:26,803
Are you serious?

624
00:25:28,724 --> 00:25:29,843
I warned you before.

625
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:30,883
What do we do now?

626
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,204
What do you mean?

627
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:34,563
Then I must prove that I love you

628
00:25:34,563 --> 00:25:35,643
more than he does.

629
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:36,403
Alright.

630
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:38,643
Your hand?

631
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:40,603
S-Sorry.

632
00:25:41,563 --> 00:25:43,163
Thanks, anyway.

633
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:45,204
Don't mention it.
I was just playing along.

634
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,444
But I have a question.

635
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:50,244
Are you serious

636
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,004
about what you said before?

637
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,643
Obviously, I just tried

638
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,764
to convince him.

639
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:02,044
You take it seriously?

640
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:03,684
O-Of course not.

641
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:05,083
Why would I ever believe that?

642
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,843
I'm not a conceited man.

643
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,123
Don't take it seriously.

644
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:12,843
But actually, I...

645
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:13,363
Lin Hu!

646
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:14,643
Zhong Xi is awake!

647
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:15,563
He has woken?

648
00:26:15,563 --> 00:26:16,883
I'll take my leave.

649
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:18,044
Come on.

650
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:26,484
Young Master.

651
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:28,803
Where are you going?

652
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:29,843
To find Kong Hou.

653
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:31,724
You've barely recovered.

654
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,403
We don't know
Kong Hou's current situation.

655
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:34,163
If you act rashly

656
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:35,363
and encounter danger again,

657
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:36,964
the leader will kill me.

658
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:38,883
No worries. I'm fine now.

659
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,083
Young Master!

660
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:42,964
Master.

661
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:45,484
What are you doing?

662
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,004
To find Kong Hou.

663
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:48,284
Absurd!

664
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:51,044
Lin Hu! Confine him!

665
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:54,284
Master.

666
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:57,764
Kong Hou is innocent.

667
00:26:58,403 --> 00:26:59,484
She can't

668
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,524
choose her origins,

669
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,883
but she's done nothing wrong.

670
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:05,204
Besides, she's my wife.

671
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:06,964
I must bring her back.

672
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:07,964
Zhong Xi.

673
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:11,123
Regardless of her innocence,

674
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,363
if you persist now,

675
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:13,724
you'll make

676
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:14,764
both yourself

677
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:15,643
and Liuguang Sect

678
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:17,044
targets of public outrage.

679
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:18,403
By then,

680
00:27:18,883 --> 00:27:19,724
do you think

681
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,484
you'll get any chance

682
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,083
to explain yourself to her?

683
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,363
Even if you retrieve her,

684
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,403
without a proper plan,

685
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:28,724
she'll just end up

686
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:30,403
constantly hiding again.

687
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:32,524
Is that what

688
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,444
you want for her?

689
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,204
I understand,

690
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,883
but whenever I think

691
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,204
she is now trapped by Jiusu,

692
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,603
enduring something,

693
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:48,684
possibly in danger,

694
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:51,764
I can't restrain myself.

695
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,123
I have failed you.

696
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:07,363
I beg your permission.

697
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:28,444
Hurry!

698
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:31,163
Kneel!

699
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,083
Your Eminence.

700
00:28:34,883 --> 00:28:36,163
What's the meaning of this?

701
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:37,524
Your Eminence.

702
00:28:37,524 --> 00:28:39,284
Lord Jiusu sent two cultivators

703
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:40,163
for you.

704
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:41,184
Take them away.

705
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:42,444
I've said before.

706
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:44,603
I don't need others' spiritual energy.

707
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,563
Why must you

708
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:46,484
harm yourself?

709
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:47,843
One or two cultivators

710
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,603
could alleviate your suffering.

711
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,204
Forcibly suppressing it

712
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,163
is futile.

713
00:28:52,684 --> 00:28:53,323
Get away.

714
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:55,044
One more word,

715
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:56,684
and I'll kill you.

716
00:28:56,964 --> 00:28:57,724
Forgive me.

717
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:58,764
I'll take my leave.

718
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,244
If you change your mind,

719
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:02,764
summon me at any time.

720
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:04,119
Get lost!

721
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,244
Why are you hunting these cultivators?

722
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:24,123
By order of Master Wu Bei,

723
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,004
we gather cultivators for our new leader

724
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:27,163
to gain their energy.

725
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:30,004
Who is the new leader?

726
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:31,044
Lowly ones like us

727
00:29:31,044 --> 00:29:32,004
never see the Sovereign.

728
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,964
We only heard she's a female cultivator.

729
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:37,163
Kong Hou?

730
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,123
Impossible.

731
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:40,563
Sir,

732
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:42,363
don't believe these dark cultivators.

733
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:43,484
If you spare them,

734
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:44,524
they will kill again.

735
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,323
You're injured.

736
00:29:46,643 --> 00:29:47,843
Return to your sect.

737
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:49,883
I'll deal with these dark cultivators.

738
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:51,843
Thank you.

739
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:57,403
You...

740
00:29:58,323 --> 00:29:58,764
Leave.

741
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,044
Go!

742
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:04,484
I hear

743
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:06,684
you've proposed to Lady Ling Bo.

744
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:07,724
Is this true?

745
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:10,843
You knew already?

746
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,163
Did you think you could hide it from me?

747
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:15,004
Answer me.

748
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:16,843
Do you genuinely

749
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,524
like Lady Ling Bo?

750
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:21,123
Well, I do.

751
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:24,603
I know your nature better than anyone.

752
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:26,044
Or perhaps

753
00:30:26,444 --> 00:30:28,363
you like her for her status?

754
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:30,684
Since I taught you,

755
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,964
you've focused solely on cultivation.

756
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,083
We both know

757
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:38,563
Zhong Xi is top one

758
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:40,724
in Liuguang Sect,

759
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:41,603
even in Lingyou Realm.

760
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:42,643
However,

761
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:45,603
you want

762
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:47,764
to stand out

763
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:49,603
more than anyone.

764
00:30:49,603 --> 00:30:50,123
Master.

765
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:52,083
Are you saying

766
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:53,684
I'm trying to stand out

767
00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:55,563
by courting Lady Ling Bo?

768
00:30:56,684 --> 00:30:57,964
Even if that's true, what does

769
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:59,603
that have to do with her status?

770
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,603
Ling Bo is the daughter
of Zhaohan Sect's leader.

771
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:04,004
You think I don't know?

772
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:06,163
Years ago,

773
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:09,083
when you befriended her,

774
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:11,123
did you

775
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,284
calculate her potential

776
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:15,363
to become Zhaohan Sect's next leader?

777
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:19,004
I always believed

778
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,803
you were a clever man.

779
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:24,484
But cleverness often
becomes its own trap.

780
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,684
I'm telling you,

781
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:27,323
in matters of the heart,

782
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,403
opportunism spells doom.

783
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,484
I'm not an opportunist.

784
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:31,323
Aren't you?

785
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:32,484
Then why now

786
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:34,403
do you persistently

787
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:35,684
court her favor?

788
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,244
The Zhaohan Sect leader's health
improves.

789
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:41,004
After all,

790
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:42,044
Ling Bo is her daughter.

791
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:43,444
You...

792
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,643
At least, you're honest.

793
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,724
Master Song He,

794
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,764
may I speak with him privately?

795
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:01,643
Master...

796
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:07,363
You heard everything?

797
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,563
So if I hadn't learned this,

798
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:11,724
you'd still pursue me

799
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:12,764
for my status?

800
00:32:14,204 --> 00:32:15,643
I-I'm sorry.

801
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:18,603
Had you not been exposed,

802
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:19,803
would you

803
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:20,724
apologize to me?

804
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,244
What's done is done.

805
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:29,444
I've nothing more to say.

806
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:30,764
I'm terribly sorry.

807
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:32,764
I don't need your apologies.

808
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:34,964
People aim for higher.

809
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:36,764
Striving to stand out

810
00:32:37,004 --> 00:32:37,764
is reasonable.

811
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,803
However,

812
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:44,444
since childhood, I've feared others

813
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,603
seeing me as the leader's daughter,

814
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:47,924
assuming I abuse my privilege.

815
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:49,123
I also feared people

816
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:50,284
thinking me incompetent,

817
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:51,444
always relying

818
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:52,563
on her esteemed status.

819
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:56,244
Yet I never imagined

820
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:58,004
that in your eyes,

821
00:32:58,403 --> 00:32:59,204
my identity

822
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:00,964
is precisely my worth.

823
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:01,924
I...

824
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,123
All these years of growth,

825
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:07,484
I've been striving to prove myself.

826
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:08,684
Yet in the end,

827
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:10,284
I'm still trapped

828
00:33:10,284 --> 00:33:12,044
by being the sect leader's daughter.

829
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:14,044
Ling Bo, don't say that.

830
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,004
It's okay.

831
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:16,803
Now,

832
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,163
I have greater priorities.

833
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:19,284
From now on,

834
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,764
don't pester me anymore.

835
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:22,204
Between us,

836
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:24,004
all is settled.

837
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,724
Listen to me, Ling Bo!

838
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:26,603
Wait.

839
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:32,643
Who's there?

840
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:33,724
Guys,

841
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,764
I am Lin Hu from Liuguang Sect.

842
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:38,964
Apologies.

843
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,284
Nice to meet you.

844
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:42,924
Might I inquire

845
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:45,004
what happened here?

846
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:46,843
While returning to our sect,

847
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:48,928
dark cultivators ambushed us,
trying to seize us

848
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,163
to provide spiritual energy

849
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:50,964
for their Sovereign.

850
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:52,284
A cultivator

851
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:52,964
helped us.

852
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:53,964
We narrowly survived.

853
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:55,083
A cultivator?

854
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,123
What does he look like?

855
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,883
His skills are exceptional,

856
00:33:59,044 --> 00:34:00,083
with high cultivation.

857
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,144
He might be a Master from a major sect.

858
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:03,244
Young Master?

859
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:05,123
Do you know his whereabouts?

860
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:26,763
Why are you here?

861
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:28,044
- Looking for Young Master.
- Looking for Zhong Xi.

862
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:30,243
Wait,

863
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,723
why are you seeking him?

864
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:32,804
To find out the truth

865
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,723
about Kong Hou.

866
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,243
Come on.

867
00:34:35,243 --> 00:34:37,444
This area is full of dark cultivators.
It's perilous.

868
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:38,404
I'll handle it alone.

869
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,123
Stay out of this.

870
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:40,404
Don't underestimate me.

871
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:41,683
Can you handle it alone?

872
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:42,364
Look,

873
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:43,563
I never underestimated you.

874
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,004
I'm concerned for your safety!

875
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,683
Your concern is unnecessary.

876
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:47,603
Worry about

877
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:48,683
your own safety.

878
00:34:51,763 --> 00:34:52,444
Regardless,

879
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:53,723
you're worried about Zhong Xi,

880
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:54,563
while I

881
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:55,683
will uncover the truth.

882
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:56,723
Let's go together then.

883
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:57,563
We can

884
00:34:57,603 --> 00:34:58,324
work together.

885
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:00,884
Fine, whatever.

886
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:18,203
Your Eminence.

887
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:20,603
Your Eminence.

888
00:35:21,044 --> 00:35:22,243
Why did you come abruptly?

889
00:35:22,524 --> 00:35:23,444
What happened?

890
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,083
An outsider

891
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,844
insists on meeting Your Eminence.

892
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:28,603
Who is it?

893
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:30,163
I don't know him.

894
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:31,524
He vowed

895
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:32,844
not to depart

896
00:35:33,004 --> 00:35:34,524
without seeing you.

897
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:36,683
It's him.

898
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:43,283
Master Zhong Xi.

899
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:44,524
An unexpected guest.

900
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:46,364
What brings you

901
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:47,563
here?

902
00:35:51,364 --> 00:35:52,083
I understand.

903
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:53,884
You came for your beloved.

904
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:54,884
Is that right?

905
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,484
Bring Kong Hou here.

906
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:57,563
I want to see her.

907
00:35:57,924 --> 00:35:58,924
Don't worry.

908
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,083
She's perfectly fine.

909
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,004
She's my sister.

910
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:03,884
How could I ever harm her?

911
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:05,683
If I don't get to see her today,

912
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:07,563
I will destroy this place!

913
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:08,763
Such bold claims.

914
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:10,083
Destroy this place?

915
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:12,324
With your current condition?

916
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,004
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

917
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:16,004
Enough with the chatter.

918
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:17,763
Where's Kong Hou?

919
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,243
Let me remind you of one thing.

920
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:22,123
This is my territory.

921
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:24,083
Who do you think you are?

922
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:25,083
Guards!

923
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:25,763
Wait!

924
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:31,283
Your Eminence.

925
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:51,844
Kong Hou?

926
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,404
How can you be their Sovereign?

927
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:58,283
Yes,

928
00:36:58,643 --> 00:37:01,203
I am now their Sovereign.
