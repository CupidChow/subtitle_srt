Huan Zong.

17
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:53,578
Do you...

18
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,297
Do you fall for anyone?

19
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:59,257
Why do you ask that?

20
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:00,257
No.

21
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:02,017
I was right, wasn't I?

22
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,338
N-No.

23
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:04,418
Impossible.

24
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,377
Then why are you

25
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:09,577
reading these romance storybooks?

26
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,137
I don't think

27
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,352
you enjoy reading

28
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,618
romance storybooks.

29
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:15,458
So, there must be a reason.

30
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:16,178
Right?

31
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,257
What kind of person

32
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:20,577
is she?

33
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:21,498
How did

34
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,577
you meet her?

35
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:23,458
Did you tell her

36
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,338
that you fall for her?

37
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,697
Does she

38
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:26,537
like you too?

39
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,058
I read these just

40
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,938
to find out

41
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:35,264
the way to confirm

42
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:36,178
if I fall for someone.

43
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,738
But I didn't say I fall for anyone.

44
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:38,898
Not at all.

45
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,898
If you don't fall for anyone,

46
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:44,058
then why are you reading these?

47
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:45,857
Alright.

48
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:48,218
Let's assume you don't fall for anyone.

49
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,697
Assume?

50
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:51,458
No means no.

51
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,104
Alright, I get it.

52
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:56,778
I get it.

53
00:02:57,938 --> 00:02:58,848
I've read

54
00:02:58,848 --> 00:02:59,618
these books

55
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:00,697
many times.

56
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:01,618
No need to read them.

57
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:03,040
Just ask me.

58
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,498
I can tell you.

59
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,298
Tell me.

60
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:06,417
When you see

61
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,697
this girl,

62
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:09,537
does your heart

63
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:10,898
beat wildly?

64
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:22,537
Think about it.

65
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:24,697
Do you

66
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:26,377
want to protect her?

67
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,537
If she vanishes from your life,

68
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:42,112
will you feel

69
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:43,338
very painful?

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,856
Yeah.

71
00:03:57,856 --> 00:03:58,977
You got it.

72
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,898
You do fall for her.

73
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,377
(So,)

74
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,618
(I really fall for you?)

75
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,417
Huan Zong, what's the matter with you?

76
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:15,938
Thinking about her again?

77
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:19,137
I really didn't expect

78
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:20,738
that someone as cold as you

79
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:21,418
would have

80
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,658
such an adorable side.

81
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:26,697
Let me tell you the truth.

82
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:28,738
Actually,

83
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,017
I did all this for Lin Hu.

84
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,418
So it's Lin Hu?

85
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:37,938
Makes sense.

86
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:39,457
Lin Hu

87
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:40,864
also seems a bit dense.

88
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:42,777
Exactly.

89
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,337
We're best friends.

90
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,658
So,

91
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,137
if he needs help,

92
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:49,498
I want to help.

93
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,418
However, Huan Zong,

94
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:53,938
you're really nice to Lin Hu.

95
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,217
Promise me,

96
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,736
don't tell Lin Hu about

97
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:05,738
the questions

98
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,137
I asked for him today.

99
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,577
He has his pride.

100
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,217
Don't worry. I promise

101
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:12,418
I won't say a thing.

102
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:20,858
(Registration)
Give me your recommendation letter.

103
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:22,738
What?

104
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,978
What are you doing here without one?

105
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:27,168
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

106
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:28,224
is not a place for anyone

107
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:28,938
to enter.

108
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:30,720
Take a good look

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,777
at us.

110
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:32,858
Look at us,

111
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,377
do we still need recommendation?

112
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,697
Trying to sneak in?

113
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,058
Leave now.

114
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,512
Don't waste my time.

115
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,098
You're insincere.

116
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:43,098
(Registration)
Wait, you!

117
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:44,178
Why are you so rude?

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
We have rules here.

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,337
I just follow the rules.

120
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:48,538
That's it.

121
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,137
- What? I...
- Lin Hu.

122
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:52,457
Don't cause trouble.

123
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:55,217
You can't even control your temper,

124
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,017
and still want
to get in Jiao Tong Pavilion?

125
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,098
Buddy,

126
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,424
could you

127
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:00,192
please show us

128
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,697
the letter?

129
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,312
Take a close look.

130
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,896
(Recommendation Letter,
from the Owner of Pingyue House)

131
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,377
Got it.

132
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:17,408
(Registration)

133
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:18,017
Here.

134
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:18,858
Thank you.

135
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:19,858
Let's go.

136
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:21,538
Leaving?

137
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:22,624
We haven't gone in.

138
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:23,137
Let's go.

139
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,848
Didn't expect

140
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,777
your faces can't be used
as a recommendation letter.

141
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:39,498
Actually, well...

142
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:40,618
Sometimes...

143
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:41,568
Someone

144
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,938
said confidently

145
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,577
that there's no place he couldn't go.

146
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:46,816
Why did he fail

147
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:47,978
at the crucial moment?

148
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:48,697
Well, I...

149
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,538
Lin Hu didn't prepare properly.

150
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:53,858
But now we need
to come up with a new plan.

151
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:54,738
Right.

152
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,658
I have an idea.

153
00:06:58,058 --> 00:06:58,978
Let's hear it.

154
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,858
We're missing a recommendation letter.

155
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,217
Then let's make one ourselves.

156
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,328
How is it?

157
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,897
No need.

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,752
(Recommendation)

159
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,137
I've prepared it.

(From Owner of Pingyue House)
Here it is.

161
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:14,137
Alright.

164

Wait, wait.

165
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,538
We're still missing one thing.

166
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,777
- This one...
- No way.

167
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:30,624
Another one.

168
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:34,858
Try this. Try it.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
(Jiao Tong Pavilion)

170
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:44,498
Please.

171
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:50,577
Lady,

172
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:51,978
please follow me.

173
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:53,978
No need for such formalities.

174
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,337
This way, please.

175
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:10,978
Lady, here.

176
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:12,538
Thank you.

177

Lady.

178
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,058
Why the rush?

179
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:21,498
You'll get it later.

180
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,658
- Lady, but...
- Come take it.

181
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,217
You may go.

182
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:31,777
Don't disturb the others.

183
00:08:32,224 --> 00:08:33,152
Thank you, Madam.

184
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:34,144
Madam, enjoy.

185
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:40,778
Here in the Jiao Tong Pavilion,

186
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:41,824
it's all about

187
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:42,784
spirit stones.

188
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:44,258
Don't let them wait.

189
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:45,857
They are all shrewd

190
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:46,577
and sharp.

191
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,018
I'm

192
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,617
not that stingy.

193
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,178
Your first time here?

194
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,617
Yes.

195
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,737
There will be new performers today.

196
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:02,688
It is said

197
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,097
each one is quite talented.

198
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:05,504
Hopefully, there will be some

199
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,737
who are talented and pretty.

200
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,737
The new performers

201
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,018
don't know anything.

202
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,138
What's the fun?

203
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,977
They need to be taught well.

204
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,138
You got the hang of it.

205
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,538
I've studied it.

206
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:26,418
By the way,

207
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:28,778
where's Jiao Tong?

208
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:33,058
What's wrong?

209
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,624
We can't see him?

210
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:40,378
Next one.

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,568
Please.

212
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:43,616
Please.

213
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:46,898
Hello, everyone.

214
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:54,418
Pretty boy,

215
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,658
your looks and qualifications

216
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,080
don't quite match

217
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,744
our requirements.

218
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,664
Please seek another opportunity.

219
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:04,058
Wait!

220
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:05,938
Sir, I understand.

221
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:07,138
Well, my looks

222
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:08,977
may not be top-notch.

223
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:09,857
Everyone,

224
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:11,872
you're all smart

225
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:12,817
and discerning,

226
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:13,737
having seen so many.

227
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,457
You must've heard one saying.

228
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,337
Don't judge a book

229
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:18,857
from its cover.

230
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,378
Then how can we see

231
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:22,658
the content of you?

232
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:23,178
Well,

233
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:25,138
I'll show you.

234
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,658
Get ready.

235
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:27,977
Well...

236
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,898
Lend me this.

237
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,088
I'll start now.

238
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:33,737
Well,

239
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:37,178
at the peak of this imperial city...

240
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,800
Enough.

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,408
After that...

242
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:54,298
Stop.

243
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,658
You have a quick mind,

244
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:59,018
and a sharp tongue.

245
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,058
I know.

246
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,617
What do

247
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:02,778
you two think?

248
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:05,217
I think this is the best.

249
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,008
You have a keen eye.

250
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:09,977
Next one.

251
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,178
Could he be the best?

252
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:39,977
May I ask

253
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,298
if you have any talents?

254
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:42,497
For example?

255
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,032
Music, chess, calligraphy,

256
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,018
or painting.

257
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,737
So, they are talents?

258
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,138
Nice taste.

259
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:55,097
Congratulations on being admitted.

260
00:11:56,697 --> 00:11:57,977
Congratulations.

261
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,938
I passed?

262
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:08,672
Just now,

263
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:09,737
it's only the preliminary.

264
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,258
Don't be too smug.

265
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,217
Whether you can stay,

266
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,816
it depends on if anyone

267
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,258
- This Jiao Tong Pavilion
- supports you.

268
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,258
is very superficial.

269
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,497
They require a talent show,

270
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,928
but you've passed

271
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:22,080
before you performed.

272
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,217
The definition of talent here

273
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:25,298
is a bit unique.

274
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,977
Who cares?

275
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,298
Just be cautious.

276
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:29,538
Of what?

277
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:30,697
Of what?

278
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,817
Traps, pitfalls.

279
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:34,097
Traps?

280
00:12:34,457 --> 00:12:35,497
I've only fallen for

281
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:36,576
traps set by Kong Hou.

282
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:38,217
Hearing her name

283
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,178
makes me angry.

284
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:39,938
Let me tell you.

285
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:40,704
- If it weren't for her,
- You guys

286
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:41,857
- we'd never be here.
- have to listen to me.

287
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:42,528
She knows

288
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,697
the purpose of our visit.

289
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:46,977
- Fine, keep defending her.
- If not,

290
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,977
then you'll have to leave.

291
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,178
You...

292
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:53,760
What? Me? Lin Hu.

293
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:55,258
Lin Hu,

294
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:56,928
you'll go straight

295
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:57,984
to the kitchen.

296
00:12:58,368 --> 00:12:59,418
K-Kitchen?

297
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,344
Such a good figure.

298
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,256
Impressive.

299
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,298
Excellent.

300
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,737
Mine.

301
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,728
Excellent.

302
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:23,577
- He's great.
- Yeah.

303
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,457
That's him.

304
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:31,418
His talent is excellent.

305
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,538
That's really rude.

306
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:40,658
Who did it?

307
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,977
What if it hurts him?

308
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,778
Well...

309
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,018
I didn't mean it.

310
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,418
Hey, hey.

311
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:00,448
Come.

312
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,178
A tip for him.

313
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,258
Thank you.

314
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,737
T-This is good.

315
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:18,857
It's good.

316
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:20,857
Good then.

317
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,138
Here is

318
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,800
where we prepare

319
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,337
food for guests.

320
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:31,872
Take a tour

321
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:32,864
around here.

322
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:34,977
It's quite lively.

323
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:37,378
Excuse me.

324
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,097
I have a question

325
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,378
to ask.

326
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,217
Don't ask questions unrelated to work.

327
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:43,936
This is very related to work.

328
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:45,217
This is about work.

329
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,138
Go ahead.

330
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:47,418
What do you want to ask?

331
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:49,138
I just really want to know

332
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,368
when I can meet

333
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,658
Jiao Tong.

334
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,440
I really admire his talent.

335
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,658
- I want to learn from him.
- Another one.

336
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:57,376
What are you people

337
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:58,658
thinking about every day?

338
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,018
Getting in Jiao Tong Pavilion

339
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:01,696
won't make you be

340
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:02,658
with Jiao Tong.

341
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:03,488
Not really.

342
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,857
Who do you think Jiao Tong is?

343
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,138
Don't even think about it.

344
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:09,018
This is your job.

345
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:10,977
Work hard.

346
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:12,736
Wait, this...

347
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,178
Sir, this...

348
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:17,697
Hurry up.

349
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:22,778
This is my job?

350
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,457
Bravo.

351
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:55,178
Sounds good.

352
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,017
Excellent.

353
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:46,898
(Impressive.)

354
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,057
(Anything you can't do?)

355
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:50,378
(I can't play the pipa.)

356
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,898
(That's not what I meant.)

357
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:57,457
(I can play the zheng,
sheng, flute, and ruan.)

358
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:58,777
(Enough.)

359
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,777
(You can't play it so well.)

360
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,017
(Why?)

361
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,217
(We have a mission.)

362
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,297
(Remember?)

363
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:08,777
(Jiao Tong?)

364
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,697
(Yes, Jiao Tong.)

365
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:12,818
(You mean,)

366
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:14,618
(I play the flute badly,)

367
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:15,777
(and he will show up)

368
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:16,658
(to stop me?)

369
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,618
(Exactly.)

370
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:19,257
(Okay.)

371
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,497
(I'll do as you wish.)

372
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,378
(The worse, the better.)

373
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:23,392
One more.

374
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,898
One more.

375
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,378
One more.

376
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:27,338
One more.

377
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,618
One more.

378
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:29,628
Exactly.

379
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,138
Right.

380
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:31,658
One more.

381
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:33,858
- Pretty boy, one more.
- Right.

382
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,697
What's going on? It's terrible.

383
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:46,977
A stand-in is hiding behind?

384
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,378
Come out, stand-in.

385
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,472
Right.

386
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,858
It's so terrible. What's happening?

387
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,152
- Get off.
- Get off.

388
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,578
- Refund.
- Refund.

389
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:00,704
Get off the stage.

390
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:01,737
I think

391
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:04,737
it's not that bad.

392
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,898
This is tormenting.

393
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,057
Exactly.

394
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,128
Sorry for startling you.

395
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:36,858
Let me offer a piece

396
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:38,938
as an apology.

397
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,568
What happened just now?

398
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,977
Is it about the flute?

399
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:49,024
Doesn't matter.

400
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,217
What matters now is

401
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,737
I saw him.

402
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:56,192
I know it.

403
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,144
You played badly on purpose

404
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,297
to lure him out.

405
00:19:59,297 --> 00:19:59,858
Right?

406
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,457
But doing so,

407
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,977
I didn't expect this outcome.

408
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:05,537
It's a bit troublesome.

409
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,297
It's okay.

410
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,618
I'm here.

411
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:08,697
Leave the rest to me.

412
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:11,618
At least,

413
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,672
we saw

414
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,048
Jiao Tong today.

415
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:15,658
Yes.

416
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,658
So what do we do

417
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:18,777
next?

418
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,136
Go and observe

419
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:24,297
Jiao Tong's room.

420
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,977
Pay attention to his daily life

421
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,712
and schedule.

422
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,977
We've gone through so much effort.

423
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:36,858
Huan Zong wasn't dismissed for nothing.

424
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:37,658
But

425
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,818
what should we do next?

426
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,497
The performers today

427
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,418
are exceptionally handsome.

428
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,138
- Yeah.
- Especially the pretty boy

429
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:46,777
who played the flute.

430
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:47,977
Yes, yes.

431
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,217
Even though his playing is a bit off,

432
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:51,658
that's not important.

433
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:54,257
His elegance charms me.

434
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:55,618
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

435
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,088
We share the same taste.

436
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,497
I've taken a special liking to him.

437
00:20:58,697 --> 00:20:59,457
Right? Right?

438
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,378
Right.

439
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:01,618
Exactly.

440
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:02,497
I wonder

441
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:03,658
what tier he's in.

442
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,138
If we buy his meeting token,

443
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,378
we can meet him in private,

444
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,737
right?

445
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:10,938
I've heard...

446
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,297
Meet in private?

447
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,257
No way.

448
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:15,217
Young ladies.

449
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:16,138
Young ladies.

450
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,737
Are you talking about

451
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,457
the young man playing the flute?

452
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:20,384
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:21,217
What?

454
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:22,297
Do you like him too?

455
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:23,977
It's a shame he got dismissed.

456
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,697
I'll take you to see him.

457
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:27,618
And you'll

458
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:29,658
take me to see Jiao Tong.

459
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:30,297
How about it?

460
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:31,938
Anyone who spends

461
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,057
at least 2,000 spirit stones

462
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,178
is considered tier one.

463
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,578
And you need to be at least tier ten

464
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,560
to buy his meeting token.

465
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,858
Not to mention it,

466
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,378
the key is...

467
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:42,898
What's the key?

468
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:45,257
I've finally found you.

469
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,257
It requires 100,000 spirit stones.

470
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:48,898
100,000 spirit stones?

471
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,537
How am I supposed to save that much?

472
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:51,457
Exactly.

473
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:52,297
Continue.

474
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,217
Continue.

475
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,977
100,000 spirit stones...

476
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:15,658
This

477
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:17,888
is what I have.

478
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,904
How's that possible?

479
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:35,618
Young lady, what's wrong?

480
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:39,497
It's you.

481
00:22:40,297 --> 00:22:42,497
Did they rip you

482
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:43,457
off?

483
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:47,418
Miss, I remember you.

484
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,977
I think

485
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,618
I got the lovesickness.

486
00:22:55,138 --> 00:22:57,697
Lovesickness?

487
00:22:58,178 --> 00:22:59,178
Among today's

488
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,032
performers,

489
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,578
there's one I'm quite fond of,

490
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:04,777
but he didn't stay.

491
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,977
I went out to find him,

492
00:23:07,257 --> 00:23:08,818
yet he had already left.

493
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,938
Well, which one?

494
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,297
Is it

495
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:17,858
him?

496
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,737
I saw him save you.

497
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:25,297
Did you know each other?

498
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,697
Miss, please help.

499
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,537
I want to see him.

500
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:37,297
L-Let me think.

501
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:42,138
That Madam Chen

502
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:43,497
doesn't seem like a bad person.

503
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,057
No, no way.

504
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,378
But for now,

505
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:49,297
this is the only way.

506
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,257
Huan Zong, why are you here?

507
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:55,537
Waiting for you.

508
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,658
This is Zhong Xi from Liuguang Sect.

509
00:23:57,658 --> 00:23:58,618
Why is he here?

510
00:23:58,618 --> 00:23:59,378
Waiting for me?

511
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:01,618
Did everything go smoothly?

512
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,858
Of course.

513
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:05,138
Let's go.

514
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:17,338
It seems I need

515
00:24:17,376 --> 00:24:19,418
to figure out a complete plan.

516
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:22,858
Huan Zong, please help.

517
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,178
That Madam Chen

518
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:25,858
doesn't seem like a bad person.

519
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,777
She just admires you

520
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:28,618
and adores you.

521
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,858
She has no bad intentions.

522
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:32,457
No way.

523
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:33,737
I reject.

524
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:40,297
Huan Zong, you know

525
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:42,240
how difficult to meet

526
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,697
Jiao Tong.

527
00:24:43,777 --> 00:24:45,024
It costs 100,000 spirit stones

528
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,138
at the Jiao Tong Pavilion.

529
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:47,858
And,

530
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:50,537
it has to be a regular customer
for over three years.

531
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:51,658
Only a major customer

532
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,618
like Madam Chen

533
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,048
can get

534
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:55,537
the rare meeting token.

535
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,618
And it's one-on-one.

536
00:24:58,858 --> 00:24:59,904
But you can't

537
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,864
sell me out

538
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:02,017
because of it.

539
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:03,418
What do you take me for?

540
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:04,457
I...

541
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:05,138
Besides,

542
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,098
I don't know Madam Chen at all.

543
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:07,977
I'm afraid

544
00:25:08,098 --> 00:25:09,338
I can't do it.

545
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,128
I really

546
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,858
can't come up

547
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:15,138
with any other options.

548
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:17,568
Then I should

549
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,457
think of another solution.

550
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,618
How about this?

551
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,257
Tomorrow, I'll go to

552
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:25,697
Pingyue House

553
00:25:26,098 --> 00:25:27,616
and see if there's

554
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:28,416
any other

555
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,737
pretty boys.

556
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,457
Find other pretty boys?

557
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:38,138
I really

558
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,138
have no other options.

559
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:41,457
I wonder

560
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,737
if I can find

561
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:44,138
someone

562
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:46,017
like you.

563
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:48,737
Find some similar ones

564
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:49,658
and make do.

565
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,378
Come on.

566
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,537
Stop that.

567
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:57,257
I'll give it a try.

568
00:25:57,938 --> 00:25:58,658
Really?

569
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,257
Huan Zong,

570
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:01,697
didn't you just say

571
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:02,658
you couldn't do it?

572
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:04,537
It's okay to try.

573
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:05,737
But remember one thing.

574
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:08,224
Don't go find pretty boys.

575
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:10,178
Don't worry.

576
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:11,777
Once it's done,

577
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,858
I'll definitely make up for you.

578
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,257
How?

579
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:18,537
Well,

580
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:20,338
how?

581
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:21,257
How about this?

582
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:24,057
You'll owe me this time,

583
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,138
and repay it later.

584
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:26,697
Alright.

585
00:26:28,497 --> 00:26:29,297
Pour some tea.

586
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,017
Yes.

587
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,240
I wonder why I came

588
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,017
here.

589
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:40,256
Just to help

590
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:42,297
Kong Hou.

591
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:44,297
Now I have to wash dishes.

592
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,098
T-There are so many dishes.

593
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,098
I really don't know

594
00:26:47,098 --> 00:26:48,658
how long I'll have to wash them for.

595
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:52,217
Hey, newcomer.

596
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,217
Hurry up.

597
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:53,984
We need them.

598
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:55,297
Wait.

599
00:26:56,378 --> 00:26:57,178
That many?

600
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,944
There's plenty here.

601
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,858
How can I finish them all?

602
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:10,697
Young Master,

603
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:12,858
could you change into this outfit?

604
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,938
Don't mind these.

605
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:23,697
Maybe

606
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,178
she likes it.

607
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:26,418
Hurry.

608
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:34,658
Young Master, take your time.

609
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:43,658
Madam Chen is quite interesting.

610
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:47,418
I need to change clothes.

611
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,418
But you are here.

612
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:50,977
I forgot it.

613
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:52,704
However,

614
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,080
if I stay alone

615
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,178
with Madam Chen outside,

616
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:56,858
it would be awkward.

617
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:59,297
Don't worry, just go change.

618
00:27:59,338 --> 00:27:59,938
I won't look.

619
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:32,017
Why is it taking so long?

620
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,858
This is a bit complicated to wear.

621
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:37,792
You said you wouldn't look.

622
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:38,858
Why did you come over?

623
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:40,898
You took a while,

624
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,016
so I'm here

625
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:42,737
to check on you.

626
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:44,288
Besides,

627
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:44,832
you are

628
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,297
almost dressed already.

629
00:28:47,578 --> 00:28:48,777
This outfit

630
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,048
doesn't seem to be

631
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,737
the current style.

632
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,658
Let me help you.

633
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,537
Otherwise, Madam Chen

634
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,658
might get anxious waiting.

635
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:24,938
What's wrong?

636
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:26,697
Maybe

637
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:28,800
Madam Chen thinks

638
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,697
you resemble someone,

639
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,537
so she is so fond of you.

640
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:33,737
Even asking you to change your outfit.

641
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:35,777
Why do you say that?

642
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:38,777
That's what the storybooks would say.

643
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,977
Who does Madam Chen think

644
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:43,737
you resemble?

645
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:47,818
This outfit

646
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:49,017
looks like

647
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,537
an attire of royal nobility.

648
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:55,392
I prepared

649
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:56,537
all these for you.

650
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,138
You will definitely like it.

651
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,296
(Oh no, Huan Zong is fasting.)

652
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:20,017
Huan Zong, eat more.

653
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,578
Huan Zong, the fish ball tastes good.

654
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:26,720
Pick another one for me.

655
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,618
Oh my.

656
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,280
Madam Chen, look.

657
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:35,818
What's that?

658
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,680
What do you want me to look at?

659
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,216
Nothing, I was mistaken.

660
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,938
Here, try the chicken.

661
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:53,178
Huan Zong,

662
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,178
could you shell some walnuts?

663
00:30:55,257 --> 00:30:56,618
It's my favorite.

664
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:10,418
I'll take another one.
This one isn't done.

665
00:31:15,098 --> 00:31:16,898
Why are you so clumsy?

666
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:18,578
Can't even shell a walnut.

667
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,418
You'd do it then.

668
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:22,938
Me?

669
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:24,898
Then the secret will be out.

670
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:25,537
Stop talking.

671
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,457
We once

672
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:31,072
were as close as you are now.

673
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,497
Madam Chen,

674
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,584
we didn't mean

675
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,777
to deceive you.

676
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:41,977
No problem.

677
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,418
Seeing you two

678
00:31:44,618 --> 00:31:46,080
being intimate

679
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:48,064
makes me envious.

680
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:50,378
N-No.

681
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:53,057
W-We aren't...

682
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:55,697
The reason I wanted to see Huan Zong

683
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:57,338
is

684
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,064
that he looks very much like my lover.

685
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,144
But my lover

686
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,537
is a prince of Lingyou Realm.

687
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,338
We aren't destined to be together.

688
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,416
He has to return to the palace

689
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,457
each afternoon.

690
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,912
So he never

691
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,457
watched the sunset with me.

692
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,457
What I want most

693
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,618
is to watch sunset with him

694
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:18,378
just once.

695
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,297
You've worked so hard

696
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:35,697
to get this token

697
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,618
just to send the woman you love

698
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:39,138
to another man?

699
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:40,898
No,

700
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:43,297
we're not in relationship.

701
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,457
Then why do you do so much for her?

702
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:50,818
You can

703
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:52,320
deceive yourself,

704
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:55,737
but can't deceive others.

705
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,520
Didn't expect
Madam Chen wanted to see you

706
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,977
for such a reason.

707
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:06,777
Did we do a good deed

708
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,658
by chance?

709
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:10,017
But Huan Zong,

710
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,096
why do you look like

711
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:13,858
someone from the Lingyou Realm royalty?

712
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:14,977
Why would I know?

713
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,697
Probably

714
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:17,697
good-looking people

715
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:18,537
all look alike.

716
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,178
Anyway,

717
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,217
thank you.

718
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,098
Okay, you can head back.

719
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:25,376
I need to find

720
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:26,257
Jiao Tong.

721
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:28,777
What do you mean?

722
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,752
Now you're abandoning me?

723
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:31,858
No.

724
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:33,297
I'm just in a hurry

725
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:34,898
to meet Jiao Tong.

726
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,440
What for?

727
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:38,688
It's still early.

728
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:39,872
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

729
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:41,138
isn't even open yet.

730
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,178
I think

731
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,737
we should head back to the inn.

732
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,696
I have some important things

733
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:46,432
to tell you.

734
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,418
You're always thoughtful.

735
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,618
I should get prepared.

736
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:52,658
Let's go back to the inn first.

737
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:53,537
I need

738
00:33:53,537 --> 00:33:55,257
to freshen up and get dressed.

739
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,178
Then I'll go meet

740
00:33:56,178 --> 00:33:57,217
Jiao Tong.

741
00:33:57,338 --> 00:33:58,537
That's not what I meant.

742
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,328
I mean...

743
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,256
Let's go.

744
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:00,777
Let's go.

745
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:05,457
Does it look good?

746
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:08,537
Yes,

747
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:09,898
but it doesn't matter.

748
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:11,680
Looking good matters.

749
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:13,657
Remember.

750
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:17,024
Once you leave your cup,
don't drink from it again.

751
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,338
The same goes for food.

752
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:19,457
Be cautious of

753
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,818
those with ill intentions

754
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:21,778
poisoning you.

755
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:23,584
I'll be fine.

756
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:24,778
I'm immune to all poisons.

757
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,698
Second,

758
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,858
if no one else is around

759
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,378
and you are with Jiao Tong

760
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:30,457
in a room alone,

761
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,416
don't let him get close to you.

762
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:33,738
Keep your distance.

763
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,696
But I'm going to learn
how to play the qin.

764
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,560
Then

765
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,218
there will definitely be close contact.

766
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:41,696
I've heard

767
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:42,698
the teacher has to teach

768
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,898
by taking the student's hand.

769
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:47,378
What? That's insane.

770
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:49,738
Don't let him touch you.

771
00:34:50,112 --> 00:34:51,657
Huan Zong, why not?

772
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,338
I'll learn how to play the qin.

773
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,432
No need to mind

774
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:56,177
these formalities.

775
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:56,992
Besides,

776
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,457
that Jiao Tong is amazing.

777
00:34:58,457 --> 00:34:59,137
Yes.

778
00:34:59,457 --> 00:35:01,177
He is indeed amazing,

779
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,657
the best music cultivator.

780
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,778
But the Jiao Tong Pavilion
has various people.

781
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:06,432
Can't tell if the ones around him

782
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:07,378
are evil or not.

783
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,698
Calm down.

784
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:11,104
Huan Zong, don't worry.

785
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:11,858
Think about it.

786
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:12,858
The Jiao Tong Pavilion

787
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:13,938
has run for years.

788
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,584
If it were a den of evil,

789
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,657
would've been discovered.

790
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:17,577
Besides,

791
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:18,720
a smart and clever girl

792
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,258
like me,

793
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:21,632
will surely

794
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:23,338
charm Jiao Tong

795
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:25,137
and successfully become his disciple.

796
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,577
Just wait for my good news.

797
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,298
You can never be too cautious.

798
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,977
Better safe than sorry.

799
00:35:30,912 --> 00:35:32,017
It'd be safe.

800
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:33,378
Huan Zong, take a seat.

801
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,177
Relax.

802
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:37,298
I'll pour you some tea.

803
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
(Zong)

804
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,688
(Why is this character)

805
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:47,977
(written like this?)

806
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:49,698
(I've seen it somewhere.)

807
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:50,778
(Right.)

808
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,738
(Zong)
(One character in the signature)

809
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,818
(of Master Writer is written like this.)

810
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:55,977
What's wrong?

811
00:35:57,632 --> 00:35:58,624
Huan Zong.

812
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,338
This character 'Zong' is quite special.

813
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:01,858
Is it the 'Zong' from Liuguang Sect?

814
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:03,738
It's the 'Zong' from Huan Zong.

815
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,778
Did you write this yourself?

816
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:09,376
(I don't think)

817
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,418
(Zong)
(there are many people)

818
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:12,224
(who write the character like this.)

819
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:14,208
(He even went to ask about)

820
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,258
(Master Writer's books.)

821
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:16,537
(Is he...?)

822
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:18,497
(The plots)

823
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,137
(from Master Writer's books)

824
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,920
(do seem to relate to)

825
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,338
(what Luanfeng Peak has done.)

826
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,338
By the way, Huan Zong.

827
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:28,258
I need to meet Jiao Tong.

828
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,056
But I can't just

829
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,218
go empty-handed.

830
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Should I

831
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,657
prepare a gift?

832
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,457
What do you want to gift?

833
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:36,378
Think about it.

834
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,338
Music, chess, calligraphy, painting.

835
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:40,097
These four arts are interconnected.

836
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:42,097
Since your handwriting is so beautiful,

837
00:36:42,097 --> 00:36:43,008
Huan Zong,

838
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:44,057
can you write

839
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:45,258
a piece of calligraphy for me?

840
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,617
You'd gift him my piece of calligraphy?

841
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:51,418
Huan Zong.

842
00:36:52,258 --> 00:36:52,898
Have some tea.

843
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:01,617
Take a look.

844
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:09,057
(Miao)

845
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:10,496
(This 'Miao' character)

846
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,418
(is just like the one
written by Master Writer.)

847
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:14,457
(Try some other characters.)

848
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:16,298
Huan Zong.

849
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,888
Just this one piece

850
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:18,898
isn't enough.

851
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:20,738
Why don't you write me some more?

852
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:21,577
More?

853
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:23,537
What to write?

854
00:37:25,218 --> 00:37:27,177
Carrying a qin,
walking around the green sand.

855
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:29,017
Depicting the beautiful clouds
with a brush.

856
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,497
How about this?

857
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,920
(Brush)

858
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:56,657
You are Master Writer.

859
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,360
This character is the same
as the one written by Master Writer.

860
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,457
So as the 'Miao' character.

861
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:02,617
Huan Zong, you are Master Writer,

862
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:03,617
right?

863
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,738
It seems it's getting dark.

864
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,040
The Jiao Tong Pavilion is about to open.

865
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,256
Take these and go to him.

866
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,632
Take that as a gift too.

867
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:15,392
Just gift him whatever you want.

868
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:16,378
Let's go.

869
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:16,992
Huan Zong,

870
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,378
you are Master Writer, right?

871
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:20,338
- Let's go.
- Tell me.

872
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,457
Lin Hu's messenger talisman?

873
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:11,617
(Young Master.)

874
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,177
(I found something suspicious.)

875
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,017
(I work in here.)

876
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,898
(At first, I could only wash dishes.)

877
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:18,496
(Later, a servant)

878
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:19,298
(got stomachache,)

879
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:19,968
(so I...)

880
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:28,497
