=Episode 11=

16
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,570
Welcome to Hehuan Sect.

17
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,969
I toast you all.

18
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,729
I'm so forgetful!

19
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,529
I only heard from Jiao Tong Pavilion

20
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,770
that Lady Kong Hou

21
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,369
is from Yunhua Sect.

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,930
I wonder

23
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,290
which Master

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,169
you study under.

25
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,969
My master is Master Wang Tong.

26
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,250
So you two

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,970
must also be from Yunhua Sect.

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,889
No.

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,850
We met along the way

30
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,209
and travel together for now.

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,329
(Good.)

32
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,209
(Just Yunhua Sect)

33
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,489
(is troublesome enough.)

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,209
I must apologize

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,169
for letting you

36
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,530
suffer such a fright

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,290
in Hehuan Sect.

38
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,370
I've already ordered

39
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,850
Jiao Tong Pavilion closed.

40
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,769
I've never imagined

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,530
that such a scum

42
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,290
was hiding.

43
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,810
It's my failure.

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,570
My apologies again.

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,530
Please, enjoy yourselves.

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,209
I wonder if Yi City's food

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,169
suits

48
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,609
Lady Kong Hou's taste?

49
00:02:50,649 --> 00:02:52,209
It's fine, really.

50
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,130
Kong Hou.

51
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,530
Aren't you afraid

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,370
it's poisoned?

53
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:02,729
No worries.

54
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,250
I'm immune to anything.

55
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,370
It's okay.

56
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,090
Still, be careful.

57
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:09,530
Tonight,

58
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,130
I arranged for dancers

59
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,530
to entertain everyone.

60
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:46,570
Don't worry, my Lord.

61
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,769
That

62
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,610
was Hehuan Sect's hypnosis spell.

63
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,769
They won't wake up

64
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:51,810
for quite some time.

65
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,289
I only want this woman.

66
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,570
As for the two men...

67
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,130
Detain them.

68
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,649
Watch them closely.

69
00:04:58,969 --> 00:04:59,769
Understood.

70
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,250
I couldn't read anything...

71
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,730
Unless...

72
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,889
It's suppressed by some

73
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,130
strong formation.

74
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:10,889
Do you know,

75
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,170
if it weren't for me,

76
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:13,810
you'd already be dead

77
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,529
in Old Wu Bei's hands?

78
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,610
Who's Wu Bei?

79
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,570
Why did he try to kill me?

80
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,209
I only remember

81
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:23,649
the dancers performing.

82
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,930
And then...

83
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,170
Why am I here?

84
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,329
You little heartless thing.

85
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,130
Why ask so many questions?

86
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:33,769
Forget it.

87
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,529
Just remember this.

88
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,490
From now on,

89
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,370
you are

90
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,889
my pretty boy.

91
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,010
If you obey me faithfully,

92
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:47,769
I'll give you anything.

93
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,170
I'm so mediocre.

94
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,930
You really want me, Master Ouyang?

95
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,289
Are you willing?

96
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:55,730
Master Ouyang,

97
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,250
you haven't answered my question.

98
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,969
Even if I'm willing to follow you,

99
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,969
I have to make things clear.

100
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,370
Old Wu Bei

101
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:08,849
is after the girl

102
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,089
traveling with you.

103
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,050
He knew she wanted

104
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,610
apprenticeship from Jiao Tong,

105
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,209
so he enlisted my help.

106
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,849
But

107
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,250
she was such a handful.

108
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,289
Wasting so much of my effort.

109
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,889
Why does he want her?

110
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,690
I don't know.

111
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,170
Maybe

112
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,969
she offended him somehow.

113
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,570
Forget about them.

114
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,730
Let's enjoy our time.

115
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,209
You broke the chains?

116
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,930
Those were blacksteel,

117
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,130
reinforced

118
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,610
with our special talismans.

119
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,570
Who exactly are you?

120
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,289
You're Master Zhong Xi!

121
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,930
Jiao Tong?

122
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,769
It's been ages since we drank together.

123
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,370
Come on.

124
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,490
What's going on?

125
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:19,969
Where are they?

126
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,930
Take a drink

127
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,769
and I'll tell you.

128
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,849
What exactly do you want?

129
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,649
What do I want?

130
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,649
What do I want?

131
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,529
You're never around these days.

132
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:52,769
I haven't drunk for days.

133
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:53,809
Let's have a drink.

134
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,610
Drink less.

135
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,130
Don't worry.

136
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,330
You're

137
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,330
breaking through stages.

138
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,370
Must be tough, right?

139
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,250
To be honest, I've been...

140
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,649
Don't worry.

141
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,569
I'm here.

142
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,929
I'll get you through

143
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,210
Golden Core tribulation

144
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,769
safe and sound.

145
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,130
Stop pulling me! Stop!

146
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,010
Come with me.

147
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,130
With these girls around,

148
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,010
you don't have to fear the tribulation!

149
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,649
Even my cultivation

150
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,569
could reach new heights.

151
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,210
- Young master.
- Young master.

152
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,689
Come over here.

153
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,450
Come here. Young Master.

154
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,889
Young master.

155
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,090
Demons should

156
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,689
walk the demon path.

157
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,929
Nonsense!

158
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,330
That's an evil path!

159
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,409
You hit me?

160
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,010
A few days studying

161
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,049
at Liuguang Sect

162
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,689
really changed you a lot!

163
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,289
But remember.

164
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:57,689
You're a demon!

165
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:00,049
You abandoned your true nature

166
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,970
and tried to live like a human.

167
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,330
Do you really think

168
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,210
they will ever accept you?

169
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,970
You're a demon!

170
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,010
That

171
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,649
will never change!

172
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,850
That's my own choice.

173
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,769
Not your concern.

174
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,010
Fine.

175
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,809
But as your brother,

176
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:19,490
I'll show you what a demon should be!

177
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:26,649
Are you insane?

178
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,529
From now on,

179
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,250
you're on your own.

180
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,490
My path

181
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,330
is different from yours!

182
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,490
To become human,

183
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,210
you're willing

184
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,330
to be a servant!

185
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,210
Is that the path you want?

186
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,850
How could you break

187
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,210
the Stone Shackles?

188
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,649
I warned you before.

189
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,490
Your cultivation path

190
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,010
is crooked.

191
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,929
Turn back now

192
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,929
and I'll spare you.

193
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,250
Look at that disgusted face.

194
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,730
Spending too long with humans,

195
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,210
you learned to be as fake as them.

196
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,169
What's so great about them?

197
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,649
Look at Hehuan Sect's head.

198
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,610
Paragon of righteousness?

199
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,689
Spouting

200
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,809
noble words

201
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,210
yet collaborates with demon cultivators!

202
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,250
I told you.

203
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,569
Not all humans are the same.

204
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:41,809
I know.

205
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,929
You mean that Young Master

206
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,049
and that girl.

207
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,769
What a pity.

208
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,370
They'll both die soon.

209
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,049
And there's

210
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,970
a meddling Lady

211
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,289
locked up in my quarters.

212
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:57,529
What's it again?

213
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,210
Ling Bo.

214
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,929
She's from Zhaohan Sect.

215
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:02,850
What?

216
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,090
You know her?

217
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,409
Not really.

218
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,250
You know her very well.

219
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,809
I said I don't.

220
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,730
Lin Hu.

221
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:15,490
You haven't changed at all.

222
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,169
The more you care,

223
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,169
the more indifferent you pretend to be.

224
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,649
Out with it.

225
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,409
What's your relationship

226
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,370
with Ling Bo?

227
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,490
I've told you.

228
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,130
I don't know her.

229
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:28,049
We're not close.

230
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,169
Understood?

231
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,610
You like her.

232
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:34,569
Nonsense!

233
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,569
Lin Hu.

234
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,049
Think it carefully.

235
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,649
Who is she?

236
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,929
The prized disciple
of Zhaohan Sect's head.

237
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,330
She's

238
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,210
the future heir,

239
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,169
totally exceptional.

240
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:51,970
And you?

241
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,610
Just a foolish fox demon.

242
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,529
I've told you.

243
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,569
Humans and demons walk different paths.

244
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,130
It seems

245
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,569
I can't let her go now.

246
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,450
I'm warning you.

247
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,610
Don't touch her.

248
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,330
Fine.

249
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,289
I agree.

250
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,730
I will

251
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,689
put the past down.

252
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,889
As for that young man,

253
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,490
I'm not interested at all.

254
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,889
I only want you to stay

255
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,569
and return to the demon path.

256
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,370
That's my price.

257
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,409
No way.

258
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,569
In that case,

259
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,569
we're done.

260
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,210
In one hour,

261
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,250
your cultivation will dissipate.

262
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,010
You won't be able to cultivate again.

263
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,889
You keep me alive...

264
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,049
You keep me alive

265
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,130
only to let me wander

266
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,409
this world alone?

267
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,289
Do you know

268
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,169
how cruel that is?

269
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,210
Why not kill me?

270
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:41,850
Take care.

271
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:56,730
Jiao Tong!

272
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,809
Jiao Tong!

273
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,769
Why must you do this?

274
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,090
My fate is controlled

275
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,130
by myself.

276
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,090
I must break the seal.

277
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:58,809
Young Master.

278
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:06,330
It's bad.

279
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,090
Young Master, we're too late.

280
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,210
Stay here and watch her.

281
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,130
(Her spiritual root has awakened.)

282
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,970
(I can't fight her head-on.)

283
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:40,289
Come with me now,

284
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,409
and I promise

285
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,289
Lord will treat you well.

286
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:06,450
Young Master.

287
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,650
Are you okay?

288
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,930
I've contacted the sect

289
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,650
to deal

290
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,849
with those scums.

291
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,210
Go to Yi City first.

292
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,250
Once I'm done here,

293
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,010
I'll come find you.

294
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,170
Take care of yourself.

295
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,329
If there's danger,

296
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,970
send a messenger talisman immediately.

297
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:18,809
Don't worry.

298
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,450
Stay cautious.

299
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,410
Understood.

300
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,490
Why is there an egg here?

301
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:29,970
Huan Zong, that is strange.

302
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:30,569
Could it

303
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:31,970
fall from the tree?

304
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,329
I'll keep it

305
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:34,450
in my pouch for now.

306
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:35,289
This way,

307
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,450
if a hatchling emerges,

308
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,569
I can take care of it.

309
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:39,930
Get in the carriage first.

310
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:41,089
Okay.

311
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,250
Kong Hou.

312
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,289
Kong Hou.

313
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,250
Huan Zong.

314
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,369
Why

315
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,930
do you think that dark cultivator

316
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,849
targeted me?

317
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,609
Dark cultivators capture righteous ones

318
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:06,809
to test forbidden arts.

319
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,410
It's not uncommon.

320
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:10,849
But I feel

321
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:12,730
things are not that simple.

322
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,609
Moreover,

323
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,569
why did I suddenly

324
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,049
get so strong?

325
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,809
You always said

326
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,890
the world is full of strange things.

327
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,529
You have no spiritual root,

328
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:23,769
but you activated

329
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,609
a cultivation bond with me.

330
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,170
That means

331
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,049
some unknown power is inside you.

332
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,490
Perhaps Wu Bei

333
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,210
was after precisely that power.

334
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,329
But for all these years,

335
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,569
I've always been

336
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,450
a talentless weakling in cultivation.

337
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,170
How could I suddenly...

338
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,930
You've wanted

339
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,010
to boost cultivation

340
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,569
and become a heroine.

341
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:48,210
Stronger energy

342
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:48,970
is a good thing.

343
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,970
But it's gone now!

344
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,250
If that dark cultivator

345
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,369
comes again,

346
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,450
I'm done for.

347
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:56,970
Don't worry.

348
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,930
You have me,

349
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,210
Lin Hu,

350
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:01,410
and your Master.

351
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,250
True.

352
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:04,609
You're right.

353
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:05,809
I have you all

354
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,970
by my side.

355
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,410
I'm not afraid.

356
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,410
Where is he?

357
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,690
Jiao Tong! Get out here!

358
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,569
Excuse me.

359
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:48,970
Excuse me.

360
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,329
Watch out.

361
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,129
Jiao Tong!

362
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,769
It's you.

363
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,609
Are you working with Jiao Tong?

364
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,936
What?

365
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:08,849
I'm here to save you.

366
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,849
You let him go.

367
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,769
What? I let him go?

368
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:12,269
I...

369
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,369
Y-You...

370
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:14,569
Lower your sword.

371
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,970
Release them first.

372
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,809
Okay.

373
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:18,309
Go.

374
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:20,450
Thank you, fairy.

375
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,129
Thank you.

376
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,129
Thank you, fairy.

377
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,049
Hurry!

378
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,970
Take this down.

379
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,129
Well.

380
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:30,650
Are you alright?

381
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,210
I'm perfectly good.

382
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,529
What's happening?

383
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,410
So...

384
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,049
That is

385
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,129
what happened.

386
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,170
After Jiao Tong died, I...

387
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,609
What? You killed him?

388
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,210
Why did you kill him?

389
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,609
I wanted to take him back!

390
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:49,930
Do you know

391
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,089
what he wanted

392
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:51,930
with those captured?

393
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,210
I don't know.

394
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,410
He meant to skin them alive

395
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,289
to preserve his handsome face.

396
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,010
That monster

397
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,170
was the top music cultivator

398
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,089
of Lingyou Realm.

399
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:02,809
And he committed such atrocities!

400
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,250
If I brought him back,

401
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,930
it would be a great merit.

402
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:07,809
Yet you killed him!

403
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,730
You meddled here

404
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,010
just to claim merit?

405
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,490
Meddling?

406
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,369
Didn't you see

407
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,769
I just saved those women?

408
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,369
You saved them to get merit.

409
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:18,369
So what?

410
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,930
Isn't

411
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,609
the result the same?

412
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,529
Why are you staring at me?

413
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,809
Nothing. Let's go.

414
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,809
What?

415
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,210
Do you know

416
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,690
where Fengyi is?

417
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,410
Fengyi?

418
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:34,650
My sense

419
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,289
of direction isn't great.

420
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,569
Why are you going to Fengyi?

421
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,250
To

422
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,010
look for my senior Chang De.

423
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,730
(Qingquan Inn)

424
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:50,849
Welcome. How many of you?

425
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:52,369
I want that one.

426
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:54,049
I'll get it for you.

427
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,769
Okay.

428
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,289
You're back.

429
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,210
Lin Hu.

430
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:11,129
What's wrong with you?

431
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,970
Would you like something to eat?

432
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,490
(Huan Zong.)

433
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,450
(Lin Hu seems so distressed.)

434
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:27,170
(Is it because)

435
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,450
(of Jiao Tong?)

436
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:30,849
(After all,)

437
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,490
(they once cultivated together.)

438
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,289
(If Senior Ling Hui went astray)

439
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:36,690
(and I had to end her myself...)

440
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,450
(I'd be heartbroken too.)

441
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,329
(Let's find a way)

442
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,450
(to cheer him up.)

443
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:42,809
(What's the best restaurant)

444
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:43,730
(in Yi City?)

445
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,490
(Let me think it over.)

446
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,650
(I've got it.)

447
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,849
(This)

448
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:50,609
(was given)

449
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,930
(by Elder Qiu Shuang.)

450
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,170
(It's a full guide)

451
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,730
(to the entire Lingyou Realm.)

452
00:22:58,609 --> 00:22:59,730
(Let me check)

453
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,569
(for recommended spots.)

454
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,049
What's she saying?

455
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,490
(Here!)

456
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,690
(Huan Zong, look.)

457
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,569
(Yi City has many scenic spots.)

458
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,129
(It says the Cuiming Mountains)

459
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,369
(have Lingyou Realm's)

460
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,250
(largest long-haired apes)

461
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:20,329
(and the best)

462
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,250
(spiritual fruit orchards.)

463
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:24,089
(Let's take Lin Hu there.)

464
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:25,930
(Agreed.)

465
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,490
(Also,)

466
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,529
(we could take him for foot massage.)

467
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,650
(Good idea.)

468
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:35,529
(And...)

469
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:36,809
(As his friends,)

470
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:38,289
(we should support him)

471
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,250
(when it matters.)

472
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,250
(Sharing both joys and hardships.)

473
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,170
(But I keep feeling)

474
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,369
(something's missing.)

475
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,410
(What's missing?)

476
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,490
(Friendship tattoos.)

477
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,049
(Let's all get matching ones.)

478
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,129
Let's skip the friendship tattoos.

479
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:55,730
Kong Hou.

480
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,170
I really...

481
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,529
I really can't do it.

482
00:23:58,529 --> 00:23:59,490
You don't get it.

483
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,344
Friendship tattoos
are symbols of loyalty.

484
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:02,848
I won't let others tattoo with me!

485
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:03,529
N-No.

486
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:04,369
The thing is...

487
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,129
I...

488
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:05,930
Lin Hu.

489
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,289
How did you enter

490
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,250
my communication barrier with Huan Zong?

491
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,609
I gave him the passcode.

492
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,329
Huan Zong!

493
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,730
I was going to surprise him.

494
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,690
That's not a surprise.

495
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,970
That's a shock.

496
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:23,010
Huan Zong.

497
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,049
Do you want matching tattoos with me?

498
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,049
My Master's

499
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,369
looks impressive.

500
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,170
That sounds good.

501
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,849
Kong Hou.

502
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:30,609
Take Young Master.

503
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,890
He'll love it.

504
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,569
You can do that.

505
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,250
Want one?

506
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:35,829
Get one!

507
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,529
Just eat.

508
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,604
(Yi City Inn)

509
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,089
Are you Lady Kong Hou?

510
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:46,569
Yes, what's wrong?

511
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,970
This package is for you.

512
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:50,410
Who sent it?

513
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:51,289
This is large.

514
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:52,490
Must be

515
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,569
from my sect.

516
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,769
All these

517
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:06,569
are birthday gifts

518
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:07,930
from your sect?

519
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,970
Yeah.

520
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,490
So many things.

521
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,890
Why not put them in your pouch?

522
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,289
That

523
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:14,809
kills the ceremony!

524
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,129
Huan Zong, look.

525
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,329
Is this pretty?

526
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:23,089
Yes.

527
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,809
What about this?

528
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:27,129
Is this pretty?

529
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:27,849
Yes.

530
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,329
And this.

531
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,129
Isn't it unique?

532
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:31,769
Yes.

533
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,289
Perfunctory.

534
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,170
What am I supposed to say?

535
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,769
Ugly. Not special at all.

536
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,170
Senior was right.

537
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,010
Men

538
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,210
really can't talk properly.

539
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,529
Happy birthday, my dear.

540
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,210
All my hidden treasures

541
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,890
are here.

542
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,089
Be sure to stay safe.

543
00:25:53,089 --> 00:25:53,769
Eat less junk,

544
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,170
so you don't get sick.

545
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,089
Ouch. Enough talk. I'm off.

546
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,890
- Don't upset your stomach like me.
- Don't upset your stomach like me.

547
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,170
Huan Zong, you're amazing.

548
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,129
You sound exactly like my master.

549
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:06,809
It's your birthday.

550
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:07,769
I want to...

551
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,490
What do you want to do?

552
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,049
It's your birthday.

553
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,529
I want to give you

554
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:15,970
a gift with Lin Hu.

555
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:18,970
What do you want?

556
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,210
Well...

557
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,410
Why waste the efforts?

558
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:29,849
If you really want sweet cakes,

559
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:31,250
I'll have Lin Hu buy some.

560
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:33,250
How could that be the same?

561
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,289
Back then,

562
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:35,369
on my birthdays,

563
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:36,890
Senior Ling Hui always

564
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,129
made me sweet cakes.

565
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:39,809
Now that I'm out traveling,

566
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:40,890
I'll make one myself.

567
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,129
That's needed for a birthday.

568
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,250
By the way, Huan Zong.

569
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,490
Is it that none of disciples

570
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,250
in Liuguang Sect

571
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,849
know how to cook?

572
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,010
Essentially.

573
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:50,730
If

574
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,529
a girl who doesn't fast

575
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,650
marries

576
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,890
into your sect,

577
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,930
wouldn't she starve?

578
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,010
I don't cook,

579
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,849
but I can hire someone cook for her.

580
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,450
Showing off your wealth, huh?

581
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,049
No.

582
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,609
I won't share

583
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:05,849
my cake with you.

584
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,730
Kong Hou.

585
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:16,129
You've got flour on your face.

586
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,289
Raise your head.

587
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,010
I'll wipe it off.

588
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,650
I'll fix your hair too.

589
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:25,170
So much.

590
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:26,490
Really?

591
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,569
You're so careless.

592
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:28,410
Plenty here too.

593
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:29,769
Done?

594
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,049
Almost... There...

595
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,150
Done.

596
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,809
All clean.

597
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:35,129
Thank you, Huan Zong.

598
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:35,890
My pleasure.

599
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,410
Huan Zong, were you teasing me?

600
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,650
My face!

601
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:45,529
It's cute, isn't it?

602
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,010
Missed!

603
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:48,690
Missed again!

Wait.

What's wrong?

609
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,569
Make a wish first.

610
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,890
Right!

611
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,210
What's this?

612
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:31,210
A wishing flower.

613
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,329
So beautiful!

614
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,769
If I make a wish upon it,

615
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,089
it'll come true.

616
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,289
Thank you, Huan Zong.

617
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,529
(May Master stay healthy.)

618
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:47,210
(May my seniors)

619
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:48,289
(achieve greater stages.)

620
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,690
(May...)

621
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:56,650
You wished for long.

622
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,970
How greedy.

623
00:28:58,289 --> 00:28:59,769
You must have made many wishes.

624
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:01,410
How do you know that?

625
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,730
Everyone's greedy.

626
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,609
I even know what you wished for.

627
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,210
Do you believe?

628
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:06,490
Do you?

629
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:07,369
Then tell me,

630
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:08,450
what did I wish for?

631
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,609
Let me guess.

632
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:10,849
Your first wish

633
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,450
is for your master.

634
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:13,490
You are

635
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,849
closest to him.

636
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:16,609
I bet the first wish was

637
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,010
for his long life and health.

638
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,970
Continue.

639
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,769
The second wish

640
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:24,730
should be for

641
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,210
your fellow disciples.

642
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,849
I presume the second wish is

643
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,730
that your seniors

644
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,609
advance further in their cultivation.

645
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,289
Are my thoughts

646
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,730
that easy to guess?

647
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:39,849
However,

648
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,369
you'll never guess

649
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,930
my third wish.

650
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,450
Truly greedy.

651
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,890
The third wish,

652
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,369
I truly can't fathom.

653
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,289
Tell me what's it.

654
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,410
My third wish

655
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,490
is...

656
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:55,010
I won't tell you.

657
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,730
Huan Zong.

658
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,450
You'll be the first one

659
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,529
to taste the cake I made.

660
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:02,329
I'm fasting.

661
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,010
I know you are.

662
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:07,210
But today's my birthday.

663
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,210
Just one bite.

664
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:10,329
One.

665
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,450
- Take a bite.
- You enjoy it.

666
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:15,210
Fine.

667
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,650
I'll eat.

668
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,930
Eating all of it myself.

669
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,049
Not leaving you a crumb.

670
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:35,175
♪Waiting for time to slow♪

671
00:30:38,688 --> 00:30:43,394

673

Huan Zong, look!

674
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:54,650
How beautiful!

675
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,690
Over there.

676
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,849
So many fireworks.

677
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:01,809
Happy time, huh?

678
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,170
What's moving inside?

679
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,329
In your storage pouch?

680
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:11,529
Right.

681
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:14,970
Oh, no.

682
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:16,010
It can't be

683
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,609
the food I stored

684
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,490
has spoiled and bred worms again!

685
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,129
"Again"?

686
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,730
Don't dwell on such details.

687
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,769
Let me check.

688
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,450
It's the egg I found

689
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,609
at Hehuan Sect.

690
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,690
Why's it growing wood ears?

691
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,490
These aren't wood ears.

692
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,609
Don't you recognize this?

693
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:40,369
It looks so bizarre.

694
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:41,490
I've never seen it.

695
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,809
It's Azure Jade Fungus.

696
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,930
What?

697
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,769
Azure Jade Fungus?

698
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,569
That's incredible!

699
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,170
My third wish

700
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,010
is to quickly

701
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,490
find the spirit herb you need.

702
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,369
It comes true now!

703
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,089
Huan Zong.

704
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,849
Your wishing flower truly works wonders.

705
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,049
Your

706
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,690
last wish

707
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:03,730
is to seek herbs for me?

708
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,369
Huan Zong, take this.

709
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:26,849
Brother!

710
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,250
Brother, what's wrong?

711
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,369
Brother!

712
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,849
What happened, brother?

713
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,170
I found someone

714
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:50,250
with once-in-a-millennium talent!

715
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,650
Did you?

716
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,250
But she has a seal

717
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:56,250
suppressing her energy.

718
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,369
Can't you break it?

719
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,170
The power of that seal is formidable.

720
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:04,890
But it doesn't matter.

721
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,690
There must be a way.

722
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,010
We are so lucky.

723
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:09,970
Don't worry, brother.

724
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,529
Let's find a way

725
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:13,170
to get her.

726
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:14,730
Presenting her to the Lord

727
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,890
would be a big merit!

728
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,049
Young Master, I just don't get it.

729
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,369
How does Kong Hou

730
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:57,329
always get

731
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,289
exactly what she needs

732
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,450
at the perfect moment?

733
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,410
Coincidence.

734
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:01,250
Coincidence?

735
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,450
Her luck is insane.

736
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:03,809
What's wrong with that?

737
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,089
Young Master.

738
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:08,249
What's that?

739
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,209
Someone's undergoing tribulation.

740
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:10,970
Tribulation?

741
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:12,129
Who?

742
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,609
Could it be Kong Hou?

743
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:18,729
She just reached Foundation.

744
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:19,410
She's advancing

745
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,089
so fast!

746
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:21,089
Wait for me!

747
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:24,049
Kong Hou!

748
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,850
Young Master, what's happening?

749
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,649
What's that?

750
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,850
A barrier.

751
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:30,770
It's blocking her advancement.

752
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:33,049
She's in agony.

753
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,930
She can't endure much longer.

754
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,330
I'll shatter the barrier.

755
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,970
Don't.

756
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,168
Without the barrier,
she can't bear the thunder strike!

757
00:34:39,168 --> 00:34:39,890
I'll bear it.

758
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,209
Huan Zong!

759
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,129
Kong Hou.

760
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:13,010
Huan Zong.

761
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,729
You scared me to death.

762
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:17,370
I thought you...

763
00:36:19,649 --> 00:36:20,490
Thank goodness.

764
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,209
What was

765
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,930
that phoenix symbol?

766
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,249
Kong Hou.

767
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:50,729
I knocked.

768
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,410
You didn't answer, so I entered.

769
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:57,089
Still thinking about earlier?

770
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,209
How's Lin Hu?

771
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:01,010
He's fine.

772
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:02,089
Just resting.

773
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:05,569
And you?

774
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,169
I'm fine.

775
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,089
But that phoenix symbol...

776
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:10,290
What was that?

777
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,970
When Lin Hu and I heard noises,

778
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:13,089
we came to find you.

779
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,770
Then we saw

780
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,330
that phoenix symbol

781
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,370
creating a barrier

782
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,930
to stop your advancement.

783
00:37:20,649 --> 00:37:21,649
What?

784
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,810
Then it turned into a phoenix
and attacked me.

785
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,490
But why would it

786
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,850
prevent

787
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,410
my tribulation breakthroughs?

788
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:31,649
I think

789
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,169
it means to suppress

790
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,010
your hidden power from surfacing

791
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,249
in case someone dangerous noticed.

792
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,410
You mean

793
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:41,850
it's actually protecting me?

794
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:43,290
Do you remember

795
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:44,249
when you stood

796
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:45,330
in front of me,

797
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,010
the attack ceased?

798
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:48,410
So,

799
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,609
where did it come from?

800
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,209
I'm not sure either.

801
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:53,049
But I heard

802
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,410
those bearing dragon or phoenix seals

803
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,529
harbor power

804
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,609
way beyond

805
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,089
ordinary cultivators.

806
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,529
Could I

807
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,249
be someone,

808
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:03,089
like in those storybooks,

809
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:03,810
who's born

810
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,490
with a phoenix destiny?

811
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,290
Is that why I could wield

812
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,410
the phoenix-headed konghou?

813
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,729
But in those stories,

814
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,290
people with a phoenix fate

815
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,249
always have tragic backgrounds

816
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,529
and miserable lives.

817
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,410
You could also look at it

818
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,689
from the positive side.

819
00:38:21,689 --> 00:38:22,770
But...

820
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:26,049
Having a phoenix mark

821
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,569
is

822
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,729
super rare!

823
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,450
What does this mean?

824
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,850
It means

825
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,649
I'm the chosen one!

826
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,169
All those legendary heroes

827
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,290
and heroines in the books

828
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,970
suffer through trials

829
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,890
before they can achieve

830
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,810
something great.

831
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:41,609
Therefore,

832
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,609
failing the tribulation this time

833
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:44,450
may be

834
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,209
Heaven testing me!

835
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,330
Huan Zong, why are you laughing?

836
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,689
I'm completely serious.

837
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,169
My Master

838
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,169
once told me

839
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,810
I'd achieve greatness later in life.

840
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,569
In the past,

841
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:01,490
I always thought

842
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,810
he was just comforting me.

843
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,089
But it turns out he was right!

844
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:07,689
Putting it that way,

845
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,410
Master Wang Tong truly has

846
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,129
remarkable foresight.

847
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:12,689
