Huan Zong?

17
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:45,375
Come on, help.

18
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,296
- What happened?
- Hurry.

19
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:47,735
Help me.

20
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:55,696
What were you doing?

21
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:57,375
Look at those.

22
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:58,455
My sect people

23
00:01:58,455 --> 00:01:59,375
gave me those

24
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,576
for self-defense.

25
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:01,975
I see.

26
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,856
But you rushed out without learning

27
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,056
how to use them.

28
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:06,296
Exactly.

29
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,455
What should I do now?

30
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:08,655
It will be a long journey.

31
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:12,816
You have a point.

32
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,495
I'm worried about it for you.

33
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,696
But thankfully, there's a solution.

34
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,096
That's right.

35
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,256
A master like you

36
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,615
knows how to use them, right?

37
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:23,775
Want me to teach you?

38
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:24,655
Yeah, of course.

39
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,495
We're not going the same way.

40
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:28,576
How can I teach you?

41
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,455
Well...

42
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,136
Will you let me tag along?

43
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:34,256
Please? Okay?

44
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:35,576
You want to tag along?

45
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,856
You're in a rush

46
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,096
to find the herbs.

47
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,895
Will I be a burden to you?

48
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,576
Yeah, I need to find the herbs.

49
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:45,096
Let me think.

50
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:48,455
You have to think about it?

51
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,455
Huan Zong, just take me with you.

52
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,376
I swear I won't

53
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:53,495
cause you any trouble.

54
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,136
I thought about it.

55
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,016
I do need your help.

56
00:02:58,976 --> 00:02:59,816
Exactly.

57
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:00,735
You know

58
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:02,256
I'm extremely lucky.

59
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,455
I'll definitely help you

60
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:04,256
find the herbs.

61
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,256
Besides,

62
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:06,976
I'm injured

63
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,816
and need protection.

64
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:09,935
That's right.

65
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:12,096
I may not be as skilled as Lin Hu,

66
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:12,735
but

67
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:13,416
it's better

68
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,536
than nothing.

69
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:16,455
You're right.

70
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:18,136
But would it

71
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:19,376
hinder your trials

72
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:20,416
if you came with us?

73
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,455
Of course not.

74
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:22,455
Didn't I tell you

75
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:23,775
my ultimate goal?

76
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,416
You want to be a heroine
who upholds justice

77
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,856
and vanquishes evil

78
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,775
like in the storybooks,

79
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,495
and eradicate injustice

80
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,816
from every corner of the world.

81
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:36,455
Exactly.

82
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:37,775
Also,

83
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:38,816
I told you

84
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,696
that I want to help

85
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,016
every person in need.

86
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:42,895
Perfect.

87
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,215
Right now, I'm the one

88
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,775
who needs help most.

89
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,895
Exactly.

90
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,816
See?

91
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,296
You won't hinder the trials.

92
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,615
Just bring me along.

93
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,816
We'll help each other.

94
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,615
Alright.

95
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,536
Nice!

96
00:03:58,536 --> 00:03:59,256
Rest assured.

97
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,735
I'll definitely

98
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:01,856
help you collect

99
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,096
all those herbs.

100
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:13,696
How did it go?

101
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:14,536
Senior.

102
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:15,935
Xiao Dong is looking

103
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:17,176
into the puppets.

104
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,616
Don't worry too much.

105
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:22,295
Take a seat.

106
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,295
But I never expected that

107
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,376
Zhong Xi would obtain

108
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:32,056
the Azure Phoenix Feather so soon.

109
00:04:32,696 --> 00:04:33,496
I must visit

110
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,415
the Zhaohan Sect

111
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,975
to show my gratitude.

112
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,895
But should we hide the fact

113
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:40,616
that Zhong Xi is injured?

114
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,775
Keep it a secret for now.

115
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,335
That child

116
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,256
carries the hope

117
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:47,696
of the entire Lingyou Realm.

118
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:48,616
Everyone

119
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,136
is waiting for his ascension

120
00:04:50,215 --> 00:04:52,335
to breach the celestial barrier

121
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:53,655
and pave the way

122
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,936
for all cultivators' ascension.

123
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:57,855
Unfortunately,

124
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,855
he's been fighting the dark cultivators

125
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:01,576
and missed his ascension window.

126
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:03,775
If people find out

127
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,415
that his spiritual core is damaged

128
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:06,655
and he can't ascend,

129
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,215
the cultivators

130
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,855
might lose all motivation.

131
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,215
You are right.

132
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:16,535
Hurry up.

133
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,895
Inform Zhong Xi immediately.

134
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:24,215
Now,

135
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,256
where are we going?

136
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:26,335
We're going to Fengyi

137
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:27,455
for Cloudseeker Twig.

138
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,816
I really don't know

139
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,176
why we should bring

140
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:33,335
this annoying girl.

141
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,016
She just offered a phoenix feather.

142
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,056
She clearly wants you

143
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:38,696
to boost her spiritual energy.

144
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:41,455
Lin Hu, what are you muttering?

145
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,696
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

146
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,095
Don't listen to him.

147
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,136
I'm not coveting

148
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,215
your spiritual energy.

149
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:50,855
I swear.

150
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:53,376
I just think friends should

151
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,136
support each other out here...

152
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:58,975
I wasn't up to something.

153
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:05,895
Oh, come on.

154
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,295
It's alright.

155
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,576
Thankfully,

156
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:11,176
you didn't drag me down.

157
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,016
Huan Zong, you...

158
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:25,295
Thank you.

159
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:31,696
Young Master.

160
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,736
It looks like a nice place.

161
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:34,335
Let's take

162
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:34,936
a break.

163
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:36,936
Rest here.

164
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,136
I'll contact Master.

165
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:39,256
You can do it here.

166
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:40,576
Why would you walk away?

167
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:41,215
There's

168
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,455
something we shouldn't know?

169
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:44,376
Not exactly.

170
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,016
It's just that Master wouldn't

171
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,415
let me go out with Huan Zong.

172
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:48,816
I have to be discreet.

173
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:49,895
Remember.

174
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:50,335
No matter

175
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:51,455
what you hear,

176
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:52,535
don't come close.

177
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,056
If Master detects

178
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,095
your presence,

179
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:55,936
he might rush over

180
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:56,975
to drag me back,

181
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,016
and I won't be able

182
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:58,696
to hang out

183
00:06:58,855 --> 00:06:59,936
with you again.

184
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,136
Got it.

185
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:02,696
Remember. Stay put.

186
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:03,455
Got it.

187
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:06,535
Go ahead.

188
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:14,535
Master.

189
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,496
It's me, Kong Hou,

190
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,415
checking in on you.

191
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:17,736
Problem solved

192
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,056
in Qiu City.

193
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:19,736
Next,

194
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,136
we're heading to Fengyi.

195
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:22,535
Oh right, Master.

196
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,335
I'm carrying many spiritual tools.

197
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,176
Each can ward off

198
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,655
hordes of monsters.

199
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,136
So please don't worry

200
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:28,936
about me.

201
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:29,855
Besides,

202
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:30,616
I'll be

203
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,855
extra careful.

204
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,335
Young Master, I don't get it.

205
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,136
We're in a rush to find the herbs.

206
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:36,895
Why are we bringing her along?

207
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,415
The dark cultivators

208
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:40,535
probably scared her.

209
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:41,415
Why do you care

210
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:42,736
if she's scared?

211
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,335
You're just

212
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:46,496
too compassionate.

213
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,095
You care about her.

214
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,136
But she hides

215
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:49,975
over there to send

216
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,056
a message.

217
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,136
No matter what,

218
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,936
we're from a respected sect.

219
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,655
Why does she look down on us?

220
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:57,415
Master Wang Tong

221
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,295
forbids Kong Hou
from regulating my energy

222
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:00,496
because it might

223
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,176
attract thunder strikes.

224
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:04,535
Now I get it.

225
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:05,376
No wonder

226
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,535
he assumed that

227
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:07,975
I went to find Kong Hou

228
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:09,535
to help regulate your energy.

229
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,975
Didn't you explain it?

230
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:12,895
I...

231
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:15,655
You didn't tell him

232
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,176
that you only wanted to confirm

233
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:19,016
if Kong Hou returned home safely?

234
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,256
I...

235
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:21,895
Come on.

236
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:22,576
You know

237
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,455
back then,

238
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,535
the moment I entered,

239
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:26,136
that old man tried to kick me out.

240
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:27,095
What could I

241
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,016
possibly say?

242
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,616
Right, I heard him saying

243
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:30,256
that

244
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,216
Kong Hou had to regulate energy with you

245
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,016
to play the phoenix-headed konghou.

246
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,336
How could I let her do that?

247
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,935
I was too furious.

248
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:37,775
So I came back

249
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,456
without explaining it.

250
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:42,055
Are you done?

251
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:42,695
Yeah.

252
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,815
Foxes sure talk a lot.

253
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:47,415
Wait, listen.

254
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,736
Another little rabbit.

255
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:00,216
Looks delicious.

256
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:00,856
Brother,

257
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:02,935
save the tender face for me.

258
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,456
Those fingers must be crispy.

259
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,136
Who are you? State your names.

260
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,256
"State your names".

261
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:11,775
Take a look.

262
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,216
Why?

263
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,456
Didn't you hear her?

264
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,016
No matter what happens,

265
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,415
we shouldn't go over there.

266
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,256
If you go there,

267
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:18,976
she might

268
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,535
get angry with you.

269
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,016
If her master sees me,

270
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:23,456
he'll take her back.

271
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:25,575
Wait.

272
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,856
Something's wrong.

273
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:28,295
How dare you

274
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,336
cause trouble in broad daylight?

275
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:37,695
Don't be afraid.

276
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,496
(Zhou Xiao, Yuanji Sect)
I'm Zhou Xiao, the chief disciple

277
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:40,376
of the Yuanji Sect.

278
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,616
I'll protect you.

279
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:44,575
Thank you.

280
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,504
(Jin Ling, Yuanji Sect)

281
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,575
(She's a music cultivator.)

282
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:53,336
Xiao.

283
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:38,895
Why don't you stay and fight?

284
00:10:59,016 --> 00:10:59,815
Young lady,

285
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:01,055
I hope you weren't scared.

286
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:02,976
Thank you for your help.

287
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,895
I'm Kong Hou from Yunhua Sect's

288
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:05,695
Qiyue Peak.

289
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:06,976
Lady Kong Hou

290
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:08,096
from the Yunhua Sect.

291
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:08,935
Nice to meet you.

292
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,016
No need for formalities.

293
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,295
Since we came across

294
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:12,616
those dark cultivators,

295
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,695
we had to act.

296
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:14,815
Fate brought us together.

297
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,136
Why don't you come and stay

298
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:16,895
at Yuanji Sect

299
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:17,856
for a few days?

300
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,655
No, it's okay.

301
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:21,415
Young lady.

302
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:22,496
- My friends and I
- Young lady.

303
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:23,415
have things to do.

304
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:24,415
We have to go.

305
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,535
Right, Huan Zong?

306
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,256
No rush.

307
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,935
Haven't you always wanted

308
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,775
to play the phoenix-headed konghou?

309
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,415
This lady here
is a music cultivator too.

310
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:35,895
How about this?

311
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:37,976
Go seek her guidance.

312
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:38,815
Go on.

313
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,256
My junior sister Jin Ling

314
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,055
is a renowned

315
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,256
music cultivator.

316
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,216
Why don't you

317
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,376
talk to each other?

318
00:11:48,695 --> 00:11:49,496
Jin Ling?

319
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,376
So you're the 11th

320
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,256
musical cultivator

321
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:52,295
in the Lingyou Realm.

322
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,415
That's right.

323
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:57,175
You can't even play

324
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,055
your natal weapon?

325
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:03,055
It's not like that.

326
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,096
I'm just not proficient yet.

327
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:06,496
It'll improve with practice.

328
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:07,175
Since

329
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,415
I'm visiting your sect,

330
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,815
I will seek your guidance.

331
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,136
Come on, let's go.

332
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:12,136
Young lady.

333
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,895
Our sect is this way.

334
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:18,415
This way?

335
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:19,055
After you.

336
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:19,935
Alright.

337
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:22,456
Zhou Xiao.

338
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,256
We're Liuguang Sect disciples.

339
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,136
May we also visit

340
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:31,535
your esteemed sect?

341
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,815
(What if they interfere...)

342
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,175
(But I can't offend)

343
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,736
(the Liuguang Sect.)

344
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,376
Liuguang Sect disciples

345
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,415
are more than welcome.

346
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:42,976
This way.

347
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:44,256
Thank you.

348
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:45,216
Please.

349
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:47,815
Tiring journey, huh?

350
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,016
Not at all.

351
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,136
We have splendid scenery.

352
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:52,016
I will definitely

353
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:52,775
show you around.

354
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,336
Alright.

355
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,535
Jin Ling, what was that?

356
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,575
I missed.

357
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:02,976
Don't you find

358
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:03,815
the dark cultivators

359
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,096
a bit strange?

360
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,736
First the dark cultivators.

361
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:08,256
Then these guys.

362
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,856
Do you think they're related

363
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,136
to the dark cultivators?

364
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:13,535
It is suspicious.

365
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,376
Look.

366
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,655
This flower carries dark energy.

367
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:22,575
Why are there such evil things

368
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:23,895
near the Yuanji Sect?

369
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,720
(Yuanji Sect)

370
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,784
(Master Shuang Qing,
Head of Yuanji Sect)

371
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,632
(Zhang Feng, Son of Master Shuang Qing)

372
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:57,535
Feng.

373
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,856
With your father's intellect,

374
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:01,775
our Yuanji Sect

375
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:04,136
will surely become

376
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,096
one of Lingyou Realm's Ten Great Sects.

377
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:09,856
You...

378
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:11,295
Your father...

379
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,055
I know

380
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:15,655
you're also worried

381
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:16,976
that this plan

382
00:14:16,976 --> 00:14:18,136
might not work.

383
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:19,535
But

384
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,535
that useless Yunhua Sect

385
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,055
maintains its position

386
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,856
among the Ten Great Sects.

387
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:26,895
Besides,

388
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,256
Kong Hou

389
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:29,695
may be a loser

390
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,415
without a spiritual root,

391
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,496
but she's still

392
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,736
Wang Tong's valued disciple.

393
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,175
If we can snatch her

394
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,815
and make her marry Xiao,

395
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,935
the Yunhua Sect would

396
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,256
have to help promote us

397
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:48,016
due to our family ties.

398
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,295
Snatch her.

399
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,535
Snatch everything.

400
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,096
Yeah, snatch her.

401
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,815
Come on, Feng.

402
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,496
Let me explain

403
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,815
the plan in detail.

404
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,055
Step one. Hero rescues damsel.

405
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,976
Hero rescues damsel.

406
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,336
First establish

407
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,216
Zhou Xiao, our chief disciple,

408
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:11,096
as a dashing hero.

409
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:15,216
Step two.

410
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,616
After Kong Hou returns with him,

411
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,376
have all disciples sing praises

412
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:22,136
all day long

413
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,456
to make him look admirable.

414
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,815
Don't scribble on it.

415
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:28,695
Step three is the most crucial.

416
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,136
One decisive blow.

417
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,736
Have Xiao marry Kong Hou.

418
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,616
A devoted wife
follows her husband's lead.

419
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:42,096
She will become one of us.

420
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:46,096
I have it all sorted out.

421
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,775
Alright.

422
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:51,456
Line up to welcome the chief disciple.

423
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,295
I...

424
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,976
I'm too esteemed

425
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:00,775
to line up and greet him

426
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:01,376
in person.

427
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,256
Xiao.

428
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:08,736
Feng.

429
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:10,096
I've told you so many times.

430
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,456
Look where you're going.

431
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,695
What a rock-solid forehead.

432
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:15,976
This way.

433
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:25,376
Senior Zhou Xiao stands tall like a pine

434
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,496
towering above the bushes.

435
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:28,935
Senior Zhou Xiao stands tall like a pine

436
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,055
towering above the bushes.

437
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:32,535
Senior Zhou Xiao stands tall like a pine

438
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:33,655
towering above the bushes.

439
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:34,256
I'm fine.

440
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,336
Senior Zhou Xiao stands tall like a pine

441
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:37,456
towering above the bushes.

442
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,976
Senior Zhou Xiao stands tall like a pine

443
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,096
towering above the bushes.

444
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,456
Senior Zhou Xiao...

445
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,096
This here

446
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,856
is Lady Kong Hou from the Yunhua Sect.

447
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:50,535
We welcome Lady Kong Hou
of the Yunhua Sect.

448
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:53,295
We welcome Lady Kong Hou
of the Yunhua Sect.

449
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:55,136
Your sect people

450
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:56,456
sure love ceremonies.

451
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:57,295
The chief disciple

452
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,655
is our guiding figure.

453
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,055
I'd stand at the gate

454
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:01,655
to greet him every day.

455
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:06,216
When will you have time

456
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:07,335
to spar with us?

457
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:10,256
Jin Ling.

458
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,896
Master told us to do so.

459
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:12,936
Don't hit him.

460
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:24,696
Xiao never lets me down.

461
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,095
Xiao never lets me down.

462
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:41,456
Who is this?

463
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:45,736
Huan Zong.

464
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:46,936
Who is he?

465
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,016
These sect people

466
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:50,216
are really weird.

467
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,496
Who are those

468
00:17:58,496 --> 00:17:59,736
young fellows?

469
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:02,095
One's called Huan Zong,

470
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:03,095
another Lin Hu.

471
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:04,496
Disciples of Liuguang Sect.

472
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:06,416
They're traveling with Kong Hou.

473
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:06,936
(Liuguang Sect)
I couldn't

474
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,095
turn them away

475
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,696
and had to host them here.

476
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,976
This is weird.

477
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,615
Liuguang Sect disciples

478
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:22,815
can visit anytime they want.

479
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,696
Why did they come

480
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,615
now of all times?

481
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,815
This ruins

482
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,456
my entire plan.

483
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:31,456
Will you find an excuse

484
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:32,696
to send them away?

485
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,575
No.

486
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:36,696
No.

487
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,135
When has the Liuguang Sect

488
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:39,055
ever respected us?

489
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:40,456
They're here...

490
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,696
Wait, I'm trying to say...

491
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:44,896
Well...

492
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:46,936
These Liuguang Sect disciples

493
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:48,256
are mere underlings.

494
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,936
For me to visit them

495
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,095
is beneath me.

496
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,615
It'd be a disgrace.

497
00:18:52,775 --> 00:18:53,696
- It'd be...
- Father.

498
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:54,496
Father.

499
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,055
Have some tea.

500
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:57,775
Alright.

501
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,095
Good boy.

502
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:01,095
Xiao.

503
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,496
Let's go play.

504
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:03,855
Alright, in a little bit.

505
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,696
Jin Ling, let's go.

506
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,815
In a while.

507
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:08,736
Alright.

508
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,815
Forget it.

509
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,016
Let them stay for now.

510
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:15,456
Especially that girl

511
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,176
named Kong Hou.

512
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,855
She's a refined and delicate

513
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:20,855
young lady, right?

514
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,615
We can't let her

515
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,775
feel neglected.

516
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,095
Besides,

517
00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:26,615
I am a respected senior.

518
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,176
She'd surely feel

519
00:19:28,176 --> 00:19:29,055
a bit uptight

520
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,216
if I met her

521
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,216
right now.

522
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:34,696
Xiao.

523
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,216
You must work harder

524
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:37,456
and put your heart

525
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:38,375
into it.

526
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:42,656
You've worked hard today.

527
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:43,696
Go back and rest.

528
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:45,535
I'll take my leave.

529
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:46,295
Alright.

530
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,016
Jin Ling.

531
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,736
You stay.

532
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:55,936
Master.

533
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:57,375
You've lost your senses.

534
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,016
What are you talking about?

535
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,815
There might be a bump on my head,

536
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:02,936
but my judgment remains sharp.

537
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,855
Especially that Huan Zong.

538
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,815
He's clearly extraordinary.

539
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,815
He's definitely

540
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,696
a senior disciple of the Liuguang Sect.

541
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:11,535
Jin Ling.

542
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:12,615
Think about it.

543
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,656
If you marry Huan Zong

544
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,535
and Xiao marries Kong Hou,

545
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,095
then our sect

546
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:19,095
could gain control

547
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:20,736
over both the Yunhua

548
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,295
and Liuguang Sects.

549
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,335
I refuse.

550
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,855
This is for your own good.

551
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:39,696
Understood.

552
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,256
Jin Ling.

553
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,976
I've always treated you

554
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,295
as my own daughter.

555
00:20:46,736 --> 00:20:48,375
Would I ever harm you?

556
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:49,976
Besides,

557
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,055
didn't you look

558
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,656
closely at Huan Zong?

559
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:55,375
He's truly handsome.

560
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:58,055
Xiao is also handsome.

561
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,055
Are you serious?

562
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,055
How can he compare to Huan Zong?

563
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,976
Huan Zong's much prettier.

564
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,855
There's nothing here.

565
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:10,815
Do you have any food?

566
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:11,855
Food?

567
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:15,256
What?

568
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:16,535
She's from

569
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,135
one of the Ten Great Sects.

570
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:20,135
A-And she needs to eat?

571
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:23,456
What did those mediocrities

572
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:25,216
of the Yunhua Sect teach her?

573
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:27,855
Master, the problem is that

574
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:28,615
our sect people

575
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,855
are all fasting.

576
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:30,256
Yeah.

577
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:30,936
There's no food.

578
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:31,295
Yeah.

579
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,295
No one cooks.

580
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:33,375
Yeah.

581
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:33,855
She...

582
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,016
Well...

583
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:36,855
You...

584
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,696
Pass on the order.

585
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,535
Tell all our disciples.

586
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:43,976
Whoever knows how to stir-fry,

587
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:45,575
boil, deep-fry, or stew anything

588
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:47,976
should assemble in the kitchen.

589
00:22:48,095 --> 00:22:50,176
I will reward them handsomely.

590
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:51,375
- Assemble.
- Rewards await.

591
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:52,216
Assemble.

592
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:53,295
- Rewards await.
- Rewards await.

593
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:53,936
Assemble...

594
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:56,216
Get going.

595
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,055
Not bad.

596
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,176
Pick

597
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,335
the best dishes

598
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,295
for Lady Kong Hou and tell her

599
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:29,295
that you made those.

600
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,256
Master.

601
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:31,416
I-I feel guilty

602
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:32,736
about taking the credit.

603
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,176
It's a strategy.

604
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,456
As the saying goes,

605
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,575
"To win a woman's heart,

606
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:38,815
you know,

607
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:41,055
you must first win over her stomach."

608
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,416
My strategy

609
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:43,456
will work.

610
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:49,375
To curry favor with Kong Hou,

611
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:50,775
Master Shuang Qing

612
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,855
is trying far too hard.

613
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,575
Such a sect leader

614
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:56,416
would mistake a dark cultivator

615
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,976
for a friendly acquaintance.

616
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,335
He's too dumb to achieve

617
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:00,055
anything.

618
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:01,896
Young Master.

619
00:24:02,295 --> 00:24:03,135
Let's just

620
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,216
check things out

621
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,176
and devise a plan

622
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:06,295
after our sect members

623
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,135
arrive.

624
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,775
Those flowers are weird.

625
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:10,456
Our sect members

626
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,016
might not know what to do.

627
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,055
Lady Kong Hou.

628
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:01,696
(What's going on here?)

629
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,416
(Are these people as showy)

630
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,736
(as Ling Bo?)

631
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,656
(Never mind. Let's eat first.)

632
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,736
Lady Kong Hou, here.

633
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,456
Did you prepare all this?

634
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:16,416
I'm not sure

635
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,496
if you like these.

636
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:34,496
Have some shrimp.

637
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,456
Come on, dig in.

638
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:38,855
I'm starving. Don't mind me.

639
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:39,775
Alright.

640
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:42,256
You're really easy-going.

641
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:43,736
In our sect,

642
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,736
the dining hall

643
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,535
gets crowded during mealtimes.

644
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,176
You must hurry

645
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:47,976
to get food.

646
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:49,256
I've trained for this.

647
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:51,815
Lady Kong Hou,

648
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:54,216
I heard your sect has the best scenery

649
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:55,456
in the Lingyou Realm.

650
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:57,815
I'd like to visit sometime.

651
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:58,615
Would you

652
00:25:58,615 --> 00:26:00,016
be willing to

653
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,216
guide me then?

654
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:02,936
No problem.

655
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,295
I'll have my senior disciples

656
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,256
show you around.

657
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:06,615
Alright.

658
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,256
Right, Young Master?

659
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,656
That's what I think too.

660
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,496
They're having fun

661
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:15,575
at this hour at night.

662
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:17,216
So many candles.

663
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,535
How romantic.

664
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:19,575
Young Master.

665
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:20,855
Do you think

666
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:22,736
Zhou Xiao might fancy

667
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:24,216
Lady Kong Hou?

668
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:26,535
In my opinion,

669
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:27,656
the Yuanji Sect

670
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:29,496
isn't one of the Ten Great Sects,

671
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,936
but Zhou Xiao's cultivation

672
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,295
matches well

673
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,055
with Kong Hou's.

674
00:26:35,535 --> 00:26:36,615
What do you think?

675
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:38,375
Got everything?

676
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:39,496
Get on it.

677
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:42,335
Alright.

678
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,496
Huan Zong.

679
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,335
You're still up at this hour?

680
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:58,135
Are you hungry too?

681
00:26:58,135 --> 00:26:59,095
Want some food?

682
00:26:59,135 --> 00:27:01,095
The scallion oil noodles are amazing.

683
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,095
Oh right, you're fasting.

684
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,615
What a pity.

685
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:13,456
Huan Zong,

686
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,976
why don't you go back to rest?

687
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:15,775
I'll send you

688
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,055
some spiritual fruits.

689
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:19,375
If I remember correctly,

690
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,775
you're also fasting.

691
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:25,095
Our Yuanji Sect

692
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:26,055
isn't as strict as

693
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:26,855
the Liuguang Sect.

694
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:27,976
We have food

695
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,016
every now and then.

696
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:32,216
It's okay.

697
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,775
Enjoying the moon with you both

698
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,375
is quite pleasant.

699
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,055
In that case,

700
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:39,496
let's talk together.

701
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:45,055
Alright.

702
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:04,216
Zhou.

703
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,216
Strangely enough,

704
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,335
there are dark cultivators

705
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,295
near your Yuanji Sect.

706
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,135
Those dark cultivators are too bold.

707
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,815
I heard

708
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:21,496
they caused trouble in Qiu City too.

709
00:28:21,736 --> 00:28:22,896
I didn't know

710
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:24,256
they'd come to Sanshu City.

711
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:28,976
Unfortunately,

712
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:31,176
they frightened

713
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,055
Lady Kong Hou.

714
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:33,896
It's alright.

715
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:34,696
Didn't you

716
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,696
step forward in time

717
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:36,896
to protect me?

718
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:37,496
Besides,

719
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:38,815
I only met Lady Jin Ling

720
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,456
and had a chance to learn from her

721
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:41,815
because of the incident.

722
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:42,896
You're right.

723
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:44,375
That may be true.

724
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,656
But when did you seek her guidance?

725
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:48,615
I...

726
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:50,176
Well...

727
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,135
I was going to see her,

728
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,775
but I was starving

729
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,295
and didn't have a chance.

730
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:56,256
I'll go now.

731
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,135
It's too late.

732
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:06,976
Yeah.

733
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:08,775
It's already nighttime.

734
00:29:08,976 --> 00:29:10,535
You confused me.

735
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:11,815
I'll go first thing tomorrow.

736
00:29:16,016 --> 00:29:16,896
That's fine.

737
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:29,496
Want some more?

738
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,335
Go on.

739
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,976
Tiger descending the mountain.

740
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,016
Young Master,

741
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:26,416
I scouted around the perimeter

742
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:27,896
and found nothing unusual.

743
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:28,855
But a courtyard

744
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:29,775
on the back

745
00:30:29,775 --> 00:30:30,976
has tight security.

746
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,176
Find a way to get in.

747
00:30:33,775 --> 00:30:34,496
Understood.

748
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:42,375
According to the plan,

749
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:43,416
Xiao will spend

750
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,176
the day with Kong Hou,

751
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:49,696
while Ling stays by Huan Zong's side.

752
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:51,696
Your father

753
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:52,936
is a genius.

754
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:54,575
Genius.

755
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:55,775
Genius.

756
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,815
Genius.

757
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:01,216
I was planning

758
00:31:01,216 --> 00:31:02,295
to show you

759
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:03,855
and everyone

760
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:05,256
the scenery of our sect

761
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,335
on flying mounts.

762
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:07,375
However...

763
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,016
Seniors.

764
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:08,775
It's fine.

765
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:09,936
Strolling around like this

766
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:10,775
is nice too.

767
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:11,456
Really?

768
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:12,095
Very well.

769
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,016
Later,

770
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,216
I'll show you

771
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:15,375
our Eight Trigrams Formation.

772
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,176
And our mines are

773
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,456
longer than Qingfeng Sect's.

774
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,575
Hot springs, Bishui Pavilion.

775
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,055
Our hot springs

776
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:22,055
are exceptional.

777
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:22,696
Over there.

778
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:23,775
Hot springs.

779
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:24,976
I bet you can cook

780
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,095
lots of eggs at once.

781
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:29,896
Hot spring boiled eggs
are a signature dish

782
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,496
of our sect.

783
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:32,456
Next time,

784
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:33,855
when you visit Yunhua Sect,

785
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:34,456
let's try

786
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:35,696
our signature beef noodles.

787
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:36,496
That's Yong City's

788
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,216
specialty dish.

789
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:38,216
Alright.

790
00:31:46,936 --> 00:31:47,896
Deal.

791
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,055
Deal.

792
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,216
Come here.

793
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,575
You're visiting the hot spring?

794
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:00,375
Yeah.

795
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,256
Do you know

796
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:02,615
it takes two people to...?

797
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:03,416
Huan Zong,

798
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,456
if you're not interested,

799
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:06,855
Jin Ling can show you

800
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:08,256
the Eight Trigrams Formation.

801
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:09,016
Jin Ling.

802
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,176
No need.

803
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:11,656
I like the hot springs.

804
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:12,815
Let's go.

805
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:13,976
Huan Zong,

806
00:32:14,135 --> 00:32:15,016
don't force yourself.

807
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:15,896
I didn't.

808
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:17,496
Then let's go together.

809
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:18,936
Together.

810
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,976
What's that flower?

811
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,176
So pretty.

812
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,416
Xiao.

813
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,176
Be careful...

814
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,216
of the thorns.

815
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:56,736
Huan Zong.

816
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,855
I still feel bad about it.

817
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,016
After all, you got hurt

818
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:01,016
trying to protect me.

819
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,016
I just asked

820
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:03,295
the physicians.

821
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:04,095
They said

822
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,656
you could scratch around

823
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:06,335
the wounds

824
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,295
as long as

825
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:08,496
you don't break them.

826
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:10,295
Got it.

827
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:13,855
If you can't reach them,

828
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:14,896
I can help you.

829
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:15,936
No need.

830
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,016
Go to sleep.

831
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,775
How could I sleep now?

832
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:20,055
After all, you got hurt

833
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:21,416
protecting me.

834
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:23,095
It's fine.

835
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:26,256
Don't be shy.

836
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,815
Let me help you.

837
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,535
I'm quite good at this.

838
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:30,896
When my junior disciples

839
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:31,696
had rashes,

840
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:32,815
I helped them.

841
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,256
It feels great.

842
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:35,615
Try it and you'll see.

843
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:36,375
Go back.

844
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:41,696
Have fun with Zhou Xiao.

845
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,615
Won't you boil some eggs together?

846
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,896
We can do that anytime.

847
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:47,656
We agreed to do it

848
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:48,615
tomorrow.

849
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:51,016
Tomorrow?

850
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:52,016
Yeah.

851
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,775
Don't drive me away.

852
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:55,095
Let me scratch your back.

853
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:55,855
Get out.

854
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:08,336
Feel better?

855
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:09,336
Well?

856
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:11,296
Come on, stay put.

857
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:13,496
This is medical treatment.

858
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,615
Why are you scared?

859
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,336
This is ice.

860
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:18,336
It helps reduce swelling.

861
00:34:18,376 --> 00:34:19,615
Don't tell me

862
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,496
you're still shy at this moment?

863
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,735
Besides,

864
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:27,055
didn't you say that

865
00:34:27,255 --> 00:34:29,255
genders come next to

866
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,135
saving lives?

867
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,496
In such situations,

868
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,376
it's acceptable.

869
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:38,376
But you shouldn't normally do that.

870
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,175
What's wrong with that?

871
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:41,215
For example,

872
00:34:41,336 --> 00:34:42,575
we can be close to each other

873
00:34:42,695 --> 00:34:44,055
because we're friends.

874
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:45,615
But Zhou Xiao is not your friend.

875
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:46,655
Senior Zhou Xiao

876
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:47,655
is also my friend.

877
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:48,535
When did you

878
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:49,735
become friends?

879
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:51,016
We should take care

880
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:52,135
of each other.

881
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,976
We're all friends.

882
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:56,735
Then what am I?

883
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,535
We're friends too.

884
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:01,456
I'm also your friend?

885
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,376
But let me tell you a secret.

886
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:12,175
You are

887
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:13,816
different from Senior Zhou Xiao.

888
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:16,055
You're very, very important

889
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:17,175
to me as a friend.

890
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:22,416
"Very, very important."

891
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:23,575
How important exactly?

892
00:35:24,376 --> 00:35:25,496
If I have to rank you

893
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:26,695
by your significance,

894
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:27,535
Senior Zhou Xiao

895
00:35:27,535 --> 00:35:28,695
would be around tenth place,

896
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,456
while you're second.

897
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,496
So who's first?

898
00:35:35,055 --> 00:35:35,695
First place?

899
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:38,095
Senior Ling Hui, of course.

900
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:38,776
Although she's

901
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:40,016
Master Pei Huai's disciple,

902
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:40,856
we grew up

903
00:35:40,856 --> 00:35:42,055
together.

904
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:44,215
And she showed me
how to make spirit stones.

905
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:52,936
Second place is acceptable.

906
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,255
Huan Zong,

907
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,936
you care about rankings?

908
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,296
What a child.

909
00:35:58,376 --> 00:35:59,135
So adorable.

910
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:00,496
Feeling better?

911
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,695
No.

912
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:08,016
You're clueless.

913
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,695
Liuguang Sect disciples

914
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:10,575
came visiting.

915
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:13,655
If we rushed to meet them

916
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,255
right away,

917
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:15,976
we would

918
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:17,255
lose our status.

919
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,135
But

920
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:22,055
he's injured now.

921
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:23,376
As the sect leader,

922
00:36:23,376 --> 00:36:24,416
I'm going to

923
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:25,416
check on him.

924
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,936
It shows the manners of a major sect.

925
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,296
Huan Zong needs to rest now.

926
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:31,575
He can't interfere with

927
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:33,376
your interactions with Kong Hou.

928
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:34,376
I think

929
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:37,135
he got injured at the perfect time.

930
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:38,215
Feeling better?

931
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:39,776
Yeah.

932
00:36:40,376 --> 00:36:41,175
Yeah.

933
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:43,135
Say something.

934
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,575
How am I supposed to know

935
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:45,655
if the pressure is fine?

936
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:49,695
Master, they...

937
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:57,255
Xiao.

938
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:59,016
What do you think

939
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:00,135
about what happened?

940
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:01,296
Master,

941
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:02,735
I dare not think about

942
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,055
what happened.

943
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,416
You dare not think about it?

944
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:08,376
Useless.

945
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:09,535
Ouch.

946
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:11,776
Why can't you appeal to her?

947
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,135
That Liuguang Sect disciple

948
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:14,575
managed to charm

949
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,456
this lady.

950
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:16,016
There is

951
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,135
something between them.

952
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:18,416
Let's just give up.

953
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:19,215
Yeah.

954
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:21,255
Give up?

955
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:22,695
You blockhead.

956
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,735
We're not giving up.

957
00:37:23,735 --> 00:37:24,896
How can we quit now?

958
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:27,735
Listen carefully.

959
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:30,095
Let me analyze this for you.

960
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,255
Who saved Kong Hou?

961
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:34,896
Huan Zong did.

962
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,856
Yeah, Huan Zong saved Kong Hou

963
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,896
and got injured in the process.

964
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:41,016
Naturally, she will care for him.

965
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:43,175
Such an interaction

966
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,336
creates something.

967
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:47,776
Now I get it.

968
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,215
No, you don't.

969
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:50,296
What did you get?

970
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:51,215
I didn't get it.

971
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,255
Listen.

972
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,535
I believe

973
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:55,816
that Kong Hou

974
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:57,816
is into someone

975
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:00,215
who makes her feel secure

976
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:02,255
yet also reveals

977
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,336
his vulnerable

978
00:38:04,936 --> 00:38:06,016
side.

979
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:10,055
Master.

980
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:12,135
Didn't you

981
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:14,175
marry your ex-wife about

982
00:38:14,255 --> 00:38:15,175
two centuries ago?

983
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:16,416
Two and a half centuries.

984
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:18,095
That would have been

985
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,456
a long time ago

986
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:20,055
for mortals.

987
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:21,215
Generations ago.

988
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:24,296
Are you sure your methods still work?

989
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:29,896
Think about it.

990
00:38:30,336 --> 00:38:32,535
You saved Kong Hou once.

991
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:34,215
She's going to feel

992
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:36,296
secure around you.

993
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:37,255
Now...

994
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,055
You need to get injured.

995
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:46,175
Master.

996
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:47,695
It hurts.

997
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:52,095
Is this a martial contest?

998
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,816
- Master.
- Master.

999
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,776
Sorry I'm late.

1000
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:10,296
This must be

1001
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,095
the renowned

1002
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,816
Lady Kong Hou of the Yunhua Sect?

1003
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,496
You must be Master Shuang Qing?

1004
00:39:14,776 --> 00:39:15,575
That's me.

1005
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:18,055
I pay respects to Master Shuang Qing.

1006
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:21,095
Good girl. So polite.

1007
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:23,535
Our Yuanji Sect

1008
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,175
holds annual martial contests.

1009
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,976
Perfect timing for you

1010
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:28,416
to observe.

1011
00:39:28,655 --> 00:39:29,615
Alright.

1012
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,175
Make yourself at home

1013
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:32,936
at Yuanji Sect.

1014
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,416
Prepare for the contest.

1015
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:42,095
- Alright.
- Go for it.

1016
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,416
You got this.

1017
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:44,215
Go for it.

1018
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,055
Go!

1019
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:45,655
Go for it!

1020
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:48,456
