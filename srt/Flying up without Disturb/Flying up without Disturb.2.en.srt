16
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,168
With your meager skills,

17
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:42,047
do you want to die

18
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,047
without ash remaining?

19
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:44,527
I am far more

20
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:45,767
than what I was.

21
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:47,288
Just... Just you wait.

22
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,127
Boost spiritual energy
with heart's blood?

23
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,928
Have you abandoned
all regard for your life?

24
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,887
If I can kill you,

25
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,008
what does risking my life matter?

26
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,128
How are you?

27
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,448
Where is the Liuguang Sect?

28
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,448
Why aren't

29
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:43,927
their people here yet?

30
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,008
Master, don't panic.

31
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,288
Our sect leader sent Wu Chuan

32
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:47,087
to summon them.

33
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:48,728
If they're summoned, where are they?

34
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,607
This is an urgent crisis.

35
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,487
Must they bathe, change clothes,

36
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:54,087
and burn incense before coming?

37
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:55,807
That old fool Song He

38
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:56,767
is utterly unreliable.

39
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:57,848
If he doesn't come soon...

40
00:02:57,848 --> 00:02:58,448
Tan Feng.

41
00:02:58,528 --> 00:02:59,927
If they don't arrive,

42
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:01,647
we two will find a way to storm in.

43
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:03,487
Master,

44
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,688
didn't we just try and fail

45
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:06,128
before turning to Liuguang Sect?

46
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:06,688
Right.

47
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:10,288
Kong Hou is trapped inside.

48
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:13,448
Can't you think of another solution?

49
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,487
Tan Feng, better keep quiet.

50
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:16,968
No matter how angry you are,

51
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,128
don't vent on him.

52
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,168
Should I vent

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,087
on you instead?

54
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:20,968
Stop.

55
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,248
Calm down.

56
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,807
Just stay calm, Master Wang Tong.

57
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,568
I heard there's a secluded

58
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,128
cultivation spot ahead

59
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,128
full of spiritual energy.

60
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:32,288
Our sect

61
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,848
has specifically prepared it

62
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:35,728
for high-level disciples'
cultivation needs.

63
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,087
Hold on.

64
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,128
We're almost there.

65
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,647
Maybe wait here

66
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:40,487
for a moment?

67
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,047
Come on.

68
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:42,688
Be careful.

69
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,248
Come on.

70
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:17,968
Watch your step.

71
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,208
Slowly.

72
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,127
Hold on.

73
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,968
Almost there.

74
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:28,367
Come on.

75
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,007
This is the place. Hang in there.

76
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:39,927
You will be fine.

77
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,247
I'll get Master to help you.

78
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:41,927
Wait for me.

79
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,247
There's no time.

80
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:48,768
You do it.

81
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:49,807
Me?

82
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,367
I can't.

83
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,888
(He's severely injured.)

84
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,367
(He can't go on like this.)

85
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,247
Whenever I touch him,

86
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:18,968
I can absorb
surrounding spiritual energy.

87
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,728
Maybe I can save him

88
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:22,968
by healing him.

89
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,408
(This is to save you.)

90
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:45,968
Miss?

91
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:46,968
Miss?

92
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,007
Are you okay? Cone on.

93
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:52,687
I'm fine.

94
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:53,927
It seems energy regulation

95
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,127
is truly exhausting work.

96
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,687
I actually fell asleep.

97
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:01,088
Your complexion looks healthy,

98
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,208
your energy is robust,

99
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,088
and your wound has healed.

100
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,447
Miss, thank you.

101
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:13,888
Don't mention it.

102
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:14,728
Hadn't you helped

103
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:15,927
absorb so much spiritual...

104
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,088
Never mind.

105
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:21,888
I mean,

106
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,247
your wound did heal completely.

107
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,168
This place

108
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,247
is our Yunhua Sect's

109
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,528
treasured cultivation site.

110
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,208
It's truly extraordinary.

111
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:30,247
If you're alright,

112
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,328
let's leave now.

113
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:31,968
Okay.

114
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:46,528
What are you doing?

115
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,648
I'm so awesome now.

116
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,247
What's so awesome about that?

117
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,447
(If he can help me)

118
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,567
(get more spiritual energy,)

119
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:53,728
(maybe I'll qualify)

120
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,888
(to choose a spiritual tool.)

121
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,247
By the way,

122
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,687
at the very least,

123
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,168
I did save your life.

124
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:01,888
And all I get is a 'thank you'?

125
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:04,168
I never leave debts unpaid.

126
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,247
What do you want?

127
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:07,927
You'd give me

128
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:09,007
whatever I want?

129
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:09,728
Name it.

130
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:14,768
What are you doing now?

131
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,047
Didn't you say you'd give me

132
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,247
whatever I want?

133
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,007
I just want to hold your hand.

134
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:20,888
Come with me.

135
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,968
Let go.

136
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:24,528
Low in spiritual energy,

137
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,487
mighty in strength?

138
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,768
What exactly do you want?

139
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:27,728
Let's go.

140
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,288
Haven't I already explained?

141
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:29,968
I'm scared.

142
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,607
Holding onto you makes me feel safer.

143
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:32,327
Stop.

144
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,047
Let me go.

145
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:35,648
I...

146
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,488
Fine.

147
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:40,047
I won't touch you.

148
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:41,807
In that case,

149
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:45,488
does your earlier promise still stand?

150
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,248
As long as it's not this absurd,

151
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,368
I'll agree to anything.

152
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,168
That works too.

153
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:53,128
However,

154
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:55,488
I'll need to save my request for later.

155
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:56,768
Because I haven't decided yet

156
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,128
what exactly to ask from you.

157
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:00,288
Storybooks say

158
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,087
that your Luanfeng Peak's ranks

159
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,408
contain little gold cultivators,
silver cultivators,

160
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,368
and bronze cultivators.

161
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,648
You seem quite skilled.

162
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,727
What's your rank?

163
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,608
Are you a little silver cultivator?

164
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:11,847
Let me make this clear.

165
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:12,927
We don't have

166
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,087
the ranks you mentioned.

167
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:15,648
Nor do we have

168
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,888
gold, silver, or bronze cultivators.

169
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,327
They're 'little gold,' 'little silver,'

170
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,807
and 'little bronze' cultivators.

171
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,408
So those were all lies?

172
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:28,567
Still, those titles

173
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,967
do sound rather imposing.

174
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:31,847
Consider using them.

175
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:32,888
It's never too late.

176
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:33,608
No need.

177
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:36,288
We're here.

178
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,567
Finally.

179
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,888
This barrier is a formation.

180
00:09:46,927 --> 00:09:47,488
I...

181
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:49,927
I'm injured.

182
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:50,847
I can't channel energy.

183
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,528
But I can't do this.

184
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:54,207
Follow my instructions.

185
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:57,528
Fine.

186
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,584
- Now chant the incantation
- Nature, one with all.

187
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,168
- and channel all your spiritual energy.
- In the void, truths unfold.

188
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,687
Eight directions' divine might

189
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,128
guides me to harmony.

190
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:05,567
The Primordial King's decree

191
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,687
is heard by the Nine Heavens.

192
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:15,927
Focus.

193
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,727
Let your spiritual energy
follow the incantation

194
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:20,368
to flow through all your meridians.

195
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:39,904
Master Wang Tong. Tan Feng.

196
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:40,928
Look. The barrier's open.

197
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,248
Master, it's open.

198
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:44,447
Since it's open,

199
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:45,528
why aren't we rushing in?

200
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,168
Okay.

201
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:47,807
You know what?

202
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:48,648
Our Yunhua Sect

203
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,888
has endless treats and marvels

204
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,168
you've never experienced.

205
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,528
Since you're here,

206
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,567
why not stay

207
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,687
for a few more days

208
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,047
before returning to Liuguang Sect?

209
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:56,528
Deal?

210
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:57,288
No need.

211
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,488
Don't be polite with me.

212
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:02,967
Just stay at Yunhua Sect

213
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:03,888
for a few more days

214
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,687
and tell all my fellow disciples

215
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,087
of my deeds of courage

216
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,168
and unshaken resolve

217
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,047
in crisis.

218
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,807
If it comes from your mouth,

219
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:12,648
they'll definitely believe every word.

220
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,567
You can stop here.

221
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:16,408
Won't you stay for tea?

222
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,847
No need. Thank you.

223
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,768
Will we meet again?

224
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,408
Danger always follows me.

225
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:26,888
We shouldn't meet again.

226
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:29,760
But you must rest sometime.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
Let's meet during your rest periods.

228
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,872
Problem solved.

229
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:33,327
I never rest.

230
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:37,047
You're terrible at conversation.

231
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,648
What's your name?

232
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,888
Kong Hou. My name is Kong Hou.

233
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:49,567
Noted.

234
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:52,687
Goodbye.

235
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:54,447
We must meet again.

236
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:55,967
Kong Hou?

237
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,488
- Kong Hou?
- Kong Hou?

238
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,447
- Kong Hou?
- Kong Hou?

239
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:01,567
Kong Hou?

240
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,047
Kong Hou? Kong Hou?

241
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,047
Kong Hou?

242
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,128
- Kong Hou?
- Kong Hou?

243
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:10,888
Master.

244
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,248
Tan Feng. Ling Hui.

245
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,168
Kong Hou.

246
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,567
Excellent.

247
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:19,967
All limbs intact.

248
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,248
Not a single part missing.

249
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,327
Truly uninjured anywhere?

250
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:24,967
Master,

251
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,087
I'm fine.

252
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,768
Good that you're safe.

253
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,408
You reckless girl!

254
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,207
Trying to scare me to death?

255
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,128
Did you want to die?

256
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,128
Why meddle in unnecessary business

257
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,008
and come to the Forbidden Forest?

258
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,528
Master, I was wrong.

259
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,207
I came for serious reasons.

260
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,488
Apologizing isn't enough.

261
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:43,207
All these years,

262
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:45,168
you've caused me so much trouble.

263
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,567
Today I'll properly

264
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,408
punish you.

265
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:48,847
I'll punish you

266
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,727
to copy all the cultivation techniques

267
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:51,768
from the past three months

268
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:53,727
ten thousand... No, one thousand...

269
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:54,888
One hundred times!

270
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:56,807
Master,

271
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,168
three months' worth of techniques

272
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,288
is a massive stack.

273
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,648
Copying them a hundred times?

274
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,368
I'll die from exhaustion.

275
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:05,727
Exactly, Master Wang Tong.

276
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,648
How's that even possible?

277
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,648
What are you two doing?

278
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:11,368
Back then,

279
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,567
when I got punished,

280
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,488
I never complained.

281
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,047
You didn't complain

282
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,128
because you'd run away immediately.

283
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,648
Now that Kong Hou's in trouble,

284
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,207
you're not helping her.

285
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:21,967
Instead, you're

286
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,087
- making it worse.
- Master.

287
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:24,847
No, Master. Stop.

288
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:25,608
Stop there.

289
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:26,967
Punish her, not me.

290
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:27,727
Master. Master.

291
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,168
Do you favor girls over boys?

292
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,128
Master.

293
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,408
Kong Hou,

294
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,927
how did the Forbidden Forest visit

295
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
give you spiritual energy?

296
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,128
Well,

297
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,648
it's probably because the forest

298
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,047
is rich with spiritual energy.

299
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,008
That can't be.

300
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,528
I've been there many times too,

301
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,768
but never experienced

302
00:13:58,768 --> 00:13:59,927
such a power surge.

303
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,488
Well...

304
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:03,408
I know.

305
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,128
It's because

306
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,727
your foundation was unusually weak.

307
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,727
- Hence rapid improvement.
- Tan Feng.

308
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:10,648
(Yunhua Sect)
Ling Hui, look at him.

309
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,087
You're in good spirits today.

310
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,087
Of course.

311
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,288
With spiritual energy,

312
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,207
I'm finally qualified

313
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,488
to attend classes with you all.

314
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,927
I want to dress up nicely.

315
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,807
Let's enjoy ourselves a bit, right?

316
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,128
Alright.

317
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,168
No more talking.

318
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,768
Class is starting.

319
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,888
Last time,

320
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,168
we discussed

321
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,768
communicating with beasts.

322
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:37,408
Some beasts
are inherently wild-tempered.

323
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,128
Not only are they time-consuming
to communicate with,

324
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:41,967
but they also frequently

325
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:46,368
fly into rages and attack violently.

326
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:47,528
Moreover,

327
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,847
their destructive power is staggering.

328
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:53,008
Kong Hou.

329
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:54,727
Kong Hou.

330
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,128
Kong Hou.

331
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:57,567
Kong Hou.

332
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,847
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou.

333
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:00,768
Kong Hou.

334
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,368
Kong Hou.

335
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:07,327
Outrageous.

336
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:08,687
We're still in class.

337
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:10,528
If you want to sleep,
go back to your room.

338
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,047
She's entered meditation.

339
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,648
- What?
- It seems

340
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:19,288
she's about to advance
to a higher stage.

341
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,368
Master.

342
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:22,488
What's with the sky?

343
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,687
Looks like someone's advancing
to a higher stage.

344
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:25,727
Let's go take a look.

345
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,567
Stay calm, everyone.

346
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,687
Hold steady.

347
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,807
What's going on?

348
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,087
Whose Heavenly Tribulation?

349
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,488
Kong Hou?

350
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:34,408
Kong Hou

351
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:35,888
is merely at the Initiation stage.

352
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:37,648
How could she face Heavenly Tribulation?

353
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,408
It seems her tribulation thunder

354
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,847
will have multiple strikes.

355
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,488
Pei Huai, you, I,

356
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,248
and Tan Feng

357
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:45,087
will help her withstand it.

358
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,008
I'll take the first strike.

359
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:17,847
There really is a second one.

360
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:29,807
Master, don't worry.

361
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,008
Leave the rest to me.

362
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:45,967
Kong Hou.

363
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:53,288
Master.

364
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,327
Kong Hou.

365
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,528
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou.

366
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,687
Kong Hou.

367
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:13,328
This divine rain

368
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,048
means she's survived the tribulation.

369
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:16,687
Tribulation?

370
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:17,727
Kong Hou,

371
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:18,687
your advancement

372
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:19,848
was anything but smooth.

373
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,088
Good that you're safe.

374
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,608
That matters the most.

375
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,848
Look at you.

376
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,487
How did you block a thunder strike

377
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:26,967
without a single scratch?

378
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:27,967
Exactly.

379
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,007
You call this
'without a single scratch'?

380
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,168
Well, Kong Hou,

381
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,608
your spiritual energy is lacking,

382
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:35,168
but your exceptional luck
makes up for it.

383
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:36,287
Of course.

384
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:38,687
She's my disciple after all.

385
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:40,888
My junior sister.

386
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:44,320
(Liuguang Sect)

387
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,128
Lin Hu, why are you dashing around?

388
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:49,927
You darn fox.

389
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,007
Now I need to sweep again.

390
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:53,328
Senior Lin.

391
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,128
Is Young Master inside?

392
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:56,727
He is.

393
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:12,128
(Annals of the Sect,
The Twenty-Four Histories)

394
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,888
Young Master,

395
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,447
Jiusu's lackeys

396
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,328
have all been taken.

397
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:20,648
My men are questioning them.

398
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,048
However,

399
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,608
no useful information
has been extracted yet.

400
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:25,848
Be patient.

401
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,207
Keep them imprisoned first.

402
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,808
Some will crack under pressure.

403
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,247
Understood.

404
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:31,368
By the way,

405
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,608
during my absence from the peak,

406
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:35,848
are there any changes?

407
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:37,287
All was peaceful.

408
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:38,888
Though everyone heard

409
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:40,368
you were pursuing Jiusu alone

410
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:41,848
and were concerned.

411
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,888
Jiusu was truly cunning,

412
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,007
but you managed to eliminate him.

413
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,848
Young Master? Young Master?

414
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,712
(Jin Yue, Head of the Liuguang Sect)

415
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,487
Young Master, are you all right?

416
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,207
I'm fine.

417
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,168
Master, how is he?

418
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:15,808
The evil poison has been purged.

419
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,487
But his spiritual core is damaged,

420
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:18,568
and it's irreversible.

421
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,440
The situation is extremely unfavorable.

422
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,687
His spiritual core is damaged?

423
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:23,888
What should we do now?

424
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,687
Master, you must find a solution.

425
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:26,752
Our sect has

426
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:27,568
many precious herbs.

427
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:28,687
There must be a way.

428
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,207
Master, please think of something.

429
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:31,328
Lin Hu.

430
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:33,648
Zhong Xi,

431
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,967
the problem is indeed more serious

432
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,088
than I anticipated.

433
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,608
I know.

434
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:41,247
Rest assured.

435
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,608
I will

436
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:43,927
certainly find a way

437
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:45,088
to help you.

438
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,408
Senior Jin.

439
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:00,808
How is it?

440
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,328
The damaged spiritual core

441
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:03,568
is indeed difficult to repair.

442
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,727
The elders and I
have deliberated at length,

443
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:06,727
but we couldn't find

444
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:07,727
any feasible solution.

445
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:14,447
The medicinal hall
still preserves some elixirs

446
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,888
given by Master Huang Qi years ago.

447
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:16,527
To save...

448
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,247
No.

449
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,287
He represents the hope of ascension

450
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,848
not just for our sect,

451
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:22,927
but for the entire realm.

452
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,328
I won't just save his life.

453
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:27,927
I'll restore his spiritual core

454
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:30,687
and preserve
his cultivation base intact.

455
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:33,207
Kong Hou.

456
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,168
Tell me,

457
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,408
how many stages does cultivation have?

458
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,048
Well, cultivation

459
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:45,007
has seven stages.

460
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,784
Foundation, Golden Core, Nascent Soul,

461
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:48,168
Soul Projection, Spirit Division,

462
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,888
Void Unity, and Great Perfection.

463
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:51,527
Good.

464
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,007
Now tell me this.

465
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,088
How many heavenly strikes descend

466
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,767
during a smooth transition

467
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,568
from Initiation to Foundation?

468
00:20:58,927 --> 00:20:59,848
One strike.

469
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,447
Then why did you receive three strikes?

470
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:02,648
Unstable temperament

471
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,168
invited three strikes upon you.

472
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:05,408
Three strikes could mean

473
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:06,927
damaged cultivation at best

474
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,888
or demonic possession
and death at worst.

475
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,408
Do you understand the danger?

476
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,727
But I...

477
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,608
I genuinely didn't know.

478
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,687
Your current level

479
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,727
barely qualifies
as the Initiation stage.

480
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:19,967
Others might not see it,

481
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,287
but do you think I wouldn't know?

482
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:22,328
How could you possibly

483
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:23,767
jump from the Initiation stage

484
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:24,927
to the Foundation stage

485
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,487
at such a rapid speed?

486
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:30,007
I...

487
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:31,927
I...

488
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,727
Tell me. What exactly happened

489
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,687
in the Forbidden Forest?

490
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,648
Well...

491
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,568
Do you remember
that cultivator from Luanfeng Peak

492
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,568
I met in Yong City earlier?

493
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,328
For some unknown reason,

494
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,247
whenever my hands

495
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:51,527
touched him,

496
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,608
the spiritual energy

497
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,848
would flood into my body.

498
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,447
What? What are you babbling about?

499
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,247
It's true.

500
00:21:58,247 --> 00:21:59,007
Otherwise,

501
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:01,447
why would I suddenly advance?

502
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,128
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

503
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,368
Master.

504
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,568
I didn't think it was important.

505
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:11,287
It was just a tiny absorption.

506
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,608
Who knew it would trigger

507
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:15,447
a realm advancement tribulation?

508
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,447
Master, stop pacing.

509
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:35,207
I think

510
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:36,608
it's neither the Forbidden Forest's

511
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,487
nor this jade bed's problem.

512
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:39,848
My fellow disciples and I

513
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:41,088
have tried on Qiyue Peak's

514
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:42,048
jade bed.

515
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,368
Nothing happened.

516
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,727
Kong Hou, what are you doing?

517
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,727
Even Master couldn't make it work.

518
00:22:58,727 --> 00:22:59,848
It seems like

519
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:02,128
only that cultivator from Luanfeng Peak

520
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:03,408
can make it work.

521
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:05,527
What exactly is going on?

522
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:06,767
You don't know

523
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:07,687
the reason either?

524
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,128
The vast Lingyou Realm

525
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:10,888
naturally holds endless wonders.

526
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:14,007
Forget it, Master.

527
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,727
Let's stop dwelling on this.

528
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,568
Anyway, I've advanced
to a higher stage now.

529
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:18,767
Isn't that good?

530
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,207
You seem quite pleased about it.

531
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,168
This matter

532
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,408
requires absolute caution.

533
00:23:23,408 --> 00:23:24,408
Today,

534
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:25,287
we helped you block

535
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,568
those three thunder strikes.

536
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,128
But would you

537
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,967
still be this lucky in the future?

538
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,767
What would you do then?

539
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:34,888
By the way,

540
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:36,727
about that guy from Luanfeng Peak,

541
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:37,927
what's his name?

542
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:39,368
I forgot to ask.

543
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:40,088
You...

544
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:40,808
I...

545
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,408
what kind

546
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:44,888
of unorthodox cultivation

547
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:46,408
is he practicing?

548
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:47,767
I've actually

549
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,687
never witnessed anything so odd.

550
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:52,368
Master,

551
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,408
what's going on with Kong Hou?

552
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:55,888
A couple of days ago,

553
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:57,247
how did she suddenly advance?

554
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,447
I know exactly

555
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:00,568
what that girl's capable of.

556
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:02,007
By all reasoning,

557
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,568
she shouldn't

558
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,608
have reached Foundation.

559
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,168
In recent days,

560
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,927
have you noticed
anything unusual about her?

561
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,608
Not at all.

562
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,048
Is she secretly practicing

563
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:13,328
some forbidden art behind us?

564
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:14,888
In the Lingyou Realm,

565
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:16,888
aside from my Longgu Pills,

566
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,727
what other method exists

567
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:20,328
that can catapult

568
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:22,527
one's cultivation overnight?

569
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,408
Master,

570
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:26,767
she must have found something

571
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:27,808
in the Forbidden Forest.

572
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:29,648
As you just mentioned,

573
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:31,007
only consuming Longgu Pills

574
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:32,168
could achieve that.

575
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,888
If she hadn't meddled,

576
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:36,848
we wouldn't have lost the business

577
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,048
with the Nascent Soul Elder.

578
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,207
Now she even used my Longgu Pills

579
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,247
for her spiritual energy surge.

580
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:44,048
A worthless wretch

581
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,648
gets to reap all the benefits.

582
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:47,927
Just wait.

583
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,527
I will definitely

584
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:51,848
not let her off easily.

585
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:54,767
These are

586
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,447
Five-Flavor Manor's pastries.

587
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,408
I went through a lot

588
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,608
to have someone acquire them.

589
00:24:58,608 --> 00:24:59,408
Try some quickly.

590
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:03,048
Kong Hou.

591
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:04,727
- Kong Hou, I'm here.
- Ling Hui.

592
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:05,767
Sit.

593
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:06,848
Hui,

594
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:08,287
why do you come here every day?

595
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:10,624
How could I miss out on good food?

596
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:11,287
- Right?
- Yes.

597
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,527
- Kong Hou.
- Give me some.

598
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:13,927
Kong Hou.

599
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,447
Glad you're here, Kong Hou.

600
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:18,727
What's wrong?

601
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:20,888
My master

602
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,088
lost a beetle.

603
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,328
One he painstakingly brought

604
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:24,447
from the Northern Wastes.

605
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,328
A truly rare specimen.

606
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,368
Our whole sect has searched

607
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:29,128
everywhere for it.

608
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,527
You were away the past days.

609
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:31,527
So we didn't disturb you.

610
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:32,967
Now that you're back,

611
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:33,888
we figured

612
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:35,328
we'd pay a special visit.

613
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:38,927
Let them search.

614
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,048
Otherwise

615
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,527
they'd claim you stole it.

616
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:42,848
Fine.

617
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,608
Senior Yun Chong, do as you please.

618
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,128
Check every corner carefully.

619
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,328
You'll pay for any damages.

620
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:57,648
Senior Yun.

621
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:02,687
Well...

622
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,168
Qing,

623
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:08,767
at high noon,

624
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,128
you summoned everyone here.

625
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:10,967
What's this about?

626
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,848
It's ruined my nap.

627
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,168
Today,

628
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:21,168
I've invited our sect leader

629
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:22,687
and all elders here

630
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,328
to discuss a matter

631
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:26,487
concerning the discipline

632
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:28,168
of Yunhua Sect.

633
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,888
Some time ago,

634
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,967
my residence lost a Golden Cicada.

635
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:33,287
(Qiu Shuang, Yunhua Sect Elder)
I mobilized people

636
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:34,767
to search throughout the sect.

637
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:36,447
Yet it remained missing.

638
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:37,888
But today,

639
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,727
within Kong Hou's chamber,

640
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,687
we found these.

641
00:26:57,128 --> 00:26:58,687
Longgu Pills?

642
00:26:58,888 --> 00:26:59,767
Exactly.

643
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:01,328
They are Longgu Pills.

644
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,527
While these pills temporarily

645
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:04,687
boost cultivation,

646
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,408
users with weak resolve

647
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,447
risk qi deviation

648
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:10,967
or fatal implosion.

649
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:11,967
Thus,

650
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,247
the Lingyou Realm banned them

651
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:16,207
over a century ago.

652
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,128
Kong Hou,

653
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,368
why would your vanity case

654
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:23,608
contain such pills?

655
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,088
Qing Yuan, you scheming cur.

656
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:27,568
How dare you

657
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:29,568
slander my disciple?

658
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:30,568
Impossible.

659
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:31,848
These aren't mine.

660
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:32,727
Exactly.

661
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,128
We were just in Kong Hou's room.

662
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:35,527
There was nothing there.

663
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:36,648
The evidence is irrefutable.

664
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:37,848
Cease your denials.

665
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,048
Kong Hou, answer me.

666
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:42,687
Did you reach

667
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,848
the Foundation stage recently?

668
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:47,168
Yes.

669
00:27:47,408 --> 00:27:49,128
You lack spiritual roots.

670
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:50,447
After a decade here,

671
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,408
your cultivation lags

672
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:53,927
behind three-year novices.

673
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:56,408
How then this sudden advancement?

674
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,408
Because...

675
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:00,967
Because what?

676
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,007
I've learned

677
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:04,447
that on your tribulation day,

678
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:05,888
three thunder strikes fell.

679
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:07,368
With proper cultivation

680
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:08,568
and steady resolve,

681
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,368
why would that happen?

682
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:15,487
Senior,

683
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:18,368
I know my disciple's character.

684
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:19,568
She'd never

685
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,128
take forbidden pills.

686
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,408
Senior Wang Tong,

687
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,408
you've indulged Kong Hou

688
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,128
beyond reason.

689
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,767
We've all witnessed it.

690
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,287
Now your leniency

691
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,527
lets her flout all rules.

692
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,967
Defending her now

693
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,088
shames our sect's justice.

694
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:39,888
I...

695
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:41,608
Senior,

696
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,727
I demand severe punishment

697
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,328
and her expulsion from the sect.

698
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:46,568
Qing.

699
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:53,808
Longgu Pills

700
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,368
have been strictly banned

701
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:57,007
in Lingyou Realm.

702
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,232
They vanished from markets

703
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:00,487
for decades.

704
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:02,128
Kong Hou only frequents

705
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:04,007
Yong City's mundane circles.

706
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,048
How could she obtain these?

707
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,007
Well, there's more.

708
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:09,287
Recently,

709
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:10,888
Yuxiao Sect faced scandal

710
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:12,247
over similar pills.

711
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:13,848
My sources say

712
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:15,808
their steward was a youth.

713
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:16,848
Her potential is poor.

714
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:18,648
Yet she has reached
the Nascent Soul stage.

715
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:21,247
I have spent years studying
the principles of elixir craft.

716
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:23,287
I knew something
was suspicious about it.

717
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:25,128
So I sent people to investigate.

718
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:26,128
As expected,

719
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:27,687
that Nascent Soul cultivator consumed

720
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:28,687
some forbidden elixirs.

721
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,168
Specifically, Longgu Pills.

722
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,368
Moreover, from what I've learned,

723
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:33,888
she illicitly refined

724
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:34,808
such pills herself.

725
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,568
In the Yuxiao Sect's name,

726
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:39,368
she'd been conducting
illegal sales in secret.

727
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:41,168
Are you suggesting

728
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:43,888
Kong Hou obtained these pills

729
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:45,048
from the Yuxiao Sect?

730
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,447
That doesn't make sense.

731
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,368
I remember

732
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:50,368
for the case of the Yuxiao Sect,

733
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:52,408
Kong Hou actually contributed.

734
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,727
Then I suppose

735
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:55,927
she feared exposure.

736
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,447
She is the thief crying 'stop thief.'

737
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,608
Master Qing Yuan,

738
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:05,368
who's really the thief here?

739
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:06,368
Speak.

740
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:07,687
Where did the pills come from?

741
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:10,048
In your Yunhua Sect's

742
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:11,888
so-called Forbidden Forest,

743
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:15,128
I bought them from Qing Yuan.

744
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:17,168
Your mere claim alone

745
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:18,727
isn't convincing enough.

746
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,088
I knew all along

747
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:21,247
you wouldn't easily

748
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:21,888
admit to it.

749
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,704
(Account Book)

750
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:26,447
I found this

751
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,328
in the Forbidden Forest.

752
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,848
Inside are letters documenting

753
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:32,808
your communications and transactions

754
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:35,168
with that Nascent Soul Elder.

755
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:35,967
Furthermore,

756
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:37,007
they're verified

757
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:38,328
by Liuguang Sect's Luanfeng Peak.

758
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:40,648
The evidence is conclusive
and irrefutable.

759
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:42,527
Master Qing Yuan,

760
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,088
would you like to see for yourself?

761
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,007
Qing Yuan,

762
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,687
how dare you!

763
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,568
Qing Yuan, you scheming cur.

764
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,368
How dare you frame my disciple?

765
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:13,168
And you dare sell forbidden pills?

766
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:22,368
Kong Hou,

767
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,848
you've accomplished a great deed.

768
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,168
What reward would you like?

769
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:26,648
I've already ordered

770
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:28,328
to post commendation notices outside

771
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,487
for your merit.

772
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,168
Senior,

773
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,328
Kong Hou achieved such great merit.

774
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:36,368
The commendation notices

775
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:37,888
are full of empty praises

776
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,368
and intangible rewards.

777
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:40,927
Give her something substantial.

778
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,088
How would I understand
a young girl's preferences?

779
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:43,808
Kong Hou,

780
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:44,767
what would you like?

781
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:46,648
You can tell me directly.

782
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:48,408
Kong Hou,

783
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,128
boldly ask him

784
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,504
- for Fairy Dress or spiritual tools.
- Yes.

785
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:55,568
He'll surely grant your wishes.

786
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:56,408
Better yet, ask for

787
00:31:56,408 --> 00:31:57,608
spirit stones or jade coins.

788
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:00,967
Master,

789
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:02,927
I want none of those.

790
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,168
Then what do you want?

791
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,247
Sect Leader,

792
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:08,247
Master,

793
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,447
I wish to venture out
and gain experience.

794
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:14,967
Gain experience?

795
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:16,568
What did you just say?

796
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:17,568
Gain experience.

797
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,527
Gain experience?

798
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,007
You haven't yet had

799
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:20,808
a natal weapon.

800
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:21,888
Forget about that idea.

801
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:22,848
It's nonsense.

802
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:26,007
I've advanced my cultivation level now.

803
00:32:26,168 --> 00:32:28,048
Most senior disciples
who descend the mountain

804
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:30,527
are only at the Foundation stage too.

805
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,487
No. The outside is too dangerous.

806
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:33,767
You're forbidden to go.

807
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:34,687
In that case,

808
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,247
I will make the decision.

809
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:42,128
I permit you to descend the mountain.

810
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,848
Thank you, Sect Leader.

811
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:46,168
Senior, you... You all...

812
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,207
You...

813
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,767
You look great.

814
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,328
How about this?

815
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,767
- Greetings, Elder Qiu Shuang.
- Greetings, Elder Qiu Shuang.

816
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:07,608
Alright, Kong Hou.

817
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:08,888
Later you'll go choose

818
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,207
your natal spiritual tool.

819
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,527
This is your reward

820
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:12,408
for solving

821
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,487
the Longgu Pill case.

822
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,088
Do you know

823
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,368
the rules disciples must follow

824
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,287
when obtaining natal spiritual tools?

825
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,568
All Yunhua disciples

826
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,568
must uphold righteousness and integrity

827
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:26,088
and protect our sect and people.

828
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,447
Should one betray the sect,

829
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:29,447
they'll die without a grave.

830
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:30,048
Good.

831
00:33:30,888 --> 00:33:32,168
You must

832
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:33,888
remember these words forever.

833
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:35,687
I vow to remember them.

834
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:37,487
After entering the Treasure Hall,

835
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:38,848
selecting a spiritual tool

836
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:40,447
is a ritual of mutual recognition.

837
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:42,168
Everything depends on fate.

838
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:43,287
Nothing can be forced.

839
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,207
Once you've made the choice,

840
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,527
there's no turning back.

841
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:49,527
The spiritual tool you choose
becomes your other half

842
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,648
and your most loyal companion.

843
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:52,848
Remember,

844
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,328
only when perfectly matched

845
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:55,527
is it truly the best.

846
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,648
I understand.

847
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:07,104
(Treasure Hall)

848
00:34:45,088 --> 00:34:47,648
Seems it's not for me.

849
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:10,687
Why did it run away?

850
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,008
With so many spiritual tools here,

851
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:17,687
one must be destined for me.

852
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,568
(I need to sense carefully
with my heart.)

853
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,088
A phoenix-headed konghou?

854
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:24,088
Are you my destined spiritual tool?

855
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,968
My name comes from this instrument,

856
00:36:27,608 --> 00:36:28,887
and my spiritual tool

857
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:31,807
happens to be
a phoenix-headed konghou too.

858
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,128
My name is Kong Hou,

859
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:35,727
and you're also a konghou.

860
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:37,168
I think

861
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:38,367
this must be the bond

862
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,327
between us.

863
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,687
I've reached the Foundation stage.

864
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,568
Why can't I play it?

865
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,048
Making it bigger probably will do.

866
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:04,727
No way.

867
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:17,168
Why still can't I play

868
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,568
the phoenix-headed konghou?

869
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:19,608
How can I

870
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:21,727
go down the mountain to gain experience?

871
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:23,207
You just reached Foundation.

872
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:23,968
You can't control

873
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,448
a phoenix-headed konghou.

874
00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:26,608
Besides,

875
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:28,128
you were useless before.

876
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:29,168
You just made Foundation.

877
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:30,727
It's normal that you can't play it.

878
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:31,807
Useless?

879
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,128
Ling Hui, look at him.

880
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,128
He called me useless.

881
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,207
Tan Feng,

882
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:37,367
you're over a century old.

883
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,207
How can you still be so tactless?

884
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:40,287
Exactly.

885
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,367
Stay if you can't venture out.

886
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:42,928
Right?

887
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,807
Staying in the sect isn't bad.

888
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:47,287
Gaining experience is still necessary,

889
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,528
but there's no rush.

890
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:50,807
Right, Kong Hou.

891
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,448
No hurry at all.

892
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:53,327
No.

893
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,207
I must go down the mountain

894
00:37:56,488 --> 00:37:58,207
to gain experience.

895
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:01,024
(Tian Yuan)

896
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:06,568
Young Master,

897
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:07,727
you should rest.

898
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:08,648
You're not fully well.

899
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:09,928
Maybe stop reading these days?

900
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,608
Young Master, you...

901
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:29,928
Young Master,

902
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:31,807
didn't you take medicine today?

903
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,048
Why take more now?

904
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:33,968
Isn't the medicine

905
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:34,887
working anymore?

906
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,807
I'll fetch Master.

907
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:37,767
He'll know what to do.

908
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,327
Don't bother him.

909
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,128
But...

910
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,327
It'll pass soon.

911
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,048
It's strange.

912
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,367
Luanfeng Peak brims
with spiritual energy.

913
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:50,327
Why do I feel worse

914
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,727
after energy regulation?

915
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,648
