=Episode 22=

16
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,842
I ran out of water.

17
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,083
Can I have some water here?

18
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:46,002
Why don't you ask your neighbor?

19
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:46,922
It's much closer.

20
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:09,482
What do you want again?

21
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,003
Could I borrow your lamp?

22
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:11,762
Mine went out.

23
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:12,482
Or I can sit

24
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:13,123
for a while.

25
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,283
It's daytime.

26
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:15,403
Who needs lamps now?

27
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:27,082
Lady Ling Bo.

28
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,202
You startled me.

29
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,163
What do you want again?

30
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,682
My room smells terrible.

31
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:32,642
Yours smells so nice.

32
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:33,682
What incense do you use?

33
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:34,642
My room smells nice

34
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:35,762
because of me.

35
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:36,522
Your room stinks

36
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:37,642
because you stink.

37
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,082
Will you leave?

38
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:47,003
Lady Ling Bo.

39
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:49,843
Lady Ling Bo.

40
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:55,802
I don't know

41
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,163
if my legs are hurting

42
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,603
whenever I walk

43
00:02:58,603 --> 00:02:59,802
because I've lost my tail.

44
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,403
Shall I massage them for you?

45
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,283
Isn't it improper?

46
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,723
In your dreams.

47
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,082
Why did you mention your tail?

48
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:06,843
It infuriates me.

49
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:07,443
Ouch!

50
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:08,242
I'm warning you.

51
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,482
Stay away from my room.

52
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:10,283
Or I'll

53
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,163
personally pluck out

54
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:12,283
your newly grown fox tail.

55
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,003
Come on.

56
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,723
Fine, I won't go in.

57
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:17,482
You're so heartless.

58
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,403
Did you make a wish?

59
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,003
I wished for...

60
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:54,283
Don't say it out loud.

61
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,043
Or it won't come true.

62
00:03:58,082 --> 00:03:58,582
Alright.

63
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,202
I'll give you a gift, then.

64
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:03,682
What is it?

65
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,642
It contains your spiritual energy?

66
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:15,202
Yeah.

67
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,002
I remember

68
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,242
that Tan Feng once gave me a bracelet,

69
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,203
claiming it was yours.

70
00:04:22,203 --> 00:04:23,922
I treasured it for so long.

71
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,523
Now, not only does this bracelet

72
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:26,362
belong to me,

73
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:29,643
but Master Zhong Xi is mine too.

74
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:37,523
Yeah.

75
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,403
(Master Zhong Xi)

76
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:41,362
(will be entirely yours)

77
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:44,882
(and yours alone.)

78
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:57,922
I promise

79
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,322
this will be the most magnificent

80
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,763
bridal headpiece in Lingyou Realm.

81
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,242
Elder Qiu Shuang.

82
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:05,562
It's indeed

83
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:06,723
magnificent,

84
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,203
but all this glittering gold

85
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:08,843
is too...

86
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,802
Elder, please spare me.

87
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:13,083
I can't wear this.

88
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:15,083
It's too much.

89
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:18,242
Should I make it plainer?

90
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,203
That'd be better.

91
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:21,122
Kong Hou.

92
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:22,643
Wait.

93
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:24,322
Zhong Xi, I'm here.

94
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,882
The groom can't see the bride

95
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,643
before the bonding ceremony.

96
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:32,482
It's a tradition.

97
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,763
Greetings, Elder Qiu Shuang.

98
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:34,562
Is Kong Hou...

99
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:35,922
Kong Hou is perfectly fine.

100
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,643
I promise your dear Kong Hou

101
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:38,882
will be the prettiest bride

102
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,083
in the Lingyou Realm.

103
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:42,682
Hurry up and leave.

104
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,603
Thank you.

105
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:44,682
I take my leave.

106
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:46,843
Let's try again.

107
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,122
Elder Qiu Shuang.

108
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:00,523
This one is too plain, right?

109
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:03,242
Let's try again.

110
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,403
Again.

111
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,283
Again.

112
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:23,122
You startled me.

113
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,403
Y-You startled me!

114
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:25,283
Enough.

115
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:25,963
I've been

116
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:26,643
looking for you.

117
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:27,682
I... You...

118
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,163
Y-You are looking for me?

119
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,242
D-Didn't you tell me

120
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:32,723
to stay away from you

121
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,163
forever?

122
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:35,442
Do me a favor.

123
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:36,763
What's wrong?

124
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,882
It sounds serious.

125
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,023
Let's go.

126
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:40,643
Wait, what is it?

127
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:42,882
So,

128
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,242
this is the "serious" matter?

129
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:46,682
Get it away.

130
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:47,643
Alright.

131
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,442
Go away.

132
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,283
Come on, it was cute.

133
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:53,043
It's gone.

134
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:55,163
If there's nothing else,

135
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:56,603
I'll take my leave.

136
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:57,482
Wait.

137
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:00,802
Check around to make sure

138
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:01,802
there's none left.

139
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:05,882
Who would've thought

140
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,043
that the fearless

141
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:07,802
Lady Ling Bo

142
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,362
is scared of a tiny insect?

143
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,682
Don't laugh at me.

144
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:12,603
Alright.

145
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:13,603
I'll look around

146
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,362
so that you can

147
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:16,562
have a nice sleep.

148
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:24,523
Nothing here.

149
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:32,122
Found anything?

150
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,203
Clear here.

151
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:38,723
Check the bed.

152
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,362
On the bed?

153
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,643
Nothing, right?

154
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:51,523
Nothing here.

155
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,482
Good to know.

156
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:54,843
I can rest easy tonight.

157
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:56,843
What's wrong?

158
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:58,242
What?

159
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,843
You're so annoying.

160
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,482
Look around again.

161
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,802
Don't move.

162
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:04,603
- Where is it?
- Stay still.

163
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,562
There is one here.

164
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,723
I-I think they're all gone now.

165
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,002
If you see another one,

166
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:31,763
maybe

167
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,243
you can call me again.

168
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,562
I'll leave now.

169
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,322
Thanks.

170
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:50,883
Alright, Kong Hou.

171
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:51,922
Go back and rest.

172
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:52,922
I've lived here

173
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,403
for over a thousand years.

174
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,602
I could find my way back blindfolded.

175
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:58,962
Tomorrow,

176
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,322
you'll become a bride.

177
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:01,643
Get some rest.

178
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:02,523
Thank you

179
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,202
for everything, Elder Qiu Shuang.

180
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,523
Kong Hou.

181
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,283
Didn't you leave?

182
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,842
Why did you come back?

183
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,322
Or you never left?

184
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:22,442
I wanted to see you.

185
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,763
We just met this morning.

186
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,163
I want to see you properly.

187
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,322
Elder Qiu Shuang did my trial makeup

188
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,962
and made my cheeks red.

189
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:36,883
I'm not pretty.

190
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:38,602
You are.

191
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,682
The storybooks say

192
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,322
that men's sweet words

193
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,842
can't be trusted.

194
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,562
One day,

195
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,643
you may get tired of me.

196
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,922
That day will never come.

197
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,082
Really?

198
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:55,922
Yeah.

199
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,003
But what if

200
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,483
you get tired of me one day?

201
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:01,922
No way.

202
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,883
I'll never get tired of you.

203
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:06,403
Pinky swear.

204
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:08,562
Pinky swear.

205
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:09,922
We vow to never

206
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,523
grow weary of each other.

207
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:12,842
We shall remain

208
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:13,962
as we are now.

209
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,123
The Zhaohan Sect leader
failed the tribulation

210
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,562
and might not make it.

211
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:38,682
Xiao Dong.

212
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:39,842
What did you say?

213
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,363
What about the Zhaohan Sect leader?

214
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:43,562
Who knows?

215
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:44,802
Everyone is saying

216
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:46,483
that the head of the Zhaohan Sect

217
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,322
failed the tribulation

218
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:50,123
and might not even survive.

219
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:51,842
When did this happen?

220
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,763
Why haven't I heard about it?

221
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,562
Their sect members are discussing

222
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:56,202
the succession

223
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:57,763
of the new sect leader.

224
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,363
Wouldn't that be Lady Ling Bo?

225
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,163
Says who?

226
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,722
She lacks the cultivation

227
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,322
to assume the position of sect leader.

228
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,682
But isn't the successor

229
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,883
usually the chief disciple?

230
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,283
Then it should be Chang De.

231
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,403
Not just "should",

232
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,322
it's certain.

233
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:13,962
I heard that

234
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:14,802
Chang De is already

235
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:15,883
preparing to take over.

236
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:18,523
(If Ling Bo can't inherit the position,)

237
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,202
(what's the point of me)

238
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,163
(pursuing her?)

239
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:24,802
Back then,

240
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,283
when her master was still recovering,

241
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:30,082
I chose to cut ties with her.

242
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,202
She probably won't talk to me again.

243
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:36,883
Xiao Dong.

244
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:42,403
I'm quite bothered. Let's talk.

245
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,403
I love hearing

246
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:45,883
other people's troubles.

247
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:47,163
Tell me everything.

248
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,322
Look how thrilled you are.

249
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,003
Well...

250
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:51,722
I'll tell you,

251
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,243
but you mustn't tell a soul.

252
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:54,363
Don't worry.

253
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,043
My lips

254
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,043
are sealed tight.

255
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:58,643
Here's the thing.

256
00:11:59,403 --> 00:12:01,003
I recently encountered

257
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,763
a lady I once admired.

258
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:06,883
A lady you once admired?

259
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,602
You've fallen for someone?

260
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:13,562
We drifted apart for some reason.

261
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:17,043
So you're saying

262
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:17,922
that you've

263
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:18,562
rediscovered

264
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,523
your feelings for her now?

265
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,962
You could put it that way.

266
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,643
Then what's the problem?

267
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,523
Just talk to her.

268
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:27,043
Ask her

269
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:27,883
whether you can

270
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:28,643
start over.

271
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,442
She won't say yes.

272
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:31,123
Why not?

273
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:33,523
She gave me

274
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:34,523
a jade pendant.

275
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,043
But after we met this time,

276
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:36,883
she wouldn't

277
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,043
let me wear it.

278
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:38,922
Obviously,

279
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:40,123
you broke her heart.

280
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,643
I had no choice back then.

281
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:46,562
"No choice," my foot.

282
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:47,602
Anyway,

283
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,523
that's all in the past now.

284
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:52,043
It was my fault.

285
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:56,163
Don't be too hard on yourself

286
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,163
for that.

287
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:59,082
T-Think about it.

288
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:00,922
After you met her the other day,

289
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,322
how was she with you?

290
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,722
When she told you to

291
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,883
remove the pendant, was she harsh?

292
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:07,763
A little.

293
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,322
That's good news.

294
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,123
That's good news?

295
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:12,403
What do you mean?

296
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:14,163
The fact that she's harsh

297
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:14,842
proves that

298
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:16,562
she still cares about you.

299
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,602
If she didn't care,

300
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:18,643
she wouldn't even

301
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:19,523
mention it.

302
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,403
So you think she still

303
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:23,962
has feelings for me?

304
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,202
- Yeah.
- We could

305
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,403
get back together?

306
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:27,562
That's right.

307
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:35,043
Wait.

308
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:38,243
If she's harsh with me,

309
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,082
doesn't it mean

310
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,082
she's holding a grudge?

311
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,243
Of course,

312
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,243
she is mad at you.

313
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:42,922
She's hurt

314
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,602
and has every right to be upset.

315
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,043
How did we end up in a loop?

316
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,163
I'm more confused now.

317
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,922
Come on, why are you confused?

318
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,363
Look, you broke her heart.

319
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,922
That becomes a trauma for her.

320
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,643
You need to heal her

321
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:54,602
before anything.

322
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,043
Then tell me.

323
00:13:58,403 --> 00:13:59,403
What should I do?

324
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:00,763
If you ask me,

325
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,922
you should go to her right now

326
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:04,523
and confess your love.

327
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,483
If she tells you to stay away,

328
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,722
you must get closer.

329
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,442
Even if she says,

330
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:09,123
"Get lost,"

331
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:09,763
you should...

332
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:11,283
Stop laughing. I'm serious.

333
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,883
Stay there even if she tells you to die.

334
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:14,483
You must take the initiative

335
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:15,763
to express your love.

336
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,403
Show your sincerity

337
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,243
and devotion.

338
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,283
Even if she told me to get lost,

339
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,363
I shouldn't leave?

340
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:21,962
Yeah.

341
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:22,763
Alright.

342
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:23,562
You have a point.

343
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,802
Obviously.

344
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,483
Don't you know who I am?

345
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:28,003
But, Lin Hu.

346
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,763
You know, some people

347
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:32,043
are all talk and no action.

348
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:33,802
They lecture others like experts.

349
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,283
But when it comes to themselves,

350
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:36,043
they fail.

351
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,322
Wait, what are you implying?

352
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:39,003
Look.

353
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,483
I've known you for years.

354
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:41,602
I've never

355
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:42,883
seen you dating anyone.

356
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,202
I'm here to comfort you.

357
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:46,403
And you mock me?

358
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:47,322
I'm done.

359
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:48,163
I'm going to bed.

360
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:51,602
Oh, and act quickly.

361
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:52,322
I'm off.

362
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:53,842
Got it.

363
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:57,962
Act quickly.

364
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,003
Should I listen to him or not?

365
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,018

♪Slowly, we accompany the fading lights♪

388
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:53,043
First bow to heaven and earth.

389
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,243
Second bow to the seniors.

390
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,602
Third bow to each other.

391
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,842
The ceremony is complete.

392
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,283
Congratulations.

393
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:29,243
Thank you.

394
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:30,882
Congratulations.

395
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,043
(Happiness)

396
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,082
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

397
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,483
From now on,

398
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,642
you two must cherish each other.

399
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:02,882
Don't...

400
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:06,203
Master, don't cry.

401
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:07,763
I'm just getting married.

402
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,483
I'll always be your disciple.

403
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:10,723
Qiyue Peak

404
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:11,842
will always be my home.

405
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:14,043
Why would I cry?

406
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,523
It's just that I've aged.

407
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,322
My eyes

408
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,322
keep getting dust in them.

409
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,362
This joyous day

410
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,562
calls for celebration.

411
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,243
Why would I cry?

412
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:25,562
Senior, rest assured.

413
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:26,963
I'll take care of her.

414
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:29,602
If I ever find out

415
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,882
that you've bullied our Kong Hou,

416
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:32,963
I'll make you pay dearly.

417
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,003
Master.

418
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:35,443
He is now

419
00:19:35,443 --> 00:19:37,122
my lawfully wedded husband.

420
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:39,162
Please stop bullying him.

421
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:40,882
Wang Tong.

422
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:43,122
Your little disciple

423
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,723
has just gotten married

424
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,362
and is already defending her husband.

425
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,888
(Happiness)

426
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,963
(What's taking Zhong Xi so long?)

427
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:29,483
(I bet Lin Hu and Tan Feng
dragged him away)

428
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,082
(for a few drinks.)

429
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:34,963
Zhong Xi.

430
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:37,082
You're back.

431
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,602
It's you.

432
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,483
Why was I not invited

433
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:59,162
to such a joyous occasion?

434
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:00,483
Why did you come?

435
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,203
Don't worry.

436
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:06,443
I'm not here for vengeance this time.

437
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,122
I came for you.

438
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,802
For me?

439
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,322
What do you want?

440
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:13,923
Kong Hou.

441
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,322
Do you remember

442
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,763
this phoenix mark?

443
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,642
Phoenix mark?

444
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:21,923
Today,

445
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,122
I'll bring my little sister home.

446
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:27,122
Don't talk nonsense!

447
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:30,243
I'm serious.

448
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,882
This is the Yueluo Clan's emblem.

449
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,602
We're blood siblings.

450
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:41,763
Jiusu.

451
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:42,842
Kong Hou.

452
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:45,642
Zhong Xi.

453
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:48,122
Are you alright?

454
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:49,082
I'm fine.

455
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:50,443
Jiusu.

456
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,243
What do you want?

457
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,362
I don't want to fight you today,

458
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:55,882
but Kong Hou

459
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,322
must come with me.

460
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:58,203
No way.

461
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,082
Won't you even ask me

462
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,162
why I'm taking Kong Hou away?

463
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,562
You must've known about

464
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:05,882
her true identity all along.

465
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:11,066
(Record of Washed Grievances)

466
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:18,763
Zhong Xi,

467
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,642
what is he talking about?

468
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:23,602
Kong Hou,

469
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,082
we are both descendants

470
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:26,483
of the Yueluo Clan.

471
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,203
The so-called clan

472
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,243
of dark cultivators.

473
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:30,443
Don't talk nonsense.

474
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:32,362
Our parents,

475
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:33,923
siblings, and clansmen

476
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,043
were slaughtered

477
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,483
by these righteous cultivators.

478
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:38,243
Will you still marry him?

479
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:39,483
If you don't leave now,

480
00:22:39,683 --> 00:22:41,003
I'll be forced to act.

481
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,043
Kong Hou.

482
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:43,602
If you still have doubts,

483
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,283
I'll prove it to you.

484
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:47,483
Let me lift the seal on you.

485
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:49,283
And you will learn the truth.

486
00:22:58,362 --> 00:22:59,082
(His cultivation)

487
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:00,562
(advanced so fast?)

488
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,043
Kong Hou.

489
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,842
Kong Hou, don't be afraid.

490
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:12,082
Whether you distrust me

491
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:13,802
or refuse to accept the truth,

492
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,122
the seal has been removed.

493
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,082
Kong Hou, you saw it.

494
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:19,642
That was Mother's phoenix mark.

495
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,402
Do not listen

496
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,723
to a single word he says.

497
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:26,523
So,

498
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,963
I had no spiritual root all these years

499
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:33,243
because my power had been sealed?

500
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:38,882
Jiusu.

501
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,322
Everyone's here.

502
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:43,923
Why don't you ask them

503
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,283
whether you're my sister

504
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:47,443
and the daughter

505
00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:49,402
of our late Sovereign Rong Ji?

506
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:50,763
Stop talking nonsense!

507
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,562
Am I talking nonsense,

508
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,443
or are you hiding something?

509
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,122
Master.

510
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:58,362
Don't tell me

511
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,882
you were the one who sealed my power.

512
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:03,122
Master Wang Tong.

513
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:05,483
Isn't my sister

514
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:08,082
a natural prodigy in cultivation?

515
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:11,602
Don't force me to make a move.

516
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,802
Why are you so enraged?

517
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:17,082
Truth be told,

518
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:18,362
you raised and educated

519
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:20,283
my sister Kong Hou all these years.

520
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:21,842
I must thank you

521
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,402
on behalf of our parents

522
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,802
and our entire clan.

523
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,043
Don't talk nonsense.

524
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,162
The dark cultivation

525
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,243
damaged your brain?

526
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:29,602
Don't pester Kong Hou.

527
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,203
She grew up

528
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,362
in the Yunhua Sect

529
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:32,203
under my watch.

530
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:32,763
Exactly.

531
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:33,963
She never left Yong City

532
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,362
before she turned seventeen.

533
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,683
She's not a dark cultivator.

534
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,362
You're clearly here to cause trouble.

535
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:41,283
Facts aren't established

536
00:24:41,283 --> 00:24:42,203
through empty words.

537
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:45,963
Kong Hou.

538
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:47,203
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou.

539
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,402
Kong Hou, your identity
as a dark cultivator

540
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,203
is now revealed.

541
00:25:04,523 --> 00:25:06,122
Even if you don't come with me today,

542
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,162
eventually

543
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:09,162
the Ten Great Sects will expel you.

544
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:10,923
One day,

545
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:11,683
you'll willingly

546
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:12,802
come to your brother.

547
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:17,723
Kong Hou.

548
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:39,882
The bride.

549
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:41,043
- Look.
- The bride is...

550
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:42,523
She's a dark cultivator.

551
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:43,683
Don't let her escape.

552
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:44,723
Nobody moves.

553
00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:53,882
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou.

554
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:04,562
I personally brought my disciple

555
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,963
from the mortal realm
to the Yunhua Sect.

556
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,283
I know her

557
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,203
better than anyone.

558
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,802
No more excuses.

559
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,443
So many people

560
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:15,162
witnessed

561
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:16,723
the entire incident.

562
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:19,162
We're not punishing you
for harboring evil yet.

563
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:21,043
So stop being argumentative.

564
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:21,963
While Kong Hou

565
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,283
has kinship with that dark cultivator,

566
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,082
she's been raised

567
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,362
within the Yunhua Sect

568
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:27,842
and has never practiced dark arts.

569
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:28,723
This truth

570
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:30,483
I swear before all sect leaders

571
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:31,483
and masters

572
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,642
with certainty.

573
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,602
We naturally trust your word,

574
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:36,362
Master Heng Yan.

575
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:39,642
But this child
isn't an ordinary dark cultivator.

576
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:41,882
When the seal broke earlier,

577
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:43,763
many sect disciples were injured.

578
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:45,642
Everyone has seen it.

579
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,203
Sect leaders and masters.

580
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,723
Disciples injured by Kong Hou

581
00:26:53,723 --> 00:26:54,723
from all the sects

582
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:55,443
have been

583
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:56,562
taken care of.

584
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,082
Alright.

585
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:03,602
Though Kong Hou
never practiced dark arts

586
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:04,642
and only hurt others

587
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:05,882
by mistake,

588
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:07,122
she still carries

589
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:08,763
the bloodline of dark cultivators.

590
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:10,043
Moreover, she inherited

591
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:11,322
Rong Ji's Five Spiritual Roots.

592
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:13,162
If Jiusu lures her

593
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:15,082
into avenging her father,

594
00:27:15,082 --> 00:27:16,683
they will come after all of you

595
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:17,723
because you have

596
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,763
suppressed the dark cultivators.

597
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,043
Even if you join hands,

598
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:23,723
you might not be able to take them down.

599
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:25,043
Master.

600
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:28,723
This matter arose abruptly,

601
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,082
shrouded in doubt.

602
00:27:30,243 --> 00:27:31,523
Let's not act hastily.

603
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,283
We'll discuss proper handling

604
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:34,763
after a thorough investigation.

605
00:27:34,923 --> 00:27:36,082
I hope the Liuguang Sect

606
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:36,602
won't be

607
00:27:36,602 --> 00:27:38,802
biased when Master Zhong Xi

608
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,203
is involved.

609
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:43,082
What makes you say that?

610
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:44,082
I'm just saying

611
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,642
that we must investigate

612
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:46,402
thoroughly first.

613
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:47,562
Master Heng Yan,

614
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:48,723
please see the big picture.

615
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:50,283
Master Heng Yan,

616
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:51,602
please see the big picture.

617
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:53,562
All of you, shut up.

618
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:54,882
You think I don't know

619
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:56,082
your true intentions?

620
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:57,723
See the big picture?

621
00:27:57,882 --> 00:27:59,683
Must I spell out your hypocrisy?

622
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:00,763
I don't wish to bring up

623
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:02,003
that incident.

624
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:03,322
But I'm warning you.

625
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:04,602
If you dare lay a finger

626
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:06,602
on my disciple Kong Hou,

627
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,602
I'll make you pay

628
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,763
at all costs.

629
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:11,283
Master Wang Tong, don't forget that

630
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,723
she's a dark cultivator.

631
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:13,802
No, she's not

632
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:14,802
because she doesn't

633
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,122
practice dark arts.

634
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:17,443
Since Master Heng Yan lacks

635
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:18,362
the resolve to act,

636
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:21,162
we petition Master Jin Yue to apprehend

637
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,723
this dark cultivator

638
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,443
on behalf of the Ten Great Sects.

639
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:29,602
No.

640
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,322
Master Jin Yue.

641
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:33,602
Liuguang Sect has always

642
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:35,203
upheld absolute justice.

643
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:36,243
Days ago,

644
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:37,322
Luanfeng Peak disciples

645
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:38,923
saved countless disciples of mine.

646
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,402
For this I'm grateful.

647
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:41,963
Yet today, to my dismay,

648
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:43,003
you let

649
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,562
your affection for your disciple

650
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:46,602
cloud your judgment.

651
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:47,923
Our Liuguang Sect

652
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:50,203
upholds absolute justice.

653
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:52,043
We won't go after someone

654
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:54,043
who has done nothing wrong.

655
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:55,003
Very well.

656
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:57,162
If Liuguang Sect

657
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,003
and Yunhua Sect both

658
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:59,723
shield this dark cultivator,

659
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:01,203
I'll make the command.

660
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:02,763
Arrest her at Qiyue Peak.

661
00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:03,802
Head of Jiufeng Sect,

662
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,003
do you think Master Jin Yue

663
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:07,483
and Master Heng Yan

664
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:09,283
will let you capture Kong Hou?

665
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,602
We'd better

666
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,082
avoid unnecessary conflict.

667
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,162
I have a solution

668
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,882
that might resolve this.

669
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:37,082
Stay outside.

670
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:38,683
My disciple Kong Hou

671
00:29:38,683 --> 00:29:40,043
has suffered enough trauma.

672
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:41,642
I must comfort her.

673
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:42,763
Wang Tong.

674
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:44,923
See the bigger picture.

675
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:48,882
Wang Tong,

676
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:50,082
wait here with me.

677
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:53,923
Song He.

678
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:55,082
Let go.

679
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:56,243
I must keep her company.

680
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,763
You might be too impulsive.

681
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,923
We need to handle it rationally.

682
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,683
I'm perfectly rational.

683
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:03,562
In my younger days,

684
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:04,443
I would've

685
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:06,162
beaten those people long ago.

686
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:08,362
Every one of them
speaks about righteousness,

687
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,362
but none of them

688
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:11,763
truly cares about my disciple

689
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:13,443
Kong Hou's life.

690
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:16,923
Master, what brings you here?

691
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:19,162
Master Heng Yan, Master Jin Yue.

692
00:30:27,802 --> 00:30:28,723
Kong Hou.

693
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:30,842
To spare your life, the sect leaders

694
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:32,523
decided that we must

695
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:35,082
extract your Five Spiritual Roots

696
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:36,882
and purge your cultivation.

697
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,043
What?

698
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,162
Only then

699
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:40,963
would they

700
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,122
let you stay at the Yunhua Sect.

701
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:45,362
I refuse.

702
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,963
Extract her roots
and purge her cultivation?

703
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:50,003
A minor mistake could kill her.

704
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:52,003
Kong Hou did nothing wrong.

705
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,362
Why should she suffer?

706
00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:54,122
I won't allow it.

707
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:56,003
Wang Tong,

708
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:57,283
Zhong Xi is inside.

709
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,802
Surely you trust him?

710
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:00,882
He'll protect Kong Hou.

711
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:02,562
If something happens,

712
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,842
we'll intervene immediately.

713
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,483
You have a point.

714
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,203
Why did you agree so suddenly?

715
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:11,642
Does it feel sudden?

716
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:12,683
I came around it.

717
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:15,082
Clarity can come in an instant.

718
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:16,402
Wang Tong.

719
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,602
You were charging in just now

720
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:20,923
but gave up so easily.

721
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:22,842
Something's off.

722
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:23,763
Really?

723
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,122
I don't think so.

724
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:26,802
Stay right here

725
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,203
and wait for them.

726
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:30,402
I'll return to my abode to rest.

727
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,443
I stayed up all night. I'm exhausted.

728
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:37,243
What scheme are you plotting?

729
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:38,923
Listen.

730
00:31:38,923 --> 00:31:40,723
Don't act recklessly.

731
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,802
People are watching you.

732
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:43,963
Exactly.

733
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:45,322
What could I possibly do?

734
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,562
People are watching me.

735
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,882
You're acting strange.

736
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:52,683
Something's wrong.

737
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:55,443
You're being paranoid.

738
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:58,162
Wang Tong.

739
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:00,082
Don't do anything foolish.

740
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:02,283
None of your business.

741
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:06,763
Zhong Xi.

742
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:09,283
Kong Hou has unique spiritual roots.

743
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,562
It is a tricky matter.

744
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,162
This is

745
00:32:14,443 --> 00:32:17,562
the most viable solution for now.

746
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:18,842
Master Heng Yan.

747
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:20,683
I'm scared.

748
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:23,322
Please don't remove my spiritual roots.

749
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:24,882
Kong Hou.

750
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:26,842
Don't be scared.

751
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:28,882
No one can hurt you while I'm here.

752
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,043
If the Yunhua Sect can't shelter you,

753
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:33,882
I'll take you somewhere else.

754
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:36,402
If the Lingyou Realm rejects you,

755
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,362
we'll go to another realm.

756
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:40,882
Zhong Xi, don't be impulsive.

757
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:42,322
I'm not being impulsive, Master.

758
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,483
I mean every word.

759
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,122
Let me repeat myself.

760
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:46,683
No one can hurt her

761
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:48,362
while I'm here.

762
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:58,283
Get that dark cultivator.

763
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:04,642
Stop her.

764
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,362
Such arrogance
from a mere dark cultivator.

765
00:33:22,562 --> 00:33:24,043
Return with me at once.

766
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:27,322
Why are you

767
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:28,203
arresting me?

768
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:29,683
I didn't do anything.

769
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:41,523
Typical vile dark cultivator tactics.

770
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:43,003
Let us out now.

771
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:43,723
If any of you

772
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,203
dare slander my disciple again,

773
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:45,802
I swear

774
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,043
I'll bury you right there.

775
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,483
What's happening?

776
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,683
Why does she sound like that?

777
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,523
Look at you.

778
00:33:58,523 --> 00:33:59,523
A concealment spell

779
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:01,082
has you trembling like rabbits.

780
00:34:10,602 --> 00:34:12,202
You guys, search over there.

781
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:12,762
Understood.

782
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,363
We should be safe now.

783
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:27,043
Zhong Xi.

784
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,803
We finally got out.

785
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,003
Thank you, Lady Ling Bo.

786
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:33,963
Don't mention it.

787
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:35,122
I can discern

788
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:36,242
right from wrong.

789
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:37,523
Young Master, Kong Hou.

790
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:38,323
Hurry up.

791
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:39,523
Ling Bo and I will stay

792
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:40,202
just in case.

793
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:41,443
Lady Ling Bo.

794
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,363
Thank you for your help.

795
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:44,762
Take care.

796
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,082
- What are you...
- What are you...

797
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:00,043
You go first.

798
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,602
I'm going to

799
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,523
regroup with our sect members

800
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:07,162
and keep "searching" for them

801
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:08,803
as if I don't know where they are.

802
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:10,282
Nice plan.

803
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:12,162
Put on a full play

804
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:15,082
to avoid suspicion. Well considered.

805
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:16,122
What about you?

806
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:17,242
What will you do?

807
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,242
Me? I...

808
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,242
I'm going back.

809
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:21,122
Going back?

810
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:22,323
No, you can't.

811
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,363
If you go back,

812
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:24,443
all those cultivators

813
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:25,803
will be watching you.

814
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:26,923
Why don't you

815
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,122
come with me

816
00:35:28,122 --> 00:35:29,122
to "search" for them

817
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:30,242
and buy them some time?

818
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:31,803
Given my tie

819
00:35:31,803 --> 00:35:33,242
with Young Master,

820
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,602
whether I return or not,

821
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:35,242
our sect leader

822
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:36,523
will suspect me.

823
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:38,003
I might as well return early

824
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,282
to divert attention
from Young Master and Kong Hou.

825
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:41,843
Isn't it better?

826
00:35:42,843 --> 00:35:43,722
That makes sense.

827
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:47,562
If they press you about

828
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,562
Master Zhong Xi
and Kong Hou's whereabouts,

829
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:50,323
what will you say?

830
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,602
I-I'll just ramble nonsense.

831
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:53,202
I'll claim

832
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:54,242
that Young Master went

833
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:54,803
up and down,

834
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:55,843
east and west,

835
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:56,883
or vanished completely.

836
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:58,722
Whether they believe it
is their problem.

837
00:35:58,722 --> 00:35:59,602
If they

838
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:01,443
actually discover his trail,

839
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:02,803
I'll learn about it first

840
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,323
and warn Young Master and Kong Hou.

841
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:05,483
That's more useful.

842
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:06,562
Don't worry.

843
00:36:06,562 --> 00:36:08,043
I'll manage.

844
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:09,963
Alright.

845
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:11,963
Then

846
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:16,682
be careful.

847
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:23,803
Y-You should stay safe too.

848
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:24,602
Alright.

849
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:28,483
Be careful.

850
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:30,923
Wang Tong.

851
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,722
I knew you were up to something.

852
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:34,282
You vanished in a blink.

853
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:35,242
I couldn't catch you.

854
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:36,843
You couldn't catch me

855
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:38,162
because you were less skilled.

856
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,562
Stop whining about it.

857
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:40,363
Yeah.

858
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:41,562
You're more skilled.

859
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,363
But you're audaciously reckless.

860
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,082
How dare you harbor Kong Hou?

861
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:46,963
My disciple did nothing wrong.

862
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,323
What do you mean by "harbor"?

863
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:50,363
They wanted to pierce her bones

864
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,523
and strip her tendons.

865
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,403
Could I just let it happen?

866
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:55,082
Especially when she's innocent!

867
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,323
Even if she were guilty,

868
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:57,282
could I just sit back

869
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,602
and let them hurt her?

870
00:36:58,803 --> 00:36:59,923
Wang Tong.

871
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:01,963
Kong Hou is a dark cultivator.

872
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:02,803
We're doing this

873
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,403
to prevent future problems.

874
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:05,642
She'd lose her spiritual roots,

875
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,242
but she'd be alive.

876
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:08,883
This is for her own good.

877
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:10,923
"A commoner's no criminal
until his treasure

878
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:12,162
invites trouble."

879
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:13,043
Blame it on fate

880
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,682
that she was born a dark cultivator.

881
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,682
Morality isn't determined

882
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:18,642
by one's origins.

883
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:20,003
I know my disciple

884
00:37:20,003 --> 00:37:21,363
better than anyone.

885
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:22,562
Her treasure invites trouble?

886
00:37:22,562 --> 00:37:23,483
Take you, for example.

887
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,682
Your mother wanted

888
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:25,682
a daughter

889
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:26,242
but gave birth

890
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:27,282
to a brat like you.

891
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:28,003
Who should

892
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:28,843
she blame?

893
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:30,242
How is that fair?

894
00:37:30,242 --> 00:37:31,043
Of course,

895
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:32,122
Kong Hou

896
00:37:32,122 --> 00:37:34,363
couldn't choose her origin, either.

897
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:35,082
You...

898
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:38,682
I won't waste my breath with you.

899
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:39,883
Tell us.

900
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,043
Where have you hidden

901
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:42,162
your disciple?

902
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,363
Out with it. Where is she?

903
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:48,403
Master Jin Yue.

904
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,642
Look at him.

905
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:51,562
So obstinate.

906
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,363
Perhaps

907
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,323
he's done more than
shelter his disciple.

908
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:55,323
All these years,

909
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:56,562
he must've learned about

910
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:57,483
her true identity.

911
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,443
He might have even
colluded with the dark cultivators.

912
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:01,403
No way.

913
00:38:01,803 --> 00:38:03,523
The entire Lingyou Realm knows

914
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,682
that Wang Tong is ruthless against evil.

915
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:06,523
He's just

916
00:38:07,003 --> 00:38:09,003
worried about his disciple.

917
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:11,562
Heng Yan.

918
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:13,363
You see what they are like.

919
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:14,162
So abnoxious.

920
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,843
Once they've decided something,

921
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,562
no one can change their minds.

922
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,323
I'll take full responsibility

923
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:21,242
and won't drag
the Yunhua Sect into this.

924
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,682
Whatever punishment you decide,

925
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,403
I'll accept it.

926
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:26,923
Punishment?

927
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:28,363
How naive!

928
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,162
You shall be executed today,

929
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:31,483
or justice won't be served.

930
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,523
Enough.

931
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:53,003
Wang Tong.

932
00:38:53,202 --> 00:38:55,762
Where is Kong Hou?

933
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,762
You old fool.

934
00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:58,363
We almost

935
00:38:58,363 --> 00:38:59,523
became in-laws.

936
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:01,323
You suspect Kong Hou too, don't you?

937
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:03,082
I only trust evidence.

938
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:04,523
Bring Kong Hou back

939
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:06,843
and extract her spiritual roots.

940
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,323
That's how we truly help her.

941
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:11,883
You...

942
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:14,202
Stop arguing.

943
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:14,963
In my opinion,

944
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:16,403
we should dispose of him too.

945
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,122
Yeah.

946
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,523
Besides, the Yunhua Sect must also

947
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,523
be held accountable.

948
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:21,363
I say we should

949
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:22,403
let them handle

950
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,722
this rule-breaker themselves

951
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:25,323
to prove their innocence.

952
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:32,682
From your aggressive stance,

953
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:35,003
if we don't execute Wang Tong here,

954
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,363
you'll tear apart

955
00:39:36,363 --> 00:39:37,323
the Yunhua Sect.

956
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,363
T-That's not what we meant.

957
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,562
But Wang Tong...

958
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:44,722
Wang Tong acted rashly, true.

959
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:47,122
But we must look into

960
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:48,562
Kong Hou's case.

961
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:51,122
You can't just lose it

962
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,642
and direct your fury

963
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:54,122
at the Yunhua Sect.

964
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,562
