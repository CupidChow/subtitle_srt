16
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,501
Kong Hou?

17
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,004
How come you're the Sovereign?

18
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:54,885
Correct.

19
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,525
I am now their Sovereign.

20
00:01:59,165 --> 00:01:59,805
Your Eminence,

21
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,805
no need for your concern.

22
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:04,284
This fool overestimates himself.

23
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:06,045
You've clarified everything.

24
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,004
Yet he insists on self-humiliation.

25
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,764
Let me handle him.

26
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,285
Did I not warn you?

27
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:13,644
You shall not touch him.

28
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,484
Your Eminence,

29
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:17,964
do you still harbor feelings for him?

30
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:22,924
No.

31
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,605
But he belongs to Liuguang Sect.

32
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:26,964
We currently

33
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,804
should not conflict excessively

34
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,204
with the Liuguang Sect.

35
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,285
I will resolve

36
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,484
my personal affairs myself.

37
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:37,165
I don't need you here

38
00:02:37,165 --> 00:02:38,405
meddling in my business.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:40,885
Fine.

40
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,244
Since he's Your Eminence's former lover,

41
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:45,605
we'll let you deal with him.

42
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:46,964
However,

43
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,165
I must remind Your Eminence.

44
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:52,125
Please forget him swiftly.

45
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,285
Master Zhong Xi,

46
00:02:58,924 --> 00:02:59,885
I previously

47
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,445
made myself clear to you.

48
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,204
Our paths diverge.

49
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,045
For past affections,

50
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:07,804
I won't make it difficult for you.

51
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:10,644
Please leave immediately.

52
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,605
Cease your persistence.

53
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,565
I don't believe.

54
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:16,845
I don't believe you truly...

55
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,764
If you continue this pestering,

56
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:22,285
I won't hold back.

57
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:31,804
What are you doing?

58
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:33,125
What do you think?

59
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,204
You truly persist in delusion.

60
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,524
If I can't take you today,

61
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:57,285
I won't leave.

62
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:59,045
(Why must you be so silly?)

63
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,244
Jiusu.

64
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:02,644
I know

65
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:04,964
you're capturing righteous cultivators

66
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,445
for Kong Hou to absorb spiritual energy.

67
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:09,605
In that case,

68
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:11,924
let me stay.

69
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,924
My spiritual energy alone
should suffice.

70
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:18,124
No need to exhaust yourselves

71
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,884
capturing minor cultivators.

72
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:22,444
Truly unexpected.

73
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,684
You possess not just courage

74
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,405
but also a bodhisattva's heart

75
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:27,165
to save all beings.

76
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:28,364
Very well.

77
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,484
We'll proceed as you say.

78
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,444
If you keep your word,

79
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,725
I guarantee

80
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,845
we'll stop catching
insignificant cultivators.

81
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:37,645
Agreed.

82
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:41,484
Your Eminence,

83
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:43,525
since he made this offer,

84
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,364
don't reject his goodwill.

85
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,360
Just fulfill Master Zhong Xi's

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,564
noble wish to save the world.

87
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:54,845
Fool.

88
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,285
Take him away.

89
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,285
Wise decision, Your Eminence.

90
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:43,324
Kong Hou,

91
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,045
you don't have to do this.

92
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,165
No one's around.

93
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:52,324
Master Zhong Xi,

94
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,004
you are so naive.

95
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:55,605
Did you not understand

96
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,124
what I told you earlier?

97
00:05:58,645 --> 00:05:59,525
I suspect

98
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,124
you're doing this

99
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:02,605
to deceive Jiusu.

100
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:03,444
Am I right?

101
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:05,684
Haven't you faced reality?

102
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,725
Stop deluding yourself.

103
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:09,804
I am the Sovereign.

104
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:11,645
The Sovereign of the Yueluo Clan.

105
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,405
You are still my wife.

106
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:15,085
We exchanged vows.

107
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:17,205
I remain your husband.

108
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:19,884
Kong Hou,

109
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,564
I'll stand by you in anything.

110
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,564
But your current path

111
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:27,924
truly breaks my heart.

112
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,085
Stop this.

113
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,564
I can protect you.

114
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,564
(Forgive me, Zhong Xi.)

115
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:37,884
(I have no other choice now.)

116
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:40,324
You're truly beyond redemption.

117
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:33,045
Senior.

118
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:35,525
Take a seat.

119
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:38,564
Well?

120
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,224
All major sects have sent envoys

121
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,364
to inquire about Zhong Xi.

122
00:07:41,484 --> 00:07:42,765
If he remains absent,

123
00:07:42,884 --> 00:07:43,776
I fear

124
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,004
suspicion will arise soon.

125
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,564
Who knows how long we can stall?

126
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:50,765
Zhong Xi's unauthorized departure

127
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,765
mustn't be disclosed.

128
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,285
Though Zhong Xi

129
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,525
doesn't show it,

130
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,124
he's deeply loyal at heart.

131
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,285
Normally,

132
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:01,564
he strictly disciplines

133
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,324
his juniors

134
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,965
and shows no mercy during training.

135
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:05,765
Yet when facing enemies,

136
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:06,564
he always

137
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,004
leads the charge.

138
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,605
At critical moments of danger,

139
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,884
he always steps forward.

140
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,405
I'm well aware of all this.

141
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:16,165
Moreover,

142
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,205
the one in peril now

143
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,525
is his cultivation partner.

144
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:21,965
Why mention all this?

145
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,364
Are you worried

146
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,045
I'll be too harsh on him?

147
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:26,564
Senior,

148
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:28,564
I know you value discipline above all.

149
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:29,965
Then say no more.

150
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:34,204
Since Zhong Xi has left,

151
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,125
it proves

152
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,245
he's prepared

153
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,285
to face all consequences.

154
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,804
Get out.

155
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:20,285
I said get out.

156
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:21,724
Don't come in.

157
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:24,765
Get out.

158
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,245
Now!

159
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,005
Haven't you noticed?

160
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,084
We've been circling

161
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,405
and ended up back here.

162
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,005
I too thought

163
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,324
this path got stranger.

164
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:55,084
I was wondering why it seemed endless.

165
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:00,604
Handkerchief.

166
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:11,245
What's this?

167
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,724
Making a marker.

168
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,304
Shouldn't you use yours?

169
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:15,245
Why take mine?

170
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:21,485
My handkerchief's expensive.

171
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:22,444
After we escape,

172
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:23,808
I'll buy you a new one.

173
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,204
- Let's go.
- I...

174
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:40,765
As expected,

175
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,245
we circled back again.

176
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,485
We can't keep wandering.

177
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:45,804
We need to find a spot

178
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:46,724
to rest

179
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,324
and consider alternatives.

180
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,045
Let's go.

181
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:53,564
Your foot?

182
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:54,405
What?

183
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:55,924
What's wrong with your foot?

184
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,844
I just walked too much.

185
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:00,804
Come here.

186
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,204
What? Put me down.

187
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:05,724
Keep walking and you'll ruin it.

188
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:14,885
Lin Hu.

189
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:15,964
What?

190
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:17,485
I'm cold.

191
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:22,045
Use this.

192
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:34,765
Wait.

193
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:35,604
Now what?

194
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:39,245
I'm thirsty. I need water.

195
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,165
Do you cultivators

196
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,365
always drink like this?

197
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:58,724
Can you conjure

198
00:11:58,724 --> 00:11:59,885
a proper cup?

199
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:00,704
Drink or not?

200
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,485
Return it if not.

201
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,084
I want some.

202
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:14,365
What?

203
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:15,200
Your foot hurts.

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,844
- Let me check.
- I can do it myself.

205
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:25,924
You lecher.

206
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,485
Stop that. Don't move.

207
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:29,804
I know

208
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,045
mortal customs separate genders.

209
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,324
I'm Lady Ling Bo.

210
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,645
Yes, you're a lady.

211
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,165
So you shouldn't

212
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,645
mind such trivialities, right?

213
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:46,485
Who knows

214
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:47,804
what kind of cursed luck this is?

215
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,204
Since meeting you,

216
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,684
my luck's been bad.

217
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,604
Meeting you ruined my luck too.

218
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,005
Let's make a pact then.

219
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,485
Stay out of each other's vicinity.

220
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:56,324
Fine.

221
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,248
From now on,

222
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,604
stay at least thirty zhang away.

223
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:02,324
Forget it. Bad luck it is.

224
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,365
I want to be with you.

225
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:04,844
What did you say?

226
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:07,204
I said I need to apply medicine for you.

227
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,525
See this?

228
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:15,405
This is Liuguang Sect's secret ointment.

229
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:17,084
Once I apply it,

230
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,245
you'll be walking soon.

231
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:19,245
But be warned.

232
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,405
Though it works fast,

233
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,125
it'll sting a lot.

234
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:23,604
Wait.

235
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:26,525
Here it comes.

236
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:39,765
My lord.

237
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:43,684
Is Her Eminence inside?

238
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:44,604
Yes.

239
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:50,324
Your Eminence.

240
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:52,885
It's late.

241
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:53,885
What do you want?

242
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:55,924
You've just absorbed spiritual energy.

243
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,724
Your meridians are brimming with power.

244
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,296
For the dual cultivation,

245
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,005
now is the time.

246
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,485
I'm tired.

247
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,005
Whatever you need,

248
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,444
wait till tomorrow.

249
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:05,724
Your Eminence,

250
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:07,604
since your return,

251
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:09,804
we've barely spoken as siblings.

252
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:11,525
About our clan,

253
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:12,864
there's much I must

254
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:13,724
share with you.

255
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:16,405
Didn't you say

256
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:17,924
you wanted answers?

257
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:33,684
Kong Hou.

258
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:45,844
It's time.

259
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,405
Kong Hou,

260
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,804
I'll now reveal

261
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,564
the past you seek

262
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:55,328
without omission.

263
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,032
(Shoushan Village)

264
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:58,304
(Our clan dwelt)

265
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,724
(on Mount Yueluo for generations.)

266
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:01,604
(Cultivation)

267
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,765
(was practiced only by a few)

268
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:05,765
(until a clansman)

269
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,040
(accidentally drained)

270
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,564
(a Lingyou Realm cultivator's energy.)

271
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,405
(His cultivation advanced rapidly.)

272
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,604
(Word spread)

273
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:14,924
(throughout our clan quickly.)

274
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:16,928
(By absorbing)

275
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,365
(Lingyou cultivators' energy,)

276
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,604
(our clan grew powerful.)

277
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,528
(The Lingyou Realm feared us.)

278
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,204
(We reigned supreme.)

279
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,165
(But a century ago,)

280
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:29,564
(after a Lingyou Realm elder ascended,)

281
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:30,964
(he cast a forbidden curse)

282
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:32,564
(on our Energy Drain Art.)

283
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,084
(Now whenever we use it,)

284
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,032
(the stolen energy retaliates.)

285
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,525
(When the backlash strikes,)

286
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:40,444
(we must drain new energy immediately.)

287
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,005
(Or we'll descend)

288
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,285
(into mindless madness,)

289
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,645
(and death will follow soon.)

290
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:47,564
(Also, by using Energy Drain,)

291
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:50,885
(the curse spreads through bloodlines.)

292
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:54,125
(So the only escape is abandoning)

293
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,324
(this dark art)

294
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,885
(to break the curse's hold.)

295
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,005
(Right?)

296
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:00,125
(Yes.)

297
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,125
(But our clan)

298
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,844
(won't bow to others.)

299
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:05,564
(I believe)

300
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:07,324
(those who understood the curse)

301
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,564
(would abandon the art)

302
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,405
(they once adopted)

303
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,125
(to protect future generations.)

304
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:14,204
(Right?)

305
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:16,564
(No. They shouldn't.)

306
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,084
(The Lingyou sects)

307
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,084
(caused the suffering.)

308
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,165
(They deserve death.)

309
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,804
Dark cultivator! Dark cultivator!

310
00:16:31,844 --> 00:16:32,684
Catch him!

311
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:36,160
- Stop!
- Stop now!

312
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,204
Surrender now.

313
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,504
Demonic filth,

314
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,005
face judgment.

315
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:53,165
Today, our Yueluo Clan
is at a disadvantage.

316
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:56,005
But the day will come

317
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,525
when we'll bring you endless turmoil.

318
00:17:08,084 --> 00:17:09,644
(Father transferred all his power)

319
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,364
(in his lifetime to you.)

320
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,324
(You became our clan's hope.)

321
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:27,552
Later, I got separated from you

322
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:28,844
and Mother during our escape.

323
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,564
After all these events,

324
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:32,525
I swore

325
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,604
to ascend and avenge Father,

326
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,124
protect our clan,

327
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,844
and avenge the Lingyou Realm.

328
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,604
But lacking Five Spiritual Roots

329
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,124
and you being missing,

330
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,445
the only path to ascension

331
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:46,336
was having my men find those

332
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,925
with exceptional spiritual roots,

333
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,324
extract their spiritual roots,

334
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,804
and refine them into elixirs

335
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,045
for my use.

336
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:53,445
Yes.

337
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:54,528
To your eyes,

338
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:55,925
it must seem cruel.

339
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:57,920
I had no other choice

340
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,804
but to do so.

341
00:17:59,364 --> 00:17:59,965
Kong Hou,

342
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:01,564
not everyone gets

343
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:02,464
the privilege of being

344
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:03,404
those hypocritical

345
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:04,564
'righteous cultivators.'

346
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:06,364
Since you know

347
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,804
you lack Five Spiritual Roots,

348
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:09,644
why pursue these futile efforts?

349
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,205
Now that I'm here,

350
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:14,045
what's your true aim?

351
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:17,404
You possess Five Spiritual Roots

352
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:18,804
and Father's spiritual energy.

353
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,525
Your ascension is within reach.

354
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,525
I see your scheme now.

355
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,404
But rushing won't help.

356
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:28,404
I have my own methods.

357
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,844
Don't interfere.

358
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,045
Fine.

359
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:33,164
I increasingly feel

360
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:35,045
you act like a true Sovereign now.

361
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:36,640
Father's wish

362
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,364
will soon be realized.

363
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,804
If Your Eminence ascends,

364
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:42,804
our clan

365
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,164
will surpass the Lingyou Realm.

366
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:47,765
After all, their realm

367
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,720
hasn't seen ascension in years.

368
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,640
The only potential candidate,

369
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,765
Master Zhong Xi,
is already in your grasp.

370
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:55,844
Our clan

371
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:58,124
finally has hope of resurgence.

372
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:01,164
Are you truly working

373
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:02,445
for our clan's revival

374
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:06,164
or harboring hidden agendas?

375
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,445
Rest early, Your Eminence.

376
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,844
Visit our clansmen when you can.

377
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:32,525
What?

378
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:33,925
The scent.

379
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:35,525
What scent?

380
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:38,765
Eyes may deceive,

381
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,084
but smells don't.

382
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,445
Stop preening. Time's urgent.

383
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:44,525
Firewood scent.

384
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,525
Follow me. We'll get out soon.

385
00:19:54,045 --> 00:19:54,644
Xiao Pei,

386
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,364
what's this about?

387
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,045
I'd like

388
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,364
to ask for your favor.

389
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:02,404
Could you deliver this gift

390
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:03,604
to my younger brother?

391
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,965
Deliver it yourself.

392
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:06,725
I'm actually

393
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,084
heading to the village soon.

394
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:09,245
Come with me.

395
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,164
No.

396
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:12,285
I can't leave this place freely.

397
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:14,485
Is it Jiusu's order

398
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,485
restricting your movement?

399
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,084
I choose not to return.

400
00:20:24,884 --> 00:20:26,804
What should I deliver then?

401
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:29,124
New clothes I made

402
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,084
for my brother.

403
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,364
He must have grown taller.

404
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,124
Children his age

405
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,525
shoot up like sesame stalks,

406
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:35,725
changing daily.

407
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:42,525
This must be the village

408
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:43,564
Xiao Pei mentioned.

409
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:46,485
Stop.

410
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:52,604
You're so pretty.

411
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:54,965
Are you from the palace?

412
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:57,364
My sister works there too.

413
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,364
Her name's Xiao Pei.

414
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,564
Do you know her?

415
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:00,644
Xiao Pei?

416
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:01,564
Forgive him.

417
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:02,564
Forgive him.

418
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,084
He doesn't know better.

419
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:05,644
He didn't mean to offend you.

420
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:06,965
Stop asking.

421
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:07,925
Come with me now.

422
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,685
I know your sister.

423
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:11,564
Really?

424
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,205
Yes.

425
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,925
Your sister asked me to give you this.

426
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:21,925
Thank you.

427
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,644
Where's my sister?

428
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,604
Where is she?

429
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:28,445
She...

430
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,084
She's not with me.

431
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,884
If you see my sister,

432
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:33,925
tell her

433
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,844
to come see me in a few days.

434
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,404
I miss her so much.

435
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:39,644
Alright, I'll tell her.

436
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:54,564
Our accommodations are humble.

437
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,404
We can only offer you plain water.

438
00:21:58,005 --> 00:21:58,725
Your Grace,

439
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:00,725
please don't take offense.

440
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:02,965
Thank you.

441
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:06,965
If I may ask,

442
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,045
does Your Grace come from the palace?

443
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:15,205
For many years,

444
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:16,644
I've led the clansmen

445
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:18,525
to strictly abide by the rules here.

446
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:20,404
We've never overstepped.

447
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:22,045
Sir,

448
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:23,564
there's no need to fear.

449
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,765
I do come from the palace.

450
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,844
But I've been away for years.

451
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,725
I don't know our clansmen well.

452
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,525
That's why I came to observe.

453
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:33,765
I mean no harm.

454
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:35,205
Actually,

455
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:36,644
we're not different

456
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:38,045
from ordinary people.

457
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,884
Staying here all these years,

458
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,445
we've just wanted peaceful lives.

459
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:43,685
But

460
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:46,285
when the curse flares,

461
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:48,685
the agony becomes unbearable.

462
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:49,925
Some clansmen

463
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:51,104
resort to

464
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:52,485
unforgivable acts.

465
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:54,124
It's only because

466
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:58,205
they can't endure such torment.

467
00:22:58,285 --> 00:22:59,124
Then how

468
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:01,216
do you resist

469
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,804
the urge to absorb spiritual energy?

470
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:09,445
These...

471
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:11,925
These are blade wounds?

472
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:13,725
For those of us who refuse

473
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,285
to steal others' spiritual energy,

474
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,245
when the curse strikes

475
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,445
and causes intolerable pain,

476
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:21,364
fearful of losing control,

477
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:22,965
we'd use knives

478
00:23:24,324 --> 00:23:25,084
or swords

479
00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:27,045
to cut ourselves

480
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,084
over and over.

481
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:30,844
Only physical pain

482
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,564
can suppress

483
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,285
the heart-devouring agony.

484
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,245
How could this be?

485
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:39,804
Elder.

486
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:40,804
Elder, bad news.

487
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:42,245
Xiao Pei's brother is unwell.

488
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:43,245
What?

489
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,644
- Elder, you're here.
- Elder.

490
00:23:45,644 --> 00:23:46,285
Please help him.

491
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:47,485
Please.

492
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:48,844
It's been hours already.

493
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:52,525
You should go home.

494
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:53,844
The boy

495
00:23:54,604 --> 00:23:57,485
must face this trial alone eventually.

496
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,925
It's no use.

497
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:00,324
When children are young,

498
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,084
adults help regulate their energy

499
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,285
during episodes.

500
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:05,164
But as they grow,

501
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,485
the pain intensifies.

502
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,604
Energy regulation alone isn't enough.

503
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:11,404
The boy

504
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:14,804
must learn to endure this himself.

505
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:21,124
My son.

506
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:34,765
Kong Hou.

507
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:41,324
It's you.

508
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:42,976
I...

509
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:44,765
Come with me.

510
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,084
I knew it was you.

511
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:15,324
Kong Hou.

512
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:17,925
Why have you come?

513
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,005
I'm here to stay with you.

514
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:23,804
Since when have you

515
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:25,685
been hiding by my side?

516
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,164
I had suspicions earlier.

517
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:30,005
I never thought

518
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:32,324
you'd have such audacity.

519
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:33,884
Do you believe

520
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,604
I could end you right now?

521
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,124
If you wish,

522
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,324
strike whenever you please.

523
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:42,725
Zhong Xi,

524
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:44,445
you...

525
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,285
I don't want your life.

526
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:52,564
But

527
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:55,604
I long ago ceased

528
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,245
to be the Kong Hou you once knew.

529
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,404
Why must you persist?

530
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,005
You may deceive Jiusu

531
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:03,604
and the masses,

532
00:26:04,205 --> 00:26:05,644
but not me.

533
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,045
I know you're still you.

534
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,245
Come with me.

535
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:10,925
Leave this place.

536
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:13,205
Must you remain deluded?

537
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:14,965
What meaning does this hold

538
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:16,364
coming from you now?

539
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,644
As you see me now,

540
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:21,376
I'm but a dark cultivator who drains

541
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:22,884
others' spiritual energy.

542
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:24,844
Why must you persist,

543
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,005
Master Zhong Xi?

544
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:28,765
Even so,

545
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,445
I'll stay by your side

546
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:36,525
to support you.

547
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,564
We'll find a solution together.

548
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:42,005
But have you ever asked

549
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:43,765
what I truly desire?

550
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:45,804
Yes,

551
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:47,164
I once

552
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,644
genuinely cared for you.

553
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,245
But

554
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:53,844
as long as my veins carry

555
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:55,680
the blood

556
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,485
of the Yueluo Clan,

557
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:58,848
I can never

558
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,928
stand by your side, Master Zhong Xi.

559
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:04,765
For whatever affection remains

560
00:27:06,644 --> 00:27:08,285
between us,

561
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:11,725
I don't want to see you again.

562
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:12,884
Get out.

563
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:14,685
Kong Hou.

564
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:21,525
I don't want to see you.

565
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:22,485
Stop following me.

566
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:23,804
Or

567
00:27:24,364 --> 00:27:25,564
I will kill you.

568
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,364
I'll say this once more.

569
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:30,285
I'm not leaving.

570
00:27:30,804 --> 00:27:31,804
Back then,

571
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,965
you risked your life

572
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,245
to save me from the illusion,

573
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,644
getting yourself battered and broken.

574
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,424
Through all that suffering,

575
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,725
you never abandoned me.

576
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:43,965
Now, I won't abandon you.

577
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,205
Whatever arguments you make,

578
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:51,285
my resolve stands firm.

579
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,205
I'm staying here

580
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,045
with you.

581
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:21,404
Your Eminence,

582
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,164
why return so late?

583
00:28:23,564 --> 00:28:24,485
Do you need something?

584
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:25,324
Nothing.

585
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,285
I merely wondered

586
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,525
how you felt meeting our clansmen today.

587
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,765
What reaction do you expect?

588
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,604
Their suffering exists

589
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:41,045
through your designs.

590
00:28:41,324 --> 00:28:42,725
I wish you to know

591
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:44,084
our people

592
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:45,364
would brave any danger

593
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:46,324
for their Sovereign.

594
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:47,965
I saw it.

595
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,164
They know nothing

596
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:54,084
of the full truth.

597
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,245
They are your own kin.

598
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:57,965
Did that not affect you at all?

599
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,128
Not even when a child

600
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,364
died before your eyes?

601
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:07,584
You weren't present

602
00:29:07,584 --> 00:29:08,604
at that village earlier.

603
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:10,528
How did you know

604
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,485
about the dead child?

605
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:14,485
Of course.

606
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:17,685
You've been watching me.

607
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:18,844
Your Eminence,

608
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,364
it's because I genuinely care for you

609
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,485
and every clansmember.

610
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:28,084
How can I trust

611
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,285
it wasn't your scheme?

612
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:34,324
Very well.

613
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:36,064
Your Eminence,

614
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:38,404
you still doubt me.

615
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,084
I will make you believe me.

616
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,644
I'll be blunt.

617
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:42,884
I've known for a long time.

618
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,324
Stop pretending.

619
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,884
What do you mean, Your Eminence?

620
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,725
Drop the act.

621
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,884
You showed me the clansmen

622
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:53,884
just to

623
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:55,564
enjoy my current expression.

624
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:56,445
What?

625
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:58,005
Still not satisfied?

626
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,245
Nothing was arranged.

627
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:04,324
I just hope you remember

628
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,205
the grand cause entrusted by our father.

629
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:10,816
I'll seize more people

630
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:11,936
for you to drain energy.

631
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:35,884
Your Eminence.

632
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:41,965
Please eat something.

633
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,045
Your Eminence,

634
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:51,285
did you see my brother

635
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:53,164
and my mother today?

636
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,205
Does the robe fit well?

637
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:58,404
Does he like it?

638
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:02,404
He

639
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,564
likes it very much.

640
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:07,685
He's envied

641
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:08,672
other children

642
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,600
with new clothes

643
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,445
for a long time.

644
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,245
But with so many children,

645
00:31:12,364 --> 00:31:13,285
Mother overlooked him.

646
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:14,644
He remains obedient

647
00:31:14,884 --> 00:31:16,084
and has never cried.

648
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:17,725
Xiao Pei.

649
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,404
I was like that as a child too,

650
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:21,725
just as eager for treats.

651
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:26,245
Forgive me,

652
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:28,005
this must sound foolish to you.

653
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:29,804
Xiao Pei,

654
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,124
there's something you should know.

655
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:47,725
The child who perished today

656
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:50,485
was your brother.

657
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:52,005
He

658
00:31:52,884 --> 00:31:54,304
is gone.

659
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,765
No.

660
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,644
Firewood scent? Nonsense.

661
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:09,285
Pure imagination.

662
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:10,364
We keep circling

663
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,525
through these woods.

664
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:12,965
Let me tell you,

665
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:13,965
my nose

666
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:15,525
never fails.

667
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:17,564
You should

668
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:19,084
rest instead.

669
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:20,124
You're exhausted,

670
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,324
misidentifying scents.

671
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,804
Who says I'm tired?

672
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:24,644
Listen,

673
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,336
I'm bursting with energy.

674
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,804
This walk's nothing.

675
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:28,884
You're the tired one.

676
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:31,045
I never get tired.

677
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:32,644
Just rest.

678
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:33,445
You rest.

679
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,128
- You rest.
- You rest.

680
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,404
So much nonsense.

681
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:41,925
I'll rest.

682
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:52,445
Lady Ling Bo, you live up to your title.

683
00:32:53,925 --> 00:32:55,445
After all these days,

684
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:56,685
you still smell divine.

685
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,005
But you stink.

686
00:33:01,536 --> 00:33:02,525
So what if I stink?

687
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,404
You don't mind anyway.

688
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:06,364
Behave yourself.

689
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:08,364
Or I'll rip off your fox tail.

690
00:33:09,408 --> 00:33:10,592
Go ahead. Rip it off.

691
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:12,804
Take my tail

692
00:33:12,844 --> 00:33:14,445
and make yourself

693
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:17,285
a magnificent

694
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:18,400
fox fur collar.

695
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,324
Wearing it,

696
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,120
you'll shine brighter.

697
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:25,564
- You need discipline.
- I'm being sincere.

698
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:26,485
Don't believe me?

699
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,364
Your disbelief makes

700
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:30,124
my fox heart ache.

701
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,008
If you doubt me,

702
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,685
my heart shatters.

703
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:34,564
Enough.

704
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:40,725
Rest assured.

705
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:42,164
Even if my nose

706
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:43,525
failed this time,

707
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:44,965
my instinct never lies.

708
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,965
We'll leave here eventually.

709
00:33:51,884 --> 00:33:52,525
- What?
- Someone's there.

710
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,564
Your Eminence, reports indicate

711
00:33:57,765 --> 00:33:59,124
the Ten Great Sects are mired

712
00:33:59,124 --> 00:33:59,884
in disputes.

713
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:01,285
Internal fractures loom.

714
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:02,880
Now is the perfect time

715
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,725
for us to act.

716
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:04,765
Amid the chaos, we can

717
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:05,884
start with the minor sects,

718
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,564
and then divide and conquer.

719
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:09,088
Fortunes shift like the wind.

720
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:10,445
Now we are the hunters,

721
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:11,445
they, the prey.

722
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:12,604
It's time to

723
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:14,164
teach those major sects a lesson.

724
00:34:14,164 --> 00:34:15,244
Let them witness

725
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:16,365
the might of our clan.

726
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,325
Your Eminence and Your Lordship,

727
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:19,325
let me lead a team

728
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:20,805
to capture those sect disciples.

729
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,164
Such short-sightedness.

730
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:25,485
Always obsessed with violence.

731
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,764
Now that the Ten Great Sects
are divided,

732
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,084
you still plan
to divide and conquer them?

733
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,544
Do you think these sects won't

734
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,445
unite again when threatened,

735
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:35,644
forming stronger alliances?

736
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:37,084
Utter foolishness.

737
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,045
Shouldn't we

738
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:38,885
at least

739
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:39,925
avenge our fallen men?

740
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:41,856
- Yes, avenge them.
- Avenge them.

741
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:43,584
- Avenge them.
- Revenge!

742
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,576
- Revenge!
- Revenge!

743
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:45,284
- Yes!
- Silence!

744
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:49,805
Are you all incompetent?

745
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:51,005
Daring only to harass

746
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,244
scattered stragglers?

747
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:53,885
Does this truly aid

748
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,005
our clan's plight?

749
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:57,445
Capturing minnows

750
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,005
and killing weaklings

751
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,096
won't restore

752
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,124
Mount Yueluo's glory.

753
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:03,200
Useless!

754
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,564
My lord, you're wise.

755
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,604
We were near-sighted.

756
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:10,005
- All hail the Lord!
- All hail!

757
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:12,684
It seems

758
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,885
you have a deeper plan.

759
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:16,365
Its success

760
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:17,564
depends

761
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:18,764
on your cooperation.

762
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:21,764
Now that

763
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:24,325
the clan honors me as Sovereign,

764
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,764
I shall prioritize

765
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:28,365
our people's welfare above all.

766
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,045
They've left.

767
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,204
Speak.

768
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,604
What's your plan?

769
00:35:51,124 --> 00:35:52,084
It seems

770
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,644
you still care for the clan.

771
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,724
But this matter

772
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:57,525
isn't ripe for discussion.

773
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:58,965
Mysterious act.

774
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,045
You misunderstand.

775
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,325
All my actions

776
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:04,005
aim to restore Mount Yueluo's

777
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:04,800
position

778
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,084
in the Lingyou Realm one day.

779
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:07,525
But

780
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:09,204
this arduous path

781
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,885
requires more than my strength alone.

782
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,644
Then what's your approach?

783
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:15,084
If you

784
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:16,644
cultivate with me,

785
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,405
progress will accelerate.

786
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:30,084
I've decided

787
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:31,684
to cultivate with him.

788
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,084
No rushing.

789
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:34,604
No risks.

790
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:36,485
Earlier in the hall,

791
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:38,045
Wu Bei and the others proposed

792
00:36:38,124 --> 00:36:39,644
raids against the righteous sects.

793
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,965
Yet Jiusu refused.

794
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:44,405
Despite his hatred
for the Ten Great Sects,

795
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:46,144
he rejected

796
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:47,284
this perfect opportunity.

797
00:36:47,724 --> 00:36:49,764
This reeks of suspicion.

798
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:52,000
Previously,

799
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,405
when the Ten Great Sects united,

800
00:36:54,204 --> 00:36:56,284
he seized every chance

801
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,405
to create as much chaos as possible.

802
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,045
Clearly,

803
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,616
now he's brewing

804
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,684
a grander scheme.

805
00:37:05,124 --> 00:37:06,164
I think so too.

806
00:37:07,204 --> 00:37:09,005
Yet he evaded

807
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:10,684
all my probes.

808
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:11,885
He feigned

809
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:13,124
sincerity and affection,

810
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,976
claiming to have found

811
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,352
a way to revive the Yueluo Clan.

812
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,764
He said he won't seek vengeance.

813
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:20,845
After countless clashes with him,

814
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,124
from what I've observed,

815
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:24,925
Jiusu plans meticulously.

816
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:26,965
If he hasn't told you

817
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:28,204
about his plan,

818
00:37:28,805 --> 00:37:30,525
he must be holding back something.

819
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:32,885
He's extremely cautious.

820
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:35,564
I've pressed him repeatedly.

821
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:36,564
But he insisted

822
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:38,084
that I cultivate with him

823
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,084
before he tells me

824
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,325
about his full plan.

825
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:41,764
So this time,

826
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:42,604
I want

827
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,365
to gauge his true intentions.

828
00:37:46,604 --> 00:37:47,124
But...

829
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,045
Never mind.

830
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:53,845
It's my own selfishness.

831
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,604
Stay out of danger.

832
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,124
I know the road ahead is perilous.

833
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,925
But constant refusal

834
00:38:02,284 --> 00:38:03,084
will eventually

835
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:04,965
test Jiusu's patience with me.

836
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:06,604
I'll appease him for now.

837
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:07,445
Don't worry.

838
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,204
I'll proceed with utmost care.

839
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:10,845
Remember.

840
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,564
If you notice anything suspicious,

841
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,045
don't act recklessly.
