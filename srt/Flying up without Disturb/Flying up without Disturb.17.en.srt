It's okay.

17
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,770
Brother,

18
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,690
I'm tired.

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,770
Please, stay here with me,

20
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,330
both you and Kong Hou.

21
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,651
Stay here with me.

22
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:23,571
What?

23
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,490
Brother, stay here

24
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,011
with me.

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,531
Because you got me killed.

26
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,171
You got me killed.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,650
If not for your actions,

28
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:37,930
I wouldn't have ended up

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,731
dying in your arms.

30
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,571
Dying in your arms.

31
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,451
The one who got me killed

32
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,330
is actually you.

33
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,571
Actually you.

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,770
You should stay here forever

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,090
and atone for your sins.

36
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,531
(I've actually forgotten)

37
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,490
(what I used to be like.)

38
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,851
(You weren't like this.)

39
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:09,890
(You haven't changed.)

40
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:11,210
(Execution)
(You never lost yourself)

41
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,370
(to power.)

42
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,090
(I'll definitely help you,)

43
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,370
no matter how hard it is.

44
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:16,691
(Huan Zong,)

45
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,050
(did you come to see me)

46
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,531
because you have remembered me?

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,251
(It hurts.)

48
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,691
(How could it not hurt?)

49
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:24,851
Though this is the inner demon realm,

50
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,971
(it still)

51
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:28,370
(hurts badly.)

52
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,691
(When you're ready for everything,)

53
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:32,971
(please tell me.)

54
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,571
I'll do anything for you.

55
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,251
Brother,

56
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,531
stay here.

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,291
I remember now.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,131
I remember everything.

59
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,971
What she said is true.

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,731
You're not my brother.

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,011
My brother would never

62
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,531
say such things.

63
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:07,090
What did you say?

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,131
You're not my brother at all.

65
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,490
This place

66
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,971
is my inner demon.

67
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,771
It's all fake.

68
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,050
Huan Zong.

69
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,690
Huan Zong.

70
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:30,690
Huan Zong.

71
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,091
You've finally overcome the inner demon.

72
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,731
You're finally recovering.

73
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,130
You're finally awake.

74
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,531
Do you know how I fear

75
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:39,130
you'd be trapped there forever?

76
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,851
You're finally awake.

77
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,731
Huan Zong,

78
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,531
you remembered me?

79
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,651
Look at my face and tell me.

80
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,010
Do you still remember me?

81
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,610
Of course, I remember you.

82
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,531
You know what?

83
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,291
When you were

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,731
in the imperial palace illusion,

85
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,851
you claimed not to know me.

86
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,771
Do you know how much that hurt me?

87
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,810
What's wrong?

88
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:11,891
Did I hit you too hard?

89
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,370
Are you unwell?

90
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,291
No.

91
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,091
Just feeling a bit uneasy.

92
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,130
Come sit closer

93
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,291
and let me hold you.

94
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:21,411
Alright.

95
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,331
Huan Zong.

96
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,050
Promise me.

97
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,250
You'll never forget me again,

98
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,531
okay?

99
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,411
I promise.

100
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:38,411
I won't forget you again.

101
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,411
You exhausted yourself

102
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,171
in that illusion.

103
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,690
I'll go find some spiritual fruit.

104
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,971
Do you want some water?

105
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:48,891
No.

106
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,130
Like I said,

107
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,731
just holding you will help.

108
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,050
Huan Zong.

109
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,771
You were...

110
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:00,930
You were never

111
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,490
like this before.

112
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:03,930
You...

113
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,171
How am I

114
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,250
different from before?

115
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,291
In the past,

116
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,690
no matter what happened,

117
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:14,490
you never spoke up.

118
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,930
You never expressed yourself.

119
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,291
That's because

120
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,490
within my inner demon,

121
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,010
I relived the pain of loss.

122
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,930
For centuries,

123
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,531
I thought I had forgotten.

124
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,130
Now, I just want to cherish the present.

125
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,050
So from now on,

126
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,291
no matter what happens,

127
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,411
we must be honest with each other.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,771
We can't let

129
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,130
unspoken words

130
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,450
lead to lifelong regrets.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,050
I promise you.

132
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,130
Who's there?

133
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,130
This child

134
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,690
looks like the Crown Prince.

135
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,091
How clever of you.

136
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,010
Dressing in my brother's clothes

137
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,211
to deceive me again?

138
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,930
Though truthfully,

139
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,291
failing to save those
around me back then

140
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,531
left me tormented with guilt.

141
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,651
So much that unknowingly,

142
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,690
it became my inner demon.

143
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,331
But it's different now.

144
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,330
Because someone has entered my life

145
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,330
who taught me

146
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,611
to embrace

147
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:37,251
life's simple joys,

148
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,771
release my obsessions,

149
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,491
learn self-acceptance,

150
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,090
and forgive myself.

151
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,491
Indeed,

152
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,891
the past can't be changed.

153
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,371
We must keep moving forward.

154
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,850
Huan Zong,

155
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,291
am I the person

156
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:55,891
you mentioned?

157
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,210
Of course, you are.

158
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,570
Kong Hou,

159
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,090
thank you truly.

160
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,810
Where are you going?

161
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,371
Now, tell us

162
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,330
what's going on.

163
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,090
500 years ago,

164
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,891
my master established a secret realm

165
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,090
beneath the cliffs.

166
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,330
(And I)

167
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,371
(am the key to open it.)

168
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,371
(My master also created)

169
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,491
(a barrier there.)

170
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,531
(It keeps this place)

171
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:28,930
(hidden from the world.)

172
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:30,411
(If anyone)

173
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:32,131
(intrudes seeking me,)

174
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,291
(they'll face their inner demons.)

175
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,011
To prevent thieves

176
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,970
from easily taking you,

177
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,371
now

178
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,891
I'll teach you to harness inner demons

179
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:47,531
to create illusions.

180
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:49,771
(Only by overcoming their inner demon)

181
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,050
(can one leave alive.)

182
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,491
(And only then)

183
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,891
(can my spell be broken)

184
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:54,850
(to obtain me)

185
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:56,371
(and open the secret realm.)

186
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,611
(Who could've guessed)

187
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:00,690
that in this world,

188
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,491
someone exists without inner demons?

189
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,611
My magic is formidable.

190
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,850
You two stayed there so long.

191
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,050
It felt real, didn't it?

192
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:13,730
You're feeling proud?

193
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,291
You nearly killed us.

194
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,291
Brat!

195
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,411
Right now, immediately,

196
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,251
remove this

197
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,210
foolish barrier

198
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,050
at once.

199
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:23,050
Take me with you, and I'll remove it.

200
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,210
I've been stuck here for 500 years,

201
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,330
dying of boredom.

202
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,251
You little kid,

203
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,450
hold out your hand.

204
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,131
Take this! And this!

205
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,611
Stop! Stop hitting!

206
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,930
I'll open the secret realm,

207
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,730
satisfied?

208
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,171
Aren't you just wanting

209
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,171
to enter the realm?

210
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,251
Not at all.

211
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,850
I fell fighting

212
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,651
dark cultivators.

213
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,491
I don't want to enter the secret realm.

214
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,330
And I'm here to find him.

215
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:46,611
I don't want

216
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,011
to go to some secret realm, either.

217
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,171
You two are so strange.

218
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,450
You have no interest in me.

219
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,251
Do you know

220
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:56,531
how many people risk their lives
seeking me out

221
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,611
just to enter the secret realm?

222
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,771
That secret realm

223
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:01,690
contains countless treasures.

224
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,651
People

225
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:05,011
scheme day and night to get them.

226
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,651
I've told you.

227
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,450
Remove

228
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,210
the stupid barrier.

229
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,651
Or I'll beat you again.

230
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,050
For centuries,

231
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,131
I've never met anyone like you two.

232
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,330
Do you know what the realm holds?

233
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:18,090
Sword manuals, cultivation techniques,

234
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,411
spiritual tools, treasures,

235
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:20,771
spiritual fruits, spirit herbs,

236
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,011
and even the legendary Merfolk Scale.

237
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,570
You mentioned the Merfolk Scale?

238
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:26,330
Yes.

239
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,411
I heard the Merfolk Scale
and the Cloudseeker Twig

240
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,730
were hidden by the same person.

241
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,771
If you know about the Merfolk Scale,

242
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,651
do you also know
where Cloudseeker Twig is?

243
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,930
Cloudseeker Twig?

244
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,210
I know it well.

245
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:39,891
The immortal used
to fiddle with it constantly.

246
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,651
You mean

247
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,970
Cloudseeker Twig is also in it?

248
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,651
Stop shaking me.

249
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:46,570
Shaking won't make it appear.

250
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,810
Just lift the magic.

251
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,970
We need to find Cloudseeker Twig
and Merfolk Scale.

252
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,611
The magic has been lifted.

253
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,970
Let's go back.

254
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:25,730
Okay.

255
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:29,810
Kong Hou,

256
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,450
(Liuguang Sect Branch)
look how dangerous it was.

257
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,690
Even if you escaped by luck,

258
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,330
tell me

259
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,491
if anything happened to you,

260
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:36,611
how could I face our sect?

261
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:38,891
My heart

262
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,651
is still pounding even now.

263
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:41,570
Tan Feng,

264
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,330
why bring this up now?

265
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,330
I'm telling you.

266
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,411
Once Huan Zong gets better,

267
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:46,570
we'll return to Yunhua Sect.

268
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,730
No delays!

269
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,611
Master has been

270
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:50,251
unreachable

271
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,251
without any reason.

272
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,450
I had no idea what to do,

273
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,450
almost going to the Head.

274
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:55,730
Tan Feng, that's excessive.

275
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,171
You're Yunhua Sect's

276
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:57,810
treasure,

277
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,411
the beloved one of me and Master.

278
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,131
If anything happened to you,

279
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:02,570
how could I go on living?

280
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,050
Lin Hu,

281
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,570
how is Huan Zong?

282
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,210
Don't worry.

283
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,371
All superficial wounds.

284
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:11,251
Nothing serious.

285
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,171
Good.

286
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,411
I'll go check on him.

287
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,730
Tan Feng, I-I...

288
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,891
I need to speak with you.

289
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:18,651
Let's check it out.

290
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,171
Let's go.

291
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,450
Why dragging me?

292
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,090
Kong Hou.

293
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:21,651
Kong Hou.

294
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,291
What "Kong Hou"?

295
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:22,810
This...

296
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,291
I have something for you.

297
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,171
What are you doing? What's this?

298
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,171
Why dragging me?

299
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:27,970
Are you colluding

300
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,131
with Huan Zong to separate me

301
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:30,050
from Kong Hou?

302
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,330
How could that be?

303
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,411
I really

304
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,330
have something for you.

305
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,171
What is it?

306
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:34,970
Show me.

307
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,810
What is it?

308
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:39,930
Come on, hurry!

309
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,251
- Senior Lin Hu.
- Senior Lin Hu.

310
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:42,251
Well,

311
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,171
let me introduce you.

312
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:43,771
This is

313
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,930
Senior Tan Feng from Yunhua Sect.

314
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,371
He's an expert

315
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:48,411
at infiltration.

316
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,050
You've wanted to learn infiltration?

317
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,570
Well,

318
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,730
here's your chance.

319
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,330
H-Hurry. Learn it now.

320
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,411
Senior Tan Feng,

321
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,491
we've long wished

322
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:56,570
- to learn infiltration.
- Exactly!

323
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,291
Come on.

324
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,291
Teach us.

325
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,011
Take Tan Feng

326
00:13:59,011 --> 00:13:59,771
around for a tour.

327
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,930
- Hurry!
- Let's go. Hurry!

328
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,570
Please teach us.

329
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,011
Thank you, Senior Tan Feng.

330
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:04,850
- Let's go.
- Come on.

331
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,411
Teach us.

332
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,131
Kong Hou!

333
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:16,930
Is anyone here?

334
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,011
Is anyone here?

335
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,570
Ling Bo?

336
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:27,771
Anyone here?

337
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:29,891
Ling Bo.

338
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:31,491
Ling...

339
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:32,531
Ling Bo, what's wrong?

340
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,291
My legs...

341
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,171
What happened?

342
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,730
Ling Bo. Ling Bo.

343
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:45,690
Why is it you?

344
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,330
Let me down!

345
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:47,690
You're awake.

346
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,810
It's okay.

347
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,810
Though I saved you,

348
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,131
don't get too emotional.

349
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:52,330
Listen carefully.

350
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,690
You mustn't tell anyone

351
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,450
about my injuries.

352
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,251
Still protecting your pride now?

353
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:58,850
Then tell me first

354
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,011
how you got injured.

355
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,810
Not talking?

356
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,050
Then I'll tell everyone

357
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,570
Lady Ling Bo was hurt and disgraced.

358
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,970
Put me down!

359
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,371
Put me down!

360
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,090
So you do feel pain.

361
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:15,131
Our Lady Ling Bo is truly impressive.

362
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,171
To outdo her senior,

363
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,651
she's even risking her life?

364
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,171
I...

365
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:20,611
I was simply

366
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,330
too eager chasing dark cultivators,

367
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,970
wanting to see

368
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,891
the situation below.

369
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,210
By your logic,

370
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,411
the entire Lingyou Realm

371
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,690
should thank you?

372
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,050
Are you done yet?

373
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:30,730
Let me tell you.

374
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,171
You don't know
how dangerous that place is.

375
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,491
Only Young Master

376
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,251
and Kong Hou,

377
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,011
the lucky one,

378
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,251
barely managed to escape.

379
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,330
You charged in blindly

380
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,611
without any knowledge.

381
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,570
Will you stop talking?

382
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,011
From the moment we returned,

383
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,570
you haven't stopped talking.

384
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:46,411
Let me tell you.

385
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,730
You were lucky

386
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,730
to fall into that mountain crevice.

387
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,531
Otherwise,

388
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,371
if that inner demon barrier

389
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:53,210
had taken you in,

390
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,371
you'd be dead already.

391
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:59,131
T-Thank you.

392
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:02,251
You're welcome.

393
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:04,850
Anyway,

394
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,930
I've already sent word

395
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,171
to your sect.

396
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:08,291
They should

397
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,891
send someone for you soon.

398
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,970
Well, Lin Hu!

399
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,891
You broke your promise!

400
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:12,850
- I...
- Didn't you promise

401
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,291
- not to tell anyone?
- Wait.

402
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,011
You told me not to tell others.

403
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,371
I just told your sect members.

404
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:19,570
Those are your own people.

405
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,090
Rest properly now.

406
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,011
I'm leaving.

407
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:24,611
Huan Zong,

408
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,970
you're finally awake.

409
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,651
Do I look that weak?

410
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,530
You do look rather...

411
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,290
What?

412
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:36,210
Don't want me to take care of you?

413
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,450
Then I'll leave.

414
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:40,930
I need to talk to you.

415
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:41,811
Sit.

416
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,210
You want me to take care of you, right?

417
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:47,730
Go ahead.

418
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,651
You already can play

419
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,371
the phoenix-headed konghou now?

420
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,571
Well...

421
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,210
Yes.

422
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,450
Why are you staring at me like that?

423
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,730
Is there something on my face?

424
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,411
No.

425
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,490
How did you manage to play it?

426
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,770
(Have you ever considered)

427
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,571
why you could play it?

428
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,250
I don't know, either.

429
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,651
No matter how I pleaded with it before,

430
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,250
it never responded.

431
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,010
It never gave me an inch before.

432
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,611
I have no clue

433
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,250
why it's acting differently this time.

434
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,411
Could it be because this time

435
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,290
you genuinely wanted to save me?

436
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,970
Of course.

437
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,811
We're good friends.

438
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,051
Of course, I wholeheartedly

439
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,210
wanted to save you.

440
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,490
But

441
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,210
what does that have to do with playing

442
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,210
phoenix-headed konghou?

443
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:46,730
This spiritual tool
senses your intentions.

444
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,891
That's why it resonated with you.

445
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,091
You wanted to save me,

446
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:51,730
so the konghou

447
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,051
sounded for my sake.

448
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,290
That makes sense.

449
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,690
Are we

450
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:02,970
just friends?

451
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:05,690
Well...

452
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:07,770
Of course, we are.

453
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:08,970
We're

454
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,811
very close friends.

455
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:18,770
Then let me make it clear.

456
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,651
I never intended

457
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:22,010
to just be your close friend.

458
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,371
Did you hear my conversation

459
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,290
with Tan Feng?

460
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:32,571
You...

461
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,171
What did you and Tan Feng

462
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,530
talk about?

463
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,171
I don't know.

464
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,730
You didn't hear anything?

465
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,811
I thought it was because

466
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:43,730
our hearts are connected.

467
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,290
The phoenix-headed konghou

468
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,450
sounded for me.

469
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,930
Not just because

470
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,891
we're friends.

471
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,571
(Huan Zong is really...)

472
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,210
(Who asks like this?)

473
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,010
(How should I respond?)

474
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,250
I told Tan Feng

475
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,811
I like you.

476
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,250
Based on your reaction,

477
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,811
it seems you don't like me.

478
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,091
Then if you don't like me,

479
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,651
why did you tell me those things?

480
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:15,210
I...

481
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:18,051
What did I say?

482
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,811
You said it yourself.

483
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,210
You'd take responsibility

484
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:22,411
and protect me.

485
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,051
I...

486
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:27,811
I did say

487
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,571
I'd protect you.

488
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,530
But

489
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,970
when did I ever say

490
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,770
I'd take responsibility for you?

491
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,851
So you agree then?

492
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:37,371
To protect me.

493
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,530
I...

494
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,811
I didn't mean that.

495
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,490
Y-You're twisting my words.

496
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,371
I never said that.

not count?

501
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,331
They count.

502
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,770
I will definitely protect you.

503
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,891
I'll keep my word.

00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,371
Young Master,

510
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,331
you've been in good spirits lately.

511
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,770
Do you and Kong Hou...

512
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:50,930
Young Master.

513
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,450
What's on your mind?

514
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,930
Kong Hou and I found a lead.

515
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:58,730
Merfolk Scale is in the secret realm.

516
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,730
Merfolk Scale?

517
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,970
The secret realm
contains the Merfolk Scale?

518
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:02,811
We came to Fengyi

519
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:03,770
for Cloudseeker Twig.

520
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,770
Now Merfolk Scale too?

521
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,450
That's perfect.

522
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,651
So next,

523
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:07,851
head to the secret realm?

524
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:08,490
Yes.

525
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:11,051
But dark cultivators
must have heard too.

526
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:11,851
So we need to talk

527
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:12,770
to the major sects

528
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,970
and go there together.

529
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,331
Dark cultivators want
to enter the secret realm.

530
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,131
There must be

531
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,411
something they want inside.

532
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,530
And it's no ordinary item.

533
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,250
But the two old fools Wu Xi and Wu Bei

534
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,331
still refuse to talk.

535
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,811
They merely follow

536
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,290
Jiusu's orders like puppets.

537
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,450
But Jiusu's true motives

538
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,131
would never be shared with them.

539
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,250
Yes.

540
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,690
By current calculations,

541
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,490
they should reach the sect soon.

542
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:34,930
How the sect will handle this?

543
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,930
Liuguang Sect never shirks duty.

544
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:39,970
The secret realm will be opened.

545
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,490
- My lord, welcome back from seclusion.
- My lord, welcome back from seclusion.

546
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,690
I hear during my seclusion,

547
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,770
your two brothers got captured

548
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,371
and were thoroughly beaten.

549
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:09,450
What?

550
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,290
Haven't rescued them yet?

551
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,851
Liuguang Sect came prepared.

552
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,891
Not only did the rescue fail,

553
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:18,171
we lost several key fighters.

554
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,730
Why save those incompetents?

555
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,611
They failed the Lord's

556
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:21,490
assigned tasks.

557
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,571
The secret realm's key

558
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:23,571
was also taken by those

559
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:24,450
righteous fools.

560
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,371
Actually, I should thank them.

561
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,210
They retrieved the key swiftly.

562
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,290
It seems Lingyou Realm

563
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,010
breeds talents.

564
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,051
- I've failed you.
- I've failed you.

565
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,290
My Lord,

566
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,290
please grant me reinforcements,

567
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,530
and I'll reclaim the key

568
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,530
for you.

569
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,051
Reclaim what?

570
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:45,851
You want

571
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:47,210
to end up like your brothers,

572
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,970
beaten and imprisoned again?

573
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:54,571
Alright.

574
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,930
As long as the secret realm opens,

575
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:59,131
who holds the key matters not.

576
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,851
You may leave.

577
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,891
Yes.

578
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,651
My Lord,

579
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:12,250
one more report.

580
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,171
Other matters don't concern me,

581
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:18,250
but when it comes

582
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,171
to Kong Hou, I must intervene.

583
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:21,290
I asked you before

584
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,690
to recall her, but you refused.

585
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,851
Now she barely made it out

586
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,091
of the inner demon realm.

587
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,811
How dare you say that?

588
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,210
Where were you earlier?

589
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,290
When your disciple vanished,

590
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,131
you vanished too.

591
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,730
You criticize me?

592
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:36,571
You're fooling around all day,

593
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:37,770
cuddling that mangy cat.

594
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,331
Do you even know where

595
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:40,010
Ling Hui is?

596
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,210
Of course, I know.

597
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,371
What's wrong with my cat?

598
00:24:42,371 --> 00:24:43,331
Then where is she?

599
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:45,490
- Not your concern.
- Where? Tell me where!

600
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,171
Not your concern.

601
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:47,091
Speak! Where is she?

602
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,690
Enough!

603
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,051
Kong Hou's a clever girl.

604
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,051
This journey has honed her well.

605
00:24:59,051 --> 00:25:00,530
She can even control

606
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,770
her natal spiritual tool now.

607
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:02,770
When kids grow up,

608
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,131
they develop their own thoughts.

609
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,210
Let's ask her

610
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,250
whether she's willing to return first.

611
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,930
About Liuguang Sect inviting
the Ten Great Sects

612
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,490
to discuss opening the secret realm,

613
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:17,690
we need

614
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,970
to decide quickly.

615
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:20,250
Elder Qiu Shuang,

616
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,611
what do you think?

617
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:24,611
Open it.

618
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,611
We already obtained the key.

619
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,331
Why wouldn't we open it?

620
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,490
This secret realm was discovered
over 1,000 years ago

621
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,290
by Immortal Bo Yuan of Jiufeng Sect

622
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,091
before ascension.

623
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:35,091
It's a land

624
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,730
abundant with spiritual veins.

625
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,690
Legends say it contains
various spirit herbs

626
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,811
and treasures.

627
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,450
The dark cultivators' goal

628
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,091
must be the treasures in it.

629
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,651
In that case,

630
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,891
we'll await them

631
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:48,851
in the secret realm.

632
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:52,811
Liuguang Sect shares this intent.

633
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,891
They propose that heads
of the Ten Great Sects

634
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,811
and the Rogue Cultivator Alliance

635
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,371
dispatch suitable representatives

636
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,930
to enter the secret realm together.

637
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,250
However,

638
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,450
we must maintain

639
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,690
utmost vigilance.

640
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,851
Today's dark cultivators

641
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,690
aren't mindless fools.

642
00:26:13,891 --> 00:26:14,571
Junior,

643
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:16,290
look.

644
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,730
Should we

645
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,651
send more gifts

646
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:19,891
to Yunhua Sect

647
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:20,970
to demonstrate

648
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,411
Liuguang Sect's sincerity?

649
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,490
Lady Kong Hou

650
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,530
has repeatedly

651
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,611
saved Zhong Xi.

652
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,970
Earlier in Yunhua Sect's
Forbidden Forest...

653
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,171
Don't worry.

654
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,811
I already delivered them.

655
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,210
Good.

656
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,210
But reflecting on it,

657
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,490
this girl from Yunhua Sect

658
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,450
truly has remarkable character
and courage.

659
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,811
She actually rescued Zhong Xi

660
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:49,331
from the inner demon realm.

661
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,331
This isn't just about good character

662
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:52,131
or courage.

663
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,411
Countless dark cultivators
and puppets descended

664
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:55,811
with none returning.

665
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,331
Yet she still chose to save Zhong Xi.

666
00:27:02,411 --> 00:27:03,490
Back then,

667
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:05,891
when Lingyou Realm's forces were chaotic

668
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,930
and demons ran rampant,

669
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:10,970
I'd just assumed leadership

670
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,651
and panicked initially.

671
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,411
Observing Zhong Xi's

672
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,490
extraordinary potential,

673
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,690
I relentlessly pushed his cultivation

674
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,490
but failed to consider

675
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,051
his recent familial loss.

676
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:23,371
This forged

677
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,611
his current temperament.

678
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,411
Yet now,

679
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:28,851
he's found

680
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:30,970
such a devoted companion.

681
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,411
Senior,

682
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,010
things will improve.

683
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:36,250
But recently,

684
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,450
Zhong Xi's condition...

685
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,051
This time,

686
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,891
we must obtain the Cloudseeker Twig

687
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,091
and Merfolk Scale.

688
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:49,970
We will.

689
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,091
We definitely will.

690
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,730
Much better now.

691
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:04,371
Coming.

692
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,331
Ma...

693
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:09,611
Mother,

694
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:10,690
what brings you here?

695
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,811
What do you think?

696
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,490
Come, sit inside.

697
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,891
Mother, I've missed you terribly.

698
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:22,730
Let me pour you tea.

699
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:27,651
You called me "Mother" today,

700
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:29,010
not "Master".

701
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,651
It seems you acknowledge your mistake.

702
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:35,051
I know I was wrong.

703
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,851
You really made me angry.

704
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,091
I received Liuguang Sect's
messenger talisman,

705
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:42,770
saying you almost died in...

706
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,571
How's your leg?

707
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:47,690
It's fine.

708
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,131
That person who sent you

709
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:49,811
the talisman

710
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,051
is the most unreliable one.

711
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,091
He always lies.

712
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:53,530
It is just a flesh wound here.

713
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,530
It'll heal soon enough.

714
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,490
He did save you after all.

715
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,851
Moreover, this time,

716
00:28:57,851 --> 00:28:59,450
you were too reckless.

717
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:01,930
So what's your decision?

718
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:03,851
Do you accept responsibility or not?

719
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:04,571
I accept.

720
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,371
I accept.

721
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,210
Then stay in seclusion for a few days.

722
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,651
Use this time for self-reflection.

723
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:12,331
But a few days later,
the secret realm...

724
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,131
In your current state,
can you handle it?

725
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,210
Why not?

726
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:15,811
Look!

727
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:18,651
I'm fine.

728
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:19,571
I can even jump.

729
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,091
Mother,

730
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,970
please let me go.

731
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,411
Fine.

732
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:31,730
You'll lead the team then.

733
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,770
Really?

734
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:36,051
What about Senior Chang De?

735
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:38,051
He is also injured.

736
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:38,690
Really?

737
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,250
You...

738
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:42,490
Is he okay?

739
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,290
You're equally reckless.

740
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:47,930
He can't even get out of bed now.

741
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,611
He'll need several days to recover.

742
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:51,490
Now, we have no choice but to send you.

743
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,651
You must exercise extreme caution.

744
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:54,851
I see.

745
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:57,331
I hope Senior Chang De recovers soon.

746
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,411
Mother, have some tea.

747
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,091
What's wrong?

748
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,210
There's news from the sect.

749
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,371
They'll open the realm.

750
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:17,970
My master said

751
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,851
the secret realm has

752
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,051
nothing to do with Kong Hou.

753
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,851
He ordered me

754
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:22,930
to bring her back

755
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,530
to Yunhua Sect without delay.

756
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,651
Tan Feng,

757
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:27,611
Huan Zong and I already agreed

758
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:28,851
to look for the herbs together.

759
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:30,571
I can't break our agreement.

760
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:31,530
- Tan Feng.
- No rush.

761
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,051
Let Tan Feng finish speaking.

762
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:34,411
Yes.

763
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:35,690
Take a cue from Huan Zong.

764
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,930
Be more composed and less impulsive.

765
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:39,690
Tell me.

766
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,051
Is there a possibility

767
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,530
that when I got the talisman,

768
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,490
you two had already departed?

769
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:46,970
Or perhaps

770
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,690
accidentally,

771
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,690
I lost track of you?

772
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,970
Tan Feng.

773
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,331
Putting it that way,

774
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,250
you're quite brilliant.

775
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,250
That's a good idea.

776
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:58,171
Moreover,

777
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:00,091
only Tan Feng
can pull this off successfully.

778
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,730
Indeed, Kong Hou.

779
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,331
Use your brain and some cleverness.

780
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:06,411
Huan Zong,

781
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,051
we can go search for Merfolk Scale

782
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,690
and Cloudseeker Twig together.

783
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,571
Aren't you happy?

784
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:11,411
Yes, I am.

785
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:16,091
I'm still here.

786
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:22,171
I never expected this foolish girl

787
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,131
to possess such exceptional
spiritual roots.

788
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,091
If we could harness her talents
for our cause,

789
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:29,331
that would be nice.

790
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,611
But now,

791
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:35,250
she's closely aligned with Zhong Xi.

792
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,730
They're practically inseparable.

793
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,891
I truly

794
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,450
can't find any opportunity to act.

795
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,171
I implore your guidance, My Lord.

796
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,331
No wonder you Wu brothers

797
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,851
remain single your whole lives.

798
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:46,131
What's her relationship

799
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,331
with Master Zhong Xi?

800
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,730
Then what should we do?

801
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,730
Are there any options?

802
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,411
But if

803
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,930
we can't recruit her to our side,

804
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,930
when her seal gets lifted in the future

805
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,450
and she joins forces with Zhong Xi...

806
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,290
I will keep her

807
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,891
alive until then?

808
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:06,371
Which sect's fellow cultivator
has arrived?

809
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:08,770
It's Lady Ling Bo.

810
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,490
Lady Ling Bo. We meet again.

811
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,770
Kong Hou.

812
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,851
Huan Zong.

813
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,051
Tan Feng.

814
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,051
I presume you all

815
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:23,051
have received the news.

816
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,010
We have.

817
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,611
Gather at Secret Realm Valley.

818
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,851
How surprising, Lady Ling Bo.

819
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:30,730
After such a big incident,

820
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,210
your master still lets you out?

821
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,290
She seems to trust you.

822
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,010
Shut up.

823
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,690
What do you mean "shut up"?

824
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,250
You greeted everyone

825
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,171
but skipped me.

826
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,091
Why did you do that?

827
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,530
Fellow cultivators,

828
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,091
we'll meet at the secret realm.

829
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:46,490
The cosmetic powder's scent

830
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,970
remains utterly intoxicating.

831
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,411
Between you two,

832
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,490
is there anything going on?

833
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,530
Nothing at all.

834
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,010
I'll settle this with you next time.

835
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,371
When's next time?

836
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:01,450
Go on, tell me.

837
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,811
Lin Hu,

838
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,571
once this secret realm opens,

839
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,091
dark cultivators might infiltrate.

840
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,411
Don't worry, Young Master.

841
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:08,730
No dark cultivators will get in.

842
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,770
Let me tell you.

843
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,210
It's rare for ten sects

844
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,530
to enter the realm together.

845
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,450
How can you collaborate like this?

846
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,131
Zhaohan Sect's Lady Ling Bo

847
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:16,970
is famed far.

848
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,331
Offer her more support.
Resolve the misunderstanding.

849
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,490
Okay.

850
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,131
Yes.

851
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:22,250
She's impulsive by nature.

852
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,331
Keep an eye on her.

853
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,530
Got it.

854
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:26,411
Let's go then.

855
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,891
Kong Hou!

856
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:37,010
- Tan Feng
- Ling Hui.

857
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:37,930
Huan Zong.

858
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,571
Go ahead.

859
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,051
Kong Hou, Tan Feng.

860
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:43,331
Ling Hui.

861
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:44,891
- Ling Hui.
- Kong Hou.

862
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:46,371
I've missed you so much.

863
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,091
Why did the sect

864
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,970
send you this time?

865
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,250
It's a long story.

866
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:50,611
In all my years,

867
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,371
even when chasing

868
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:52,371
new cosmetic ingredients,

869
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:53,571
I've never traveled this far.

870
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:54,891
Kong Hou,

871
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,331
why not return to the sect?

872
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:57,530
You master worries about you

873
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,010
and told me to bring you back.

874
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,811
I...

875
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,411
I have unfinished business here.

876
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:03,530
Business?

877
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,451
What's going on here?

878
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,890
I promised him

879
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,730
to accompany him

880
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,330
to search for herbs in the secret realm.

881
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,890
Kong Hou, you catch up.

882
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,770
We will

883
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,370
rest there.

884
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,051
Let's go.

885
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,890
Search for herbs?

886
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,131
Is this really about searching

887
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:31,370
or...

888
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:32,730
Lady Kong Hou.

889
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,250
Jin Ling, Zhou Xiao.

890
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,290
Pastries for you.

891
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,850
Thank you for saving me before.

892
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,131
Kong Hou,

893
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,451
don't take their offerings.

894
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,451
It could be a trap.

895
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:46,730
Who knows if they still

896
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,051
collude with dark cultivators?

897
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:48,730
Why did you

898
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,611
come this time?

899
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,410
Where's Master Shuang Qing?

900
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,210
I've heard all

901
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,131
about his noble deeds.

902
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,370
My master

903
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,210
was misguided back then.

904
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,491
Misguided?

905
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,250
A momentary lapse can cost lives.

906
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,011
She didn't give you trouble

907
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:04,250
because she's generous.

908
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:05,410
Don't think Yunhua Sect

909
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,131
is easy to bully.

910
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,971
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

911
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:14,011
You two.

912
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,051
What are you doing?

913
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,730
This charade of yours

914
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,730
makes us look like bullies.

915
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:24,410
That's not what we meant.

916
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,330
We sincerely came to apologize.

917
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,531
Our past actions

918
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,451
are indeed inexcusable.

919
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,171
However,

920
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,210
we will

921
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,290
soon get married.

922
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,370
We've agreed

923
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,531
that coming to this realm

924
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:39,011
is our way to earn forgiveness

925
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,451
through our actions.

926
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:44,491
Cultivators don't dwell on trivialities.

927
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,651
No need to explain.

928
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:46,491
I know it all.

929
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:49,011
As for these pastries,

930
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:50,690
I happen to enjoy them.

931
00:35:58,362 --> 00:36:00,576
(Heaven and Earth's Desolation)

932
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:07,424
(Heaven and Earth's Desolation)

933
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:15,611
Lady Ling Bo,

934
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,850
we'll entrust this matter to you.

935
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,850
Fellow cultivators,

936
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,410
I'm Ling Bo from Zhaohan Sect.

937
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:33,210
After consultation among elders,

938
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,890
I'll preside over this gathering.

939
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,571
Lady Ling Bo.

940
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,210
I also seek your assistance.

941
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,850
This secret realm expedition
holds great peril.

942
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,051
Dark cultivators lurk outside.

943
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:41,890
We must stay alert.

944
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:42,690
Therefore,

945
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,171
the major sects

946
00:36:44,931 --> 00:36:45,690
have decided

947
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,810
to have some of us here

948
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,091
to guard the entrance.

949
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,091
Others will enter via lottery

950
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,531
for realm access.

951
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:54,931
Those drawing enter tokens

952
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,250
may enter the secret realm.

953
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,890
Those drawing stay tokens

954
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,890
will remain on guard.

955
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,091
We must draw enter tokens!

956
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:03,651
I'm certain we'll draw

957
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:04,730
the enter tokens.

958
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,690
I'm with Lady Ling Bo.

959
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:09,091
Agreed. That works.

960
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,410
Okay.

961
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:11,890
We'll follow Lady Ling Bo's lead.

962
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,410
