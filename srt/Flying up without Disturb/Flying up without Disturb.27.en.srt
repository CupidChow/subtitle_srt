=Episode 27=

16
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:58,724
(To sever ties with me,)

17
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:00,643
(Kong Hou staged that act
before everyone.)

18
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,044
(Without this bracelet,)

19
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,324
(if her dark cultivator blood)

20
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:04,084
(erupts...)

21
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:05,324
(No.)

22
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:06,720
(I must find a way)

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,003
(to give her the bracelet.)

24
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:11,803
So,

25
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,643
they are indeed dark cultivators.

26
00:02:16,643 --> 00:02:17,664
Lin Hu.

27
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:19,963
This world

28
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:21,923
isn't simply black and white.

29
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:24,004
The world and the people

30
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,444
are both complex.

31
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:27,564
I've been thinking.

32
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:29,963
Have I been wrong

33
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:32,963
all these years?

34
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:34,604
No.

35
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,124
You did nothing wrong.

36
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,164
But

37
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,884
we all need to grow.

38
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:41,963
Besides,

39
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,808
you've matured so much.

40
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:44,803
You won't treat me

41
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,243
the same way you did before.

42
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,164
And you don't believe

43
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,363
that Kong Hou is a dark cultivator.

44
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,564
And you changed the way

45
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:52,203
you do things.

46
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:53,504
You no longer rigidly

47
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:54,444
aim for the goal.

48
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:56,164
You care more about the underlying

49
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:57,284
significance.

50
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:58,004
Right?

51
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,483
So,

52
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,856
you're saying that

53
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,203
I'm on the right track?

54
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:08,803
Yes, absolutely.

55
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:14,164
So, was I

56
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,444
annoying in the past?

57
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:18,004
In the past?

58
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,200
Yes, you were annoying.

59
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,124
Just kidding.

60
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:24,643
Of course not.

61
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:25,643
Ling Bo,

62
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,083
you've always been nice.

63
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,483
Really?

64
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,284
Yeah.

65
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:31,923
You've always been nice.

66
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:32,643
And

67
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:35,124
you'll keep improving.

68
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,643
Do you believe

69
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,592
that Kong Hou is a dark cultivator?

70
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,324
What about you?

71
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,763
I did believe it.

72
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:47,904
But now,

73
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:49,963
I'm not sure.

74
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,724
So what will you do

75
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:54,560
next?

76
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:58,496
I'll visit the Yunhua Sect.

77
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:01,124
Yunhua Sect?

78
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:18,604
Did you suddenly summon everyone

79
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:19,964
for something urgent?

80
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,044
Yes, Your Eminence.

81
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:23,443
There is something urgent.

82
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:25,204
We have been progressing

83
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:26,483
smoothly in cultivation.

84
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:27,872
Thanks to Your Eminence,

85
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:30,404
the Ascension Array I've been refining

86
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,604
is nearly complete.

87
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,644
Congratulations, Your Eminence, My Lord.

88
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,512
Congratulations, Your Eminence, My Lord.

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,696
(Ascension Array?)

90
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:39,072
(That was fast.)

91
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:43,968
Congratulations, Jiusu.

92
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:45,363
But

93
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:46,624
why didn't you announce

94
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,128
such grand news earlier?

95
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,856
I hadn't found the chance.

96
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,584
Forgive my delay, Kong Hou.

97
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,084
I propose we hold

98
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,363
an Ascension Ceremony

99
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,664
for this occasion

100
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,123
and invite delegates

101
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:00,416
from the Ten Great Sects

102
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,724
to witness our glory.

103
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,240
- I think...
- Rest assured.

104
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,352
With my current cultivation,

105
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,724
I can totally handle those old men

106
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,243
of the righteous sects.

107
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,084
Give the command,

108
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:16,224
and I'll bring them here.

109
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:17,568
Those who defy us

110
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,164
shall perish.

111
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,803
- Perish!
- Perish!

112
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:24,160
- Perish!
- Perish!

113
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:25,683
Alright.

114
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,424
In that case,

115
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:30,323
why don't you let me

116
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,584
prepare

117
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,728
for the Ascension Ceremony in person?

118
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,672
You will prepare for it?

119
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:37,923
Of course.

120
00:05:38,243 --> 00:05:40,032
This is a grand event.

121
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,524
I wouldn't

122
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,656
entrust it to others.

123
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,844
You're absolutely right.

124
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:47,524
Family members are the most trustworthy.

125
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:48,964
Then it's settled.

126
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:49,844
Jiusu,

127
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:51,803
focus on refining the array.

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,964
Leave this matter

129
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,764
to me.

130
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,616
You four, come with me.

131
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,164
My lord,

132
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:11,683
will you really

133
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:13,204
let Kong Hou do this alone?

134
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,644
What if she joins hands with

135
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:16,764
Zhong Xi

136
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,044
and sabotages the upcoming

137
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:18,764
ceremony?

138
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,243
Zhong Xi.

139
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:23,404
I'm counting on him showing up.

140
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,600
If he dares to come...

141
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:38,084
Come with me.

142
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:39,104
Why are you here?

143
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,524
I think they all left.

144
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,448
Better to stay cautious.

145
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:55,084
Are you

146
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:55,904
alright?

147
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,683
I had to

148
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,136
act that way.

149
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,280
These past days, I've been

150
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,604
recuperating at Fengyi.

151
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:03,456
Has Jiusu

152
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:04,832
given you trouble?

153
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:06,284
No.

154
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:08,084
I've been avoiding him lately.

155
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,664
That's how I've been managing.

156
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:12,128
Okay, I'll make it short.

157
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:14,644
You must keep

158
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,000
this bead bracelet.

159
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:18,164
When your dark cultivator blood

160
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,404
erupts

161
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:20,204
and causes pain,

162
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:21,443
it'll suppress it.

163
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,404
You took a huge risk

164
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:26,720
just to come

165
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:28,736
and give me this?

166
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,644
This bracelet

167
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,792
isn't a permanent solution.

168
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:35,123
But I know

169
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,323
another artifact

170
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:37,003
that can

171
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,683
suppress your dark cultivator blood.

172
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:39,808
Soul Anchoring Lamp.

173
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,683
It calms the heart's flames

174
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:42,923
and steadies the mind.

175
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,164
A permanent remedy.

176
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,856
Soul Anchoring Lamp.

177
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:49,152
Does it truly exist?

178
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,328
You're not sacrificing your soul

179
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,056
or vital essence again

180
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,880
to craft it for me, right?

181
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,044
Don't lie to me again.

182
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:57,764
I'm so scared...

183
00:07:57,764 --> 00:07:58,656
Of course not.

184
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:00,443
I'm standing right here,

185
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,724
perfectly fine.

186
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:02,923
Besides,

187
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,164
that lamp truly exists.

188
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:05,964
And I'll find it for you.

189
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,844
Alright then.

190
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:11,200
It's getting late.

191
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:12,724
I have to go.

192
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,683
Anyway, remember.

193
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,480
Your safety comes first.

194
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:17,764
Don't...

195
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,656
Kong Hou.

196
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,683
When I was trapped
in my inner demon realm,

197
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,584
you never abandoned me.

198
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,563
Now I'll do the same.

199
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:27,936
I won't give up on you.

200
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:31,404
I'll see you again.

201
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:16,404
Your Eminence, you're distracted.

202
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,760
Our cultivation is finally...

203
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:21,923
Your Eminence,

204
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,160
what was on your mind?

205
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:25,484
Is there something

206
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:26,963
more important than restoring

207
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:28,563
our Yueluo clan's glory?

208
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:29,920
I know my priorities.

209
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,083
I'm tired.

210
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,764
I'll retire to rest.

211
00:09:56,923 --> 00:09:57,843
What's wrong?

212
00:09:58,443 --> 00:09:59,963
I sent my people

213
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,244
to follow our Sovereign today

214
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,336
without your permission.

215
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:05,044
Please don't blame me, my lord.

216
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:07,392
Did you find anything?

217
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:08,683
Our Sovereign

218
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,083
met Zhong Xi again.

219
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:11,616
She met with Zhong Xi?

220
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:12,864
My trusted subordinate

221
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:14,683
lost track of them midway.

222
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:16,484
But he clearly saw

223
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,304
our Supreme with Zhong Xi.

224
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,603
I'm worried that

225
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,484
Zhong Xi might disturb our Sovereign
and hinder her cultivation.

226
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,000
To prevent complications,

227
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,723
we should kill Zhong Xi.

228
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,128
Killing him is easy.

229
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:29,963
But unless Kong Hou

230
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,323
completely forgets him,

231
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:33,024
she might resent me.

232
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:35,723
After all, I'm her only brother.

233
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:36,723
What should we do?

234
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,176
Ascension Ceremony is approaching.

235
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:39,443
We still need Kong Hou's

236
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:40,963
Phoenix Essence.

237
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:43,723
We can't afford mistakes now.

238
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,923
Attend to your duties.

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,484
I have my plans.

240
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:48,843
Understood.

241
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:57,244
Xiao Pei.

242
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:00,923
Lord Jiusu.

243
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,832
How has Her Eminence
been sleeping lately?

244
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,923
Quite...

245
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:07,884
Quite well.

246
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,216
Serve her carefully.

247
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:10,592
Or you know

248
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,256
the consequences.

249
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:13,963
Understood.

250
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:14,624
I will

251
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,044
serve Her Eminence diligently.

252
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,083
You may leave.

253
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,923
Understood.

254
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,480
(That was the Qibao Hollow Bell.)

255
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:42,484
Xiao Pei.

256
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:48,404
Forgive me, Your Eminence.

257
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:52,563
What's wrong?

258
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,244
Is something troubling you?

259
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:55,764
You seem distracted.

260
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,963
I saw Lord Jiusu

261
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,400
heading to the secret chamber

262
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,524
with the Qibao Hollow Bell.

263
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,203
Qibao Hollow Bell?

264
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,524
It's an artifact

265
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:10,244
that extracts people's memories.

266
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,083
I once

267
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,603
saw Lord Jiusu

268
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,963
extracting someone's memories

269
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:15,203
with that item.

270
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:18,044
And then?

271
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,083
That person

272
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,056
became like a mindless corpse.

273
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,044
He obeyed orders

274
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,648
that told him to act like a dog.

275
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:26,848
Qibao Hollow Bell.

276
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,603
(Where did Jiusu hide)

277
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,563
(the Qibao Hollow Bell?)

278
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:43,364
(A wooden box.)

279
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,644
(A silent bell.)

280
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,203
What is this?

281
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:29,056
Where am I?

282
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,124
- Kong Hou.
- Mother.

283
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:31,203
Where are you?

284
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:32,124
- Kong Hou.
- Mother.

285
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,644
- Mother, I'm here.
- Come out.

286
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:34,592
Kong Hou!

287
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,443
Kong Hou! Where are you?

288
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:38,124
Where are you?

289
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:38,843
Mother.

290
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,164
Mother, I'm here.

291
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:51,843
Zhong Xi.

292
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:57,244
Mother.

293
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,244
No.

294
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,016
Mother.

295
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,083
No way.

296
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,683
This can't be real.

297
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:19,963
This can't be real.

298
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:22,004
It was you.

299
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:24,672
No one else

300
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:28,083
could wield the Dragon's Roar Sword.

301
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,603
Even in an illusion,

302
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,644
this remains true.

303
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:35,104
Only you can command it.

304
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:37,484
It was you.

305
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,203
You killed my mother.

306
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:42,124
It was you!

307
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:44,603
Lord Jiusu is coming.

308
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:45,644
We must leave.

309
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:50,963
My lord.

310
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:53,056
What a genius move.

311
00:14:54,524 --> 00:14:57,323
But what if she doesn't believe it?

312
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,784
It's better if she believes it.

313
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,544
Otherwise,

314
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:02,723
I have other measures.

315
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,203
What's the purpose

316
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,603
of this move, my lord?

317
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,364
No more questions.

318
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:08,723
You'll find out soon enough.

319
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:10,083
Understood.

320
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,443
Your wisdom prevails.

321
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:12,443
I believe

322
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:13,083
that soon

323
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,880
you will achieve all your goals.

324
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,264
How's it going with the Yunhua Sect?

325
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:20,524
Our people

326
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,244
have besieged the Yunhua Sect for days.

327
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:23,712
But they won't even open up.

328
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,203
In my opinion,

329
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:26,323
we should strike now

330
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,524
to eradicate them

331
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,152
and show the Ten Great Sects

332
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:29,884
our might.

333
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:31,284
Do you know

334
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,923
why I want them here?

335
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,044
To intimidate
the Ten Great Sects, naturally.

336
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,048
The Ascension Array requires

337
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,443
hundreds of vibrant young disciples

338
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:41,484
from righteous sects

339
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,364
at peak strength

340
00:15:43,364 --> 00:15:44,323
as fuel.

341
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:45,824
If we kill them all,

342
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:48,203
what will power the array?

343
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,443
Now I get it.

344
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:52,736
Make them surrender disciples.

345
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,963
If they refuse,

346
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,124
I have plenty of ways

347
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,364
to make them comply.

348
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,323
(Yunhua Sect)

349
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:01,323
I wonder how Kong Hou

350
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:02,272
is doing there.

351
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:03,644
Will Jiusu

352
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:04,563
hurt her?

353
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,164
Indeed.

354
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:06,603
Jiusu is vile and treacherous.

355
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:08,044
If he intends to hurt Kong Hou,

356
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,164
can she handle it

357
00:16:09,164 --> 00:16:10,244
on her own?

358
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:11,323
Kong Hou is smart.

359
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,404
She will keep herself safe.

360
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,044
Besides, Jiusu is her brother.

361
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,284
She'll be safe for now.

362
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:17,923
However...

363
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:18,843
However what?

364
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:19,843
Wang Tong.

365
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:20,843
Wang Tong.

366
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:21,764
Master.

367
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:22,244
Wang Tong.

368
00:16:22,244 --> 00:16:22,963
Elder Qiu Shuang.

369
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,404
Why did you come?

370
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,563
Master Heng Yan is suddenly

371
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:26,884
undergoing tribulation.

372
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,603
We came to discuss strategies.

373
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:30,323
Dark cultivators have besieged us

374
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,284
for over ten days,

375
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,603
harassing us constantly.

376
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:34,603
Master Heng Yan
is undergoing tribulation.

377
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:35,364
We...

378
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,484
I knew

379
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:37,764
I sensed something.

380
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,603
Why now

381
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:39,963
of all times?

382
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,284
What should we do, Master?

383
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:42,843
The Yunhua Sect needs a leader.

384
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:43,603
That's right.

385
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,443
Jiusu presses aggressively,

386
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:46,443
tightening his grip.

387
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:47,203
Our sect

388
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:48,603
faces grave peril.

389
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:50,443
We need a leader

390
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,683
to unite our forces.

391
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,404
You mean...

392
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:56,800
Stop playing dumb.

393
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,364
At this critical moment,

394
00:16:58,563 --> 00:16:59,563
only you, Wang Tong,

395
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:00,164
can take over.

396
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:00,923
Me?

397
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,443
Get up.

398
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:03,683
I-I...

399
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:04,603
This is too much...

400
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,123
Wang Tong.

401
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:06,528
- Qiu Shuang.
- You're our only hope.

402
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,244
Wait.

403
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:08,843
- Come on.
- Wait.

404
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:09,643
Qiu Shuang.

405
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,044
Kong Hou.

406
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,044
Why are you here?

407
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,244
I'm going to find
the Soul Anchoring Lamp.

408
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,843
I came to say goodbye.

409
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:33,323
Zhong Xi,

410
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,064
I want to ask you something.

411
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,163
Go ahead.

412
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,680
Were you involved in what happened

413
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:42,112
at Mount Yueluo?

414
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:44,403
Do you have anything to do

415
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:46,784
with my mother's death?

416
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:47,964
No.

417
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,504
Why do you ask?

418
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,520
I've entered Jiusu's memory barrier

419
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,484
and witnessed

420
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,424
the massacre of the Yueluo Clan.

421
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,024
I saw you

422
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:59,648
and members of the Ten Great Sects

423
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:02,080
launching a joint assault.

424
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,843
Memory barrier?

425
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:06,924
Can you tell me more

426
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,204
about that memory barrier?

427
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,136
Do you know the Qibao Hollow Bell?

428
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:12,444
Yes, I do.

429
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:13,724
A spiritual tool

430
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,323
used by dark cultivators.

431
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,284
What's wrong?

432
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,004
So you know about it.

433
00:18:21,244 --> 00:18:22,880
Qibao Hollow Bell.

434
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,563
When dark cultivators cultivate,

435
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:27,684
their souls must enter barriers.

436
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:29,563
To protect their bodies,

437
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,776
they store memories within the bell.

438
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,632
Even if their bodies perish,

439
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,123
they can resurrect

440
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,284
using others' vessels.

441
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:37,924
That's right.

442
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,444
It's a memory storage device.

443
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,920
When Jiusu cultivated,

444
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,044
he stored his memories within it.

445
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:44,764
I...

446
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:46,720
I saw...

447
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,000
Kong Hou.

448
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,244
Sometimes,

449
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:51,843
seeing isn't necessarily believing.

450
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,323
Memories can be altered.

451
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:56,832
Are you saying

452
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,403
that what I saw was fabricated?

453
00:18:59,403 --> 00:18:59,964
Yes.

454
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:03,392
Qibao Hollow Bell stores memories

455
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,684
and also creates illusions.

456
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:06,643
I bet Jiusu

457
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,244
showed you false visions

458
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,004
to drive a wedge between us.

459
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,204
It seems

460
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,083
you two

461
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,768
share a profound affection.

462
00:19:17,843 --> 00:19:19,328
You never miss an opportunity

463
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,123
to meet.

464
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,792
Actually, I've long suspected

465
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:23,643
that your fondness

466
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:24,883
for this guy

467
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,484
could compromise your loyalty.

468
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:29,524
So I devised a small test

469
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,363
to probe your true intentions.

470
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:32,964
I never imagined

471
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,976
that you wouldn't avenge our mother.

472
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:36,323
Instead, you eagerly

473
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:37,924
pledge loyalty and show affection

474
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:39,123
to this man.

475
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,444
What a nice sister

476
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:44,736
and honorable member of the Yueluo Clan.

477
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,843
(The Dark Cloud Tablet advanced)

478
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:48,204
(Jiusu's cultivation.)

479
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:49,004
(Zhong Xi and I)

480
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,144
(may not stand a chance.)

481
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,768
I wanted to confront him directly.

482
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,528
That's why I sought him out.

483
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:55,808
Don't get me wrong.

484
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,632
Members of the Ten Great Sects

485
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,520
all participated in

486
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,924
slaughtering our clan.

487
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,843
They must pay for what they did.

488
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:04,444
He's no exception.

489
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,856
He must die, too.

490
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:10,304
You think I would lie about

491
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,163
what had happened to our clan?

492
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,123
Jiusu.

493
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:15,328
Kong Hou came to me

494
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,284
and learned the truth.

495
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:19,648
Stop pretending.

496
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,888
Does our mother's life

497
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,064
weigh less than your love affair?

498
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,004
Kong Hou.

499
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:27,968
I earnestly

500
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:29,843
hope you'll change your mind

501
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:30,688
and side with me.

502
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:33,244
- You've disappointed me...
- Jiusu.

503
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:34,976
You won't hurt her

504
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:36,608
while I'm here.

505
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:39,712
Your spiritual core is unstable.

506
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:41,568
You can't protect anyone.

507
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:43,684
Try me.

508
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:47,764
Kong Hou.

509
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:48,964
I never truly

510
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,044
wished to hurt you.

511
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:51,883
And I gave you chances.

512
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:53,484
But now,

513
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:55,603
it's too late.

514
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:57,883
But don't worry.

515
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:00,032
I won't kill either of you.

516
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:02,643
My Ascension Array

517
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:04,352
requires your assistance.

518
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,424
As for you, Zhong Xi...

519
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,004
It was my fault.

520
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:14,403
Let him leave.

521
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:16,883
I-I'll go back with you.

522
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:20,563
What was that?

523
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,323
What did you do to him?

524
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:24,192
Though Mount Yueluo was destroyed,

525
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:25,284
its unique

526
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,724
venomous Gu parasites remain.

527
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,204
Their poison is unmatched

528
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,204
and incurable.

529
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:31,724
I said I'd go back with you.

530
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,083
What else do you want?

531
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:34,524
I find the Gu parasite

532
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,320
more trustworthy than you.

533
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:37,728
But rest assured.

534
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,924
As long as you behave,

535
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,248
I'll retrieve the Gu parasite

536
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:42,816
and spare his life.

537
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:44,832
But if you oppose me

538
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,803
or betray me again,

539
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:49,664
I'll let the poison claim him.

540
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:54,924
Zhong Xi.

541
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:57,363
Zhong Xi.

542
00:21:57,563 --> 00:21:58,964
The Gu parasite

543
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,004
has infiltrated your vital organs.

544
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:04,603
How does it feel?

545
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,603
I'm fine.

546
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:08,004
Don't listen to him.

547
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:15,924
Zhong Xi.

548
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:21,883
You two,

549
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:23,776
come back with me.

550
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:24,964
And you

551
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,400
will do what I say

552
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:28,603
and cultivate with me.

553
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:32,684
Don't worry.

554
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:33,964
I'll find a way

555
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,456
to remove the Gu parasite.

556
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:39,284
I'm alright.

557
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,323
Jiusu's power has grown tremendously.

558
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,803
I'm afraid the elders...

559
00:22:46,603 --> 00:22:47,563
I know.

560
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:49,484
Don't worry.

561
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:52,764
Jiusu has the Dark Cloud Tablet.

562
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,204
The elders

563
00:22:56,444 --> 00:22:58,323
may not be his match.

564
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:00,403
Once his Ascension Array is complete,

565
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,684
the world will suffer devastation.

566
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:06,764
My lord.

567
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,000
Master Wu Bei went there

568
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:10,204
but the Yunhua Sect wouldn't comply.

569
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,284
Those people don't know their places.

570
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,244
Obstinate fools.

571
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:16,764
Forget it. Just kill them all.

572
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:17,684
At worst,

573
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,764
we'll replenish from other sects.

574
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:20,832
Go ahead.

575
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:22,764
Pass on my word to Wu Bei.

576
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:25,083
Those who won't serve me

577
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,284
shall be eliminated.

578
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,856
It will show the other sects

579
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:31,803
what happens

580
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:33,724
to those who defy me.

581
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:44,083
So many dark cultivators.

582
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,284
What's happening?

583
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,204
It seems the Ten Great Sects

584
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,803
have already withdrawn.

585
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,123
The Yunhua Sect

586
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:51,123
is standing alone.

587
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,544
No. I must help them.

588
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:55,603
What? Are you scared?

589
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,083
Scared? Who's scared?

590
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:57,843
We have no idea

591
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:58,843
what's going on.

592
00:23:58,843 --> 00:23:59,684
What if you

593
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:00,603
get yourself killed?

594
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,843
We know what's going on.

595
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:03,044
Don't you see them

596
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:03,843
lurking around?

597
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:04,563
What if they

598
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:05,323
hold hostages?

599
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:06,964
What if the Yunhua Sect has a plan

600
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:07,883
and our intervention

601
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:08,964
ruins

602
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:09,563
everything?

603
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,004
Then, what do we do?

604
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,363
Let me think.

605
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,163
We can't just let it be.

606
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,244
Let's see how it goes

607
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:17,403
and act accordingly.

608
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:19,444
Let's go.

609
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:22,764
Everyone, stop.

610
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:24,323
Wu Bei.

611
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:25,643
Release her.

612
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:26,883
Let her go.

613
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:28,524
Want me to release her?

614
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:29,632
It's simple.

615
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,284
Hand over your disciples.

616
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:33,363
You wish.

617
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:34,688
We'd rather die

618
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,323
than surrender.

619
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:37,472
Then I'll oblige you.

620
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:41,883
Ling Hui.

621
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:42,964
Who is it?

622
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,616
Your Eminence.

623
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,144
Kong Hou.

624
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:17,248
My disciple Kong Hou?

625
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:19,843
I'm no disciple of yours.

626
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,524
Your Eminence.

627
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:24,044
What brings you here?

628
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,004
What?

629
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,328
You dare question me?

630
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:29,484
Know your place.

631
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:30,684
Kong Hou.

632
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:32,603
What's going on here?

633
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:34,112
Don't you get it?

634
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:36,764
You've been my master

635
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:38,044
for over a decade.

636
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,096
So, I'm giving you a chance.

637
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,524
Hand over ten people.

638
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,643
And we'll leave immediately.

639
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:47,883
Kong Hou.

640
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,083
I don't believe it.

641
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:51,764
What happened?

642
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:53,323
Tell me.

643
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:54,163
Even if it costs me

644
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,524
my life,

645
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,284
I'll find a solution

646
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:58,843
to fix all this.

647
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,128
Who do you

648
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,163
think you are?

649
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:04,832
You think I would need help

650
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:07,643
with all the power I possess?

651
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,696
Be smart.

652
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:11,904
Obey my command.

653
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:13,964
Surrender ten people.

654
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:16,403
What's happening?

655
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:18,123
Your Eminence.

656
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,843
Stop wasting your breath.

657
00:26:19,924 --> 00:26:21,363
Just give the order.

658
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:22,284
And we will

659
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,484
annihilate the Yunhua Sect now.

660
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,363
What are you waiting for?

661
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:30,484
Attack.

662
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:38,284
Your Eminence.

663
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,696
Your Eminence. You...

664
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:43,403
I knew you didn't

665
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:45,323
submit to the Lord.

666
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:47,603
Kong Hou.

667
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:48,603
I knew

668
00:26:48,603 --> 00:26:50,816
you wouldn't become like that.

669
00:26:54,764 --> 00:26:56,163
Become like that?

670
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:58,083
What do you mean?

671
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,123
Wang Tong.

672
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,160
This is who I am.

673
00:27:05,004 --> 00:27:06,803
You were just unaware of it.

674
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:10,208
Stop deluding yourself.

675
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:11,924
My brother

676
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:14,603
needs living cultivators for his array,

677
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:16,764
not corpses.

678
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:18,284
Don't worry.

679
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,563
I won't hurt you.

680
00:27:22,244 --> 00:27:23,524
And you.

681
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,376
Calling you pig-brained

682
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,883
is a compliment.

683
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:28,803
B-But...

684
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:30,284
But the Lord...

685
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:32,363
For such a trivial matter,

686
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:33,856
you mobilized so many people,

687
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,004
caused unnecessary losses,

688
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:38,816
and almost ruined my brother's plan.

689
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,112
You're utterly useless.

690
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:44,603
Kong Hou.

691
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,240
Kong Hou.

692
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,083
Kong Hou.

693
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,204
How did she become like this?

694
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:51,244
Kong Hou.

695
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:52,563
- Why would you...
- Silence.

696
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:54,363
How dare you

697
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:56,096
address me by my name?

698
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:58,976
One more word,

699
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:01,163
and I won't hold back.

700
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:02,123
Kong Hou.

701
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,004
What do you want?

702
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,724
As long as the Yunhua Sect

703
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:06,803
follows my order

704
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,524
and surrenders ten people,

705
00:28:08,883 --> 00:28:09,803
naturally,

706
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:11,168
I'll guarantee your safety.

707
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,152
Otherwise,

708
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm not sure

709
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:18,284
what I'll do.

710
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:19,643
Kong Hou.

711
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:21,883
Wake up.

712
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:22,924
- (Master, don't worry.)
- Look

713
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:23,872
- (I won't hurt them.)
- at them.

714
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,665
They are

715
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:27,163
- (This is a stalling tactic.)
- your fellow disciples...

716
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,004
Silence.

717
00:28:38,244 --> 00:28:39,284
I'll go with you.

718
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:41,536
Ling Hui.

719
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,323
Me too.

720
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:44,563
Excellent.

721
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,843
The wise ones know when to yield.

722
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:50,083
You saved me the trouble.

723
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,083
Guards.

724
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,843
Take them away.

725
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:56,960
Kong Hou.

726
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:58,688
Kong Hou.

727
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,284
Kong Hou.

728
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:18,284
What Gu parasite

729
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,192
did Jiusu plant in me?

730
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:21,524
I've read so many books

731
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:23,284
on the Gu parasites,

732
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:25,323
but couldn't find any clues.

733
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,684
Young Master, you should rest.

734
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:29,964
Xiao Pei.

735
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:31,563
When will Kong Hou come?

736
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,204
I don't know where Her Eminence is.

737
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:35,964
Have some spiritual fruits first.

738
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:42,764
Please wait.

739
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:46,444
What else do you need?

740
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:48,444
There's something you should know.

741
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:51,563
I regulated energy
with Kong Hou some days ago.

742
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,403
Her energy flow was chaotic

743
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:55,123
and her blood flow reversed.

744
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:56,603
She needs treatment,

745
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:58,944
or she might be in trouble.

746
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,843
How did that happen?

747
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,764
W-What should I do?

748
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:05,204
Please

749
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:07,284
keep me informed

750
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,964
if anything happens.

751
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:10,643
Alright.

752
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:13,123
Young Master,

753
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:14,684
you seem to care deeply

754
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,403
about Her Eminence.

755
00:30:16,803 --> 00:30:18,204
You love her, don't you?

756
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:21,123
Yes.

757
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:23,724
She's the love of my life.

758
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:24,724
How nice.

759
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,284
Her Eminence

760
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,403
is suffering.

761
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:29,204
Each day weighs on her spirit.

762
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:30,363
Lord Jiusu forces her

763
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,764
to cultivate every day.

764
00:30:32,204 --> 00:30:33,924
She has to deal with him

765
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:35,924
and protect me.

766
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,248
I'm too useless

767
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,520
to help with anything.

768
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,024
Don't say that.

769
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,603
It's not your fault.

770
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:44,083
But Kong Hou

771
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,563
has endured so much hardship.

772
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,616
But you care for her deeply.

773
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,363
She'll surely take comfort in that.

774
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:50,684
Right, Young Master.

775
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:52,044
You mentioned

776
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:53,684
her reversed blood flow.

777
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:54,684
Is there a way

778
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:55,964
to heal her?

779
00:30:56,083 --> 00:30:57,123
Due to Jiusu's

780
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,144
Gu parasite,

781
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,684
I can't help her regulate energy.

782
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:05,363
We're both seeking solutions.

783
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,924
Lord Jiusu possesses

784
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,684
some fascinating ancient manuals.

785
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:10,603
Do you think

786
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:12,123
they might contain answers?

787
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,440
That's possible.

788
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:15,444
But...

789
00:31:15,524 --> 00:31:17,440
Let me retrieve them for you.

790
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:18,524
No.

791
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,684
It's too dangerous for you.

792
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:22,244
I've vowed to myself

793
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:23,444
to serve our Sovereign.

794
00:31:23,563 --> 00:31:25,244
Since you're the love of her life,

795
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:27,168
helping you serves the same purpose.

796
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:33,024
I never expected such loyalty

797
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:35,904
in this wretched place.

798
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,083
Young Master,

799
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:38,643
wait for me.

800
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,664
Be very careful.

801
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:49,244
Kong Hou.

802
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:50,244
You're back.

803
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:52,764
Greetings, my lord.

804
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:57,484
I brought back

805
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,684
the Yunhua Sect members.

806
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:00,843
Jiusu.

807
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:02,720
Your subordinates

808
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,603
prove woefully incompetent.

809
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:07,083
Had I not intervened,

810
00:32:07,163 --> 00:32:08,284
they wouldn't have

811
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:09,924
secured even one disciple

812
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:11,284
for you.

813
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:14,924
Actually, it doesn't matter.

814
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:16,163
I was planning

815
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:18,004
to annihilate the Yunhua Sect

816
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,563
if they didn't comply

817
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,004
and replenish the "materials"

818
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,244
from other sects.

819
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:24,924
Capturing more people

820
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:26,524
would require additional effort.

821
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:27,764
We shouldn't

822
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:29,363
keep wasting time like this.

823
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,363
The array matters the most.

824
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:33,603
Fine then.

825
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:34,924
It's been a long trip.

826
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,163
Get some proper rest.

827
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:39,403
Guards. Take them away.

828
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:41,724
Move.

829
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:42,403
Hurry up.

830
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:42,964
Faster.

831
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:44,363
Move.

832
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:45,524
Go.

833
00:32:45,684 --> 00:32:47,456
Keep them under tight watch.

834
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,684
Don't let any mole

835
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,163
disrupt our Lord's plans.

836
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:55,136
Wu Bei.

837
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:59,163
You kept provoking me.

838
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:00,832
What do you want?

839
00:33:01,764 --> 00:33:03,204
I wouldn't dare.

840
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:12,832
I advise you to watch your tongue.

841
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,464
If this happens again,

842
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,764
I'll smash your teeth in.

843
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:29,536
My lord.

844
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:31,616
Do you truly trust her?

845
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:35,616
With Zhong Xi in my grasp,

846
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:36,896
she will be

847
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:39,008
absolutely loyal to me.

848
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:41,856
She's deceived you multiple times.

849
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:43,563
In my opinion,

850
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,363
Kong Hou has never

851
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,232
truly submitted to you.

852
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:49,216
If I say she'll be loyal,

853
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:50,924
then she will be.

854
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:54,112
I'm only concerned for your safety.

855
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:57,403
Kong Hou might collude with Zhong Xi

856
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:58,924
to harm you.

857
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:00,960
Enough. I recognize your loyalty.

858
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:02,496
Rest assured.

859
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:04,576
She won't repeat her past behavior.

860
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:06,336
She'll follow my orders

861
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:08,044
and serve my purposes.

862
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:18,884
Xiao Pei did me a huge favor.

863
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,763
She actually managed to

864
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,004
retrieve books from Jiusu.

865
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:23,524
Who's there?

866
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:25,723
Young Master.

867
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:26,964
Young Master.

868
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:29,283
Young Master, it's me.

869
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:30,044
Lin Hu.

870
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:31,163
Why are you here?

871
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:32,484
Young Master, come with me.

872
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:33,683
Kong Hou took Tan Feng

873
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,163
and Ling Hui from the Yunhua Sect.

874
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:36,484
She's changed.

875
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:38,528
Kong Hou abducted them?

876
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,163
She took people to the Yunhua Sect

877
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,004
and caused heavy casualties.

878
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,964
Her bloodline was controlling her.

879
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,404
The episodes cause her unbearable pain.

880
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:49,243
Young Master.

881
00:34:49,243 --> 00:34:50,044
Why are you

882
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,243
still defending her?

883
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:54,924
(Jiusu must have threatened her.)

884
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:57,924
Young Master, why...

885
00:34:58,324 --> 00:34:59,924
Why do you look so pale?

886
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,044
Are you injured?

887
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:01,924
No.

888
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:02,964
Are you hurt?

889
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:03,964
Did Kong Hou hurt you?

890
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:04,603
Nonsense.

891
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:06,283
Fine, I'll stop.

892
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:07,243
Young Master,

893
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:08,083
come with me.

894
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:09,243
What if Kong Hou

895
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:10,524
hurts you again?

896
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:11,603
I can't leave.

897
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:12,203
Come on.

898
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,603
Why not?

899
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:14,484
Young Master.

900
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:15,924
You don't believe that she's

901
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:16,924
still into you, right?

902
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,083
If she's still into you,

903
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:18,723
why would she

904
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,004
lock you up here?

905
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:21,004
Enough.

906
00:35:21,004 --> 00:35:21,884
I said I can't leave.

907
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:23,163
I have things to do.

908
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:23,763
But...

909
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:24,324
Enough.

910
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,044
Find something for me.

911
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,163
I have my plans.

912
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:27,964
And Kong Hou

913
00:35:27,964 --> 00:35:29,324
is controlled by her bloodline.

914
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:31,563
I must save her.

915
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:34,364
I see.

916
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:38,368
Let's go.

917
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:43,243
The Yunhua Sect disciples.

918
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:44,123
Kong Hou turns out

919
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:45,083
to be so heartless

920
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:46,364
even with her own people.

921
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,456
What an animal.

922
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:48,804
Kong Hou is not like that.

923
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,723
You nurtured that dark cultivator.

924
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:51,723
Look what you've done

925
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:52,844
- to us all!
- Exactly!

926
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:53,964
That's right!

927
00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:55,083
Traitors!

928
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,004
What an animal!

929
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,044
Not a single decent person!

930
00:35:58,044 --> 00:35:59,168
- Not one good soul!
- Quiet!

931
00:35:59,168 --> 00:35:59,808
- Traitors.
- Animal.

932
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:00,800
- Look.
- Animal.

933
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,568
Quiet!

934
00:36:09,203 --> 00:36:09,804
What do we do?

935
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:10,444
It's alright.

936
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,643
Take him away.

937
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:14,364
I'm not going anywhere.

938
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,844
- Let me go.
- Senior...

939
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,404
I-I'm not going anywhere.

940
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,123
Where are they taking him?

941
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,004
Isn't it obvious?

942
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:26,603
Jiusu and Kong Hou

943
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,004
are using him for cultivation.

944
00:36:29,044 --> 00:36:30,083
No way.

945
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:43,884
Kong Hou.

946
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:52,324
Zhong Xi.

947
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:54,484
Today...

948
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:56,864
I've heard.

949
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:57,964
Next,

950
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,280
I'll abduct people
from the Liuguang Sect.

951
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,712
Jiusu needs captives for his array.

952
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,404
I'd rather do it myself

953
00:37:05,404 --> 00:37:06,304
than send someone.

954
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:07,484
At least,

955
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:09,243
I can minimize

956
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,080
the casualties.

957
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:14,083
I understand.

958
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm glad you understand.

959
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:19,683
Speaking of which,

960
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:21,444
if we let Jiusu

961
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:23,328
complete his Ascension Array,

962
00:37:23,683 --> 00:37:25,376
even with both of us combined,

963
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,163
we couldn't defeat him.

964
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:29,964
Then the entire Lingyou Realm

965
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,964
would be reduced to scorched earth.

966
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,752
I've been deeply concerned about this.

967
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:36,844
While you were away,

968
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:39,328
Xiao Pei brought me spiritual fruits.

969
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:40,608
She was worried

970
00:37:40,964 --> 00:37:42,203
about you and volunteered

971
00:37:42,364 --> 00:37:44,283
to steal manuals from Jiusu for me.

972
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:45,524
At first,

973
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:47,404
I wanted to search the texts

974
00:37:47,563 --> 00:37:48,704
for any method

975
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:50,804
to prevent your blood reversal.

976
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:51,744
But by chance,

977
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,044
I found an ancient text

978
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,203
documenting the Harmony Sync technique.

979
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,163
Harmony Sync

980
00:37:58,324 --> 00:37:59,404
turns out to possess

981
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:02,004
life-restoring power.

982
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:03,683
It might be the only way

983
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:04,928
to break the Ascension Array.

984
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,808
Even the slimmest hope

985
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:10,848
is worth pursuing.

986
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,004
Be careful

987
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,924
around Jiusu.

988
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:22,004
Today's cultivation

989
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:23,712
went unexpectedly wrong.

990
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,364
Why is that?

991
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,484
My lord.

992
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,723
What's the rush?

993
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:35,004
Where are you going?

994
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:37,324
I'm going to prepare snacks

995
00:38:37,364 --> 00:38:38,324
for Her Eminence.

996
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,563
I told you

997
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:41,524
to keep an eye on her.

998
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:42,763
But you

999
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:44,723
proved utterly useless.

1000
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,324
I merely...

1001
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:47,484
Merely what?

1002
00:38:48,364 --> 00:38:49,683
So incompetent.

1003
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,083
Why should I keep you around?

1004
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,484
There are plenty

1005
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,083
who can serve in your place.

1006
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:57,683
I happen to need spiritual energy now.

1007
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:01,728
My lord.

1008
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:03,683
What are you doing?

1009
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,804
I'm granting you
a chance to make amends.

1010
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:47,324
Greetings, my lord.

1011
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:48,800
Your timing is perfect.

1012
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,563
The Dark Cloud Tablet

1013
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:52,736
is nearing its final refinement stage.

1014
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:54,444
It will help

1015
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:56,324
advance my spiritual energy.

1016
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:58,848
After that, the Ascension Array

1017
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:00,384
will be within my grasp.

1018
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:02,203
Congratulations, my lord.

1019
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,083
Bring the Sovereign here.

1020
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:05,243
We will cultivate

1021
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:06,763
with the Dark Cloud Tablet.

1022
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:09,440
Are you cultivating with her?

1023
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:10,784
Kong Hou did a good job

1024
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,643
at the Yunhua Sect.

1025
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,404
I want to study the Dark Cloud Tablet

1026
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:15,360
with her.

1027
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,643
We share one mind

1028
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:18,844
and might just

1029
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,283
unravel the secrets

1030
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:21,844
of the Dark Cloud Tablet.

1031
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:22,844
My lord,

1032
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:24,603
this is highly inadvisable.

1033
00:40:24,844 --> 00:40:26,624
Kong Hou is not trustworthy.

1034
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,404
The Dark Cloud Tablet
is an ancient treasure

1035
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,603
containing the ten legendary artifacts.

1036
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,603
It holds not only spirit herbs

1037
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,123
that boost spiritual energy,

1038
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,404
but also manuals

1039
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,004
for ruling the Lingyou Realm.

1040
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:39,723
If she exploits this,

1041
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:41,696
the consequences would be dire.

1042
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,324
I understand your concerns.

1043
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,083
But remember this.

1044
00:40:46,324 --> 00:40:48,064
I need her to complete

1045
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:49,152
the Ascension Array.

1046
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:50,763
Thus, I have to

1047
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:51,964
study the Dark Cloud Tablet

1048
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,184
with her.

1049
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:54,243
I will keep

1050
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,844
observing whether

1051
00:40:55,964 --> 00:40:57,888
she harbors ulterior motives.

1052
00:40:58,404 --> 00:41:00,763
You don't have to worry.

1053
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,576
Your wisdom prevails. I understand.

1054
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,120
My lord,

1055
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,563
I will prepare for

1056
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,964
the Ascension Ceremony right now.

1057
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:19,683
Alright. Go ahead.

1058
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:23,884
Wait.

1059
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:29,203
What can I do for Your Eminence?

1060
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:30,444
Enough

1061
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:31,648
with the act.

1062
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,763
I clearly heard you discussing

1063
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:34,944
the Dark Cloud Tablet.

1064
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:37,283
If you distrust me so,

1065
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:39,723
why don't we pursue ascension

1066
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:41,184
separately?

1067
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:44,243
Kong Hou.

1068
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:46,080
You don't have to be so upset.

1069
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,083
Wu Bei noticed

1070
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,603
your frequent visits to Zhong Xi.

1071
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,104
He was worried and came

1072
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:52,324
to report this.

1073
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:53,643
Besides,

1074
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:56,364
I'm indeed a bit worried.

1075
00:41:57,324 --> 00:41:59,404
Since you doubt me,

1076
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:00,640
how about this?

1077
00:42:01,163 --> 00:42:03,136
Assign me a task

1078
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:05,152
and I'll accomplish it right away.

1079
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:06,720
You said it yourself.

1080
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,152
You will do anything I say?

1081
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:10,484
Of course.

1082
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,123
However,

1083
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:14,004
I would also like to

1084
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:15,123
propose an idea

1085
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:17,683
to see if it pleases you.

1086
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:19,283
What is it?

1087
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:20,844
I've heard

1088
00:42:20,884 --> 00:42:23,484
that the Liuguang Sect
refuses to surrender its members.

1089
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:26,004
Let me handle this.

1090
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:26,924
