(Yongning Gate)

17
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:03,928
Your Highness,

18
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:05,649
it's about the time.

19
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:19,774
(Imperial Decree)

20
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,728
The First Prince

21
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,209
served as the Grand General,

22
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,089
commanding troops beyond the capital.

23
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,209
His duty was to safeguard the realm,

24
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,489
yet he harbored treasonous ambitions

25
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,049
and led armies to assault the capital,

26
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,209
plotting regicide.

27
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:43,529
This is high treason.

28
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:45,969
Unforgivable crimes!

29
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:47,769
Strip all his noble titles.

30
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:49,209
Demote him to commoner status.

31
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,209
Execute him immediately.

32
00:02:57,688 --> 00:02:59,408
That stupid emperor

33
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,529
usurped the throne through regicide.

34
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,448
He is a ruler devoid of mercy, kindness,

35
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:05,848
and loyalty!

36
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,369
Yet he dares slander me?

37
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,329
Ridiculous.

38
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:12,969
My return with troops

39
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,888
was rightful and just.

40
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:17,408
My regret lies only in haste,

41
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:19,969
failing to claim your head.

42
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:22,168
(Execute)
Even if I die today,

43
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,049
heaven's justice prevails.

44
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,969
You won't escape retribution.

45
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:45,408
Brother,

46
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,249
I've come to bid you farewell.

47
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,049
Huan Zong,

48
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:54,608
protect yourself.

49
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,168
Protect our younger brother.

50
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:06,369
I promise.

51
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,288
Execute!

52
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,928
Zong,

53
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:50,209
Zong, what's wrong?

54
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,168
Zong,

55
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,808
Mother

56
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:57,689
has gone.

57
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,408
Did I fail to meet expectations,

58
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,248
so the First Prince

59
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:04,569
opposed my succession,

60
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,689
thus staged this rebellion?

61
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,969
Who told you this?

62
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:11,009
Father told me this.

63
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:20,608
Do you trust me?

64
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,529
Yes.

65
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,488
I trust you above all.

66
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,449
Did the First Prince

67
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,889
really rebel because of me?

68
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,608
Trust me.

69
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,209
He loved you dearly.

70
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,608
This has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:41,368
Don't blame yourself.

72
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:42,608
Okay?

73
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,569
From now on,

74
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,689
I'll protect you in the capital.

75
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:10,848
These...

76
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,928
So many dark cultivator corpses

77
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,769
and those beggar puppets.

78
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,728
They were all discarded here.

79
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,848
Huan Zong?

80
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,928
Huan Zong, where are you?

81
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:22,089
Please be safe.

82
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:26,728
Huan Zong?

83
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:31,889
Huan Zong.

84
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:46,649
Huan Zong, wake up.

85
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,129
I'm Kong Hou.

86
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:50,889
Let's go.

87
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,449
I'm taking you out of here.

88
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,248
Even with his body recovered,

89
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,569
without conquering inner demons,

90
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:58,209
he'll remain in catatonia

91
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,329
or perish.

92
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,649
So this is your inner demon.

93
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,048
Wait here.

94
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,449
How peculiar.

95
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,329
Could it be

96
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:51,089
only I could perceive that enchantment?

97
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,000
(Laundry Bureau)

98
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,408
This is weird.

99
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,009
This is clearly the imperial palace.

100
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,288
How could his inner demon

101
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,889
be tied to the imperial palace?

102
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,248
Was he once a eunuch?

103
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:23,529
No. It's impossible.

104
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,048
Huan Zong must have been

105
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,209
at least a palace guard.

106
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:27,848
No matter what,

107
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,608
I'll find him first.

108
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,049
Who's there?

109
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,089
There's no one.

110
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:34,888
You saw wrong.

111
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:35,648
Get back to work.

112
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:46,488
This...

113
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,528
- I'm coming.
- Your Majesty.

114
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,689
I'm coming.

115
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,648
No escaping now.

116
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:12,169
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:12,888
Where are you?

118
00:09:12,888 --> 00:09:14,049
- I'm coming.
- I'm here.

119
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:15,248
Your Majesty.

120
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,248
My beauty! I'm coming!

121
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,488
I'm right here.

122
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,528
You're here.

123
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:20,289
I got you.

124
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,689
- Your Majesty.
- I got you.

125
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:22,368
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,289
My beauty.

127
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,449
Father,

128
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,969
the traitor has been executed.

129
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:33,728
What did he say?

130
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,169
Did he confess before dying?

131
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,248
The traitor died
without acknowledging guilt.

132
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,569
He believed himself innocent.

133
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,888
He's just stubborn.

134
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,848
And what do you think?

135
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,209
Is he guilty or not?

136
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:56,888
I believe

137
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,848
he is guilty.

138
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,368
Good that you know he's guilty.

139
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:05,848
You're wiser than him.

140
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,488
But remember this well.

141
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,488
Don't repeat his mistakes.

142
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:12,289
Your Majesty,

143
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,768
please have some tea.

144
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,049
My beauty,

145
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,209
why haven't I

146
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:21,569
noticed you before?

147
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:22,888
Alright.

148
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,128
You'll serve me from now on.

149
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,728
Thank you, Your Majesty.

150
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:28,728
So beautiful.

151
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:33,768
Congratulations on finding
a new consort.

152
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:35,689
Okay. Go attend to your duties.

153
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,888
I'll take my leave.

154
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:41,728
Your Majesty,

155
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:44,008
time for the elixir.

156
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,528
Let me feed you, Your Majesty.

157
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:47,929
Good.

158
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,608
From now on,

159
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:12,008
you shall be my consort.

160
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,008
I dressed meticulously

161
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,449
every day just to see him.

162
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:16,409
No matter how late,

163
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,848
I'd wash and prepare,

164
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,409
rising before dawn to work.

165
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,289
Yet he

166
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,648
never even glanced at me

167
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,929
and told me to stop dreaming.

168
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:24,528
What's so special about him?

169
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:25,329
I'm a palace maid.

170
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:26,488
He's just a guard.

171
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:28,768
All guards are the same.

172
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:29,848
They look down on us.

173
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,409
They just dress fancier

174
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,689
and get paid more,

175
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,449
but in the end,
they're still just servants.

176
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:35,569
Exactly!

177
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:36,969
It's okay.

178
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,248
Ladies,

179
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,569
may I ask something?

180
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:43,329
Do you know

181
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,969
a guard named Huan Zong?

182
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,329
There are too many guards.

183
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,089
How could I know all their names?

184
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:49,809
That's true.

185
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:50,809
Oh, right.

186
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:51,648
He looks

187
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:52,569
exceptionally handsome.

188
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,209
I might know

189
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,488
some good-looking ones.

190
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:57,209
But I haven't heard

191
00:11:57,209 --> 00:11:58,608
that name you mentioned.

192
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,648
Did you see that in some

193
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:01,848
lovesick dreams you had

194
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,209
when you couldn't sleep?

195
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:04,608
I...

196
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,248
I'm exhausted today.

197
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:13,888
Got scolded by the matron again.

198
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,209
His Majesty just executed

199
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,689
the rebellious First Prince.

200
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:20,768
Only the Second Prince

201
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,329
- I'm spent.
- and the Crown Prince remain now.

202
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:23,569
In the end,

203
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,209
it's just gossip.

204
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,488
No useful information at all.

205
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,569
They say

206
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:31,329
the First Prince

207
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,488
never actually rebelled.

208
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:33,528
It was just because...

209
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:34,848
I also heard

210
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,569
the late Empress didn't

211
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:37,569
die of illness.

212
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,169
She was...

213
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,128
She was murdered

214
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,209
by her consort,

215
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,169
the current Emperor.

216
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:48,209
So the First Prince came back

217
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,169
to seek revenge.

218
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,488
But His Majesty was prepared

219
00:12:50,488 --> 00:12:51,368
and exposed his plan.

220
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:52,848
To make an example of him,

221
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,848
he asked Second Prince
to oversee the execution.

222
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,648
Brothers slaughter each other.

223
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,008
Now the Second Prince

224
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,409
must be thoroughly terrified.

225
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,689
He wouldn't dare disobey.

226
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,289
I heard

227
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,449
the Crown Prince isn't even

228
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,689
His Majesty's biological son.

229
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,248
And now, he is so young.

230
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:07,368
(How come what they're saying)

231
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:08,728
(sounds so much like)

232
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:09,689
(what chronicles wrote)

233
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,648
(about Lingyou royalty?)

234
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,689
(But the late Empress was killed)

235
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:14,289
(by her consort over 300 years ago.)

236
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:16,848
(Is this truly Huan Zong's inner demon?)

237
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:18,689
(How could his inner demon connect)

238
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,449
(to royal affairs from 300 years ago?)

239
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,128
Which department do you work in?

240
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,608
Your face looks unfamiliar.

241
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,049
I don't recall seeing you before.

242
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:28,329
I'm responsible

243
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,648
for the laundry.

244
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,368
We're all laundry workers here.

245
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,689
I-I just

246
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,089
woke up groggy this morning.

247
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,289
I mean

248
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:39,728
I'm from another palace.

249
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,169
Our matron sent me

250
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:42,848
to deliver pastries for everyone.

251
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,449
Which matron would that be?

252
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:48,248
You know the matron.

253
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:49,528
Who else could it be,

254
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:50,169
right?

255
00:13:50,368 --> 00:13:51,648
I-I...

256
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:54,089
These

257
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,528
are the treats the matron

258
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:56,648
sent me to deliver.

259
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:57,648
I need to return now

260
00:13:57,648 --> 00:13:58,768
and report back to her.

261
00:13:58,768 --> 00:13:59,569
I'm leaving now.

262
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,089
I'll visit again.

263
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:02,768
You...

264
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,329
Alright. Go back and have some rest.

265
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,728
I shall stay by your side.

266
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,248
Should you need anything,

267
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,569
I'll attend to you immediately.

268
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,569
It would be shameful to neglect you.

269
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,248
Perfect.

270
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:20,368
I just remembered something

271
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,089
requiring your immediate attention.

272
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,329
Your wish is my command.

273
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,248
When reporting to His Majesty

274
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,969
about the rebel executions today,

275
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:30,728
I noticed his chambers were filled

276
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:32,409
with stunning female companions.

277
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,969
Some of them

278
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:36,049
were breathtakingly beautiful.

279
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:37,648
I thought to myself

280
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,049
if I could have such beauties

281
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,608
attending to me,

282
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:43,368
it would be marvelous.

283
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:44,929
But naturally,

284
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,089
those peerless women belong

285
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,728
with His Majesty.

286
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,329
Settling for the next best thing,

287
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,888
if I could settle

288
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:53,049
for slightly less dazzling

289
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,608
yet equally skilled companions,

290
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,329
it would make nights more bearable.

291
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:00,209
No need to explain, Your Highness.

292
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,689
I know what to do.

293
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,608
I'll personally handle it.

294
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,929
Thank you.

295
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,008
But if they could arrive tonight,

296
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,809
that would be great.

297
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,008
Consider it done.

298
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,368
Grant me two hours,

299
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:14,289
and you'll be pleased.

300
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,368
Any suspicious movements from him?

301
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:23,768
I failed.

302
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:25,809
I lost the Second Prince's trail.

303
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:26,648
Useless!

304
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:29,929
He claimed

305
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,128
to have dropped something

306
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,648
and sent guards searching.

307
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,008
But it was dark.

308
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:36,528
I turned around

309
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:38,409
just to find him vanished.

310
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,289
Where exactly?

311
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:41,528
Near the imperial garden.

312
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,689
He must be meeting someone there.

313
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:48,449
Maybe it was the First Prince's faction.

314
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:49,809
But I heard

315
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:50,409
they've always

316
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,969
only obeyed the First Prince.

317
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,848
Now, he's actually managed
to recruit them?

318
00:15:55,248 --> 00:15:56,049
But

319
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,008
when I went to see
the Second Prince later,

320
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:58,929
I encountered one

321
00:15:58,929 --> 00:15:59,969
of his eunuchs,

322
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,209
who was about to send people

323
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,248
out on errands.

324
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,368
They said it was
to find beauties to serve

325
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:05,368
the Second Prince.

326
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:06,929
Out of nowhere,

327
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,929
wanting to find beauties?

328
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,569
Who would believe that?

329
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,728
I must catch him red-handed

330
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,008
and charge him with treason on the spot.

331
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:16,888
Someone! Prepare the carriage!

332
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:19,209
Yes, Your Highness.

333
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,488
The imperial palace is enormous.

334
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:25,888
I've walked so far,

335
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:26,888
but haven't seen any

336
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,169
guards' quarters.

337
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,648
Could it be the guards

338
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,008
all live outside the palace?

339
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:34,089
My legs are killing me.

340
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,128
Late at night,

341
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:38,608
the palace is heavily guarded.

342
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:40,689
Without using spiritual energy,

343
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,209
how should I search?

344
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,169
Where should I go?

345
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,409
I'm starving.

346
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,368
Maybe I should take a nap.

347
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,008
Once I'm asleep,

348
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:55,728
maybe I'll dream of something tasty.

349
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,888
Where should I sleep?

350
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,449
There's a tree here.

351
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,248
Your Highness,

352
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:39,169
besides the eunuch just now,

353
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:40,849
there are still many in the palace

354
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,209
following me.

355
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,609
Time is pressing.

356
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,129
The First Prince's military power

357
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,048
has been stripped away,

358
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:48,528
but all generals

359
00:17:48,528 --> 00:17:49,369
from Northwest Camp

360
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:50,849
only follow his orders.

361
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,048
He once instructed us

362
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:53,568
that if his elimination failed,

363
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:55,048
we should faithfully serve you.

364
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,528
This is the First Prince's token.

365
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:58,849
With this,

366
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,008
you can command

367
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,728
the vast forces of the Northwest Camp.

368
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,528
Now that my brother is gone,

369
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:05,889
we must plan carefully.

370
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,048
When the time comes,

371
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,008
the situation will reverse.

372
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:52,889
Huan Zong?

373
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:53,889
Huan Zong.

374
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,609
It really is you!

375
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:01,248
Huan Zong,

376
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,969
let's get out of here now.

377
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:05,929
Let go.

378
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:08,169
I won't.

379
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,209
You don't know how hard

380
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:12,609
I've worked to find you.

381
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,609
I've searched for ages!

382
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,929
Get off me first.

383
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,528
Who are you?

384
00:19:28,528 --> 00:19:30,449
How dare you address me by name?

385
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:31,609
Huan Zong,

386
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,248
don't you remember me?

387
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:39,248
Get up.

388
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:40,768
Come here.

389
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,169
Are you another spy sent by my father?

390
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:48,649
What?

391
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,728
Don't speak.

392
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:52,728
Don't move.

393
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,808
Isn't this Consort Qi?

394
00:20:15,969 --> 00:20:17,328
You just got your promotion.

395
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:18,048
What brings you

396
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,288
out for a nighttime stroll?

397
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:19,849
I...

398
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,169
I was walking to aid digestion.

399
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:23,808
Second Prince, w-what

400
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,849
are you doing here?

401
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,129
(Second Prince?)

402
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,929
(So Huan Zong isn't a guard.)

403
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,568
(He's the Second Prince
of Lingyou Realm?)

404
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,449
Don't you see?

405
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:34,728
On such a lovely night,

406
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:35,929
naturally, I'm spending time

407
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:36,849
with a beauty.

408
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,849
(Why does Huan Zong seem so strange?)

409
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:39,728
What?

410
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:41,129
Would you like to watch?

411
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,209
I don't mind it,

412
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,849
but prolonged viewing

413
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:49,649
might hinder your digestion.

414
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,209
No.

415
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:51,528
I won't disturb you.

416
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,528
Speak.

417
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,209
Why did my father send you here?

418
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,129
What "father"?

419
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,969
I've been explaining this
all the way here.

420
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,488
I'm Kong Hou.

421
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,369
I was just exhausted
from searching for you

422
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,568
and slept in that tree for a while.

423
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:23,728
I never expected

424
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:24,728
I'd encounter you

425
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:25,849
there.

426
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:26,649
Besides,

427
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:27,849
how did you become

428
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,768
Lingyou Realm's Second Prince?

429
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:31,488
What are you muttering about?

430
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,328
I don't know you at all.

431
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,528
I'm asking you one last time.

432
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,209
Why did my father

433
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,649
send you here?

434
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:39,609
Huan Zong,

435
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:41,449
I came for you.

436
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:42,369
All of this

437
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,728
is an illusion.

438
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,088
Come with me, okay?

439
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:46,889
Let's get out of here now.

440
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:48,728
I'll say it again.

441
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:50,528
I don't know you at all.

442
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:51,929
You don't know me?

443
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,849
How could you not know me?

444
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:54,449
You...

445
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:56,728
Earlier, you

446
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,528
claimed to like me.

447
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,169
But you don't know me now?

448
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:01,449
Don't tell me you've fallen

449
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,568
for Kong Hou?

450
00:22:02,808 --> 00:22:03,528
Yes.

451
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:06,768
I've never met you.

452
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,288
Let alone know you.

453
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,609
And I'd never say such things.

454
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,048
Previously,

455
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:15,768
they told me

456
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:18,048
after entering your inner demon realm,

457
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:19,929
you'd forget me.

458
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,409
I didn't believe them.

459
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:22,808
Huan Zong,

460
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,088
I'm Kong Hou of Yunhua Sect.

461
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:26,649
You're Huan Zong of Liuguang Sect.

462
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:27,728
Everything happened here

463
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:28,768
is all fake.

464
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:29,649
Just your inner demon.

465
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,088
You have to wake up.

466
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:32,969
I've heard of Yunhua Sect

467
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:33,969
and Liuguang Sect.

468
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,568
But what's that to me?

469
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:36,568
You're currently

470
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,088
Lingyou's Second Prince,

471
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:38,849
but

472
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:40,649
that's your former self.

473
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,409
You joined Liuguang Sect later.

474
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:44,889
Okay.

475
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,288
Huan Zong,

476
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:48,969
l-lower your sword first.

477
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,328
Let's discuss in detail, okay?

478
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:57,689
Huan Zong, I...

479
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:00,889
Alright! Alright!

480
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,528
I won't touch you.

481
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:04,808
I just want to tell you the truth.

482
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,209
Everything happened here

483
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,689
is your inner demon.

484
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,088
None of this is real.

485
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:09,808
The real you

486
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:11,768
lies unconscious in the outside world.

487
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:13,008
If you doubt me,

488
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,288
come with me now.

489
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,849
Once we escape here,

490
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,169
everything outside

491
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:18,568
will make sense to you.

492
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,088
Let go.

493
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:21,728
Just come with me.

494
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:22,528
Come with me.

495
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:23,129
Why so strong?

496
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:24,369
Come with me.

497
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:25,969
Why bring me here?

498
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,129
Can't you see

499
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,369
the exit over there?

500
00:23:30,488 --> 00:23:31,689
What exit?

501
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:32,849
Nonsense.

502
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,169
Never mind.

503
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,568
Your blindness matters not.

504
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,008
Just follow me.

505
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:38,808
Again?

506
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:40,409
Are you even a woman?

507
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:41,528
- Go!
- You're so strong.

508
00:23:41,528 --> 00:23:42,248
Let me go.

509
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:43,568
Or I'll have you executed now.

510
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,248
Once we escape,

511
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,369
you'll just thank me.

512
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,169
You'd never punish me then.

513
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:49,849
Let go!

514
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:51,929
Let go!

515
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:58,649
Where is she?

516
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,169
What's going on?

517
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:11,528
It seems

518
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:12,169
Huan Zong can't

519
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,528
come out from this exit.

520
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:15,088
Which means

521
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:17,129
he can't conquer his inner demons.

522
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:27,409
Huan Zong.

523
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:31,328
Huan Zong.

524
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,008
I beg you. Please wake up.

525
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:35,929
I'm begging you.

526
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,889
Don't speak.

527
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:42,488
(He was injured
in the inner demon realm.)

528
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,328
Why are there wounds
appearing outside too?

529
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:47,568
So if you

530
00:24:47,728 --> 00:24:49,449
face danger inside,

531
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:51,849
wouldn't your physical body also...

532
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,088
It seems I can't act rashly yet.

533
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,689
I must enter to find a way.

534
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,849
I will definitely save you.

535
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:06,288
I'll find a way.

536
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:07,528
Wait for me here.

537
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:17,528
It's strange.

538
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,088
Why did she suddenly vanish?

539
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:21,568
Am I seeing things?

540
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,088
Or is this a dream?

541
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:28,288
Your Highness.

542
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:29,328
Don't speak yet.

543
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:32,008
See what's behind me.

544
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:34,649
A wall?

545
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:36,209
Just a wall?

546
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,129
Nothing unusual?

547
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,369
Like an exit perhaps?

548
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:43,328
An exit?

549
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:44,728
There's no exit.

550
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:45,889
Your Highness,

551
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:47,008
what's wrong?

552
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:48,288
No exit?

553
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:49,689
Then what happened?

554
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,728
How did she vanish then?

555
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,048
Your Highness.

556
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:55,889
Why are you here?

557
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,169
We've caught Consort Qi's spy.

558
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,129
Make it discreet.

559
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:01,689
Understood.

560
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:06,649
Let's go.

561
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,369
Come here, my beauty.

562
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:13,129
Come on.

563
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,649
Have a grape.

564
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:22,849
I truly never expected

565
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:25,409
the Second Prince to be more eager

566
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,609
than Your Majesty.

567
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:27,528
He acted so recklessly

568
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,008
in the imperial garden

569
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,048
without fear of being seen.

570
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:33,129
I think

571
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,889
he wanted people to witness this.

572
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,568
What do you imply?

573
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:40,088
I don't understand.

574
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:44,129
He was putting on a show for you.

575
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:45,849
His schemes run deep.

576
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:48,169
He's no ordinary playboy.

577
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:50,369
He's probably harboring resentment.

578
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,369
Your Majesty, you speak wisely.

579
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,008
However,

580
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,689
that palace maid today

581
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:58,808
is quite lovely.

582
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:00,609
Really?

583
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:01,409
Tell me about it.

584
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,288
Your Majesty!

585
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,288
Come on.

586
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,369
I'm just joking.

587
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:10,568
You're the most lovely.

588
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:12,008
You're the most lovely.

589
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:13,328
That's more like it.

590
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:14,609
I was thinking

591
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:16,768
that maid's delicate appearance

592
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,209
might prove useful for us

593
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:19,568
in the future.

594
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:23,129
After all, heroes fall to beauty's trap.

595
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,488
Well said!

596
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:27,889
I'll listen to you.

597
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:29,728
I'll listen to you from now on.

598
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,209
- Your Highness.
- I won't sleep!

599
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:35,288
My brother hasn't

600
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:36,528
told me a story yet.

601
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,889
He still hasn't told me a story yet.

602
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,488
You should retire.

603
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:41,488
Your Highness.

604
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:43,328
I won't sleep! I won't!

605
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,129
What's going on?

606
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:47,248
- Brother, you've finally come.
- Your Highness.

607
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:48,728
Why do you come so late today?

608
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:50,328
I've been waiting for so long.

609
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,248
I had matters to attend.

610
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,409
I was so scared.

611
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:56,889
I thought

612
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:58,768
you'd leave

613
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,288
and never come back just like Mother

614
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:02,008
and the First Prince.

615
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,048
How could that be?

616
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,528
Haven't I come now?

617
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:05,449
Go. Time to sleep.

618
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:06,369
You may leave.

619
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,969
Let's go!

620
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:09,969
Go on. Lie down.

621
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:12,248
Brother,

622
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:13,248
what story will you

623
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:14,528
tell me today?

624
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:17,849
No stories tonight.

625
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:19,088
Instead, I'll share

626
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,008
something personal.

627
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:20,969
Great!

628
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:25,528
Today, I passed by a place

629
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:27,609
and saw a girl

630
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:28,728
(fall down from a tree)

631
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,209
(and I caught her.)

632
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,568
From a tree?

633
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,129
And she told me

634
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:41,328
that we used to be

635
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:42,849
very close friends,

636
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,369
but I somehow forgot her.

637
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:48,929
But I can't recall anything.

638
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:51,929
Why?

639
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,528
How could you forget

640
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:54,689
a close friend?

641
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,008
Was she very sad

642
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,409
and angry?

643
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:01,129
Maybe a little.

644
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,088
Later,

645
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,328
(she took me to a place,)

646
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,768
(saying if I went with her,)

647
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:07,808
(I'd recall everything.)

648
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:08,808
Let go!

649
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:09,849
Can't you see

650
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:10,929
the exit over there?

651
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,369
But there was clearly just a wall

652
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:17,248
in that place.

653
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:19,248
There was no exit at all.

654
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,129
Oddly enough,

655
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:23,929
she walked through the wall

656
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:25,528
and vanished.

657
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:30,808
Don't you find that strange?

658
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:33,568
Brother, she must be

659
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,649
a fairy,

660
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,449
right?

661
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,129
What "fairy"?

662
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:39,488
Yes, she is.

663
00:29:39,808 --> 00:29:40,609
Otherwise,

664
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:41,449
how could she

665
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,768
get into a wall?

666
00:29:42,768 --> 00:29:43,609
Brother,

667
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,248
if you meet her again,

668
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,008
bring me to see her.

669
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,609
I've never seen

670
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,008
a fairy before.

671
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:53,209
Alright.

672
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:54,649
Go to sleep now.

673
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:57,969
Lie properly.

674
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,544
(Zhaoqian Hall)

675
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:07,169
How come it became daytime

676
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:09,048
in the blink of an eye?

677
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:10,488
We've waited days

678
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:11,649
to finally catch you.

679
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:13,369
Let's report back.

680
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,209
What? It's been days?

681
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,528
It's just the blink of an eye.

682
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,088
What "days"?

683
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,048
Move. Stop talking.

684
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:18,609
Let me go.

685
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,048
- Go!
- What are you doing?

686
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:21,528
Let me go!

687
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,409
Your Highness, she's here.

688
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:30,169
Let her in.

689
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,328
Huan Zong!

690
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,369
I told you I could walk myself.

691
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:35,248
Let go.

692
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:48,369
Huan Zong,

693
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:50,369
why are you acting like Jiao Tong,

694
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,088
asking me to get in

695
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:54,048
while still undressed?

696
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:55,328
You may leave.

697
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:56,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

698
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:10,929
After careful consideration these days,

699
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:12,728
I believe you're another spy

700
00:31:12,728 --> 00:31:13,849
sent by my father.

701
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,889
You just can use some witchcraft.

702
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,088
What? A spy?

703
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:20,248
Witchcraft?

704
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:21,129
Are you truly,

705
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,129
as my brother claims,

706
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,528
a fairy?

707
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:25,768
Great.

708
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,568
I'm a fairy this time.

709
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,129
You'd better think carefully.

710
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:37,008
I'm neither a spy

711
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,768
nor a fairy.

712
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:40,048
I'm Kong Hou.

713
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,209
I'm your friend,

714
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,409
Kong Hou.

715
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,969
I'm not lying.

716
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,129
It's just

717
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,088
that you don't remember.

718
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,048
So stubborn.

719
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:52,048
In that case,

720
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:53,048
I have no reason

721
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:54,129
to hold back.

722
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:55,889
Guards!

723
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:58,328
Mark this woman as an assassin

724
00:31:58,488 --> 00:31:59,849
and execute her at once.

725
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:01,008
Wait! Huan Zong,

726
00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:02,129
you can't do this to me.

727
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,088
Y-You...

728
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:03,889
Wait.

729
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:05,728
I have a way

730
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:08,248
to prove I'm your friend.

731
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,088
What?

732
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:13,288
I think I forgot something important.

733
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,248
What's Huan Zong's

734
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:14,889
inner demon?

735
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,169
(Could his inner demon)

736
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:17,288
(be Jiusu?)

737
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,808
(Probably not.)

738
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:20,088
Are you okay?

739
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:20,969
If I know

740
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,169
what his inner demon is,

741
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:22,969
would I not say it?

742
00:32:22,969 --> 00:32:23,728
Serving him so long

743
00:32:23,728 --> 00:32:24,689
and still don't know?

744
00:32:24,689 --> 00:32:25,189
I...

745
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:27,568
(When I first met him,)

746
00:32:27,568 --> 00:32:29,248
(he'd been at Liuguang Sect for long.)

747
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:29,808
(He's always)

748
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:30,969
(been like this.)

749
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:31,689
(No one dares ask)

750
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:32,849
(about previous things.)

751
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:35,088
Well, Master Song He

752
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:35,768
once said

753
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:36,449
before joining

754
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:37,889
Liuguang Sect,

755
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,209
he went through terrible things.

756
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,328
It looks like I'll have
to take it step by step

757
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,929
after I enter.

758
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:44,808
Oh, right, Kong Hou.

759
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:45,369
Well...

760
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:46,969
Move aside!

761
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:48,568
Well, Kong Hou.

762
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,328
Though I don't know

763
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,008
Young Master's inner demon,

764
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:52,528
I do know one of his secrets.

765
00:32:52,528 --> 00:32:53,889
When you go in,

766
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:54,409
you...

767
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:55,328
Move aside!

768
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:56,488
If he doesn't know you

769
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:57,248
after you go in,

770
00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:57,969
just tell him...

771
00:32:57,969 --> 00:32:58,568
You just...

772
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,929
Come on. You just...

773
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:01,609
You just tell him...

774
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:03,409
I know

775
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:05,288
there is a mole on your butt.

776
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:06,609
Maybe let me

777
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,929
come in and check for myself?

778
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:08,929
Then we'll know!

779
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:11,209
Bei Jun.

780
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:13,209
You leave too.

781
00:33:13,488 --> 00:33:14,169
Yes.

782
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:20,649
Huan Zong,

783
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,129
now you believe me, right?

784
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,528
What else do you know?

785
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:24,409
Keep talking.

786
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:26,449
I also know

787
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,169
you love wearing white.

788
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,248
That counts?

789
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:31,169
You value cleanliness,

790
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:31,889
so

791
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:32,969
you forbid food

792
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,169
in your chambers.

793
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:35,169
Also,

794
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,528
you've been particular

795
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,209
when it comes to tea.

796
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:39,849
You use morning dew

797
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,129
from pine needles to brew your tea.

798
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:44,169
No peach blossoms,

799
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,129
snow plums,

800
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:46,369
or lilies allowed.

801
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:48,088
My father has really gone

802
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:49,008
to great lengths

803
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,129
just to get you close to me.

804
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:52,689
He even told you

805
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,528
such things in detail.

806
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:57,008
He must value you greatly.

807
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:02,728
Since my father values you so,

808
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,248
I shouldn't

809
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,488
kill you so easily.

810
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:06,849
What logic is that?

811
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:08,608
Why can't you kill me

812
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,048
because he values me greatly?

813
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,889
What?

814
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:12,449
Do you want to be killed?

815
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,729
Yearning for death?

816
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,048
No! I don't!

817
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:19,208
Well then. Just call me a spy.

818
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:27,648
My lady,

819
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:28,929
starting today,

820
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,289
you'll be residing here.

821
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:32,208
Here?

822
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,329
(Didn't Huan Zong)

823
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,088
(consider me a spy?)

824
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:39,088
(Yet he arranged
such luxurious quarters for me?)

825
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,608
(What's his real agenda?)

826
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,809
My lady,

827
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:44,688
all these are gifts

828
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:46,249
from the Second Prince himself.

829
00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:47,969
Don't you know?

830
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,648
Throughout these years,

831
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:50,729
the Second Prince

832
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,208
has never kept female company.

833
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,849
You're the first one.

834
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:55,409
If you manage

835
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,249
to win his favor,

836
00:34:57,249 --> 00:34:58,369
a formal title

837
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,889
might be in your future.

838
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,688
When that day comes,

839
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:03,289
do remember me please.

840
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:04,289
Sir,

841
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,769
you misunderstood.

842
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,488
I-I don't need these.

843
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:08,800
My relationship with Huan...

844
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,648
with the Second Prince

845
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,249
isn't what you imagine.

846
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,329
Consort Qi heard the Second Prince

847
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,249
found a beauty,

848
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,449
and sends her blessings.

849
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:19,648
This...

850
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,488
What absurd nonsense!

851
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:27,648
(Huan Zong is the Second Prince?)

852
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:29,409
(So what the maids said)

853
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,409
(about the Empress
being killed by her consort)

854
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:33,488
(means his father murdered his mother?)

855
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:35,688
(Also, the Emperor killed his brother,)

856
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:36,969
(making him oversee execution?)

857
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,008
(Oh, my.)

858
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:39,608
(How monstrous!)

859
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,289
(So could Huan Zong's inner demon)

860
00:35:41,488 --> 00:35:42,568
(stem from his failure)

861
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:44,409
(to kill his father for vengeance?)

862
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:47,208
(Then can I help him)

863
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,369
(overcome his inner demon)

864
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:49,329
(by helping him)

865
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,088
(kill the Emperor?)

866
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:53,889
(Or must he do it himself?)

867
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:00,369
What's on your mind?

868
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,409
You're so absorbed.

869
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,088
Thinking of you.

870
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:03,568
Huan Zong, why are you here?

871
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:06,889
No wonder

872
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:08,088
my father chose a rare gem.

873
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:09,289
You're truly different.

874
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:10,929
Even your words drip honey.

875
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,369
No,

876
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:13,568
that's not what I meant.

877
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:14,409
You misunderstood.

878
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:15,568
I...

879
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,488
So what do you mean?

880
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,488
Huan Zong, you...

881
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:25,369
Y-You've been drinking?

882
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,929
Let go of me, Huan Zong.

883
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:28,488
No.

884
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,168
Huan Zong, let me go.

885
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:31,688
- Huan Zong.
- Didn't my father send you here

886
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:33,449
for this?

887
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,048
Huan Zong.

888
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:34,969
- Go tell my father.
- Huan Zong.

889
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:36,048
Don't do this.

890
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:37,769
This is typical of the Second Prince,

891
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,488
wallowing in debauchery

892
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:41,208
and neglecting his duties.

893
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,208
Let me go!

894
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,249
Let go?

895
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:45,008
Huan Zong, don't do this.

896
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:45,809
Huan Zong.

897
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:47,769
Huan Zong, let me go.

898
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:48,688
Huan Zong.

899
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:50,648
Huan Zong, don't.

900
00:36:50,648 --> 00:36:51,369
Huan Zong.

901
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:52,168
Huan Zong.

902
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,249
Snap out of it, Huan Zong!

903
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,249
Huan Zong!

904
00:36:58,809 --> 00:36:59,889
Huan Zong!

905
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:04,168
Huan Zong!

906
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,409
(Huan Zong is now controlled
by his inner demons.)

907
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,809
(This isn't his true nature.)

908
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:29,769
Huan Zong.

909
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:33,409
What happened

910
00:37:33,409 --> 00:37:35,128
to you today?

911
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:53,889
Brother.

912
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,608
