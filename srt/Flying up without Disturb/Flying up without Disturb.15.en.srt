=Episode 15=

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,079
Your Highness,

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,079
you look full of vitality.

18
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,719
Did you sleep well last night?

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,919
Well enough.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,520
Huan Zong.

21
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,120
Last night...

22
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,240
Last night, you didn't serve me well.

23
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Starting today,

24
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,760
you'll become a palace maid.

25
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,840
This uniform looks hideous.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,759
Stay close.

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,279
Must you be so talkative?

28
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,640
No, brother...

29
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,599
What did you call me?

30
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:23,080
No, sir.

31
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,240
Think about it.

32
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,640
The color of this uniform

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,039
is truly tacky.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
If I dressed better,

35
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,680
wouldn't I work

36
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,800
with more enthusiasm?

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,599
What?

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,439
You want to wear

39
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,159
royal attendant's garments?

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,999
No. I wouldn't dare.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,319
Remember.

42
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,960
Serving the Second Prince

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,759
is a great honor for you.

44
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,680
Yes.

45
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,039
Then could you tell me

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
what the Second Prince normally likes

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
to eat

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,479
or to do for fun?

49
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,640
You dare investigate the Second Prince?

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,039
(Huan Zong already suspects me)

51
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,360
(of being the Emperor's spy.)

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
(If rumors spread about me)

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,159
(inquiring about him,
it'd be disastrous.)

54
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,360
No, not really.

55
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,759
I simply wanted

56
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,680
to better understand

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,999
how to serve him.

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,719
Memorize the palace rules

59
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,840
and avoid trouble.

60
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,080
Remember.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,159
Starting today,

62
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,200
this uniform

63
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,120
is your access token.

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,640
You can only serve the Second Prince.

65
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,520
If you disturb His Majesty

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,159
or nobles from other palaces,

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,200
it might cost your life.

68
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,640
Yes.

69
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,080
(How can I kill the Emperor if I can't)

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
(reach his chambers?)

71
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:27,999
(I can't)

72
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,279
(use my spiritual energy here.)

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,920
(If I actually get beheaded...)

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,680
(Forget it.)

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,240
(I'd better find another way first.)

76
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,640
Your Highness.

77
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,599
What happened?

78
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,279
No. Nothing.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,719
Since you're awake,

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
let me attend to your washing, okay?

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,840
The cloth.

82
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,560
Clumsy.

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,239
What's that smell?

84
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,919
The sandalwood scent from the table.

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,279
You're using a table-cleaning rag

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
to wipe my hands?

87
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,000
Let me wipe your hands.

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,960
Stay back.

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,359
Your clothes are dirtier than rags.

90
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:40,239
Go away!

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,880
Your Highness,

92
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,880
grant me a chance

93
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,440
to redeem myself, please?

94
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:49,719
No need.

95
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,000
Why so polite with me?

96
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,479
Come on. Sit properly.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Gently!

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
Sorry. My mistake.

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,599
It hurts!

100
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,799
Alight.

101
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm skilled at hairstyling.

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,039
I told you it hurts. How dare you!

103
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,279
With your handling,

104
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,320
I'll go bald.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,400
But tight styling

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,239
makes you look dashing,

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,000
right?

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,239
In all my years,

109
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,760
I've never dressed in this way before.

110
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,520
Your skill is impressive.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,520
You flatter me.

112
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,760
You flatter me.

113
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:06,279
What's this?

114
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,039
If I'm not mistaken,

115
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,560
these should be porcelain shards
from a vase.

116
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,760
But I really didn't mean to.

117
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,919
I just

118
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,320
broke this vase by accident.

119
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,080
Besides,

120
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,080
these tiny fragments

121
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,440
can't possibly hurt anyone.

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes, they can't cause harm,

123
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,159
but they reveal your carelessness.

124
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,359
Clean this up.

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,679
Got it.

126
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
Stop grabbing.

127
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,479
I brought plenty.

128
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,239
Enough for all.

129
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,560
Look.

130
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,200
The spy the Emperor sent this time

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
acts utterly bizarre.

132
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,760
Why hasn't she asked us

133
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,799
where the Second Prince is

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
but just feeding fish here?

135
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,440
Keep your voice down.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Let her do

137
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,599
whatever she wants.

138
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,799
We'll simply report everything
to His Highness.

139
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,080
You've

140
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,520
eaten my fish food.

141
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Now, help me analyze this situation.

142
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
It seems

143
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,279
I won't be able

144
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,719
to kill the Emperor for now.

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,320
But I can't just randomly make

146
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,039
Huan Zong kill his own father either.

147
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,359
That's beyond unreasonable.

148
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,840
He still doesn't trust me now.

149
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,640
If I act recklessly,

150
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,719
might I end up harming him?

151
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,080
No.

152
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,279
I have to find another way.

153
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,640
I must make Huan Zong remember me.

154
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,640
If he could remember me,

155
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,479
he'd realize

156
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,799
everything here

157
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,279
is completely fake.

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,159
He's so smart.

159
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,760
He will surely break his inner demon.

160
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,080
But

161
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,880
how can I make him remember me?

162
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,599
Thanks, Fish.

163
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,560
When this is over,

164
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,560
food will be endless.

165
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,119
That spy

166
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,160
fed fish all morning?

167
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,359
Yes.

168
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,759
Also,

169
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,479
after His Highness attended court,

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,239
she claimed

171
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,239
she was still hungry

172
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,519
and ate a lot of food in the kitchen.

173
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,879
She even ate all your pastries

174
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,920
meant for today.

175
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,999
Since you said

176
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,639
she could do whatever she wants,

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,479
we didn't dare stop her.

178
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,320
What

179
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,960
a novel tactic.

180
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
What are you doing here alone?

181
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,320
Your Highness,

182
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,399
come look.

183
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,160
All the koi fish are belly-up.

184
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
They're all dead.

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,280
You poisoned these fish.

186
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,399
No.

187
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
I didn't poison them.

188
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,960
I don't know what happened.

189
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,239
What scheme...

190
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,160
What scheme are you brewing?

191
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,560
How could you think

192
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,119
of ambushing me in a way like that?

193
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,040
Choose a deeper pond next time.

194
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,999
This one's too shallow to drown in.

195
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,200
I truly never intended to harm you.

196
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,280
I just

197
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,200
wanted

198
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
to help you recall

199
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,999
what happened in the past.

200
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,119
You mentioned earlier

201
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,840
wanting to help me recall the past.

202
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,759
What is it?

203
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm warning you.

204
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,759
You should make the story

205
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,999
more convincing this time.

206
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,639
I'm telling the truth.

207
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,599
Back then,

208
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,800
I was chasing a scavenger

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,479
when I accidentally tumbled

210
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,599
down a hillside.

211
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,359
Then

212
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,399
you appeared by the riverside

213
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,759
with your attendant named Lin Hu.

214
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,040
I haven't heard
of the name Lin Hu before.

215
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,040
No.

216
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,080
Back then, I was

217
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,440
focused on catching the scavenger.

218
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,639
I fell into the water

219
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,999
and dragged you in with me.

220
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,519
Then accidentally...

221
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,879
Accidentally, I pulled your clothes

222
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,239
right off.

223
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,800
Y-You don't remember now.

224
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,160
Alright, enough.

225
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,359
Stop talking.

226
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,080
Wait, there's more...

227
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,040
That was our

228
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
first encounter.

229
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,960
You were on that street.

230
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Because of your handsome looks,

231
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,119
the Nascent Soul Elder

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,800
tried to harass you publicly.

233
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,840
If you can't recall, let it be.

234
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,560
No need to be so harsh.

235
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,960
Nonsense.

236
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,080
I...

237
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,080
I was telling the truth.

238
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,359
It seems my falling in water

239
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,800
still can't make Huan Zong

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
remember me.

241
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,359
I need another plan.

242
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,320
Something bolder and grander,

243
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,840
which will force Huan Zong

244
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,160
to remember me.

245
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,119
Guess the palace

246
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,639
doesn't have those things.

247
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,080
To make you feel

248
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,759
the same stab in the back

249
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,680
you did at Yuanji Sect,

250
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,680
I have to do this.

251
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,840
Blame imperial palace

252
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,359
for lacking real toxins.

253
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,320
What're you doing here?

254
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,239
Nothing.

255
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,359
I did nothing.

256
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,759
Nothing.

257
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,239
Nothing?

258
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,719
I really don't understand

259
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,399
what Father was thinking.

260
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:08,359
Why did he send you here?

261
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
Even if you wanted to harm me,

262
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,719
couldn't you use some brains?

263
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,119
A foot-dead goldfish pond

264
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,160
to drown me?

265
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:15,479
Fingernail-sized

266
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:16,160
rose thorns

267
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
to stab me?

268
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,119
I've never seen

269
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,840
a spy as inept as you.

270
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,879
Right?

271
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
I told you

272
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,560
I'm not a spy.

273
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,800
I said you're inept,

274
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
not that you're not a spy.

275
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,560
Had you trusted me,

276
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,359
I wouldn't need

277
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,479
to make all these messes.

278
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,280
That wooden head of yours

279
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,040
never gains wisdom.

280
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
Now it's my fault?

281
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,920
Of course!

282
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
It's all your fault.

283
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:38,879
But

284
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,399
you did protect me

285
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,440
and got injured.

286
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:43,560
So I'll

287
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,920
let it slide.

288
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,960
Alright.

289
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm swamped with duties.

290
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,840
I have no time for your games.

291
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,479
Keep quiet

292
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,800
and work in the stables.

293
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,879
You don't trust me anyway.

294
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,200
Anywhere is the same.

295
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,119
The stables...

296
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,800
What? Stables?

297
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:11,519
From now on,

298
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,080
you'll manage this place alone.

299
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,440
By myself?

300
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,639
S-Such a...

301
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,879
From now on,

302
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,200
let's get along well.

303
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,359
Tell me.

304
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,560
Huan Zong's too cruel to me.

305
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,920
He abandoned me alone

306
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
in this filthy stable.

307
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,759
Oh, horse.

308
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,639
Tell me.

309
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
How on earth

310
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,080
can I make him remember me?

311
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,320
Now, he doesn't

312
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,599
show me any kindness.

313
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,440
I can't

314
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,119
let this continue.

315
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,239
Why won't even you talk to me?

316
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,080
You

317
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,879
are just like Huan Zong.

318
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,160
You are heartless

319
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,239
and have a poor memory.

320
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,920
Stable hand.

321
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,599
Go feed my horse.

322
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,680
When it clears up,

323
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
give it proper grooming.

324
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,280
This horse is magnificently sturdy.

325
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,399
It looks extraordinary.

326
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,599
Where did Huan Zong get it?

327
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,280
It's a gift

328
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,599
from his colleague.

329
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,519
But why

330
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:27,239
would they

331
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,399
gift the Second Prince?

332
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,879
Don't meddle in his affairs.

333
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,999
Just tend to this horse properly.

334
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,800
Here.

335
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,999
Besides basic care,

336
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,359
she sometimes argues with horses,

337
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,119
and even

338
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,800
decorated your favorite horse

339
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,040
with ornaments.

340
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,519
Tell me.

341
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,160
Why is she doing

342
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,719
all these absurd things?

343
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,479
Your Highness, please enlighten me.

344
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,359
I can't figure it out.

345
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
The crucial point is
her nonsensical claims

346
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,280
sound oddly plausible.

347
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,800
Your Highness,

348
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
having served you for years,

349
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,399
I've never seen

350
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,280
someone so bizarre.

351
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Could her words be true?

352
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,560
Tell me.

353
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,359
Since awakening from my coma,

354
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,639
have I ever experienced

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,680
memory lapses

356
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,080
regarding past events?

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,119
Your Highness,

358
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,080
I've been by your side since childhood.

359
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,800
If you truly couldn't remember

360
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
past occurrences,

361
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,200
how would you still recognize me?

362
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,359
You're the new maid

363
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,720
managing stables

364
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,480
for my brother?

365
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,560
Your brother?

366
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,439
Who are you?

367
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,240
Presumptuous!

368
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,320
You dare not bow to the Crown Prince?

369
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,599
Greetings, Your Highness.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,159
I heard my brother

371
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,760
acquired a fine horse.

372
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:31,520
Where is it?

373
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,959
I want to ride it.

374
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,359
Make it gallop.

375
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,280
Make it gallop.

376
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,000
Faster! Faster!

377
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,280
Faster!

378
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,480
Your Highness,

379
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,439
this horse is new here

380
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,879
and unaccustomed to this place.

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,320
Faster! Faster!

382
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,199
Your Highness,

383
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,560
the horse remains untamed.

384
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,879
Ride with caution.

385
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,560
I dropped something.

386
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,800
Help me dismount.

387
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,840
Slow down, Your Highness.

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,439
My brother give it to me before.

389
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:07,520
Please stop crying.

390
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,359
Such distress

391
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,560
harms your health.

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,000
My brother give it to me before.

393
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,639
It's merely a dough figurine.

394
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Stop crying.

395
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:17,679
Alright. It's okay.

396
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,040
No more tears!

397
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,720
(Would Huan Zong be as lively)

398
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,840
(and adorable as him)

399
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,000
(when he was a kid?)

400
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,119
(But why has he)

401
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:43,919
(become so...)

402
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,520
Tell me

403
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,480
your other desires.

404
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,720
I can craft anything for you.

405
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,959
If you can imagine it,

406
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,439
I can shape it.

407
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,959
Really?

408
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,919
Yes.

409
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,199
Then I want...

410
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,760
I...

411
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,840
Whatever I want,

412
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,760
it won't be the same one anymore.

413
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
That's easy.

414
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,879
You can ask Huan...

415
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,599
You can ask the Second Prince

416
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,919
to shape you a new one,

417
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:15,480
right?

418
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,040
After Mother passed away,

419
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,320
my brother became well-occupied.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,040
No one ever plays with me normally.

421
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,919
The eunuchs and bodyguards around me

422
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,359
only repeat these phrases.

423
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,040
Be careful, Your Highness.

424
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,480
Don't cry, Your Highness.

425
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,199
How utterly tedious.

426
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,879
How about this?

427
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,119
Just tell me

428
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,959
what you want to eat

429
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,359
and what you want to play.

430
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:46,919
I

431
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,159
will make sure to fulfill them all.

432
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,240
Really?

433
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

434
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,399
What happened next?

435
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,040
Did Master Zhong Xi catch that beast?

436
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,280
Of course, he did.

437
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,560
Master Zhong Xi

438
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,679
thrust his sword at the beast.

439
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,000
What's going on?

440
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,159
Let me down!

441
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,520
Your Highness, stay calm.

442
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,199
Brother! Brother!

443
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,439
I won't let you get hurt.

444
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,639
Brother! Brother!

445
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
Your Highness! Someone!

446
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,439
Is the Crown Prince injured?

447
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,080
Your Highness, please rest assured.

448
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,520
His Highness merely suffered shock.

449
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,199
No physical harm done.

450
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,919
He'll awaken after some rest.

451
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:54,919
You may leave.

452
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,679
Understood.

453
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,240
Your Highness,

454
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,199
the spy has been awake.

455
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:48,760
Huan Zong.

456
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:50,959
What is this place?

457
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,439
Do you know

458
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,080
why you're here?

459
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,320
I...

460
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,199
I seemed

461
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,560
to take your brother horseback riding.

462
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,679
Then the horse got spooked

463
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
and went wild suddenly,

464
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,560
throwing us both off.

465
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,359
Your brother, the Crown Prince...

466
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,879
Is he alright?

467
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,080
Was he injured?

468
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,800
You tell me.

469
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,480
Do you wish him injured or not?

470
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,639
I don't understand.

471
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,639
What are you implying?

472
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
You don't understand?

473
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
Did my father send you here?

474
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,560
After merely

475
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,520
ignoring you for a few days,

476
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,560
you couldn't wait anymore?

477
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,639
Huan Zong, please listen.

478
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,639
There must be

479
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,159
some misunderstanding here.

480
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,399
Misunderstanding?

481
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,240
If you have schemes,

482
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,879
direct them at me.

483
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:58,439
Why are you targeting a child?

484
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,240
He's only six.

485
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,000
He needs coaxing to finish meals,

486
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,639
and cries from nightmares.

487
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,760
How could you hurt him?

488
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,679
How could I do that?

489
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,080
I didn't.

490
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,480
How could I harm him?

491
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,879
I-I'm truly didn't.

492
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,399
Stop pretending.

493
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:16,399
I'll say it one last time.

494
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,199
If you have schemes in the future,

495
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,280
direct them at me.

496
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,720
Touch my brother again,

497
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,840
and I'll make sure you leave no remains.

498
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:24,840
Huan Zong,

499
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,639
I meant no harm.

500
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,919
Trust me.

501
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:30,679
Not talking?

502
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,720
You do have some backbone.

503
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:39,480
Fine.

504
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,480
Bei Jun.

505
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:52,720
Huan Zong,

506
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,320
what're you doing?

507
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,439
What are you doing? Let me go.

508
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,520
I never harm women.

509
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:03,359
But first,

510
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,919
she can't harm my family.

511
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,599
I didn't.

512
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,119
I swear it wasn't me.

513
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:10,240
Growing up in the imperial palace,

514
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,800
I learned one fundamental truth.

515
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,359
Words spoken too easily

516
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,199
should never be trusted.

517
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,399
I'm truly not a spy.

518
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:19,359
Trust me.

519
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,119
Bei Jun,

520
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
choose something you can wield.

521
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,240
What are you trying to do?

522
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,359
Huan Zong,

523
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,080
I would never harm your brother.

524
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:37,000
I'd advise you to stop holding out.

525
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,599
Since you've already decided

526
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm a spy sent by your father,

527
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,399
why bother interrogating me?

528
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,599
Don't worry.

529
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,320
I won't kill you now.

530
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,639
It's not the time yet.

531
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,879
But I can make you suffer.

532
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,639
Let him watch helplessly.

533
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,080
That would be great.

534
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,159
Instead of wasting time,

535
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:58,760
you should

536
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,359
investigate

537
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,320
why that horse

538
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,480
suddenly went mad.

539
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,560
Take her elsewhere to cool off.

540
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,639
When the time comes, think carefully

541
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,159
before speaking to me.

542
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,080
If I'm feeling generous,

543
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,560
I might grant you an intact corpse.

544
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,119
What will make you believe me?

545
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,919
If my father asks

546
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,879
how you met your end,

547
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,919
I'll first feign grief.

548
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,480
I learned it from you.

549
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,599
Then I'll tell him you stumbled
into the dungeon.

550
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,159
Servants tried to find you but failed.

551
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,560
When they found you,

552
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,320
you were already lifeless.

553
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,520
Stay here.

554
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,159
Huan Zong.

555
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,000
Huan Zong.

556
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,840
Bei Jun,

557
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
kill that maddened horse.

558
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,639
Have a coroner examine it thoroughly.

559
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,399
Understood.

560
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,439
So cold.

561
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,879
Huan Zong.

562
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,599
It's freezing here.

563
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,080
It's truly freezing here.

564
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,879
Let me out.

565
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,119
No.

566
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,679
If I use my spiritual energy now,

567
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
all previous efforts will be wasted.

568
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,560
I can't do this.

569
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,439
No.

570
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,240
I need to find another way.

571
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,919
I need to calm down.

572
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,480
I need to calm down.

573
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,760
Think of a way.

574
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,320
Huan Zong,

575
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,080
I will get you out of here.

576
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,080
Think again.

577
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,119
Find another way.

578
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Huan Zong.

579
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,399
Brother.

580
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,040
Brother.

581
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,399
The Crown Prince is awake!

582
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,879
Truly Heaven's blessing.

583
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,119
Heaven's blessing.

584
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,040
Brother.

585
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:09,879
Get the physician.

586
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes.

587
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,919
How do you feel?

588
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,720
Brother.

589
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,040
The Crown Prince is out of danger.

590
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,119
I will prescribe

591
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,240
some calming herbs

592
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,679
for His Highness.

593
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:29,520
Hush. You've just awakened.

594
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,280
Any other instructions?

595
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,399
His Highness is young
and impressionable.

596
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,280
But his constitution
ensures swift recovery.

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,919
I take my leave.

598
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,320
Brother,

599
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,399
the physician said I'm fine.

600
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm truly fine.

601
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:51,639
Alright.

602
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,480
Rest a while longer.

603
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,240
Do you remember

604
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,560
what happened back then?

605
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Everything was normal at first.

606
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
Then the horse suddenly went mad.

607
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,439
Oh, right.

608
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:13,800
How is that

609
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,919
palace maid now?

610
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
The palace maid?

611
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,959
Yes.

612
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,199
The horse suddenly went mad

613
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
and tried to throw us off.

614
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,480
It couldn't be stopped at all.

615
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
When we fell down,

616
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,840
it was that palace maid

617
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,679
who shielded me with her body.

618
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,639
She saved me.

619
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,879
If not for her,

620
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,159
I might have been injured.

621
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,560
That palace maid saved you?

622
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,439
Brother,

623
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,599
where is that palace maid

624
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,639
right now?

625
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:43,679
How is she?

626
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
Is she injured?

627
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,720
Your Highness,

628
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,679
the coroner is here.

629
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,199
Got it.

630
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:54,800
Your Highness,

631
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,040
this is what I found

632
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,320
in the stomach of that spooked

633
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:57,899
horse.

634
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,199
Any abnormalities?

635
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,840
Yes.

636
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,560
This is a poisonous herb

637
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,599
called Bell Grass.

638
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,879
When animals consume it,

639
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:04,760
they go mad.

640
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,199
But this grass has a peculiar trait.

641
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,760
Horses don't show symptoms

642
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,159
right after eating it.

643
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,000
It won't act

644
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,199
until seven to ten days later,

645
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:19,080
after it's fully absorbed

646
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,879
by the body.

647
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,480
Seven to ten days?

648
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:22,320
Are you sure?

649
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,439
Yes, I am.

650
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:24,760
Based on the state

651
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,199
of this grass in the horse stomach,

652
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,720
it had been present

653
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,959
about seven to ten days.

654
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,240
Your Highness,

655
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,240
you scheduled

656
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
to ride it tomorrow

657
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,280
to meet Duke Ning

658
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,439
and other officials.

659
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,959
You may leave.

660
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,399
Bei Jun,

661
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,040
how long has Kong Hou
been at the stables?

662
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,439
You only sent her there

663
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
two days ago.

664
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,639
That decision

665
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:53,959
was impulsive.

666
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,320
Only two days have passed,

667
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,119
yet the poison grass...

668
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,439
It seems I've wronged her.

669
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,720
Once I get him out of here,

670
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:11,760
everything

671
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,119
will be alright.

672
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,320
Wake up.

673
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,679
Huan Zong.

674
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,879
Huan Zong,

675
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,560
trust me.

676
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,480
I truly never intended to harm you

677
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:39,679
or your brother.

678
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,720
I know.

679
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,359
Truly.

680
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,599
I wrongfully accused you.

681
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,359
Trust me.

682
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,280
What's going on?

683
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,320
Huan Zong.

684
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
Huan Zong, what's wrong?

685
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,399
What is this?

686
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,879
What's happening, Huan Zong?

687
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,199
Huan Zong.

688
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,119
Let's get out first.

689
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,159
Leave this place.

690
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
What are you doing?

691
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,000
Digging a tunnel.

692
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,280
Why dig a tunnel?

693
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,320
To escape, obviously.

694
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,840
You fool.

695
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
You think locking me up...

696
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:11,800
Never again.

697
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,879
Trying to imprison me?

698
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,720
Haven't measured your own worth?

699
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,919
Running quite fast.

700
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,039
Care for another round?

701
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,479
Be careful.

702
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,999
Wait, hold on.

703
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,559
W-What are you doing?

704
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:43,079
Look.

705
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,479
Sending you on your final journey.

706
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,320
Final journey?

707
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,999
Where to?

708
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,160
To lush pastures

709
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,359
where you'll surely become

710
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:51,800
enlightened souls

711
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,959
free from wicked desires.

712
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,359
Isn't that

713
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
sending us to the underworld?

714
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,079
I don't want to die.

715
00:34:59,079 --> 00:34:59,840
Brother,

716
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,879
I don't want to die!

717
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,399
Shut up! Stop crying!

718
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:04,079
We both serve the Lord.

719
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,439
If he dares hurt us,

720
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,959
the Lord will never spare him.

721
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,079
I don't care who that Lord is

722
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,959
or whether he will spare me.

723
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,680
You won't live to see it anyway.

724
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,600
I can redeem myself right now.

725
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,399
Shut your mouth!

726
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,280
I can still contribute

727
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,439
a lot to Lingyou Realm.

728
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,479
Don't kill me!

729
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,399
That was quick.

730
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,720
Listen well.

731
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,600
Take these two back.

732
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,840
If they cause any trouble on the way,

733
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,559
execute them on the spot.

734
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,999
Let's go.

735
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:30,959
As long as you spare us,

736
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:31,720
we'll do anything.

737
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,840
Of course. Anything.

738
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,320
Huan Zong.

739
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,600

Huan Zong.

746
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,120
It's really you.

747
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,519
So

748
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,519
you've been by my side all along.

749
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,039
Am I dreaming?

750
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,720

Leave it. I'll handle it.

755
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:42,680

Come on. Take it slowly.

764
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,999
How long was I asleep?

765
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,320
Three days already.

766
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,320

767
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,879
never wake up.

768
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,800
Three days?

769
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,399
Huan Zong.

770
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,079
Trust me.

771
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,999

I wrongfully accused you.

775
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,399
The Second Prince
asks about you every day.

776
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,160
Thankfully...

777
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,720
He comes every day to ask about me?

778
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,959
Could it be

779
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:21,120
he's remembering me?

780
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,280
My lady, you still have a fever.

781
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,879
- I'm fine.
- You still...

782
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm fine.

783
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,320
Huan Zong,

784
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,999
I was just about to look for you.

785
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,079
Three days of fever.

786
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,559
I thought you might never wake up.

787
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,519
Yet here you walk barefoot.

788
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:45,959
You've fully recovered?

789
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,720
Huan Zong,

790
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,479
did you come to see me

791
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,959
because you have remembered me?

792
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:50,919
Right?

793
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,359
No.

794
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:56,919
But I'm certain now

795
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:57,919
that the incident had

796
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:58,840
nothing to do with you.

797
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,120
True enough.

798
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,240
If you had remembered me,

799
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,919
you wouldn't have locked me
in the ice cave

800
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,320
and treated me so cruelly.

801
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,359
Do your injuries still pain you?

802
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,079
It hurts. How could it not?

803
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:19,120
Though this is the inner demon realm,

804
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,479
it still

805
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,840
hurts badly.

806
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,240
Every part of me aches.

807
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:27,720
I misunderstood you.

808
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:28,760
I'm sorry.

809
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,999
Is that all?

810
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,120
I

811
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,999
can make amends.

812
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,879
My lady,

813
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,519
His Highness had the imperial kitchen

814
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,640
prepare this tonic meal.

815
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,640
Please dine.

816
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,160
Come on.

817
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,399
Take your time.

818
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,160
He didn't investigate properly

819
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,280
before resorting to torture.

820
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,439
He thinks he can

821
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,879
dismiss me with a single meal?

822
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,640
Does he look down on me so easily?

823
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,240
Utterly ungrateful.

824
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,640
Your Highness,

825
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,439
you barged into a lady's chamber
so casually.

826
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:52,600
Don't you know the propriety

827
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,399
between genders?

828
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,919
I'm here

829
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,439
to find out how this

830
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,919
can be settled?

831
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
Your Highness,

832
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,399
you speak too lightly.

833
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,919
You slap someone,

834
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,280
and then offer a sweet favor.

835
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,039
Do you expect them

836
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,079
to eagerly present their cheek again

837
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,120
for another slap?

838
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
Don't be so ungrateful.

839
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,999
I've always believed

840
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,519
that sincerity and understanding

841
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,760
must be mutual.

842
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,479
If Your Highness

843
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,640
truly carries remorse,

844
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,160
I would have sensed it already.

845
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,760
Yet now, I feel nothing.

846
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,399
Your Highness,

847
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,720
please take your leave.

848
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,079
What are you doing?

849
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,280
Then just wait and see

850
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,479
my sincerity.

851
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,359
Let it begin.

852
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,320
You do it.

853
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,800
No, you do it.

854
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,280
- No.
- You do it.

855
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,359
- You can do it.
- You do it.

856
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,720
Why the hesitation?

857
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,479
Bei Jun, you'd do it.

858
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:07,840
Your Highness,

859
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:09,359
should I truly strike?

860
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:11,079
Do it.
