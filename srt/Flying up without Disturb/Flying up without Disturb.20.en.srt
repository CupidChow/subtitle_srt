16
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:46,249
Wait here.

17
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:46,928
Yes.

18
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,488
The Jiusu now

19
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,809
is different from before.

20
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,249
It's critical.

21
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:54,768
I understand.

22
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,329
Fortunately we only need

23
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,449
the Dragonblood Herb now

24
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:58,529
to have all ingredients

25
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,488
and restore your spiritual core.

26
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:01,729
Be extremely careful.

27
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,249
I'll wait here for your return.

28
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:08,968
By the way,

29
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,289
I almost forgot this.

30
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,849
This boosts spiritual energy.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,449
This one

32
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,409
heals external wounds.

33
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,129
And this.

34
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:18,129
It's very effective.

35
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:19,449
Take all of them.

36
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:24,648
These should suffice.

37
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:26,688
Don't worry about me.

38
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,329
I'll be back soon.

39
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:32,968
Ling Hui.

40
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,729
Ling Hui.

41
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,088
What's wrong, Tan Feng?

42
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,329
It's Kong Hou's message.

43
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,208
She's safely

44
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,329
exited the secret realm.

45
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:38,968
Really?

46
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:39,808
Excellent.

47
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:42,488
What's the matter?

48
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,208
That Chi Si was actually Jiusu.

49
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:45,368
He infiltrated the group.

50
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,208
Huan Zong is leading a pursuit now.

51
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:50,808
Thankfully Kong Hou is safe.

52
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:52,648
Kong Hou is safe.

53
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:54,169
Shouldn't you be happy?

54
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:55,449
Kong Hou's safe.

55
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,569
Of course I'm relieved.

56
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:57,569
I nearly cried

57
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,808
getting the message earlier.

58
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:00,129
But did you forget?

59
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:01,729
When Master ordered me

60
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:02,609
to bring her back,

61
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,729
I pretended not to hear.

62
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:04,648
If he finds out now

63
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:05,688
she met Jiusu,

64
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,088
I'll be... I'll be...

65
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:09,768
True.

66
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,368
With his temper,

67
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,849
you're in deep trouble.

68
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:16,049
Alright.

69
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,488
Just beg for his mercy.

70
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:18,569
Perhaps he'll

71
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,569
forgive you.

72
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:21,768
No other choice then.

73
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:22,768
Also,

74
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:23,688
Kong Hou wants

75
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:24,889
to meet us at the tea stall.

76
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:25,729
Let's hurry.

77
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,088
Okay.

78
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,329
Our lord effortlessly

79
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:36,729
deceived all the orthodox sects.

80
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,889
Those fools

81
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:38,609
never realized

82
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:40,208
his true identity.

83
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:40,889
I also heard

84
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,129
our lord killed

85
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,648
everyone in the secret realm,
humiliating the righteous sects.

86
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:56,889
My lord!

87
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,889
My lord, bad news.

88
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,129
Intruders are attacking.

89
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,248
They tracked me down already?

90
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,049
My lord,

91
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,049
do we fight?

92
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,409
Not yet.

93
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,289
We can't afford to waste our strength.

94
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:26,289
Fear not.

95
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,849
We're here to save you.

96
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,488
They're nearby. Search!

97
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,209
Understood.

98
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:39,888
Let's go.

99
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:51,808
Master,

100
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,008
no one's here.

101
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,769
There's writing here.

102
00:04:56,609 --> 00:04:59,409
(My father's murderers shall die.)

103
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:00,769
(I will slaughter)

104
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:02,368
(all you shameless rats)

105
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,488
(to honor my father Rong Ji's spirit.)

106
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,089
Kong Hou.

107
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:16,488
- Kong Hou.
- Kong Hou!

108
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,209
Tan Feng.

109
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,169
Kong Hou.

110
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,128
I'm so relieved

111
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:23,128
to see you safe.

112
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:26,248
I'm fine, Tan Feng. Truly.

113
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:26,769
Moreover,

114
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,089
we've finally met, haven't we?

115
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:28,969
You've been long gone.

116
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,409
I was worried sick.

117
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:31,328
And Tan Feng said

118
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:32,688
you encountered Jiusu.

119
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,248
You nearly scared me to death.

120
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,368
There were some dangers,

121
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,609
but all turned out well.

122
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:38,008
See? I'm perfectly fine now.

123
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:44,248
Tan Feng,

124
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:46,409
Kong Hou is getting hungry.

125
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:46,928
Could you

126
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:48,409
buy us some pastries?

127
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:49,328
No.

128
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:50,808
I need to watch Kong Hou.

129
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,328
Stop crying now.

130
00:05:52,328 --> 00:05:53,049
Look at me,

131
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,049
alive and well.

132
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:55,969
As Ling Hui said,

133
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:57,688
I really am getting hungry.

134
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,008
Could you buy me some pastries?

135
00:05:59,008 --> 00:05:59,688
Please?

136
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:00,609
Okay.

137
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:01,409
Wait for me.

138
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,568
Go quickly.

139
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:06,209
Sit down.

140
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,248
Kong Hou,

141
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:10,328
your trip to the realm

142
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,409
sounded terrifying.

143
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,209
Hearing about it

144
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,328
made my hair stand on end.

145
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,209
But fortunately,

146
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,169
we got two herbs

147
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:16,368
Huan Zong needed.

148
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,008
However...

149
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:18,769
Ladies,

150
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,008
want some qiaoguo?

151
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:22,008
Let's buy some qiaoguo.

152
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:22,688
My treat.

153
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:24,609
This time, I'm paying.

154
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,209
I have spirit stones now.

155
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,609
How many?

156
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:28,328
Four.

157
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,209
Four qiaoguo.

158
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:31,209
Here you are.

159
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:31,808
Thank you.

160
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:32,688
Thank you.

161
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,529
Tasty qiaoguo!

162
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:36,328
Four?

163
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,849
One for you, one for me,

164
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:38,888
and one for Tan Feng.

165
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:39,609
And the fourth?

166
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:40,368
Are you having two?

167
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,328
The last one's for Huan Zong.

168
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,969
Why give him any?

169
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:45,409
The Luanfeng Peak people

170
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,729
are pursuing Jiusu.

171
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,969
Besides, he's supposed to be fasting.

172
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:50,089
Huan Zong

173
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,928
occasionally eats a bite or two.

174
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,928
And this is from me to him.

175
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:57,568
Are you two...

176
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:58,849
No.

177
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:00,409
What I meant is,

178
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:03,888
what are your plans now?

179
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:07,769
I haven't decided yet.

180
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,409
I just want

181
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,368
to stay with Huan Zong forever.

182
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:15,568
So you've pledged your hearts
to each other.

183
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,729
What 'pledged hearts'?

184
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:18,328
Ling Hui,

185
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,049
you're being too blunt.

186
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,568
You're making me shy.

187
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,568
What's there to be shy about?

188
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,169
Unless

189
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,368
you don't want him.

190
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,769
Of course I do.

191
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:28,328
I definitely want to be with him.

192
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:30,248
It's just

193
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,769
I don't know how to

194
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:34,928
be with him forever

195
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:35,688
and never part.

196
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,609
That's simple.

197
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:37,568
Get married.

198
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,328
Getting married?

199
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:45,089
But he hasn't mentioned

200
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,128
marriage to me.

201
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:47,248
Kong Hou,

202
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,609
since when are you so rigid?

203
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,849
The man doesn't have to propose.

204
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,969
A woman can do it too.

205
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,488
True.

206
00:07:58,568 --> 00:07:58,928
Right.

207
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,248
I'll marry Huan Zong.

208
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:06,568
Where are you going?

209
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:07,888
To ask for his hand.

210
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,529
The storybooks say

211
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,849
marriages

212
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:12,769
need proper ceremony.

213
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,928
And it's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

214
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,409
I must prepare thoroughly.

215
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,128
When Huan Zong returns,

216
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:19,289
I'll tell him

217
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,368
I want to marry him.

218
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:22,649
Kong Hou,

219
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:23,969
there's no need to rush this.

220
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,609
It requires proper planning.

221
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,529
Proper planning?

222
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,808
Senior Ling Bo.

223
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:37,649
Ling Bo,

224
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,848
everyone's ready.

225
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:39,769
We can depart.

226
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,369
Ling Bo,

227
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:43,129
why do you

228
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,328
seem preoccupied?

229
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:46,808
Do you know

230
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,129
what foxes like to eat?

231
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,289
Foxes?

232
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,249
Ling Bo,

233
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:51,889
why are you

234
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,009
suddenly asking about foxes?

235
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:54,529
Will you keep a spirit pet?

236
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:55,769
No more questions.

237
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,688
Anyway, I need this information.

238
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,448
Speak up if you know.

239
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,088
Foxes love chickens.

240
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:01,968
Right.

241
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,009
But he's been fasting.

242
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,369
A fox fasts too?

243
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,649
How fascinating.

244
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,129
I recall my uncle

245
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:12,968
once kept a fox spirit pet.

246
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,409
It adored Ancient Tea Fruits.

247
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:16,129
They're great for fox fur maintenance.

248
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,968
Ancient Tea Fruits improve fur.

249
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,808
And Lucid Fruits.

250
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:20,928
Excellent for eye health.

251
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,169
And Woodsky Grass.

252
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,688
It makes foxes hyperactive.

253
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,169
They'll roll around excitedly.

254
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,848
Ancient Tea Fruits, Lucid Fruits,
and Woodsky Grass.

255
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:28,928
Enough.

256
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:29,889
You go ahead.

257
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:30,688
I have things to do.

258
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:31,448
Don't wait for me.

259
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,249
- Ling Bo?
- Ling Bo?

260
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,208
You're back.

261
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,608
Are you hurt?

262
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:49,409
No.

263
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,169
Let's get inside then.

264
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:52,568
Alright.

265
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:53,928
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

266
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:55,208
By the way,

267
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,649
should you check on Lin Hu?

268
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,448
Is he alright?

269
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:25,649
Ling Bo, you're here.

270
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:27,328
How are you?

271
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:29,808
Well...

272
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:31,728
Should I

273
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:32,928
call a healer for you?

274
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:33,649
No need.

275
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,688
Some medicine will help.

276
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,009
My arms feel weak.

277
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:48,769
Could you assist me?

278
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,129
Don't push your luck.

279
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:54,728
Fine, I'll manage.

280
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:03,009
Never mind. I'll do it.

281
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:08,568
Here.

282
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:20,568
Slow down. It's hot.

283
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:30,968
Here.

284
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:38,848
Thank you.

285
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,369
No need to thank me.

286
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,688
You became like this

287
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:43,769
because of me.

288
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:44,968
I'm here to repay my debt.

289
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:46,369
Well,

290
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,169
don't dwell on it.

291
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,289
Though you've lost cultivation now,

292
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,369
your spiritual core remains intact.

293
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:54,808
If you start cultivating anew,

294
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,208
within a century,

295
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,448
full recovery is certain.

296
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:58,889
Moreover,

297
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,529
I came to tell you

298
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:02,848
I've sent my sect members

299
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,808
back first.

300
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:06,688
I am

301
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,928
staying to care for you.

302
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:10,249
R-Really?

303
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,249
Ling Bo,

304
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:17,409
this sudden kindness

305
00:12:17,608 --> 00:12:20,129
is unfamiliar to me.

306
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:21,728
You'll get used to it.

307
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:22,688
I always

308
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,889
repay what's owed.

309
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:31,369
Well then.

310
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,169
Let me share something too.

311
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,328
It's about

312
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:37,129
my tail.

313
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:39,409
It's broken,

314
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:40,369
but

315
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:43,289
it can actually regrow.

316
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,208
And my cultivation

317
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,649
will fully recover too.

318
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,688
What did you say?

319
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,088
Don't look at me like that.

320
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:56,088
Don't draw your sword.

321
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:57,889
Wait.

322
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:58,889
Don't draw it.

323
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,009
Regardless of everything,

324
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,088
I've lost my tail.

325
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,448
At the very least,

326
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,568
I'm still a patient,

327
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:03,928
right?

328
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:05,169
I need... need care.

329
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:06,289
Fine.

330
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,009
Then I'll make sure

331
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,049
to take good care of you.

332
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:10,769
Wait.

333
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:11,728
Stop running.

334
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:12,249
Ling Bo.

335
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:12,688
Stop.

336
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:13,009
Listen.

337
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:13,769
Wait, listen to me.

338
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,169
Stop right there.

339
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,489
I didn't tell you earlier

340
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,529
because

341
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:19,968
you've been so kind to me.

342
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:21,009
I... I just...

343
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,088
So you lied to me.

344
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:22,409
And now

345
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:23,649
you're blaming me?

346
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,208
I'm not blaming you.

347
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,529
Before I lost my tail,
you'd scold and hit me.

348
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,688
But after I lost it,

349
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,249
you stopped both.

350
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,448
Now you even feed me medicine.

351
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,009
I was not used to

352
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,049
your sudden kindness.

353
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,088
So I went along with it.

354
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:35,608
Alright.

355
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,928
So you kept lying to me?

356
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,608
After all I've done for you.

357
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,728
You made me feel guilty.

358
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:41,649
That's not true.

359
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:42,688
It wasn't like that.

360
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:43,448
I told you

361
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:43,968
as soon

362
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:44,968
as I felt better.

363
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,448
I worried you'd blame yourself.

364
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:47,568
So I told you right away

365
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,129
about the regrowth possibility.

366
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,009
I wanted

367
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,568
to spare you from worry.

368
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:54,848
We're even now.

369
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:56,328
Take care of yourself.

370
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,289
I'm returning now.

371
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:58,208
Wait.

372
00:13:59,009 --> 00:13:59,889
I... I...

373
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,409
Look at me.

374
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,448
You're leaving now?

375
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,289
I haven't finished my medicine.

376
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:09,688
He still got away.

377
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:11,448
But I'll catch him.

378
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:14,009
Huan Zong.

379
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:16,289
In the past,

380
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,129
when I heard cultivators
from Luanfeng Peak

381
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:19,928
captured dark cultivators

382
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,328
or subdued demons,

383
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:22,448
I always thought

384
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:23,369
it was just their duty.

385
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,129
It felt so distant from me.

386
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,009
But

387
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:27,369
since knowing you,

388
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,529
I've realized

389
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,049
that you all devote

390
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,369
so much effort

391
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:32,208
and you face

392
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,249
unimaginable dangers.

393
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,448
From another perspective,

394
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,049
cultivators of Luanfeng Peak

395
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,049
are like everyone else.

396
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,529
You're ordinary people

397
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:40,928
who cultivate as we do.

398
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:41,769
You've actually

399
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,529
done exceptionally well.

400
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,129
Stop being so hard on yourself.

401
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:45,728
Okay?

402
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,169
Right, Huan Zong,

403
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,169
earlier,

404
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,649
while waiting for you,

405
00:14:53,848 --> 00:14:54,688
I read

406
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,688
the most fascinating storybook.

407
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,328
It tells about

408
00:14:58,489 --> 00:14:59,289
a man

409
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,208
who deceives

410
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,489
a woman so cruelly.

411
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:02,728
That poor woman

412
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,289
is so tragic.

413
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:08,249
Is that so?

414
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:10,889
What does he lie to her about?

415
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,249
The woman

416
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,769
only learns from others' words

417
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:15,088
upon her deathbed

418
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,889
about the man's true identity.

419
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:18,129
Well,

420
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:19,889
isn't that man utterly despicable?

421
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:21,608
Keeping her in the dark.

422
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:24,328
Then

423
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,328
is the woman angry?

424
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,009
Of course.

425
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,448
She becomes furious.

426
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:32,568
I suspect

427
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,369
that's actually what kills her.

428
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,889
But what if the man

429
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,369
has unspeakable hardships?

430
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:38,928
Right?

431
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,369
Still unacceptable.

432
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:41,169
Even if

433
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,289
he faces heaven-defying adversities,

434
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,688
they can discuss it together.

435
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,289
How can he deceive her like that

436
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,688
while hypocritically claiming

437
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,409
eternal, unyielding love?

438
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,688
He won't even reveal

439
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:53,649
his true identity.

440
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,409
That man

441
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,928
is truly despicable.

442
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:58,129
As for the woman,

443
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,649
I feel she deserves better.

444
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,328
(We are in love.)

445
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,169
(I should have told her)

446
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,169
(about my real identity.)

447
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:06,249
(How could I...)

448
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,208
(For something so crucial,)

449
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:10,728
(how could he keep it)

450
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:12,568
(from her?)

451
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:15,728
Kong Hou,

452
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:16,808
I...

453
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:18,009
By the way,

454
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,009
earlier I heard people

455
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,249
address you

456
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:25,409
as 'Master' or something.

457
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:27,249
Don't tell me,

458
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:28,088
like the man

459
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,649
in the storybook,

460
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,489
you're actually not Huan Zong

461
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,088
and have been lying to me?

462
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,409
Then I'd be more pitiful

463
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,448
than that woman.

464
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:39,369
Kong Hou,

465
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:41,889
at this point,

466
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,129
I won't keep it from you.

467
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,529
I am Zhong Xi.

468
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:48,769
Zhong Xi?

469
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,369
You Zhong Xi?

470
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,328
Master of Liuguang Sect's Luanfeng Peak,

471
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:54,968
Master Zhong Xi?

472
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:56,448
Heavens!

473
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,369
My wild guess was right.

474
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:06,689
But...

475
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:07,568
What is it?

476
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,128
So you're Zhong Xi.

477
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,408
Then you must carry

478
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,489
tremendous burdens.

479
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,568
No wonder you were so harsh

480
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,368
on yourself before.

481
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:30,929
Then the descriptions

482
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,168
I read in storybooks

483
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,848
about Master Zhong Xi

484
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,808
suffering near-fatal injuries,

485
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,848
brushing with death...

486
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:39,128
Were they true?

487
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,408
I used to think

488
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:43,088
those were just

489
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,408
exaggerated fictional tales.

490
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:45,729
After all, stories need

491
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,568
perilous twists

492
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,568
and heart-wrenching separations

493
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,128
to be romantic and engaging.

494
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,088
But

495
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:55,209
now I realize

496
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,128
those were events

497
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,408
that truly happened to you.

498
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:02,769
You've endured so much.

499
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:06,408
My heart aches for you.

500
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,009
I worry about you.

501
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:12,769
It's alright.

502
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,328
I've grown accustomed over the years.

503
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,049
Moreover,

504
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,408
those storybooks

505
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:20,489
are mostly exaggerated.

506
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:23,328
About the part

507
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,328
saying

508
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:25,848
that since taking over Luanfeng Peak,

509
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:26,888
you've lost all emotions,

510
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:27,969
is that also exaggerated?

511
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:30,969
I simply hold myself and others
to high standards.

512
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:32,888
Taking over Luanfeng Peak

513
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:33,608
happened

514
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:34,769
over a century ago.

515
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:37,648
Before,

516
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,289
I couldn't understand

517
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,608
why certain people

518
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,328
would see themselves as swords.

519
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:44,769
Cold and emotionless,

520
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,128
even when gravely wounded,

521
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:48,848
they disregard their own lives

522
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:49,969
but fight desperately.

523
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,128
I solemnly swear

524
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:55,729
to govern Luanfeng Peak
from this day forward

525
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,168
to eradicate evil
and uphold righteousness,

526
00:18:58,408 --> 00:18:59,729
leaving no wickedness unpunished.

527
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,969
I'll stand with the peak's disciples

528
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,128
through life, death, and every trial.

529
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:07,368
As Luanfeng Peak's master,

530
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,689
I cannot afford ordinary emotions.

531
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,608
Master Song He once told me

532
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,249
that in my master's youth,

533
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:15,888
his compassion

534
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,689
caused peers to be injured.

535
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:19,568
Even worse,

536
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,529
a dear friend of his

537
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:22,489
perished because of it.

538
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,088
So your master simply

539
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,888
wants to spare you
from repeating his mistakes

540
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,209
and losing loved ones.

541
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:28,608
Right?

542
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:30,209
Yes.

543
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,009
Enough explanations.

544
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:36,088
I'm glad

545
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:38,408
you're not upset.

546
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:41,328
How could I possibly be upset?

547
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:42,209
Moreover,

548
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,848
I've made my decision.

549
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,249
From now on,

550
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:47,368
whatever happens to you,

551
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,888
I'll stand by your side

552
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,049
to share your burdens.

553
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,568
I'll protect you without fail.

554
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:12,608
Ling Bo.

555
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,408
I just heard

556
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,368
Zhaohan Sect's members departed.

557
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,368
I feared I'd missed you.

558
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,209
Blame your Liuguang Sect's

559
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,368
stinking fox.

560
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,808
His antics were so outrageous.

561
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,088
He even lost his tail.

562
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,088
I merely stayed

563
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,168
to clean up

564
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:31,449
his mess.

565
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,009
You mean Lin Hu?

566
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,249
He is quite nice.

567
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,689
He's just impulsive sometimes,

568
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,049
with fewer formalities.

569
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:40,529
You'll appreciate him in time.

570
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,049
Who'd want that?

571
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,808
I

572
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,168
don't mingle

573
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,449
with just anyone.

574
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:48,689
Enough about him.

575
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:49,769
By the way,

576
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,648
I heard about your secret realm trip.

577
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:52,489
Are you

578
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,808
experiencing any ill effects?

579
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:54,729
None at all.

580
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,729
Good.

581
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:58,009
I'll be

582
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,368
returning to Zhaohan Sect soon.

583
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:01,449
Wait.

584
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,328
The day

585
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:05,608
grows late,

586
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:07,249
and rainy clouds gather.

587
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:08,529
Rain may affect

588
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:09,128
your journey.

589
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:09,808
Why not

590
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:10,769
stay here

591
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,529
one more night?

592
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,608
(Is the jade pendant)

593
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,608
(the one I gave him before?)

594
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:22,328
Stay one more night.

595
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:23,529
It won't hurt.

596
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:28,489
Very well.

597
00:21:28,568 --> 00:21:29,449
I'll depart tomorrow.

598
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:30,249
Sure.

599
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:42,648
Who's there?

600
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:48,449
Liuguang Sect's Xiao Dong.

601
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:49,729
Lady,

602
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:51,769
are you here for
the Cultivation Assembly?

603
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,408
Yes.

604
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:55,449
But

605
00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:57,449
why were you staring at me?

606
00:21:58,769 --> 00:21:59,689
Not at you.

607
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,408
I merely noticed

608
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,328
(Night Vision Art)
the book you held.

609
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,009
If it interests you,

610
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:08,449
you can have it.

611
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,249
I've already read it twice.

612
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:13,848
Lady,

613
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,608
what should I call you?

614
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,929
And how should I

615
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,529
return this book to you?

616
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:20,888
I'm Ling Bo.

617
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,408
Keep it for now.

618
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:24,648
Return it after you finish.

619
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:32,689
Ling Bo?

620
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:34,168
So she's

621
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:35,729
Zhaohan Sect's leader's chief disciple,

622
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,408
Lady Ling Bo?

623
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:47,929
What is

624
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,009
Xiao Dong's intention anyway?

625
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,368
Why's he still wearing

626
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,408
that jade pendant from back then?

627
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:56,769
I thought I made myself clear.

628
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:57,769
Why?

629
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:00,128
Could it be...

630
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:02,729
No, no.

631
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:03,929
I'm overthinking this.

632
00:23:05,368 --> 00:23:06,128
Xiao Dong.

633
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:08,969
You remember my name?

634
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:10,769
Your name

635
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:11,969
is pleasant and memorable.

636
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:12,648
What?

637
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,848
Need something from me?

638
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:16,249
I came to ask you

639
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:17,648
about some passages in the book.

640
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:18,568
There are parts

641
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:19,449
I don't understand.

642
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:24,449
Have you been waiting long?

643
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:25,289
Why not call me?

644
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:26,289
I just got here.

645
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,848
I didn't want to bother you

646
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:30,608
without proper notice.

647
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,368
The purpose

648
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,969
of our attendance at the Assembly

649
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:35,529
is for cultivation discussions.

650
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:36,489
We can sit down

651
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,929
and discuss your questions.

652
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,808
Thank you, Lady Ling Bo.

653
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:45,368
Ling Bo.

654
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:47,289
What is it?

655
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:48,328
Ling Bo,

656
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:50,088
the market's lantern show is in days.

657
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:51,529
There's word of pretty lanterns,

658
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,009
all sorts of toys,

659
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,328
and even street performances.

660
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:55,449
Let's go see it.

661
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,449
Xiao Dong asked me out.

662
00:23:58,489 --> 00:23:59,449
He has a few questions

663
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:00,408
to ask me,

664
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,848
and we'll visit the lantern show.

665
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:03,249
Xiao Dong?

666
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:04,568
Why have you been with Xiao Dong

667
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,489
from Liuguang Sect so often?

668
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:07,489
Because Liuguang Sect

669
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,608
is hosting the Assembly.

670
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:09,729
Certainly,

671
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:11,088
they'll be hospitable to guests

672
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:11,729
like us.

673
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,088
Besides, Xiao Dong

674
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,209
has great character.

675
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:15,249
He's driven,

676
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:16,529
and we get along well.

677
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:17,808
Didn't he give you

678
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,168
a Frostbell Flower yesterday?

679
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:21,049
That plant only grows on cliffsides.

680
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,608
It must've been hard to get one.

681
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,929
He said he was gathering energy

682
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:26,608
and happened

683
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,249
to see such a beautiful bloom there.

684
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:30,009
So he picked it for me.

685
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:31,289
Every time you practiced

686
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:32,049
recently,

687
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,168
he brought you cooling tea.

688
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:36,368
That's Liuguang Sect's

689
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:37,368
special brew.

690
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:39,088
It's said to aid cultivation.

691
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:40,289
The way he looks at you

692
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:42,249
is full of admiration.

693
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,289
Stop talking nonsense.

694
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:45,729
I'm not.

695
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,249
And I think you two

696
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:48,289
look great together,

697
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,209
a perfect match.

698
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,689
You are Lady Ling Bo

699
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:53,209
with radiant beauty.

700
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,168
As for him,

701
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:55,689
he's rather dashing

702
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:56,848
and charming too.

703
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:58,128
And both of you

704
00:24:58,128 --> 00:24:59,648
have exceptional talent.

705
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:01,888
They say Xiao Dong

706
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:03,769
is Liuguang Sect's rising star.

707
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,689
In just a few years,

708
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,088
he's reached the Golden Core stage.

709
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,209
His future's boundless.

710
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:09,729
What? Golden Core?

711
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,449
Yes.

712
00:25:10,808 --> 00:25:12,368
Moreover, I think you should

713
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,128
elevate your relationship with him.

714
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,128
It would be a powerful union.

715
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:17,808
If he's at the Golden Core stage,

716
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:18,769
how could he not know

717
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,128
the Night Vision Art?

718
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,529
Why would he lie to me?

719
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:30,729
Ling Bo?

720
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:31,689
Why are you here?

721
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:33,088
What's your intention?

722
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:34,249
At the Golden Core stage,

723
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:34,888
you know all.

724
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:35,808
Yet you pretended

725
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:36,888
to seek guidance from me.

726
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:37,568
Tell me.

727
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:39,289
Why did you play me for a fool?

728
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:40,529
I didn't.

729
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,088
Truly.

730
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:43,368
Then why did you approach me?

731
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,209
What's your motive?

732
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,168
Any schemes?

733
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,529
I harbor no ill intentions.

734
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:48,888
Then why did you

735
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:50,209
feign ignorance?

736
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,088
Well...

737
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:55,128
What's so unspeakable about it?

738
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:56,368
What's your true intention?

739
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:00,489
Ling Bo.

740
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:01,929
I wish to cultivate,

741
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,128
advance,

742
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,368
and build a future with you.

743
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:08,529
You make it

744
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,568
sound so formal.

745
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,568
We're cultivators of the Lingyou Realm,

746
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:12,848
essentially one family.

747
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:13,489
Mutual help

748
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,489
is only natural.

749
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:15,328
I understand.

750
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:17,328
But beyond our communal ties,

751
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:20,929
I desire more interaction with you.

752
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:24,648
I understand now.

753
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:26,808
You... you understand?

754
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,209
So you grasp my meaning?

755
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,049
Since you're a Golden Core cultivator,

756
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,088
may I

757
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:33,128
seek your guidance

758
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:34,168
when I have questions?

759
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:34,769
No problem.

760
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:36,168
I'll share all I know

761
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,009
without reservation.

762
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:47,769
Who's there?

763
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:54,009
(I'll see you off.)

764
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,608
(Don't leave without a word,)

765
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:56,489
(Lady Ling Bo.)

766
00:26:57,368 --> 00:26:58,929
Who asked you to see me off?

767
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,168
You sly fox.

768
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,209
(What time will you rise,)

769
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:09,969
(Lady Ling Bo?)

770
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,568
(Don't oversleep.)

771
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,049
How could I possibly oversleep?

772
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,368
When have I ever overslept?

773
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:20,408
(Right.)

774
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:21,449
(Lady Ling Bo)

775
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:22,408
(would never oversleep.)

776
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,529
(Then I'll entrust tomorrow's awakening)

777
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:25,848
(to your care, Lady Ling Bo.)

778
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,209
(I fear I will awake)

779
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,128
(to find you gone)

780
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,568
(and miss you.)

781
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,769
(That would be sad.)

782
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:31,449
So...

783
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,408
So what if we miss?

784
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,009
I'll never wake you up.

785
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:46,848
(Just teasing you.)

786
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:47,808
(Lady Ling Bo,)

787
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,769
(I'll come wake you tomorrow.)

788
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:50,608
Farewell.

789
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:51,929
See you tomorrow.

790
00:27:57,848 --> 00:27:59,808
Who says I'm seeing you tomorrow?

791
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:06,368
What?

792
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:07,529
You're bringing him

793
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:08,808
back to our sect?

794
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,729
Yes.

795
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:12,009
Don't tell me you plan

796
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,888
to detain him here

797
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,328
if he declines your proposal?

798
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,328
What nonsense.

799
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:19,328
I simply want

800
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,368
to formally introduce him

801
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,209
to Master.

802
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:25,449
Understandable.

803
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,769
If your master learns

804
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:28,888
he's the renowned

805
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:29,888
Master Zhong Xi,

806
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:31,328
he'll be utterly astonished.

807
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:32,769
When you first told me,

808
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:33,969
it took me ages to process.

809
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,689
Zhong Xi or Huan Zong,

810
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:37,808
either way,

811
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,209
he's mine from now on.

812
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,888
Are you that confident?

813
00:28:43,009 --> 00:28:45,209
Aren't you worried

814
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:46,729
that he never considered

815
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:47,969
marrying you?

816
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:49,808
How could that be?

817
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:50,929
Impossible.

818
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:52,769
Ling Hui,

819
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:54,168
please teach me.

820
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,689
What method should I use

821
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:56,769
to propose to him?

822
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,408
Will that work?

823
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:09,689
Can I really

824
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:11,848
say those words out loud?

825
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:17,929
Lin Hu.

826
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:23,929
Tomorrow,

827
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:25,408
I'll visit Yunhua Sect

828
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,128
to see the elders.

829
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:28,568
Help me check if this outfit works.

830
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,489
You want my opinion?

831
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:32,689
This outfit...

832
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:33,769
I think...

833
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:34,489
Alright. Stop.

834
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,088
Wait.

835
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:37,408
You...

836
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,729
Don't be shy.

837
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:39,769
I haven't even said it.

838
00:29:41,368 --> 00:29:42,128
Makes sense.

839
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,249
It's his first time meeting the elders.

840
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:44,848
It's normal.

841
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:50,209
How about this one?

842
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:51,808
I thought about it.

843
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:53,049
Since I'm meeting the elders,

844
00:29:53,088 --> 00:29:54,689
I should dress more formally.

845
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:55,929
That said,

846
00:29:56,249 --> 00:29:57,328
the Yunhua Sect is used

847
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:58,289
to casual freedom.

848
00:29:58,489 --> 00:29:59,808
Wouldn't being too formal

849
00:30:00,328 --> 00:30:00,888
be improper?

850
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:04,049
Makes sense.

851
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,128
This outfit

852
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,209
and that outfit,

853
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:09,289
changing back and forth.

854
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:13,088
How about this one?

855
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:15,608
I thought about it carefully.

856
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,009
Kong Hou has a lively nature.

857
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:18,529
I should maintain

858
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,168
this energetic appearance.

859
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:21,568
Young Master,

860
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,368
every outfit

861
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:25,568
looks majestic

862
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:27,969
and dashing on you.

863
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,209
However,

864
00:30:29,449 --> 00:30:30,848
we should consider one thing.

865
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,328
What do you mean?

866
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,249
First, we need to decide

867
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,608
what status you'll claim.

868
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:37,328
As a friend?

869
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,249
If as a friend,

870
00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:38,969
your outfit choice

871
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:39,648
doesn't matter.

872
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:40,729
Of course not.

873
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:41,729
If not a friend,

874
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:42,289
what are you?

875
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:47,848
At the very least

876
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,168
more than an ordinary friend.

877
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:51,969
More than an ordinary friend?

878
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:52,648
Then what?

879
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:00,249
Good news!

880
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:01,209
Starting today,

881
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,729
all suitors proposing to Kong Hou

882
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,168
will receive lifetime free access

883
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:08,568
to Yong City's beef noodles.

884
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:12,009
First come, first served.

885
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:14,969
Doesn't Zhong Xi

886
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:17,289
practice fasting?

887
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:21,929
It slipped my mind in my haste.

888
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:23,368
Then...

889
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,729
Fasting cultivators can get...

890
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:28,249
Get what? What can they get?

891
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:29,489
Enough. Stop thinking.

892
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,449
Oh my dear.

893
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,449
With your proposal method,

894
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:34,408
he'll definitely refuse.

895
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,449
He might not even want you anymore.

896
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:37,929
Just listen to me.

897
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:38,529
I mean it.

898
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:39,969
Ling Hui.

899
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,009
What should I do then?

900
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:43,848
Why is proposing so hard?

901
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:44,888
Kong Hou.

902
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:48,848
You came for me?

903
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,608
What are you two doing?

904
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,608
Nothing.

905
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,009
We're enjoying the moon.

906
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,249
I have things to do.

907
00:31:59,249 --> 00:31:59,969
I'll leave now.

908
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:00,808
Take care.

909
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,808
Zhong Xi, what are all these?

910
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:12,729
These

911
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:15,328
are keys to Luanfeng Peak's
Treasure Hall.

912
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:16,289
These two

913
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:17,408
are storage room keys.

914
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,969
These are for the archive vaults.

915
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:22,368
But why are you showing me

916
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:22,969
these?

917
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:24,408
What's so special

918
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,729
about these keys?

919
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:27,729
I...

920
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:30,368
I want you to keep them for me.

921
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,249
These are crucial items.

922
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:35,168
You want me to keep them?

923
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,289
Zhong Xi,

924
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:39,289
are you going on a long trip?

925
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:40,689
I'm not.

926
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,449
These are meant for you.

927
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,168
Have you

928
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:46,969
lost your keys recently?

929
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:48,648
That's not right.

930
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,249
You're always meticulous.

931
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,168
How could you lose anything?

932
00:32:59,128 --> 00:32:59,848
Look at this.

933
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:02,568
With this key

934
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:05,368
you'll become

935
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,568
another owner

936
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,689
of Liuguang Sect's
Master Zhong Xi's abode.

937
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:19,088
Owner of Zhong Xi's adobe?

938
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,209
Are... are you...

939
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:32,368
Are you...

940
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:35,489
Are you saying...

941
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:37,449
Zhong Xi,

942
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,608
you want to...

943
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,729
You finally understand.

944
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:42,888
I...

945
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:44,648
I...

946
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:46,568
No, I don't understand.

947
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:47,929
If you hand

948
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:49,368
everything to me,

949
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,568
what if I go broke someday?

950
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,608
I might

951
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:53,888
sell a key

952
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:54,888
for money.

953
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:55,689
That's fine.

954
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,009
Do as you wish.

955
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:58,449
At worst, we'll roam the streets

956
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,648
together. It doesn't matter.

957
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,494
♪Fade like a poem♪

958
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:07,128
We'll be together?

959
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,248
Let's get married.

960
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:17,608
Will you?

961
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:28,849
I... I will.

962
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:37,472
♪Time engraves into rings♪

963
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:44,718
♪Slowly, we accompany the fading lights♪

964
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:48,768
Ling Bo?

965
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:50,728
Lady Ling Bo?

966
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:52,849
Lady Ling Bo, rise and shine.

967
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,529
Stop knocking.

968
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:57,648
I've been up for hours.

969
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:02,889
What?

970
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:04,288
Nothing.

971
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:06,049
Why are you damp?

972
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,168
I've never seen you

973
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,529
fresh from bathing before.

974
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:11,688
You look great.

975
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,489
With the scents

976
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:14,929
of the cosmetics gone,

977
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:15,768
you smell great.

978
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,728
W-Why are you smiling?

979
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:22,009
Don't people say cosmetics

980
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:23,128
make one more presentable?

981
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:23,728
Right?

982
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:24,608
Nonsense.

983
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:25,568
That's for people

984
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:26,608
with ugly faces.

985
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,208
You're naturally beautiful.

986
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,369
No need for those things.

987
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:30,688
Natural purity suits you best.

988
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,248
Really?

989
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,208
Absolutely.

990
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:33,929
You look pretty.

991
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:38,248
Well... smooth talker.

992
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,088
Let's go.

993
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:40,969
Wait.

994
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:41,929
I meant every word.

995
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:42,809
This natural look

996
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,449
suits you best.

997
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:44,849
Pure and unadorned.

998
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:46,088
Better than heavy makeup.

999
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:46,848
I mean it.

1000
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:01,568
Ling Bo?

1001
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:05,969
Ling Bo?

1002
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:08,208
Ling Bo?

1003
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:19,179
(Haoqing Temple)

1004
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:27,049
Master,

1005
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:28,688
still no sign of Lin Hu.

1006
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,248
Let's wait longer.

1007
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,608
(So he's Master Zhong Xi.)

1008
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:36,688
Tan Feng.

1009
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:37,369
Tan Feng.

1010
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:39,088
Why do you keep

1011
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,849
staring at Zhong Xi?

1012
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:42,849
Have you lost your senses?

1013
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,409
I wasn't staring.

1014
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:45,369
Listen.

1015
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,288
Return like this,

1016
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,568
and Master will be furious.

1017
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,288
How could a marriage be that simple?

1018
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,529
Master Wang Tong
dotes so much on Kong Hou.

1019
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,929
He'd certainly approve.

1020
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:55,809
My master will definitely agree.

1021
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:57,128
When that time comes,

1022
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,088
we'll need your support, Tan Feng.

1023
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:03,529
No problem.

1024
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:07,929
Where's Lin Hu?

1025
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,768
Why hasn't he returned yet?

1026
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:12,849
You're really going back?

1027
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,409
Young Master plans

1028
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:15,288
to marry Kong Hou.

1029
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,329
Why not come with us

1030
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:17,088
to Yunhua Sect?

1031
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,969
I'll go then when the time comes.

1032
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:20,969
The back-and-forth is too troublesome.

1033
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,608
None of your business.

1034
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:23,369
How about this?

1035
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,472
Give me your messenger talisman.
I'll contact you.

1036
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:26,369
Why should I?

1037
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:27,768
I'm concerned for your safety

1038
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,009
if you go alone.

1039
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:32,009
This is mine.

1040
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:33,728
Well...

1041
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:34,809
Yours.

1042
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:39,768
Here.

1043
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:44,168
Well...

1044
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:46,288
Stay safe on your journey.

1045
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:47,489
And

1046
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,608
I lied to you before.

1047
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:51,449
I'm sorry.

1048
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,409
Don't dwell on it.

1049
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:56,809
Why are you smiling?

1050
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,969
Be safe on the road.

1051
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:00,608
Stay vigilant.

1052
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:02,088
Remember to message me.

1053
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:08,369
I'm back.

1054
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:08,728
Look.

1055
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:12,849
Lin Hu, why are you so late?

1056
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:14,128
We thought you'd left already.

1057
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,128
I... I...

1058
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:17,088
I went to buy some things

1059
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,728
to bring back.

1060
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:19,809
Not everyone's here yet.

1061
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,088
Xiao Dong hasn't arrived.

1062
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:21,688
Master.

1063
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:25,728
Perfect timing, Xiao Dong.

1064
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,608
Lead the disciples back to the sect.

1065
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,688
I'm going to Yunhua Sect with Kong Hou.

1066
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:30,128
Master,

1067
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:31,568
Sect Leader isn't well.

1068
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:37,632
Master Song He.

1069
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:38,768
Zhong Xi?

1070
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:40,849
Why are you back too?

1071
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:41,529
Master Song He,

1072
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,768
what happened to my master?

1073
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,608
During his cultivation,

1074
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:46,728
his mental instability

1075
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:48,329
caused severe energy blockage

1076
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:49,248
that's hard to resolve.

1077
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,409
Mental instability?

1078
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:51,568
What caused that?

1079
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,208
He's been regretting

1080
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:55,049
forcing your cultivation
all these years,

1081
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,608
not understanding your struggles.

1082
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,849
The guilt overwhelmed him.

1083
00:38:58,608 --> 00:38:59,409
Now hearing

1084
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:00,809
that the Yunhua Sect girl

1085
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:01,889
has become close with you

1086
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:02,809
as your soulmate,

1087
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,248
he feels relieved,

1088
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:05,168
yet the guilt

1089
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,449
remains unresolved.

1090
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,208
Years of suppressed emotions

1091
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:08,728
caused...

1092
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:11,969
I'll go check on him.

1093
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,608
