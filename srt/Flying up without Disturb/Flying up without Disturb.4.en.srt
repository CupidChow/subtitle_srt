Is that right?

17
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:06,802
This is going smoothly.

18
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:08,162
We'll complete it soon.

19
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,602
Divine artifact.

20
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,121
This is quite efficient.

21
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,121
- Of course.
- Pour more.

22
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,961
Pour it over all of these.

23
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,242
I bought this at the market

24
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,401
because I found it fun.

25
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:42,561
It's not medicine.

26
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,721
We shouldn't overuse it.

27
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:44,881
Then hurry and go

28
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,042
buy more.

29
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,881
This can save us.

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,841
Buy more?

31
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:49,721
That'd be perfect.

32
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,401
Why don't

33
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,161
you two

34
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:52,001
go to see

35
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:52,681
if there's more

36
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,242
available?

37
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:57,642
Well,

38
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:02,561
I can go by myself.

39
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,681
No need for company.

40
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,322
Really? That would be great.

41
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:06,922
This.

42
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,001
Open it yourself.

43
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,042
We need some other items.

44
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:11,322
Please buy them back,

45
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:12,022
okay?

46
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:14,042
That's easy.

47
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:14,922
Alright.

48
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:17,642
I'll go by myself.

49
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:01,961
Here, take it.

50
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:02,642
I'll take it.

51
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,721
Let go. I'll take it.

52
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:06,642
I'll take it.

53
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,522
I'll take it.

54
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:08,721
I'll help you.

55
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:09,602
I'll take it.

56
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:11,681
It hurts.

57
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,401
Did you do that on purpose?

58
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,202
I didn't.

59
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:14,961
Forget it.

60
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:15,482
Didn't expect

61
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:16,561
you to help me up.

62
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,602
I can get up myself.

63
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:31,081
Sir,

64
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:33,001
how much?

65
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,402
Two spirit stones.

66
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,402
That expensive?

67
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,641
Are you kidding me?

68
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,001
Are you an idiot?

69
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,761
You want to pay without bargaining?

70
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,081
Bargaining is troublesome.

71
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,681
What's troublesome about it?

72
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,362
I think

73
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,441
you'll get scammed

74
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,362
during traveling.

75
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,162
Watch me.

76
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,842
One spirit stone.

77
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:52,602
That's it.

78
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:53,441
W-Well...

79
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:54,362
One spirit stone?

80
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,802
Sell it or not.

81
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:56,842
If not,

82
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,962
we're leaving.

83
00:04:58,482 --> 00:04:59,922
I do. I do.

84
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:01,842
See?

85
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:02,761
Easy, right?

86
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:03,962
I learned it.

87
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:08,641
Here.

88
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,922
I-I'm still mad at you.

89
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:19,581

91
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:26,441
How long will this line take?

92
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:28,881
When will we reach the front?

93
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:31,842
What's sold here?

94
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:32,881
Why such a long queue?

95
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:39,282
This is the new shop

96
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,201
of Five-Flavor Manor.

97
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,162
Their pastries

98
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:42,962
are so delicious.

99
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,881
Indeed.

100
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:44,962
Buy some

101
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,282
for your loved one,

102
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,881
and she'll surely be delighted.

103
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,162
Loved one?

104
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,362
- He doesn't have one!
- He doesn't have one!

105
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:58,282
So you still don't

106
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,402
have a loved one.

107
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:01,722
Anyway, it is

108
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:03,001
none of your business.

109
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,121
Let's go.

110
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:05,441
You...

111
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:08,081
Can't you tell?

112
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,362
They are interested in you.

113
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,201
What's that to do with me?

114
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,641
What?

115
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,441
Forgot the lesson

116
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,001
taught by the Nascent Soul Elder?

117
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,282
If you really want pastries,

118
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,521
then get in line.

119
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:20,881
Don't talk to them.

120
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:24,242
Come here.

121
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:31,282
Still mad at me?

Senior Ling Hui.

123
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,521
I only realize now

124
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,482
that some people

125
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,802
can live such boring lives

126
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,001
and turn themselves

127
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,602
into a weapon,

128
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,441
toiling day after day.

129
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,282
Cultivation

130
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,881
is all about having fun.

131
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:45,641
There's so much

132
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:47,521
delicious food and fun in this world,

133
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,042
yet they don't enjoy any of it.

134
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,242
If they don't understand,

135
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:52,362
then their sect should

136
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,761
remind them.

137
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,482
Not like us.

138
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:58,201
Be careful. Watch your step.

139
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,881
Senior Ling Hui,

140
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:00,641
I consider him

141
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,121
a friend.

142
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:03,641
That's why I'm so worried.

143
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:06,681
See? I told you to be careful.

144
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,482
You didn't even try to drag me back.

145
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:09,521
You're sulking

146
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:10,722
and ignoring me.

147
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:12,802
Sir,

148
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:14,722
buy her an ice pop,

149
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,042
and she'll stop sulking.

150
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:16,842
Really?

151
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:17,881
Want one?

152
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,162
Want it?

153

Ice pop?

154

Considering

155
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,121
you bought me an ice pop,

156
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,201
I'll forgive you.

157
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:33,482
Why aren't you moving?

158
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:35,482
Watch out!

159
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,242
This time I dragged you back.

160

B-But

00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,842

00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,121
You appreciate Master Writer too?

198
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,281
I was

199
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,562
just asking.

200
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:34,881
Oh my.

201
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,921
Can't believe you also appreciate him.

202
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:38,041
People who appreciate him

203
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,082
are quite rare.

204
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:41,682
Whatever.

205
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,562
I get it.

206
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,521
You're just feeling

207
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:47,121
a bit embarrassed,

208
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:47,682
right?

209
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:48,962
Don't be embarrassed

210
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,401
to be a fan of Master Writer.

211
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,761
Moreover, let me tell you.

212
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,442
Only ignorant people

213
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,722
would think his works

214
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:56,242
terrible.

215
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:57,041
Rest assured.

216
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,521
You have excellent taste.

217
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,362
And

218
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,242
it's normal for us
to have some preferences,

219
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:01,801
right?

220
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:04,921
Alright, let's just say I like him then.

221
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:07,322
Since you said so,

222
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,001
I must do something.

223
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,001
I'll buy

224
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:11,801
these books.

225
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,121
How much?

226
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,121
If you want them,

227
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,442
five spirit stones then.

228
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,242
Five spirit stones?

229
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,962
If that's too much,

230
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,041
three spirit stones.

231
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:22,001
Can't go any lower.

232
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,761
These are Master Writer's works.

233
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,562
Only cost three spirit stones?

234
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,482
Think the price is too low?

235
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:30,121
Then what do you think they're worth?

236
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,921
Certainly more than

237
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,722
three spirit stones.

238
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:35,082
Six spirit stones?

239
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:36,362
No! Way too low!

240
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:37,362
Ten?

241
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:39,682
Still low.

242
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:40,881
Fifty spirit stones.

243
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,722
That's about right.

244
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:43,881
Then they're yours.

245
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,442
Who reads
Master Writer's books nowadays?

246
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,161
Ten years ago,

247
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,202
he wrote Cultivation Record I,

248
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:52,161
which was utterly incomprehensible.

249
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:53,801
It's full of nonsense.

250
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:54,401
Exactly.

251
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:55,161
Watch your mouth!

252
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:55,962
Exactly.

253
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,041
A cracked pot goes with a cracked lid.

254
00:10:58,202 --> 00:10:59,362
Every trash finds its owner.

255
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,842
Do you even understand his works?

256
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:03,602
We don't. You do.

257
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,121
Didn't you teach me to bargain?

258
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:08,641
Why did you set a higher price?

259
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:09,641
This is different.

260
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:11,641
These are Master Writer's books.

261
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,482
They're not worth fifty.

262
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,001
Of course, they are.

263
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,322
Master Writer's works

264
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,562
are priceless.

265
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:19,722
We can't let

266
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:21,242
others look down on him.

267
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:22,682
Fairy,

268
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,041
you have exceptional taste.

269
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:24,881
I haven't met

270
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,001
a customer with

271
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:26,562
elegant taste

272
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,682
like you in ages.

273
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:28,682
Here are your books.

274
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,682
(The Complete Works of Master Writer)

275
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:30,182
Okay.

276
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,161
The spirit stones you had

277
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,521
were spent on pastries.

278
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:39,521
Well...

279
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,082
Lady,

280
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,401
since you have no money,

281
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,281
why causing a scene here?

282
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,121
Exactly.

283
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:52,881
Thank you.

284
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,041
- See? She has money.
- Let's go.

285
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:55,962
See?

286
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:02,242
Weren't these supposed to be for me?

287
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,761
Why are you reading them first?

288
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,842
Don't be so stingy.

289
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,962
If you like them, take them all.

290
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,842
No need.

291
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,442
Actually, I have them all at home.

292
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:15,082
But mine

293
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,041
aren't as new as yours.

294
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,242
They've worn out.

295
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,482
In this case,

296
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:19,641
you read them before.

297
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,202
Then why read them now?

298
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,842
I can never read enough

299
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,442
Master Writer's books.

300
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,521
You really appreciate him?

301
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,322
Of course.

302
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,921
You too, right?

303
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:32,202
Well,

304
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,641
do you think Master Writer

305
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,442
is

306
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:35,921
a quiet person

307
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,962
who doesn't talk much?

308
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:37,842
Because

309
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,281
his works

310
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,161
are difficult to grasp,

311
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,082
yet the experiences

312
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:43,442
of his characters

313
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:45,281
aren't something
ordinary people would have.

314
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:46,202
Moreover,

315
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,322
each character

316
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,562
might seem cold in personality,

317
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,242
but in reality,

318
00:12:50,242 --> 00:12:51,881
they're all righteous people,

319
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,082
who are eliminating evil

320
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,362
and upholding justice.

321
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,082
I've

322
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,202
wanted to be someone

323
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,722
like them ever since childhood.

324
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:58,921
Pity.

325
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,722
You can take action now.

326
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,881
I still have much to learn.

327
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,881
The characters from his works

328
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:08,202
are like...

329
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:09,281
like you

330
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,801
Luanfeng Peak disciples,

331
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:12,482
being renown throughout

332
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:13,562
the entire Lingyou Realm.

333
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,242
Yet I...

334
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,962
I can't even properly use

335
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,921
my natal spiritual tool,

336
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,121
That's why my master

337
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:21,521
never let me venture out

338
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,362
and kept me stay in Yong City.

339
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:26,322
Come...

340
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,842
Come help me catch the ducks!

341
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,161
Lin Hu.

342
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,761
Why did you get all these ducks?

343
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,161
The village elders

344
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:36,962
told me

345
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,121
ducks can repel insects,

346
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:39,202
so I brought some over.

347
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,602
Come help me.

348
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:41,881
- Okay.
- Get in.

349
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:43,842
Got it.

350
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:44,682
Get in.

351
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:45,842
Hurry.

352
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,202
- Get in.
- Over there.

353
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:48,801
Over there.

354
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,161
Stop it.

355
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:54,881
Get in.

356
00:13:56,521 --> 00:13:57,121
Get in.

357
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,041
Huan Zong,

358
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,202
come help us.

359
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:00,242
Get these ducks in.

360
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,121
- Over here.
- Over here.

361
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,161
Over here.

362
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:05,482
Come here.

363
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:08,521
Huan Zong,

364
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,722
you're amazing.

365
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,442
This tea set

366
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,322
is the Nascent Soul Elder's?

367
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:24,682
Why did you steal

368
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,041
his tea set?

369
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:27,842
I brought it my own.

370
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,722
When traveling,

371
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,761
you carry a full tea set?

372
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,962
You don't get it.

373
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,881
Let me tell you.

374
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:36,362
Young Master has his own etiquette

375
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:37,641
for tea.

376
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,562
Take the tea leaves.

377
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:40,482
They must be

378
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:42,121
wrapped in handmade paper packets

379
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,881
and stored in lime jars.

380
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:44,962
The lime gets

381
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:46,641
replaced every ten days.

382
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:47,881
The brewing water

383
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:48,641
must be

384
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,881
the morning dew from pine needles.

385
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,202
And bring it to boil

386
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:53,082
with big heat,

387
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,202
then steep the leaves

388
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,202
in the boiling water.

389
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,202
That's it.

390
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,872
- So many details.
- Of course.

391
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:00,962
I thought

392
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:02,682
you Luanfeng Peak disciples...

393
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:04,362
What?

394
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,761
You thought us

395
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:07,202
to be barbaric and rude?

396
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:10,281
Well,

397
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:12,401
why hasn't the Master come out yet?

398
00:15:12,401 --> 00:15:13,801
It's been ten days.

399
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:15,082
Did something

400
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,202
happen to him?

401
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:16,761
Should we

402
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:17,761
fetch a physician?

403
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,121
What for?

404
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,722
I'm the physician.

405
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:25,801
Master.

406
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:26,722
Did you figure it out?

407
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,682
Come with me.

408
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,041
Seek out the spirit herbs

409
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:33,722
listed on this prescription.

410
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,281
(Prescription)
Azure Phoenix Feather, Merfolk Scale,

411
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:37,041
Cloudseeker Twig.

412
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,281
For each herb obtained,

413
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:39,521
place it into

414
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,001
this specialized elixir furnace.

415
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,761
When all spirit herbs are gathered,

416
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,722
the furnace will produce

417
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:47,641
an elixir.

418
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,001
Take the elixir,

419
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:51,322
and your spiritual core
will fully recover.

420
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:53,442
Thank you, Master.

421
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:54,281
Master,

422
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,881
you are really amazing.

423
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,602
Do you like the specialty

424
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:58,602
from Yunhua Sect?

425
00:15:58,722 --> 00:15:59,401
Also,

426
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:00,682
I've noticed many people sent

427
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:01,521
letters of gratitude

428
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,602
to physicians.

429
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:03,682
They'd hang those letters

430
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:04,881
right at the entrance.

431
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,401
It's so impressive.

432
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:06,921
How about

433
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,921
I prepare one for you?

434
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:11,401
Don't celebrate yet.

435
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,682
The spirit herbs

436
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,001
are extremely rare.

437
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,562
You'd better be mentally prepared

438
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:16,801
in advance.

439
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,082
If they're that rare, what should we do?

440
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:21,842
It's fine.

441
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,401
Master Song He

442
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,161
is an expert in medicinal herbs.

443
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,121
He'll certainly help me find them.

444
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,761
Thank you, Master.

445
00:16:29,962 --> 00:16:30,682
And,

446
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,722
this laxative is for your master.

447
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:35,962
Laxative?

448
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,962
Master, seriously?

449
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:38,801
My master

450
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,482
has constant diarrhea.

451
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:43,121
Your master eats too much

452
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,082
and too diversely.

453
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:45,041
More excretion

454
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,001
will benefit him.

455
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,682
Alright.

456
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:49,041
Seclusion is exhausting.

457
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,521
Leave now.

458
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,281
Leave.

459
00:16:51,322 --> 00:16:51,962
Leave.

460
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,442
Leave now.

461
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,202
Azure Phoenix Feather, Merfolk Scale,

462
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:05,242
Cloudseeker Twig.

463
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:06,882
I've never even heard of these herbs.

464
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,081
How can we find them?

465
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,162
Huan Zong,

466
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:11,801
can your master

467
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,081
really find them all?

468
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,281
Perhaps let me

469
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,202
copy the prescription,

470
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,202
I'll review it.

471
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:16,841
Liuguang Sect is

472
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:18,202
the foremost sect in the world.

473
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:19,642
We'll find a solution.

474
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,482
But if

475
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,962
it's true,

476
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:25,682
why did you seek my help before?

477
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,202
I had no clues before,

478
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:28,682
but now I have the prescription.

479
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:29,841
Finding a solution

480
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,321
is merely a matter of time.

481
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:32,761
Rest assured.

482
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:37,962
Well, it's been ten days.

483
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,601
You should set off now.

484
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:41,882
I-I know.

485
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,041
I'll leave soon.

486
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:46,281
Then you go back soon

487
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:47,561
to find the herbs.

488
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:48,922
Okay.

489
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,202
But if you truly

490
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:53,361
encounter any difficulties,

491
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:54,962
send me a messaging talisman.

492
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,402
I'll help you out.

493
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,328
Here are my messaging talismans.

494
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:16,841
Where are yours?

495
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,841
Young Master never gives

496
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,162
his messenger talismans

497
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:32,601
to anyone.

498
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:33,962
By the way, Huan Zong,

499
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:35,281
you once promised

500
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,402
to grant me one request.

501
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:37,682
You haven't fulfilled it yet.

502
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,601
Just name it.

503
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:42,202
Well,

504
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,841
promise me not to overexert yourself

505
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,321
and take good care of yourself.

506
00:18:46,722 --> 00:18:48,001
That's my request.

507
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,001
You too.

508
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:54,242
Well,

509
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:56,882
I'll take

510
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,482
my leave now.

511
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,402
Stop!

512
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:03,361
My fields are

513
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,321
all rice plants?

514
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,122
We were wrong.

515
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:05,682
Run!

516
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:06,962
We'll compensate you later.

517
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,402
Sorry, Master.

518
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,521
Stop!

519
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:12,162
Stop right there!

520
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,761
Sorry!

521
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,041
I planted Baichen Grass

522
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,442
in the fields before.

523
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,682
Where have you all taken them?

524
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:33,402
Senior Brother.

525
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:34,962
How is it?

526
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,242
Master Song He, any progress?

527
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:39,841
The elders and I have reviewed it.

528
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,041
Huang Qi is right.

529
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:41,962
This prescription

530
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,922
can indeed help
restore your spiritual core.

531
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:45,482
The Vermilion Grass,

532
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,682
Wuyuan Water and Wangqiu Stone

533
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:48,122
have already been located.

534
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,482
Thank you, Master Song He.

535
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:52,521
But the remaining six spirit herbs...

536
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,041
Just say it.

537
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,281
They are exceptionally rare.

538
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,242
However,

539
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:01,442
I've informed Master Hong Yan.

540
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:02,841
Though your injury

541
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:03,761
must remain secret,

542
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:04,521
he should

543
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,001
safeguard your ascension.

544
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:07,402
After careful consideration,

545
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,202
I decided to inform him.

546
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,682
More help means

547
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:11,882
better chances.

548
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:15,922
Rest assured.

549
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,521
I and the elders

550
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,321
will surely find a way to help you.

551
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:45,041
I wonder how Huan Zong is doing.

552
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:46,682
He hasn't sent

553
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,321
any messages to me.

554
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:58,882
Maybe

555
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,162
I'll message him.

556
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:04,321
My messenger talismans!

557
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:07,482
My messenger talismans.

558
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:11,482
What to do?

559
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:16,601
I can only

560
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:17,801
try my best.

561
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:19,442
Don't get damaged.

562
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,041
Or I couldn't contact

563
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,202
Huan Zong.

564
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,521
Why is the sun gone?

565
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,561
Let me blow on you.

566
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:39,922
I'll give you another blow.

567
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,601
Dry quickly, please.

568
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:47,361
Please.

569
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,761
Hang in there.

570
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,922
Let me try.

571
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,202
Why won't they activate?

572
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,402
Huan Zong.

573
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:58,521
They're all broken.

574
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:01,242
What should I do now?

575
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:04,321
Master.

576
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:09,361
What do you mean?

577
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:10,361
This command token

578
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:11,321
represents

579
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,682
leadership of the Liuguang Sect,

580
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:13,962
also your responsibilities.

581
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,321
It stays with you.

582
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:16,041
It...

583
00:22:18,882 --> 00:22:20,361
Are you afraid...

584
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,521
I understand.

585
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:25,482
You concern about spiritual core,
and think about the big picture.

586
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,202
But we've dispatched disciples

587
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:28,442
to seek herbs for your

588
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,202
spiritual core.

589
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:31,001
Masters.

590
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:33,281
You got me wrong.

591
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:36,962
I think

592
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,922
I couldn't wait idly,

593
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,321
so I'll search for the herbs myself.

594
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,242
During my absence,

595
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:44,682
Luanfeng Peak affairs

596
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:46,001
will suffer.

597
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:49,402
After deliberation,

598
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,882
I decided to return the token

599
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,722
to your care.

600
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,642
When I recover,

601
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,001
I'll reclaim it then.

602
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:01,281
Young Master.

603
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,162
Young Master.

604
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,601
Masters.

605
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:07,962
Did your Young Master

606
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,561
mention his destination?

607
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:11,561
He...

608
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,482
H-He didn't...

609
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:18,162
He didn't mention it at all.

610
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,922
Report the situation to the head

611
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,202
and I every day.

612
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,202
Understood.

613
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:24,281
Take care of him.

614
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,841
Be cautious. Don't act rashly.

615
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:28,081
Yes.

616
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:31,202
Do you have sufficient funds?

617
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,001
Yes.

618
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,482
We've brought ample travel funds.

619
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:35,521
Take this.

620
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:37,521
Don't be frugal.

621
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:39,162
Understood.

622
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:39,761
Right,

623
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,682
do you prepare the elixirs?

624
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,321
Yes.

625
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,616
Aside from the regular elixirs,

626
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,280
we also brought those
from Master Huang Qi.

627
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:47,242
These are new elixirs I made.

628
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,442
Understood.

629
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:50,841
And here are

630
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,601
my messenger talismans.

631
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,482
Yes.

632
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:54,561
Report

633
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,281
the situation to me

634
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,722
through these.

635
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,442
Yes.

636
00:23:58,482 --> 00:23:59,162
And...

637
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,361
That's sufficient.

638
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,242
That's sufficient, Master.

639
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,041
If I don't go now,

640
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,041
Young Master will go afar

641
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,242
and I won't catch up with him.

642
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,402
Alright.

643
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:08,561
Go.

644
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:09,321
Yes.

645
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:10,482
Wait.

646
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,041
Remember my words.

647
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,321
Got it.

648
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:17,361
Young Master!

649
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:20,001
Wait for me, Young Master!

650
00:24:29,562 --> 00:24:37,856
(Outside Qiu City)

651
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:41,402
Excuse me.

652
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,242
May I ask

653
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:43,882
how far Qiu City is from here?

654
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:44,642
Qiu City?

655
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:45,841
Thirty li ahead

656
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:46,801
lies Qiu City.

657
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:47,561
Thank you.

658
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:48,882
It's nothing.

659
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:50,601
(Then I'll)

660
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:52,081
(explore Lingyou Realm)

661
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:53,482
(The Complete Works of Master Writer)
(as written in Master Writer's storybooks.)

662
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:56,642
Qiu City belongs to Yunhua Sect.

663
00:24:56,722 --> 00:24:57,281
Yunhua Sect

664
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,162
maintains regional stability

665
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:01,202
while granting autonomy
to local residents.

666
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,482
All Qiu City affairs

667
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:04,041
are handled by the city magistrate.

668
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:05,882
Due to proximity to western wilderness,

669
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:06,761
scavengers often

670
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,521
appear near Qiu City.

671
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:10,321
These scavengers are actually organized

672
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,882
petty thieves and pickpockets.

673
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,001
You!

674
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:18,841
Stop!

675
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,361
Return my purse!

676
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:28,922
Stop!

677
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:30,882
Be careful.

678
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:33,242
Stop!

679
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,281
Give it back!

680
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,442
Give it back!

681
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:55,761
What happened?

682
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:56,841
Who is he? Just go.

683
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:00,162
Alright.

684
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:01,202
Just ignore that guy.

685
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,361
It's okay.

686
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:08,922
Young Master.

687
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,482
Are you thinking about

688
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,081
that Lady Kong Hou?

689
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,882
I've told you

690
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,321
if she considered you a friend,

691
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,841
she would've...

692
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:18,761
Where to?

693
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:20,601
Take a stroll.

694
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:21,122
Wait,

695
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,361
where to?

696
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:23,281
Where to exactly?

697
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,321
Stop!

698
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:41,281
Give back my purse!

699
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,122
Stop there!

700
00:26:58,521 --> 00:26:59,361
Kong Hou.

701
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:02,202
Kong Hou.

702
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:04,162
Huan Zong.

703
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,882
The water isn't deep at all.

704
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:12,041
I thought...

705
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:13,202
Why are you here?

706
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,122
I was chasing someone...

707
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:16,561
Huan Zong.

708
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,081
Why are you here too?

709
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:22,561
Sorry.

710
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,162
I accidentally

711
00:27:23,162 --> 00:27:24,482
pushed you into the water.

712
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:25,561
Let me help you.

713
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,081
I'll tidy you up.

714
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,081
Enough.

715
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:30,122
You suddenly

716
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:31,761
pushed me into water.

717
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,162
And you made my clothes

718
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,122
soaked.

719
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:37,041
I-I really didn't mean it.

720
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:41,841
Huan Zong.

721
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,162
Never thought

722
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:44,361
we'd meet again

723
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:46,521
in such a way.

724
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:47,642
Never expect it either.

725
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:51,722
Huan Zong.

726
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:52,841
I have matters to attend to.

727
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:54,682
Let's meet in Qiu City.

728
00:27:54,761 --> 00:27:55,561
It's settled.

729
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:56,841
I won't stand you up, I promise.

730
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,642
It's settled.

731
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,202
You...

732
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,682
Are you kidding? A phoenix?

733
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:04,482
You've probably never seen a pheasant.

734
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,122
You!

735
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:06,962
I swear I'm telling the truth.

736
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:08,962
The genuine Azure Phoenix.

737
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:09,761
Azure Phoenix.

738
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,041
I heard the Zhaohan Sect people

739
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,242
are getting it to Qiu City.

740
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:13,801
(Azure Phoenix?)

741
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,122
(Isn't it what)

742
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,482
(Young Master is looking for?)

743
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:17,281
Really?

744
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:22,361
You're talking about the Azure Phoenix?

745
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,202
Watch out!

746
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,402
You thief!

747
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,482
Thank you for helping me.

748
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,482
Who are you?

749
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,202
I'm just

750
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:27,801
after the scavengers like you are.

751
00:29:27,882 --> 00:29:28,482
I helped you

752
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,361
back there.

753
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:30,281
If I were evil,

754
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,521
would I have helped you?

755
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,962
Right?

756
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:35,402
(Seems like she's from a major sect.)

757
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:41,402
Don't worry.

758
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:42,402
We're both women.

759
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:43,361
I'll keep your secret.

760
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,281
If you dare blab,

761
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:44,841
I'll...

762
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:49,081
Your skills are impressive.

763
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,962
Clearly from a major sect.

764
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:51,841
And I'll

765
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,041
keep my promise.

766
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:54,682
So,

767
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,922
let's part ways here.

768
00:29:57,122 --> 00:29:58,922
Go our separate paths.

769
00:30:04,722 --> 00:30:06,281
(Fengxiang Inn)
What's wrong?

770
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,521
The Zhaohan Sect people are

771
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:09,242
escorting a phoenix from the North back

772
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:10,001
to the sect.

773
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,361
What's going on?

774
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:12,761
Why the commotion?

775
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,442
Why so many people?

776
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:16,442
Young Master.

777
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,722
That's what I told you,

778
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:18,841
the Zhaohan Sect's

779
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,162
Azure Phoenix.

780
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,402
Calm down.

781
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:23,761
We are so lucky.

782
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:25,122
Just find it right here.

783
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:26,962
Want to stand here

784
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:27,962
and do nothing?

785
00:30:28,801 --> 00:30:29,761
Well,

786
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,601
should we take the suite or courtyard?

787
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:33,442
Your call.

788
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:34,841
Just somewhere quiet.

789
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:35,561
Fine.

790
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,561
You look

791
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:39,321
for her.

792
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:40,882
Me?

793
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:42,001
Any problem?

794
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:43,642
Not at all.

795
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:45,162
Then let's move.

796
00:30:47,242 --> 00:30:48,482
Right,

797
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:49,922
I promised Huan Zong

798
00:30:49,962 --> 00:30:51,841
to meet in Qiu City.

799
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,081
My stupid memory...

800
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:55,521
I'll definitely lose track of him again.

801
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,242
Lord will return soon.

802
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,281
If we prepare the elixir

803
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,001
from the Azure Phoenix,

804
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,841
and we'll be greatly rewarded.

805
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:12,281
You know

806
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:13,882
what to do.

807
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:16,041
Make it done.

808
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,162
Understood?

809
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,882
(Endless Visitors)

810
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:33,841
This way, please.

811
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:35,561
Be careful.

812
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:39,601
Our suites are

813
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:40,882
on these two floors.

814
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,521
Such a spacious courtyard.

815
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,442
This way, please.

816
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:53,761
Should you need an elixir chamber

817
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,722
or private courtyard,

818
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,162
we have them available.

819
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,402
A suite will do.

820
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,281
I can tell

821
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,841
you are from a major sect.

822
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,962
Why travel alone?

823
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:06,642
Without any attendant?

824
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:08,521
Cultivation

825
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:09,882
isn't about showing off.

826
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:11,081
No need

827
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,321
to scatter flowers

828
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:13,801
like some grand operas.

829
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:14,301
Well...

830
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,001
Look!

831
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,088
(Endless Visitors)

832
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:32,024
(Fairy Ling Bo, Zhaohan Sect)

833
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:40,521
It's her.

834
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:42,442
Fairy.

835
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:43,682
Watch your step.

836
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:45,841
Are you alright?

837
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:49,001
What a coincidence.

838
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:54,841
Fairy Ling Bo,

839
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:56,482
your disciples escorting the phoenix

840
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:57,122
have arrived.

841
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:58,001
Resting in suites.

842
00:32:58,081 --> 00:32:58,682
This way.

843
00:32:58,882 --> 00:32:59,482
This way.

844
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,242
Please.

845
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:03,722
(So she's from Zhaohan Sect.)

846
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:05,402
(How many flowers would be required)

847
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,882
(along her path?)

848
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,601
I intended to roam the martial world.

849
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:20,242
But upon seeing you,

850
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:22,001
I think I have to stop.

851
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,561
What do you want?

852
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:24,442
Lady,

853
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,162
got any fire?

854
00:33:27,242 --> 00:33:28,281
Since you don't,

855
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:29,321
how did you manage

856
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,402
to ignite my heart?

857
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:35,242
M-Mind your words.

858
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,162
I could,

859
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:38,361
but upon seeing you,

860
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:39,321
at this moment,

861
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,001
I couldn't keep my composure.

862
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,242
Unctuous.

863
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:43,561
Lady,

864
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:45,242
to wash spiritual fruits,

865
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:46,202
what took you so long?

866
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:47,122
Come over here.

867
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:48,341
Lady.

868
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:51,482
You dare flirt with my maid?

869
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,001
Do you know who I am?

870
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:54,122
No.

871
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:55,482
I don't care.

872
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:57,922
Wait.

873
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,841
Flirting?

874
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,922
We're all roaming
in the martial world.

875
00:34:02,922 --> 00:34:04,682
I simply wished to befriend her.

876
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:06,761
Besides,

877
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,441
I talked to your maid,

878
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:09,801
not you.

879
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,162
Why the anger?

880
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,522
Unless

881
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:13,321
you think

882
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:14,921
I ignored you

883
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:16,361
because I talked to your maid

884
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:17,481
instead of you?

885
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:19,042
Who cares?

886
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:20,042
Do you even deserve it?

887
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:22,162
So be it.

888
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:23,242
Why the anger?

889
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,122
I don't bother arguing with you.

890
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:26,682
Don't let me see you again.

891
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,002
I haven't finished

892
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,401
asking.

893
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:34,401
Never mind.

894
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:36,401
I'll do it myself tonight.

895
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,682
Didn't even name a specific spot.

896
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,441
Where should I look for Huan Zong?

What?

907
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:37,642
Why set a barrier here?

908
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:48,481
Waiter.

909
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:49,881
I demand a room change.

910
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,202
Who's lodging next to me?

911
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,481
Singing at this hour.

912
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:54,801
All rooms are occupied now.

913
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:55,761
Perhaps,

914
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:57,162
endure this one night?

915
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:58,202
Tomorrow morning,

916
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,481
I'll arrange it immediately.

917
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:00,841
I'll depart tomorrow.

918
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,202
Go negotiate on my behalf now.

919
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:03,202
Well...

920
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,082
Maybe you'd go yourself.

921
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,202
A barrier set at the door.

922
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,682
I can't get in.

923
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:08,722
Exactly.

924
00:36:08,722 --> 00:36:10,361
Even you can't get in,

925
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,441
I couldn't possibly get in either.

926
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:14,602
So you won't go?

927
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:15,242
I...

928
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:16,441
Where's your room?

929
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,761
I'll sleep in your room tonight.

930
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,602
Don't.

931
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:19,602
Please don't.

932
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:20,242
Don't.

933
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,281
Fairy, let me tell you.

934
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:23,522
The neighbor next door

935
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,162
is from the Zhaohan Sect.

936
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:26,801
That's a major sect.

937
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,361
I can't afford to offend them.

938
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:30,361
A major sect, so what?

939
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,321
I am

940
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,682
Kong Hou of Yunhua Sect.

941
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:34,801
Fairy,

942
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:36,562
to be honest with you,

943
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,082
the one living next to you

944
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,361
isn't human.

945
00:36:40,642 --> 00:36:41,801
What?

946
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:43,961
Then a ghost?

947
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:45,042
No.

948
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:45,881
It's

949
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:48,321
the Azure Phoenix of Zhaohan Sect.

950
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:50,682
The phoenix can sing?

951
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:51,602
That's why

952
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:53,042
it's a millennia-old phoenix.

953
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,401
It's extremely precious.

954
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:55,682
I truly can't

955
00:36:55,722 --> 00:36:57,202
afford to offend it.

956
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:58,242
If...

957
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:59,682
If you truly can't

958
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:00,522
make do,

959
00:37:00,602 --> 00:37:01,481
then I

960
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:02,841
have to offer you

961
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,042
my room.

962
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:06,602
Forget it.

I can't sleep,

974
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:47,401
and I can't even read in peace.

975
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,401
I'm about to lose my mind.

976
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,361
