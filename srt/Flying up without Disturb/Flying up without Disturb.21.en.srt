=Episode 21=

16
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:48,618
You're back.

17
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:50,538
Yes.

18
00:01:59,139 --> 00:01:59,859
Master,

19
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,779
let me help regulate your energy.

20
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:03,458
No. You mustn't.

21
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:06,538
Your spiritual core hasn't
fully stabilized.

22
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,418
You can't afford to expend more energy.

23
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:09,418
But Master...

24
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:10,578
No more arguments.

25
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:13,538
Yes.

26
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,258
As your master,

27
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,858
I've failed you.

28
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,499
Master, don't say that.

29
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,379
You were strict in my early years

30
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:26,418
because you had no choice.

31
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,659
I understand.

32
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,298
Moreover, you've always

33
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:30,779
genuinely cared for me.

34
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,258
I've long known this.

35
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:33,619
So, Master,

36
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:35,738
don't blame yourself on my account.

37
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,219
Zhong Xi,

38
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:40,818
you've changed.

39
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,379
You would never say that

40
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:46,418
in the past.

41
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,059
Yes.

42
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,538
I feel I've changed quite a bit too.

43
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:55,459
That companion you found at Yunhua Sect

44
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:58,698
taught you how to open your heart.

45
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,018
Your temperament

46
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,258
has become far more open than before.

47
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,619
These are lessons

48
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:07,698
that no sect

49
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,578
could ever teach you.

50
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:14,659
I used to believe

51
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,538
that to master the sword,

52
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:19,939
one must abandon emotions and desires.

53
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:21,379
But Master,

54
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,018
if that were true,

55
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,939
how would we differ

56
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,939
from mere swords

57
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,858
or weapons?

58
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,138
Master, do you know?

59
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:34,858
Kong Hou has truly taught me

60
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:35,818
many vital truths.

61
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,219
She showed me

62
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,138
that this world

63
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,698
holds more than cultivation, swordplay,

64
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,138
or slaying demons.

65
00:03:44,138 --> 00:03:45,138
These past days,

66
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,179
she's guided me across the land,

67
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,059
tasting delicacies along the way.

68
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:51,738
It reveals to me

69
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,219
the beauty inherent in all things.

70
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,018
Truthfully,

71
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:58,619
being with her

72
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,138
brings me joy.

73
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,059
Zhong Xi,

74
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,738
regarding Kong Hou...

75
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,459
Master,

76
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,818
I wish to form a cultivation

77
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,738
partnership with her.

78
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:32,259
Master Jin Yue.

79
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:33,418
Master Song He.

80
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:35,899
Formalities are unnecessary,
Master Hong Yan.

81
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:37,618
How is Zhong Xi?

82
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,538
Rest assured.

83
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,899
Zhong Xi's fine.

84
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:42,819
Zhong Xi

85
00:04:43,538 --> 00:04:44,298
is destined

86
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:45,699
for ascension.

87
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:47,058
Our Yuexing Sect

88
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,378
exists to safeguard those
destined to ascend.

89
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,899
I'll definitely do my best.

90
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,339
If anyone

91
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:53,699
jeopardizes the ascension,

92
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,819
we will intervene.

93
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,378
Don't worry about it.

94
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,058
Join me in the inner hall for details.

95
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,319
After you.

96
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,659
(The Way Stands Supreme)

97
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,579
We've obtained the Crossfin Fishbone.

98
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:09,178
Only one ingredient remains

99
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:10,899
to restore Zhong Xi's spiritual core.

100
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,538
Yet now his focus wanders.

101
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,178
Has he forgotten

102
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:16,738
his solemn duty?

103
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,538
Rest assured.

104
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,178
Trust in Zhong Xi.

105
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,099
Even partnered with Kong Hou,

106
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:23,538
he'll never abandon

107
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,019
his ascension destiny.

108
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:27,978
Ling Hui, do you think

109
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,298
his master might be

110
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,378
against my marriage

111
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:32,418
with Zhong Xi,

112
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,459
and

113
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,298
locked him up?

114
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:36,938
If Zhong Xi attempts escape,

115
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,418
he'll punish him.

116
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:40,298
I don't want Zhong Xi to be harmed.

117
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,058
Even if...

118
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,538
Even if his master disapproves,

119
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,058
I don't want him to be punished.

120
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:44,819
Ling Hui,

121
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,019
how about this?

122
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,178
Let's go steal Zhong Xi back.

123
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,139
Okay.

124
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,219
Who are you going to steal?

125
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,378
Me?

126
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,058
Zhong Xi.

127
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:03,978
I thought...

128
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,058
I thought...

129
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:06,899
Thought what?

130
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,699
I-I thought something
had happened to you.

131
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:10,738
By the way,

132
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,259
is your master alright?

133
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,219
I haven't been eating or sleeping

134
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:14,978
these days.

135
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,339
I'm worried something may

136
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,298
happen to your master.

137
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,418
I feared maybe

138
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,738
he disapproves of our marriage,

139
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,938
and has detained you.

140
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:21,858
I'm also worried

141
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,418
if he has locked you up somewhere,

142
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,058
punishing you, and scolding you.

143
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,618
You didn't even send a message.

144
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:28,938
You're unbelievable.

145
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,899
I want to say

146
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,298
my Master has agreed.

147
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,498
And he's prepared

148
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:46,139
an exceptionally generous
betrothal gift.

149
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,779
I'll propose to Yunhua Sect soon.

150
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,418
Really?

151
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:49,418
Yes.

152
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,019
What time is it now?

153
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:35,378
That brat and Tan Feng

154
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:36,538
still aren't back.

155
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:47,538
(Sunlit Zenith)

156
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,738
What's wrong, Tan Feng?

157
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,378
Both of you, let go first.

158
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:53,498
Why?

159
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:55,139
I was going to take Zhong Xi

160
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,178
to meet Master anyway.

161
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,498
Have you decided what to say?

162
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,339
Just tell the truth.

163
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,498
Tell him that we're getting married,

164
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:02,298
and that

165
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,779
the lightning strike issue

166
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:04,858
has also been resolved.

167
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:05,538
Besides,

168
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,459
my temperament has improved.

169
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:09,418
Master won't refuse.

170
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,618
Good luck to you both.

171
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:13,899
Tan Feng,

172
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,779
you're not coming with us?

173
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,139
I'll pass.

174
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,538
Master's mad because
I didn't reply his message.

175
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:20,938
If I show up now,

176
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:21,858
I'll get scolded.

177
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,099
I'll hide at Ling Hui's.

178
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:25,498
You...

179
00:08:25,858 --> 00:08:26,579
Why tagging along?

180
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,618
That old man wants to beat me.

181
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,459
I'm not going.

182
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:30,959
Let's go.

183
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,419
Don't worry. I'm here.

184
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,819
Master,

185
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,299
this is Zhong Xi from Luanfeng Peak.

186
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,258
You are Zhong Xi?

187
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,658
Greetings, Master.

188
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,258
You reckless girl.

189
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,658
You didn't even send word

190
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,378
before bringing him here.

191
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:58,778
Senior,

192
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,138
here's a modest gift

193
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,378
as token of respect.

194
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,819
Luanfeng Peak cultivators

195
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:09,018
finally learned some manners?

196
00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:11,179
Let me see.

197
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:12,219
Master, look.

198
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:13,459
Liuguang Sect has

199
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,778
so many interesting things.

200
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:16,618
Look at you!

201
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,699
Mengshi Mushrooms?

202
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,898
What's that?

203
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,339
T-They cure diarrhea.

204
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:29,658
Why laugh?

205
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:31,059
It's an illness. Remedies needed.

206
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,099
What's so funny?

207
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,498
Unexpectedly,

208
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,219
Master Zhong Xi

209
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,658
managed to find Mengshi Mushrooms.

210
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,858
Kong Hou mentioned

211
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,219
your stomach ailments.

212
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,819
Hence, I sent people

213
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:45,898
to find this.

214
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,658
I hope you'll accept it.

215
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:50,018
Zhong Xi,

216
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,179
you're so thoughtful.

217
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,256
It's only proper.

218
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,179
You are...

219
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:57,179
Master,

220
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,018
I brought him back this time

221
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,138
just to tell you

222
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,778
that I want to marry Zhong Xi.

223
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:04,498
M-Ma...

224
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,099
Marry him?

225
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:06,978
You two

226
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,179
want to get married?

227
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,258
Yes.

228
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,778
I love him.

229
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,618
Do you even know

230
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:15,618
what "love" means?

231
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,738
When I first left the sect,

232
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:19,099
I truly didn't understand.

233
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,738
But now I know.

234
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,299
We've faced life and death together.

235
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:24,939
My heart is certain

236
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:29,219
that I love him.

237
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,018
I want to be with him

238
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:31,978
forever and ever.

239
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,018
Stop

240
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,138
spouting nonsense!

241
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,419
Take him away immediately!

242
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:40,579
I don't want to see him at all!

243
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:41,778
And take

244
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:42,858
this thing away too!

245
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,778
I can't accept it!

246
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:45,858
Master,

247
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,459
what's wrong with you?

248
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,778
You tell me.

249
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,099
Your marriage...

250
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,939
I won't allow it!

251
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,138
Master...

252
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,699
What should we do?

253
00:10:57,179 --> 00:10:59,099
(Why is Master Wang Tong so opposed?)

254
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,378
(Does he know that Kong Hou...)

255
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:07,459
Don't worry, Zhong Xi.

256
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:08,778
Master dotes on me most.

257
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:09,819
He'll agree eventually.

258
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,219
He's just reluctant to let me go.

259
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:13,898
It's fine. I can convince him.

260
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:16,738
You're the one I have chosen.

261
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,138
I'll surely take responsibility.

262
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:19,378
Okay.

263
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,738
Let's go.

264
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:30,258
(This day)

265
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,819
(has come so soon?)

266
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,579
Since ancient times,

267
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:48,939
war has always harmed the common people.

268
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,258
This is especially true
in the mortal realm.

269
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,339
Such wickedness.

270
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,459
Wickedness...

271
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,378
Madam?

272
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:06,258
Please save my child.

273
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:07,699
Save her.

274
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:08,378
Alright.

275
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:12,498
Master.

276
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,138
How do you recognize me?

277
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,459
Master,

278
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,819
I know you're not from this place.

279
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,099
No need to save me.

280
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,299
I know my time has come.

281
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:29,258
Just please save my child.

282
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:32,939
I beg you to save her.

283
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:33,459
Alright.

284
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:34,378
Alright.

285
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,778
- Please, Master.
- Alright.

286
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:40,699
Her name is

287
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:43,018
Kong Hou.

288
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:46,459
Madam.

289
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,579
(When I first saw this girl)

290
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,059
(in the mortal realm,)

291
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:53,339
(I knew)

292
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,299
(she was no ordinary person.)

293
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,778
But who could have predicted...

294
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,858
If they

295
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:01,898
truly get married,

296
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,299
with Master Zhong Xi's status,

297
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,138
the secret will not
remain hidden for long.

298
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,819
Will Kong Hou

299
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,939
get involved again?

300
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:22,939
My lord, I've failed.

301
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,378
Many of our people

302
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,299
have been captured by Luanfeng Peak.

303
00:13:27,018 --> 00:13:28,018
But now it's settled.

304
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,419
With the Lord's return,

305
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:31,059
he'll surely lead us

306
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,419
to revive the Yueluo Clan.

307
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:33,898
This is nothing.

308
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,539
When evading

309
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,699
those hunters back then,

310
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,539
I didn't even have a safe place

311
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:39,299
to sleep.

312
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:40,858
The slightest lapse

313
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,138
would cost my life.

314
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:44,898
Dark cultivators,

315
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,378
surrender now!

316
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,778
Senior, someone's here.

317
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:32,939
I failed to locate you

318
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:33,658
promptly,

319
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,219
thus failing the Lord's trust.

320
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,419
Even my formidable father

321
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,378
could not withstand it.

322
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:41,419
With your meager skills,

323
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,179
there's no need

324
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,378
to overestimate yourself.

325
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:47,618
Moreover,

326
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,459
I have this now.

327
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,299
This is

328
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,339
the Dark Cloud Tablet?

329
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,738
With this,

330
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,778
those self-righteous sects

331
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,898
shall soon witness my power.

332
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,778
I'll make them taste

333
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:09,258
the agony of losing loved ones

334
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,378
and descending into the abyss.

335
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:12,819
Master.

336
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,778
Master, are you calm now?

337
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:17,858
I'm perfectly calm.

338
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,419
It's you who seems to be agitated

339
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,579
and act impulsively.

340
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:21,658
Master,

341
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:23,498
I know you can't bear to part with me,

342
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,419
but

343
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,419
my decision

344
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:26,858
was made after careful thought.

345
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,539
It's not impulsive at all.

346
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:29,258
Besides,

347
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,658
you needn't worry about me.

348
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,618
Aren't you backing me?

349
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:33,459
As for Zhong Xi,

350
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,778
he'll surely treat me well.

351
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:39,778
Summon him here.

352
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,819
So you're the one Kong Hou

353
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,339
rescued in the Forbidden Forest.

354
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:56,778
Regarding this,

355
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:58,258
I should've informed you earlier,

356
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,699
but never anticipated...

357
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,138
Let's set this aside for now.

358
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,778
First, discuss your plans

359
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,618
to get married.

360
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:07,939
You've known each other briefly,

361
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:09,539
and I don't know you well.

362
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:11,018
Naturally, I won't entrust

363
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,258
Kong Hou to you carelessly.

364
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:13,459
I understand.

365
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,819
So to proceed with the marriage,

366
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,378
you must first pass

367
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,459
my three trials.

368
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,018
Any objections?

369
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:22,738
No.

370
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,939
Your Liuguang Sect members

371
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,219
are notoriously arrogant,

372
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,579
never humbling yourselves

373
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:30,378
nor enduring grievances.

374
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:31,738
So,

375
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,658
my first trial

376
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:34,939
is to serve Kong Hou.

377
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:35,978
Serve?

378
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:37,978
Why the fuss?

379
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:39,658
Master,

380
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:41,539
what do you mean by "serve"?

381
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,459
After we get married,

382
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:43,978
we'll

383
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,258
care for each other for sure.

384
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,539
Aren't you being unreasonable?

385
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,978
I simply want to see

386
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,378
if Master Zhong Xi

387
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:56,179
can be attentive.

388
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,419
After all, Kong Hou

389
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,099
was pampered since childhood

390
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,419
by our Yunhua Sect.

391
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,259
I accept.

392
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:06,579
Zhong Xi.

393
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:08,458
After marriage,

394
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:09,819
I'm supposed to care for you.

395
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,138
This trial

396
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:12,658
is trivial.

397
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:19,418
Start washing.

398
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,658
To serve Kong Hou,

399
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:22,658
you must ensure

400
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,698
her hands never touch mundane chores.

401
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:25,819
From now on, laundry

402
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,819
and dishwashing

403
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,178
shall be your tasks.

404
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,059
I'm just here for amusement.

405
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,418
Master's serious.

406
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:34,739
Master,

407
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,739
this pile's enormous.

408
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,099
I merely assigned laundry

409
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,099
and bedding washing.

410
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:39,858
If you complain,

411
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,259
I'll make him scrub my shoes

412
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,218
and wash socks.

413
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:42,938
Master! Master!

414
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,099
Forget it.

415
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,739
Senior, don't worry.

416
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,019
I can handle it.

417
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:52,858
At least you know your place.

418
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:54,539
No magic allowed.

419
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,218
I'll be watching you closely.

420
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:58,658
Master.

421
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:14,658
Use your feet.

422
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,178
Like this.

423
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:25,019
How can you use your feet?

424
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:25,698
Master,

425
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,618
didn't you teach me

426
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:28,099
and Tan Feng this when I was young?

427
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,579
With this pile of clothes,

428
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,299
we need our feet to get them clean.

429
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:32,819
Tan Feng, isn't that right?

430
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,458
Yes, that's right.

431
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,099
Nonsense!

432
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,059
Zhong Xi, let me help you.

433
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,099
Master, don't be angry.

434
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,858
Master,

435
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:09,698
please let Tan Feng

436
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:10,779
assist Zhong Xi.

437
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,739
How can you make

438
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,378
Zhong Xi mop alone all the time?

439
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,698
You'll work him to death.

440
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,099
Tan Feng is not available.

441
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,019
Can't you see

442
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:17,938
he's occupied?

443
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,259
Will mopping really kill him?

444
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,099
Don't forget...

445
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,218
Don't forget

446
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:23,898
you're going to marry him.

447
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,898
Master,

448
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,819
that's enough.

449
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,618
What do you mean by "enough"?

450
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:40,819
Nothing can be off!

451
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:41,499
Keep going!

452
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:55,979
Lady Ling Bo.

453
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:57,378
I

454
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,658
apologize for deceiving you

455
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,418
earlier.

456
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:01,658
Can you forgive me?

457
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:04,858
No way.

458
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:07,378
W-Who apologizes via messenger talisman?

459
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,059
Using a talisman

460
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,178
shows zero sincerity!

461
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:10,979
B-But if I don't apologize

462
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,458
to her

463
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:13,858
and she ignores me

464
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,698
or keeps giving me cold looks,

465
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:16,898
what should I do?

466
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,378
What's wrong with me?

467
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:20,019
Since when

468
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,499
did I become so indecisive?

469
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:23,418
Whatever.

470
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,259
She's returning to her sect,

471
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,019
not entering any dangerous place.

472
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,019
What could happen?

473
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:28,858
Forget it.

474
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,579
S-Sent?

475
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,339
I didn't even decide what to say!

476
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,658
How was it sent already?

477
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:47,059
(Who apologizes via messenger talisman?)

478
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:47,819
(Using a talisman)

479
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,059
(shows zero sincerity!)

480
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,938
(B-But if I don't apologize)

481
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:52,299
(to her)

482
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:53,579
(and she ignores me)

483
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,458
(or keeps giving me cold looks,)

484
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,658
(what should I do?)

485
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:58,938
(What's wrong with me?)

486
00:20:58,938 --> 00:20:59,698
(Since when)

487
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,019
(did I become so indecisive?)

488
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:02,099
(Forget it.)

489
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:03,898
(She's returning to her sect,)

490
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:05,658
(not entering any dangerous place.)

491
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,739
(What could happen?)

492
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:07,499
(Forget it.)

493
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,819
What nonsense are you spouting?

494
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,019
You stupid fox.

495
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:17,499
I know your Liuguang Sect members

496
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:18,618
practice fasting

497
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:19,458
and don't eat.

498
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,938
But Kong Hou can't do that.

499
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,579
She'll starve if she's with you.

500
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:25,698
You know Kong Hou

501
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,019
has been pampered since childhood.

502
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,218
Even fruits must be artistically carved.

503
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:32,698
When did I ever

504
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:33,539
eat carved fruits?

505
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:34,218
Shut up!

506
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:35,458
Of course.

507
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:36,938
The carvings

508
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,579
must be extraordinary artwork.

509
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,418
Here you go!

510
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,579
You're truly remarkable!

511
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,898
Let me try it too.

512
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:29,059
When I first learned swordplay
in the sect,

513
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:30,499
Master asked me

514
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,218
to carve a hundred watermelons
every day.

515
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,019
(I must've been out of my mind.)

516
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:38,458
(How could I forget
he's a sword cultivator?)

517
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,499
Not clean enough. Wipe it again.

518
00:22:58,019 --> 00:22:58,819
Master,

519
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,418
if you keep this up,

520
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:01,579
even I can't stand it.

521
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:02,138
If you can't,

522
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:03,299
don't marry him then!

523
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:05,218
I'm going out.

524
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:17,779
Master.

525
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,339
Master.

526
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:23,259
Keep an eye on him for me.

527
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:23,759
Got it.

528
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:29,218
- Master.
- Senior.

529
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:30,339
Master.

530
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,019
What's wrong

531
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,059
with all this fuss?

532
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,019
Senior,

533
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:34,898
it's terrible.

534
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:36,059
My cat's missing.

535
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,858
Your cat's missing?

536
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,019
Don't panic.

537
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:42,138
There've been
many tomcats around lately.

538
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,499
It's probably got lured away.

539
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:44,938
Then help me look for it.

540
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:46,339
I've got important matters

541
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:47,059
to attend to here.

542
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,418
No time to search for your cat.

543
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,418
Besides, cat-finding isn't my duty.

544
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:51,698
Master,

545
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,299
you're Yunhua Sect's

546
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:55,019
m-m-most

547
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,698
skilled tracker!

548
00:23:56,698 --> 00:23:57,539
Exactly, Senior.

549
00:23:57,658 --> 00:23:59,618
So just help her, okay?

550
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,938
Just help me find it.

551
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:01,898
Fine, fine!

552
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:03,178
I'll help you find it.

553
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,378
Don't you dare help him cheat.

554
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,339
Enough.

555
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,099
Get moving.

556
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:08,898
Let's go, Senior.

557
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,099
Okay, go.

558
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:11,739
Hurry.

559
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,938
- Hurry up!
- Why are you panicking?

560
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:14,938
How can I not panic?

561
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:15,579
Where did you

562
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,378
see it last?

563
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:17,979
I don't remember.

564
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,339
- Kong Hou.
- Zhong Xi,

565
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:21,698
stop working.

566
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,819
Master's away on business.

567
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:23,618
Take a break.

568
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:25,378
I promised your master

569
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,539
to clean all these properly.

570
00:24:27,378 --> 00:24:28,658
I see what's going on now.

571
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:29,499
Master is just

572
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:30,618
making things hard for you.

573
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,418
Even if you work harder and better,

574
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,539
he'll never be satisfied.

575
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:35,858
Exhausted, aren't you?

576
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:39,979
I never thought you'd

577
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:40,938
do so much for me.

578
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:51,819
Senior.

579
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:55,499
I've completed the three trials

580
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:56,819
you mentioned earlier.

581
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:58,418
Exactly, Master.

582
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:00,339
Zhong Xi passed all three trials.

583
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:00,979
You should

584
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,259
approve our marriage now.

585
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,418
No.

586
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,259
Master,

587
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:09,458
how can you back out?

588
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:11,178
No means no!

589
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,019
No one could change this!

590
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:13,819
I absolutely forbid

591
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,019
your marriage!

592
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:15,658
Get back

593
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:16,739
to your Liuguang Sect!

594
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:18,898
Master, you've gone too far!

595
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:19,858
Y-You...

596
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:41,059
Her spiritual energy's normal,
meridians unobstructed.

597
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,339
Why did she faint?

598
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:47,698
(Stubborn girl,)

599
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,339
(faking an illness to trick me?)

600
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:50,739
However...

601
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:51,938
Senior,

602
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:53,618
what's going on?

603
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:00,979
Her spiritual energy normal,
meridians unobstructed.

604
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,979
Why did she faint?

605
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:08,779
This must be a matter of heart.

606
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:09,938
Matter of heart?

607
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,499
It's all because of you,

608
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,218
we become like this!

609
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,898
You stay and care for her properly.

610
00:26:14,898 --> 00:26:15,858
I'll consult the Head

611
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:17,259
about possible solutions.

612
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,418
Her meridians are indeed unobstructed.

613
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:36,418
No abnormalities in spiritual energy.

614
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:39,579
(Could her seal slipped)

615
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,819
(and the dark energy)

616
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,418
(hit back, so she fainted?)

617
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,099
(I must help her)

618
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:46,858
(suppress the dark energy
within her body.)

619
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:20,378
Why did you place a seal

620
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,138
on Kong Hou?

621
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,618
What do you mean, Senior?
I don't understand.

622
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:26,418
Is that so?

623
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:28,739
I've said before

624
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,218
this is a matter of heart.

625
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:31,658
In such circumstances,

626
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:32,658
I've never heard

627
00:27:32,658 --> 00:27:34,178
of any rescue method

628
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,378
requiring the use of seals.

629
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:38,259
Master Zhong Xi,

630
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,218
you should know

631
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,779
that fabricating random excuses

632
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:42,218
won't deceive me.

633
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,178
Moreover,

634
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,898
you're not skilled at lying.

635
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,779
About Kong Hou,

636
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,458
have you discovered something?

637
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:52,539
So it seems

638
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:55,178
you knew long ago.

639
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,019
Who else knows about this?

640
00:27:58,938 --> 00:27:59,938
Senior, don't worry.

641
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:01,378
Regarding Kong Hou,

642
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,059
my thoughts align with yours.

643
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:04,059
I will never

644
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,418
disclose this matter to others.

645
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,218
However, if you

646
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:09,218
have been obstructing

647
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:10,739
our marriage

648
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,499
because of this,

649
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:14,618
then can you

650
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:15,458
be reassured now?

651
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:18,299
Fine.

652
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:20,938
Whether you know or not,

653
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:22,618
I'll choose to believe

654
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,218
that you're willing

655
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:26,779
to guard this secret for her

656
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,259
and protect her forever.

657
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,218
Though you're from Liuguang Sect,

658
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,299
your sincere devotion to her

659
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,378
is evident.

660
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,138
In this world,

661
00:28:36,218 --> 00:28:37,938
aside from Tan Feng and me,

662
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:39,059
having another person

663
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:40,819
who cares for Kong Hou this deeply

664
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,618
gives me peace of mind.

665
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:43,698
So,

666
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,418
you agreed?

667
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,218
What do you think?

668
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:49,779
Master,

669
00:28:50,178 --> 00:28:51,059
you agreed?

670
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:52,138
What do you think?

671
00:28:58,218 --> 00:28:59,499
You reckless girl.

672
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,059
I knew you were faking illness.

673
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:02,979
That no longer matters.

674
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:04,019
Master,

675
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,618
I just heard

676
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:06,819
you've approved

677
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,579
my marriage with Zhong Xi.

678
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:09,658
Is this true?

679
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:11,339
I'm only consenting

680
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:13,339
due to his genuine sincerity.

681
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,299
Wonderful! Zhong Xi,

682
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:16,979
we can finally get married!

683
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:17,739
However,

684
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:19,938
don't celebrate too soon.

685
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,019
To marry her,

686
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,858
you must agree to my condition.

687
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,618
You must join Yunhua Sect
as an inducted member

688
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,779
to properly care for her.

689
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,019
Master.

690
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:30,599
Alright.

691
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:33,019
I accept.

692
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,019
Okay.

693
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,339
In that case,

694
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,059
when you come to Yunhua Sect,

695
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:41,499
I will surely

696
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,339
protect you for all our days.

697
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,218
Trust me.

698
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:24,099
Kong Hou,

699
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,458
I simply don't understand.

700
00:30:25,739 --> 00:30:27,059
He's already proposed to you.

701
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,299
Why make these decorations?

702
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,618
Men shouldn't be spoiled like this.

703
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:31,979
They'll become arrogant,

704
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:32,819
acting recklessly.

705
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:33,858
Ling Hui,

706
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:34,979
you don't know

707
00:30:35,138 --> 00:30:37,019
how moved I was

708
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,259
when Zhong Xi proposed.

709
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:40,259
Moreover,

710
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:41,418
he endured

711
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,339
Master's endless difficulties
for my sake,

712
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,019
and did so many things

713
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,739
he would never do before.

714
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:48,418
This time,

715
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:50,658
I just want him to experience

716
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,259
the same joy I felt when he proposed.

717
00:30:54,739 --> 00:30:55,339
Of course,

718
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:56,539
most importantly,

719
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,378
a woman shouldn't lose face.

720
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:08,858
Kong Hou,

721
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,099
where are you taking me?

722
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:13,059
Someplace wonderful.

723
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:13,819
What?

724
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:14,858
Don't you trust me?

725
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:15,938
I do.

726
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,418
I'd follow you anywhere.

727
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,698
That's better.

728
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:24,618
We're here.

729
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:26,259
This is the place.

730
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:42,499
What's all this about?

731
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:46,299
Do you remember

732
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:47,458
I told you before

733
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,898
that I spent ages discussing
with Ling Hui

734
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,218
about properly proposing to you?

735
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,779
I never expected you'd beat me to it.

736
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,299
So you couldn't stand being outdone,

737
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,618
and are staging a comeback?

738
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,458
You always understand me best.

739
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:03,979
No!

740
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:05,938
I didn't think that way.

741
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,658
I just...

742
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:09,938
You just want to surprise me?

743
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,099
You saw right through me again.

744
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:18,099
Zhong Xi,

745
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,099
I just want you to know

746
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:21,658
you're someone

747
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:23,539
extraordinarily important to me.

748
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,458
I want to marry you.

749
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:30,979
Will you marry me?

750
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,059
Yes.

751
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:46,218
A hundred times yes.

752
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:48,579
A thousand times yes.

753
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:53,739

00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:10,658
Kong Hou,

773
00:34:10,778 --> 00:34:11,818
choose your favorites.

774
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:21,818
Is it good?

775
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:27,499
(Oh, my.)

776
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:31,298
(This must be my tenth meal today.)

777
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:33,778
Eat more.

778
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:36,979
Here you are.

779
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,338
Master Pei Huai.

780
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:39,059
Zhong Xi.

781
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,059
Master Pei Huai,

782
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:43,419
impressive appetites.

783
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,019
Yunhua Sect's kitchens

784
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:50,379
are renowned throughout Lingyou Realm.

785
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:52,419
Every dish here

786
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,899
is a culinary masterpiece.

787
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,218
Perhaps we should
continue tasting tomorrow?

788
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,218
Out of the question.

789
00:34:58,419 --> 00:34:59,338
The bonding ceremony

790
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:00,899
comes but once in a lifetime.

791
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:01,859
No slipping allowed.

792
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:03,338
Our banquet must

793
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:04,738
reflect our utmost refinement.

794
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,499
Don't you agree, Kong Hou?

795
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,218
However...

796
00:35:11,658 --> 00:35:12,379
Here's the thing.

797
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:15,138
I am new to Yunhua Sect,

798
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:17,019
unfamiliar with these grounds.

799
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:18,338
Tomorrow, I want

800
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:19,218
to have Kong Hou

801
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,138
show me around

802
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,419
and learn the layout,

803
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:23,899
so I won't get lost.

804
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:25,338
If one day, I need

805
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:26,979
to clean Master Pei Huai's quarter

806
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:27,738
but can't

807
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:28,859
find it,

808
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,059
isn't that embarrassing?

809
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:33,979
Okay.

810
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:34,618
Very well.

811
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,099
I particularly like

812
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,939
such an eloquent young man.

813
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:39,019
Kong Hou,

814
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,059
let's

815
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:41,099
end it here today.

816
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:42,939
I should return

817
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,059
to feed my cat.

818
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:54,658
What's wrong?

819
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,379
Did you overeat and feel full?

820
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:58,379
A bit full indeed.

821
00:35:59,178 --> 00:36:00,379
But I never expected

822
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,338
you would

823
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:03,178
flatter Master Pei Huai.

824
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:04,818
I thought

825
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:06,618
you only behaved this way with me.

826
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,419
To be honest, I'm just anxious.

827
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:17,459
I saw you worked so hard.

828
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:20,459
It seems someone like me

829
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,379
is truly ill-timed.

830
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:24,738
It's okay.

831
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,258
I was just teasing you.

832
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:27,899
It's fine. I'm not angry.

833
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:29,218
I was teasing you too.

834
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:31,099
Well, you...

835
00:36:32,138 --> 00:36:32,979
I mean it.

836
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:34,499
We can finally marry.

837
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:38,818
We're getting married.

838
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:53,258
Return to your quarters.

839
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:54,698
- Yes.
- Yes.

840
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:06,539
Lady Ling Bo.

841
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:08,979
What a coincidence meeting you here.

842
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:11,019
What a coincidence.

843
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:14,218
Why did you bring

844
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:15,338
your junior disciples along?

845
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,019
Where's your master?

846
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:19,658
My Master

847
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:21,539
should arrive with yours

848
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,379
on the wedding day.

849
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:26,459
He instructed me

850
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:27,979
to deliver gifts first,

851
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:28,818
and then

852
00:37:28,818 --> 00:37:29,859
have my juniors

853
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:30,539
return to rest.

854
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,178
We'll also check

855
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,618
if any assistance is needed.

856
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:37,979
(Why is he still wearing)

857
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:39,298
(this jade pendant?)

858
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:44,499
Proceed upstairs first.

859
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:46,499
We have matters to discuss.

860
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:47,818
- Yes.
- Yes.

861
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:57,024
(Yunhua Sect)

862
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,178
Return this jade pendant

863
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,099
to me.

864
00:38:09,658 --> 00:38:10,218
Why?

865
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:12,059
You've worn this constantly.

866
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:13,658
It's bad for both of us.

867
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:15,499
No one else knows

868
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:16,738
you gave this

869
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:17,419
to me.

870
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:18,218
It's fine.

871
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:19,618
After years of silence,

872
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,459
why keep wearing it?

873
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:22,899
Because this is

874
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:25,178
the first pendant you ever gave me.

875
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:26,698
Let me speak plainly.

876
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:28,298
In the past,

877
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:28,899
many people

878
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,298
misunderstood our relationship.

879
00:38:30,738 --> 00:38:31,738
After all these years,

880
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,298
I don't want gossip to spread

881
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:34,499
because of this.

882
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:41,218
If you don't want me wearing it,

883
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:44,059
I'll give it back.

884
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,899
(Why does she look so irritated?)

885
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,859
(Is meeting me)

886
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:10,099
(what upset her?)

887
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:15,738
Well...

888
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:16,818
Lady Ling Bo.

889
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:18,459
What a rare visitor.

890
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:19,939
We've waited ages for you.

891
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:25,499
O-On this joyous occasion,

892
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,818
why the long face?

893
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:27,979
Something troubling you?

894
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:29,658
Why are you so nosy?

895
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:31,218
Besides,

896
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,019
it is their wedding.

897
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,218
Why are you here?

898
00:39:33,258 --> 00:39:34,019
I'm here waiting

899
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,138
for Xiao Dong.

900
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:37,178
I await Xiao Dong here.

901
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:37,738
Xiao Dong,

902
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:39,059
what took you so long?

903
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:40,459
All disciples have entered.

904
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:41,178
Waited for me?

905
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:43,218
You didn't say it

906
00:39:43,218 --> 00:39:44,019
in your message.

907
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,778
Do I need to message you for that?

908
00:39:45,778 --> 00:39:46,859
We're from the same sect.

909
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:47,778
Well...

910
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:48,738
The disciples said

911
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:49,459
you two

912
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:51,539
were discussing at the mountain's base?

913
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:54,178
About what?

914
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,019
N-Nothing.

915
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:57,138
It's just

916
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,138
about the Cultivation Assembly
Zhaohan Sect

917
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:01,778
and Liuguang Sect
will co-host next year.

918
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,658
- The Cultivation Assembly?
- You continue your discussion.

919
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:04,899
I'll take my leave.

920
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:06,899
Ling Bo?

921
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:08,658
Lady Ling Bo,

922
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,539
we've prepared a room for you.

923
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:11,979
You'll find it satisfactory.

924
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,658
Alright.

925
00:40:15,698 --> 00:40:16,499
Let's go inside.

926
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:17,298
Xiao Dong.

927
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:18,379
Ling Bo

928
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,979
seemed rather perturbed today.

929
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:20,979
Did she snap at you

930
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:21,579
when you talked

931
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:22,298
down there?

932
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:28,818
What's wrong

933
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:29,979
with everyone?

934
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:40,099
(Ten years ago)
I heard you've been close

935
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,939
to Xiao Dong from Liuguang Sect?

936
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:44,178
Yes.

937
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:46,258
But recently,

938
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:48,019
he hasn't talked to me much.

939
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,019
He probably got close to you at first,

940
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,459
saw you showed no response

941
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,499
and treated him like just a friend,

942
00:40:55,658 --> 00:40:57,059
and then decided

943
00:40:57,298 --> 00:40:58,258
to ignore you.

944
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:01,459
What should I do then?

945
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:03,419
Let matters take their course.

946
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,499
Since he's made his decision,

947
00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:07,059
we should respect it.

948
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:08,859
If you attempt to contact him now,

949
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:10,539
it might renew misunderstandings.

950
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:12,738
Then I send him

951
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:13,818
a final messenger talisman

952
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:14,738
to explain everything.

953
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:15,459
Alright.

954
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:17,859
I thought

955
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,059
you'd fell for someone,

956
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:20,579
but now it appears

957
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:21,899
your destined connection

958
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:24,459
lies with another entirely.

959
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,258
