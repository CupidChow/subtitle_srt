16
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:42,912
Why's she

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,797
walking so oddly?

18
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:44,998
Looks like a dark cultivator.

19
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:45,758
Let's see.

20
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:52,957
Ma'am, are you alright?

21
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,157
Stay away from me.

22
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:57,088
I might lose control,

23
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:58,918
drain your spiritual energy,

24
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,037
and hurt you both.

25
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:00,957
Leave now.

26
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:04,558
I heard if they

27
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,677
don't drain energy in time,

28
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,037
dark cultivators will die.

29
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:25,024
How are you?

30
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,648
I didn't ask you to save me.

31
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,920
Why let me absorb energy?

32
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,640
Why won't you let me die?

33
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:39,117
We couldn't just let you die.

34
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,717
Exactly.

35
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,038
You saved me once,

36
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:45,638
but can you save me a second time?

37
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,717
Eventually,

38
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,440
I'll lose control

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,758
anyway.

40
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:52,277
Well...

41
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:57,517
I've restrained myself all my life,

42
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,677
only to end up being seen

43
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:02,117
as an energy-draining monster.

44
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:03,198
Ma'am,

45
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,158
let future troubles wait.

46
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,117
Just focus on living well now.

47
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,104
My husband,

48
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,848
son, and daughter-in-law

49
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:17,758
all took their own lives

50
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:20,957
when they couldn't bear it anymore,

51
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:22,957
leaving me alone

52
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,640
to live like this.

53
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,776
What's the point?

54
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,358
Ma'am,

55
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,397
is that

56
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:35,797
your home over there?

57
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:43,104
Sit.

58
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:44,438
Sit.

59
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:45,957
Sit.

60
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:56,544
We'll do it.

61
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:58,592
Young ones,

62
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,592
you meant well,

63
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:05,237
but why save me?

64
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,277
When will

65
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:09,878
this torment end?

66
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:11,918
It's not fair.

67
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,038
When we were cursed long ago,

68
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,358
our weakened clan members

69
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:18,037
could recover at Mount Yueluo.

70
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:19,717
But the Ten Great Sects

71
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:20,678
drove us out

72
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,118
of our homeland.

73
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,638
We fled here as refugees.

74
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,496
Kong Hou, why are you here?

75
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:43,878
Jiusu,

76
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:45,238
I came to discuss

77
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:46,798
dual cultivation.

78
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:48,477
Kong Hou,

79
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:50,277
why the sudden change of heart?

80
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:52,597
I'm the Yueluo Clan's Sovereign.

81
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:54,798
You schemed tirelessly

82
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,277
to break my seal

83
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:57,517
and bring me back.

84
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,837
Aren't you seeking to revive our clan

85
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,277
together with me?

86
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:04,477
Or do you have ulterior motives?

87
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:05,798
Of course not.

88
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:06,917
My ambitions

89
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,517
need no concealment.

90
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:10,118
But you've always

91
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:11,318
befriended those sects

92
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:12,717
while distrusting

93
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,798
our own kind.

94
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:14,957
I never imagined

95
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,517
you'd change so quickly.

96
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:18,477
Jiusu, rest assured.

97
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:20,357
Now that I'm here,

98
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,078
I know full well

99
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,198
what my position demands.

100
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,344
But your recent actions

101
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:26,678
don't convince me

102
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:27,517
of your commitment

103
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:28,640
to cultivate with me.

104
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,678
If that's your belief,

105
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,037
why speak of

106
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:33,438
sibling unity?

107
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,392
It's just empty platitudes.

108
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:36,837
Your behavior

109
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,397
is unconvincing.

110
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:39,998
Earlier in the hall,

111
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:40,837
without knowing

112
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,558
my plan to revive the Yueluo Clan,

113
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:43,638
you vehemently opposed

114
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:44,917
Wu Bei's strategy.

115
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,037
In my opinion,

116
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,957
it's definitely not
a matter of poor timing.

117
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:50,397
What Wu Bei and the others
intended to do

118
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,078
was merely vengeance-driven.

119
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:53,798
Why risk casualties

120
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,238
over such trivial motivations?

121
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,517
Launching an offensive now would only

122
00:05:57,597 --> 00:05:59,072
result in needless bloodshed.

123
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:01,318
As Sovereign of the Yueluo Clan,

124
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:02,517
their safety

125
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,238
remains my responsibility.

126
00:06:04,357 --> 00:06:05,758
Our feud with righteous sects

127
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:06,878
has festered for long

128
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,597
with mountains of blood debt.

129
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:11,238
Attacking now

130
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,878
would only pile more corpses.

131
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,318
By restraining Wu Bei's party

132
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:15,157
from revenging,

133
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:17,118
can we maintain fragile peace?

134
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,758
Even if we don't strike first,

135
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,238
once they regroup,

136
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,597
they'll still attack us.

137
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:22,957
Other sects

138
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:24,318
would avoid involvement entirely.

139
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,728
Why would they join forces

140
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:27,037
for a combined assault?

141
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:29,318
Master Zhong Xi from Liuguang Sect

142
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:31,328
has been desperately pursuing you.

143
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,118
He wants to bring you back.

144
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:35,477
His weakness

145
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,357
lies in emotional attachments.

146
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,717
He's not worth fearing.

147
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:39,758
Moreover,

148
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:40,517
haven't we

149
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,717
captured him already?

150
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:43,477
What?

151
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,198
Are you afraid of him?

152
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,238
Certainly not.

153
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,318
But keeping him alive

154
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:49,760
in the name of absorbing energy

155
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,157
and refusing to raid
righteous sects for captives...

156
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,477
Your Eminence,

157
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:54,638
do you think

158
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,638
I'm that naive?

159
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:56,992
These excuses

160
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:58,438
can't buy me off.

161
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,397
Then it complicates matters.

162
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:03,917
Your distrust

163
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:05,397
and wariness

164
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,517
make your request

165
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:08,638
of joint cultivation

166
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,198
a profound contradiction.

167
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,517
Jiusu,

168
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,597
if you do think so,

169
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:14,477
I truly can't help it.

170
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:15,917
Besides,

171
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,717
trust requires

172
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,277
one party

173
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,037
to take the first step.

174
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:24,357
Very well.

175
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,078
About the manuals I gifted you,

176
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,277
should we start

177
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,678
practicing them

178
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:29,917
jointly now?

179
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,638
Your Eminence,
the manuals you requested.

180
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,397
You may leave.

181
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:38,678
Yes.

182
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,397
(The Ten Great Sects
and the Yueluo Clan)

183
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,438
(have feuds, old and new.)

184
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,517
(I must find resolution.)

185
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:02,078
Never imagined

186
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:03,678
Jiusu would practice

187
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:04,717
such methods.

188
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:06,878
These aren't cultivation techniques

189
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,037
but life-consuming

190
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:10,118
dark arts.

191
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:11,517
Jiusu

192
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:12,917
sacrifices all morality

193
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:14,118
for power.

194
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,238
Should you cultivate with him,

195
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,118
stay vigilant.

196
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:20,037
Okay.

197
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:21,837
I'll be cautious.

198
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:23,318
Zhong Xi,

199
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,318
any other observations?

200
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,238
These scrolls contain

201
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,837
bloody, unorthodox methods

202
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,198
but ultimately

203
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,158
are just cultivation shortcuts.

204
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:37,798
No substantial evidence here.

205
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,117
Why are you here?

206
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:03,637
Since you're studying,

207
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,837
I'm overjoyed.

208
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,038
Spare the pleasantries.

209
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,398
Before coming,

210
00:09:08,597 --> 00:09:09,997
I did suspect.

211
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:10,912
But seeing you

212
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,384
genuinely studying these

213
00:09:12,877 --> 00:09:13,997
makes me feel

214
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,518
my previous silent dissent

215
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,757
was utterly laughable.

216
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,477
The manuals are obscure and voluminous.

217
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,957
Take your time.

218
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:21,398
Don't read further for now.

219
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:23,424
I've prepared you a surprise.

220
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,798
Why show me this?

221
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:35,637
Have you forgotten?

222
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:37,877
When we were little,

223
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,078
we wandered destitute
through the streets.

224
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:41,984
Back then, what you desired most

225
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:44,096
was exactly this.

226
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:45,318
And this?

227
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:46,597
Three copper coins.

228
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:48,117
If you've brought money,

229
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:49,158
then come buy it.

230
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,158
What's that?

231
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,357
That's a pinwheel.

232
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,597
It looks so beautiful.

233
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,438
Wait here for me.

234
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,278
Do you have money?

235
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:58,837
If you have money, you can have it.

236
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:00,318
Just three coins to buy it.

237
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,117
Stop it.

238
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,717
Whose brat is this?

239
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:03,678
Stealing in public!

240
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,117
Rascal with no proper upbringing.

241
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,078
I'll beat you every time I see you.

242
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:12,798
Stop it!

243
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,488
Put those down! No stealing! Stop!

244
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:16,576
Drop those!

245
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:19,392
Brother.

246
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:23,997
Don't cry.

247
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,158
I'm not crying.

248
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:26,837
I'm just angry at my own weakness.

249
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:28,117
You're the best brother

250
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,558
in the whole world.

251
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:36,597
I'll fix it.

252
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,078
Brother.

253
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,198
Have you truly forgotten it, Kong Hou?

254
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:01,837
Kong Hou.

255
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,597
Why?

256
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,798
Leave now.

257
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,678
I need time alone.

258
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:11,558
Understood.

259
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,168
My earlier reminiscence

260
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:17,184
made me act impulsively.

261
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,040
Rest well, Your Eminence.

262
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:20,597
I'll take my leave now.

263
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,728
Do you believe what he said?

264
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,798
I don't.

265
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:41,357
I know

266
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:43,438
the Yueluo Clan was indeed

267
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,477
being hunted back then.

268
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:51,837
About the Yueluo Clan matter,

269
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:54,038
the Ten Great Sects had to intervene.

270
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:55,957
I know

271
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,038
your heart is conflicted,

272
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:01,957
especially now that you've learned...

273
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:03,518
I know.

274
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:06,997
The Yueluo Clan committed

275
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,398
numerous unforgivable atrocities.

276
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,117
Jiusu

277
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,957
merely seeks to exploit me
for further evil.

278
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:14,518
No matter his honeyed words,

279
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:16,837
I'll never trust him.

280
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:19,558
Kong Hou,

281
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:24,038
feuds formed can also be resolved.

282
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,198
Such is the way of the world.

283
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,078
When channeling energy earlier,

284
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,117
why did you delay your rhythm?

285
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:13,438
I've never been talented
in cultivation since childhood.

286
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:14,837
Before the Foundation stage,

287
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,997
I couldn't even
absorb spiritual energy properly.

288
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,198
My control over energy flow

289
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:20,318
falls short of yours,

290
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:22,158
which you've cultivated since childhood.

291
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,877
Jiusu, are you alright?

292
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:27,237
I'm fine.

293
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,038
My energy flow was temporarily disrupted

294
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,757
but is stabilized now.

295
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,837
To regain control so swiftly

296
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:33,997
over such turbulence

297
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,757
is truly remarkable.

298
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:37,518
Any secret technique?

299
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:40,957
When regulating your energy flow,

300
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,757
you must
synchronize precisely with mine.

301
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,918
Without the Dark Cloud Tablet's help,

302
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,837
the consequences would've been dire.

303
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,518
I didn't expect you
to have such a divine artifact.

304
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,398
This puts my mind at ease.

305
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,757
I'll diligently study those manuals.

306
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,757
Mastery isn't achieved overnight.

307
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,798
Let's conclude today's practice here.

308
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,318
Dark Cloud Tablet?

309
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,438
Are you sure?

310
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:18,918
While cultivating together,

311
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:20,757
I attempted to disrupt his energy flow,

312
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,357
but unexpectedly

313
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,997
an anomalous power intervened.

314
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,597
It suppressed the divergence

315
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,717
of his energy flow.

316
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,357
He wasn't affected in the end.

317
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:30,597
I know Dark Cloud Tablet

318
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:31,357
is a spiritual tool

319
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,637
that aids cultivation greatly.

320
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:34,278
But I never expected

321
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,357
it to be in Jiusu's possession.

322
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:38,957
The Dark Cloud Tablet's benefits

323
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:40,957
for cultivators are truly immense.

324
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,357
My master once said

325
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:44,518
this Dark Cloud Tablet

326
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,477
offers tremendous assistance
to cultivators.

327
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,438
Moreover, it contains

328
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,798
various rare treasures

329
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:50,997
that enhance spiritual energy.

330
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,357
Then among them,

331
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,024
is there

332
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,318
the final ingredient you need,

333
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:54,997
Dragonblood Herb?

334
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,078
Possibly.

335
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:57,918
Since Jiusu values it so highly,

336
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:58,997
he must've kept it well.

337
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,117
In that case,

338
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:01,918
we must obtain it at all costs.

339
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:02,624
No.

340
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:03,918
It's too risky.

341
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,536
He held the Dark Cloud Tablet

342
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:06,757
while cultivating with you.

343
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,837
It means he still distrusts you

344
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:09,918
and guards against you.

345
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,117
Though he won't confront you openly now,

346
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:13,597
his actions

347
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:15,278
are merely to deceive you.

348
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:17,318
Don't worry,

349
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,038
I won't be deceived by him.

350
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,278
But I'm considering

351
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,198
that a spiritual tool
like Dark Cloud Tablet

352
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,558
must possess awareness.

353
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:28,798
Since it lent Jiusu

354
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,038
such tremendous power,

355
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,877
this borrowed power
must eventually be repaid.

356
00:15:34,357 --> 00:15:35,757
Therefore, I deduce

357
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:36,918
that Jiusu won't

358
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,798
keep the Dark Cloud Tablet
on him all along.

359
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,597
Moreover,

360
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,357
this borrowed power

361
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:43,518
isn't something

362
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:44,757
he can simply repay at will.

363
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,237
Exactly.

364
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,757
I believe Jiusu

365
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,438
must have stored the Dark Cloud Tablet

366
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:51,318
in a location

367
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,237
abundant with natural spiritual energy

368
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,357
for future use.

369
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,158
Through my recent observations,

370
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:01,757
there's one place

371
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:03,117
that fits perfectly.

372
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,117
It stinks.

373
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,518
I don't want this pillow anymore.

374
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:16,837
It's not that bad.

375
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,278
Were you worried

376
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:24,997
I'd sleep uncomfortably on the floor

377
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:26,278
and threw it to me on purpose?

378
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:29,997
You're overthinking.

379
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,518
Well,

380
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,318
Ling Bo.

381
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,637
Do you...

382
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,080
do you like me?

383
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:50,198
Nonsense.

384
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,318
I think it's you who likes me.

385
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:53,117
I...

386
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,558
If you don't like me,

387
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:56,480
why let me

388
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,056
sleep on

389
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:57,997
your shoulder earlier?

390
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,558
If you don't like me,

391
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:01,088
why give me the pillow

392
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:01,798
when I was

393
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:02,877
sleeping on the floor?

394
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:03,558
You wanted

395
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,238
my comfort.

396
00:17:04,238 --> 00:17:05,318
If you don't like me,

397
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,720
why didn't you say no,

398
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,448
when the old lady
asked if we were a couple?

399
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:10,357
Why are men

400
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,837
always so self-assured?

401
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:15,958
I...

402
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,480
Do you like me or not?

403
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,518
Sleep now.

404
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:28,038
Wait.

405
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,456
You haven't answered. How can you sleep?

406
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:33,958
Alright, sleep.

407
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,238
Behind this wall

408
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:16,637
must be Jiusu's secret chamber.

409
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:19,437
There must be a mechanism somewhere.

410
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:20,278
Let's search.

411
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:46,798
This is the place.

412
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,637
Split up and search.

413
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,712
(Rong Ji)

414
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:05,917
Phoenix Essence?

415
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,837
Today I studied the Dark Cloud Tablet

416
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:09,664
and gained insights.

417
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,318
By following your method

418
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,256
in later cultivation,

419
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:14,837
we can ascend alongside Her Eminence.

420
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,238
Then black rain will pour,

421
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,597
withering all living things

422
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:19,117
and destroying the Lingyou Realm.

423
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,877
All those righteous sects

424
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:22,144
shall face eternal damnation.

425
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,216
Our clan has lost our homeland.

426
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,518
How dare they still shamelessly

427
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:28,576
live in peace?

428
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,998
Our clan's fate, our vengeance,
and our future

429
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,318
all rest upon you, my lord.

430
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:34,976
We are but rootless drifters,

431
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:36,704
sworn to follow you unto death.

432
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:38,518
We only hope

433
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:39,437
to soon witness

434
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:40,357
our clan reclaiming

435
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:41,600
our place in Lingyou Realm

436
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:44,256
and restoring our former glory.

437
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:51,677
It's late.

438
00:19:51,718 --> 00:19:53,792
What brings you here, Your Eminence?

439
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,597
I was studying this manual in my chamber

440
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:58,677
but found some parts incomprehensible.

441
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:00,718
I came to seek your guidance.

442
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,238
Unexpectedly, you were absent,

443
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,397
so I looked around.

444
00:20:05,677 --> 00:20:07,117
Your dedication

445
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:08,278
is admirable.

446
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:09,397
However,

447
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:10,798
it's already deep night.

448
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,518
There's no need to rush tonight.

449
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:14,117
Go back and rest early.

450
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,597
Very well. You should rest too.

451
00:20:28,238 --> 00:20:29,197
My lord,

452
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,848
do you truly believe Her Eminence

453
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:32,758
came here for the manual?

454
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:33,837
Do you buy that?

455
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,998
Her Eminence's every word and action

456
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:36,758
affects

457
00:20:36,758 --> 00:20:38,278
the Yueluo Clan's future.

458
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:41,718
I implore you not to be deceived

459
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:43,437
and stay vigilant.

460
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,637
That was close.

461
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,157
We nearly got exposed.

462
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,278
Jiusu is inherently suspicious.

463
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,478
He must've

464
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:13,917
sensed something just now.

465
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:16,478
But he still needs you now,

466
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,112
so he won't confront you

467
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:18,917
over trivial things.

468
00:21:20,357 --> 00:21:21,278
True.

469
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,478
But did you catch

470
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:24,518
Wu Bei's words earlier?

471
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:26,278
He said

472
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,958
Jiusu's cultivation with me

473
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,637
aims for ascension alongside me.

474
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,597
And then black rain will pour,

475
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:32,798
withering all the living

476
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,677
and destroying the Lingyou Realm.

477
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,238
Though he's your brother,

478
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,597
your paths diverge.

479
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:39,437
His vile deeds

480
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:40,758
don't merit your grief.

481
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:41,758
I know.

482
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:43,837
I don't trust him.

483
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:44,958
His talk of

484
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,318
revitalizing our clan

485
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:47,718
is mere deception

486
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:49,117
to make me cultivate with him.

487
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:52,157
Kong Hou,

488
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,357
please come away with me.

489
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:55,637
Let's leave this place.

490
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,518
The Liuguang Sect, Yunhua Sect,

491
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:58,432
and others

492
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,038
will help us find a way.

493
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,597
We'll face it together.

494
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,397
I won't leave.

495
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,078
Just now,

496
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:09,798
in Jiusu's secret chamber,

497
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,038
I found a scroll

498
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:13,718
(Rong Ji)
left by my father, Rong Ji,

499
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:15,038
the previous Dark Sovereign.

500
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:16,758
It says

501
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:19,758
that ascension in this realm

502
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,917
requires the one bearing Phoenix Essence

503
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:23,197
to breach the sky

504
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,318
with their power.

505
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:26,518
Only then

506
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:28,998
can cultivators here achieve ascension.

507
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,038
And his daughter is fortunate

508
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,758
to carry Phoenix Essence,

509
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,038
destined with the chance.

510
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,758
Phoenix Essence?

511
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,278
You?

512
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:40,478
Yes.

513
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:43,478
If I only possessed
Five Spiritual Roots,

514
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,637
Jiusu

515
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,478
might find a replacement for me.

516
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:47,478
But as long

517
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:48,832
as the Phoenix Essence

518
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,958
remains within me,

519
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,038
he'll definitely come for me.

520
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:53,437
My sect has borne

521
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:54,798
too much pressure for my sake.

522
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:56,558
I can't...

523
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:02,357
I understand.

524
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:04,958
Stay if you must.

525
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:06,837
I'll keep you company here.

526
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,357
We'll find a way together.

527
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,157
By the way,

528
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:13,238
we've been studying
ancient texts lately,

529
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,157
but they're too cryptic.

530
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,877
Should we consult

531
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,278
someone specializing in this field

532
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:19,758
to seek their guidance?

533
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:22,877
You

534
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:24,157
aren't making me

535
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:25,998
seek that eccentric old man again,
are you?

536
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:28,837
That's exactly my thought.

537
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,078
Think about it.

538
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:31,958
He's read countless ancient texts

539
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,597
and specializes in this domain.

540
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,357
Perhaps

541
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:37,758
he's encountered a solution

542
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:39,677
in some volume he's studied.

543
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:40,837
Enough.

544
00:23:41,238 --> 00:23:42,597
Drop that idea.

545
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,616
I'm not leaving.

546
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,536
I know you're worried,

547
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:47,078
but you said yourself

548
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:48,518
Jiusu currently

549
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:49,877
won't harm me.

550
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:52,397
Besides, other than you,

551
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,798
who else could go?

552
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:58,597
Fine.

553
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:00,518
I'll agree then.

554
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:01,917
No time to waste.

555
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,238
Depart immediately.

556
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,864
Look at you two.

557
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,837
- Why are you sleeping on the floor?
- Ling Bo, get up.

558
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:26,877
Newlyweds indeed,

559
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:28,800
can't even sleep properly.

560
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't catch a cold.

561
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:32,238
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:24:32,357 --> 00:24:34,038
I've been restless lately,

563
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,197
ending up on the floor.

564
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:37,357
At my age,

565
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:38,837
I understand these things.

566
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:39,637
Of course.

567
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:40,798
Ma'am, thank you

568
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:41,837
for sheltering us

569
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:42,432
last night.

570
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:42,998
Well,

571
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:44,117
we'll be leaving soon.

572
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:45,472
Go, then.

573
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:47,264
Staying brings risks.

574
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:49,197
Inspectors patrol

575
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,558
the village regularly.

576
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:52,238
Outsiders caught here

577
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:53,397
will get arrested.

578
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:54,197
Understood.

579
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:56,352
Thank you.

580
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,272
- Didn't you sleep on the bed?
- Enough.

581
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:07,917
Let's go.

582
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:09,197
Don't you want to find

583
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:10,078
your young master?

584
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:11,798
About yesterday's question...

585
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:12,958
Stop talking, or I'll...

586
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,518
Alright, I won't ask.

587
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:15,798
Or you'll pluck my fox tail.

588
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:16,478
I know.

589
00:25:17,637 --> 00:25:18,437
Here.

590
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:30,078
After scouting around,

591
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:32,117
this dark cultivator village

592
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,637
seems no different

593
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,637
from regular villages.

594
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,478
And these dark cultivators

595
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:37,437
don't appear evil.

596
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,117
Exactly.

597
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,040
And that old lady

598
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,798
said yesterday

599
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:40,837
they'd rather endure pain

600
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,597
than absorb others' spiritual energy.

601
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:45,518
Though they're dark cultivators,

602
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:46,758
they've committed no crimes.

603
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:48,238
So they're not villains.

604
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:49,718
Outrageous.

605
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:51,637
It's mere prejudice and discrimination.

606
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,958
We demon cultivators suffer too.

607
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,837
People always assume we're evil.

608
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:56,064
Not me though.

609
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,336
You haven't?

610
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,877
You haven't?

611
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,637
I still remember your glare

612
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:04,278
when you learned

613
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:05,157
I was one.

614
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,798
It was not because of your identity.

615
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,288
So it was because of me.

616
00:26:08,597 --> 00:26:10,278
You were utterly annoying back then.

617
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:10,976
Are you saying

618
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:11,968
I'm not annoying now?

619
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,837
- Still annoying.
- Bad news!

620
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:16,157
What's happening? Why the panic?

621
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,357
Many villagers have died.

622
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:18,944
Someone... someone's hunting us.

623
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:19,872
Alert everyone.

624
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:25,558
Did the Ten Great Sects

625
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:26,357
find this place

626
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:27,264
and plan to kill them?

627
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:29,278
Let's get them

628
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:30,208
to a safe place first.

629
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:31,437
Agreed.

630
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,440
Your Eminence!

631
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,677
Your Eminence, something happened.

632
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:37,357
What's wrong?

633
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,318
The righteous sects

634
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:39,078
somehow discovered

635
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:39,648
our location.

636
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:40,800
They're in the village now.

637
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:42,528
Go check immediately.

638
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,157
No. No.

639
00:26:58,357 --> 00:26:59,904
I thought you descended the mountain.

640
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,238
I noticed disturbances

641
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:02,197
and rushed back.

642
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:03,798
Luckily, I made it in time.

643
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:08,677
Master Zhong Xi,

644
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,437
as the master of Luanfeng Peak,
why shelter dark cultivators?

645
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:12,448
What's your intention?

646
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,558
I said

647
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,640
I need no one's protection.

648
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:22,558
As a dark cultivator,

649
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:24,558
I stand opposed

650
00:27:24,718 --> 00:27:26,117
to the righteous sects.

651
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,478
As for you,

652
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,357
my affection for you died long ago.

653
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,437
I implore you, Master Zhong Xi,

654
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:33,798
to abandon the obsession.

655
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:36,637
Should the world's fate

656
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:38,238
or a mere man

657
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,958
truly be beyond my discernment?

658
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,318
I merely performed

659
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:43,677
wedding rites with you.

660
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,278
Now that I am the Sovereign,

661
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,958
what couldn't I obtain?

662
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:53,998
This is a token of love

663
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:55,958
from you, Master Zhong Xi.

664
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:57,117
Today,

665
00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:58,917
before all witnesses,

666
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:02,176
I sever ties with you completely.

667
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:04,917
No further bonds shall remain.

668
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,318
Within this

669
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,518
lies spiritual energy

670
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:10,278
forged from Master Zhong Xi's soul.

671
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,157
Now I return it,

672
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,437
letting that power

673
00:28:14,758 --> 00:28:16,637
dissipate into nothingness.

674
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,558
Hear me, you fools.

675
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,238
Previously, I merely used him.

676
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:39,677
Now

677
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:41,958
he's outlived his usefulness.

678
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,318
All of you, scram now!

679
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,798
It seems Her Eminence

680
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:49,998
has finally made

681
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:51,278
the wise choice.

682
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:54,558
Congratulations, my lord.

683
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:21,798
Fear not, everyone.

684
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:22,998
It's Ling Bo.

685
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:26,016
- She's back.
- Careful.

686
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:28,437
Are you alright?

687
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:29,197
I'm fine.

688
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,718
And them? Did they retreat?

689
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:31,677
All retreated.

690
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:32,397
Good then.

691
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:34,677
You're safe now. Rest assured.

692
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:37,248
Thank you, our savior.

693
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:38,432
- No need.
- Please rise.

694
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:39,718
No formalities required.

695
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:40,758
- Rest now.
- Thank you.

696
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:41,888
We're safe now.

697
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:42,592
Thank you.

698
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:43,917
Go rest over there.

699
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:45,318
Thank you.

700
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:45,958
Careful.

701
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,078
Thank you.

702
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:49,157
Kind souls.

703
00:29:54,078 --> 00:29:54,677
What now?

704
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,117
What's our next move?

705
00:29:59,197 --> 00:29:59,998
No haven exists

706
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:00,798
beyond here.

707
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:02,478
Leaving means certain death.

708
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:07,877
I don't have

709
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:08,798
any plans yet.

710
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:09,397
Let them

711
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:10,238
rest here for now.

712
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:11,318
For now?

713
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,117
This isn't a permanent solution.

714
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:13,718
What do we do

715
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,758
afterward?

716
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:15,518
Afterward...

717
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:17,568
I haven't figured that out yet.

718
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:19,318
I refuse to believe

719
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,192
that his vast world

720
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:20,768
holds no place

721
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:21,837
for them to exist safely.

722
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,264
Enough. Stop fuming.

723
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:24,958
If you collapse,

724
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,038
how will you protect them?

725
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:27,437
Here's an idea.

726
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:28,798
Let's scout ahead

727
00:30:28,877 --> 00:30:30,112
for alternative routes.

728
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,437
Let's go.

729
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:35,917
Your Eminence, I heard reports

730
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,397
the village is in a dire situation.

731
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:40,558
Is everyone alright?

732
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,197
When I arrived,

733
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:44,278
it was already too late.

734
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:51,078
Xiao Pei.

735
00:30:52,637 --> 00:30:55,072
Are they all truly gone?

736
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:57,078
Yes. But you mustn't lose hope.

737
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,958
No matter what,

738
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:01,117
I'll find a way.

739
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:03,998
My brother's gone.

740
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,518
Everyone else is gone too.

741
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:10,437
What am I to do now?

742
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:11,357
If you wish

743
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,238
to leave this place,

744
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,318
I'll arrange

745
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:17,318
a safe haven

746
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:18,558
for you.

747
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:19,958
But in this world,

748
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,637
I'm completely alone now.

749
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:23,837
Your Eminence,

750
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,437
I want to stay by your side.

751
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:27,958
But staying

752
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:29,798
with me

753
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:31,328
means constant peril.

754
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,518
I don't want to endanger you.

755
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:34,917
You're the only one

756
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:37,278
left in this world
who's ever shown me kindness.

757
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:43,357
Very well.

758
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:45,318
I accept your pledge.

759
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,558
Master, are you alright?

760
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,318
I'm fine.

761
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:53,758
Kong Hou is ruthlessly vicious.

762
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,917
I aimed to take you
back to Luanfeng Peak.

763
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:56,798
But our master

764
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,078
and the Ten Great Sects

765
00:31:58,078 --> 00:31:58,998
are all at Yunhua Sect.

766
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:00,597
They claim you colluded

767
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:01,518
with Kong Hou.

768
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:02,238
They're pressuring

769
00:32:02,238 --> 00:32:03,478
our master to hand you over.

770
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:04,437
And now

771
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,798
due to the Kong Hou incident,

772
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:06,597
the sect says...

773
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:07,958
Their rejection of me

774
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,278
is only natural.

775
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,238
So I took the initiative

776
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:13,078
to bring you to Fengyi Outpost.

777
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:13,998
Moreover,

778
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:17,437
only the disciples

779
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,558
stationed here

780
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:19,877
still remain loyal.

781
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:22,677
What of the village?

782
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,518
Nearly all died.

783
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:29,632
Even if you refuse to wake up,

784
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:30,877
today I must

785
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:31,958
speak plainly.

786
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,998
Kong Hou has become a dark cultivator.

787
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,197
She shows zero regard

788
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:35,837
for past bonds

789
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:36,958
and is utterly merciless.

790
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,278
Xiao Dong,

791
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:40,238
enough.

792
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:45,637
Never mind.

793
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:47,488
Anything else?

794
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,038
Any news of Lin Hu?

795
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,278
No news yet.

796
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:53,157
But I left a messenger talisman.

797
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,917
He'll likely arrive soon.

798
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,318
Stop!

799
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:01,677
Ling Bo?

800
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,704
- Ling Bo.
- Ling Bo.

801
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:08,758
Ma'am?

802
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:12,437
Ma'am?

803
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,758
How could you massacre innocents?

804
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:22,117
Ling Bo,

805
00:33:22,197 --> 00:33:23,758
they were all dark cultivators.

806
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,397
So what if they were?

807
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,038
Can't you see

808
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,397
they were elderly and children?

809
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:30,397
They never

810
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:31,478
had any threat to anyone.

811
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:33,357
Ling Bo, you're mistaken.

812
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,117
We only acted

813
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:36,558
when they suddenly went berserk.

814
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,117
All dark cultivators

815
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:38,877
deserve to die.

816
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:39,758
I haven't forgotten.

817
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:43,117
I understand the rules.

818
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:44,448
But these were merely

819
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,357
helpless,

820
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,238
ordinary villagers.

821
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:47,238
They couldn't

822
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:48,437
possibly pose any threat.

823
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:49,798
What about you?

824
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,877
Look at what you've done.

825
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,238
You're making

826
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:54,240
no distinction

827
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,357
between right and wrong.

828
00:33:55,437 --> 00:33:56,397
Ling Bo,

829
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,558
what's happened to you?

830
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:58,597
Why are you defending

831
00:33:58,597 --> 00:33:59,518
these dark cultivators?

832
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,078
Have they...

833
00:34:01,837 --> 00:34:03,776
- Have they enchanted you?
- Stay back.

834
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,117
Are you alright?

835
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,398
Enough.

836
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:14,592
You've killed them.

837
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:15,478
Leave now.

838
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,358
Now I understand.

839
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:19,478
Master Zhong Xi

840
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:20,958
and Kong Hou are in collusion.

841
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:21,757
They sent you here

842
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:22,438
to trick Ling Bo.

843
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:22,998
Didn't they?

844
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:23,717
Nonsense.

845
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:26,117
Return to the sect.

846
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,277
Ling Bo,

847
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:28,197
you must come back

848
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:29,317
with us today.

849
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,117
Do not sink

850
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:30,998
to their level.

851
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:32,197
I won't return.

852
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,157
Ling Bo.

853
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:33,958
- Ling Bo.
- Ling Bo.

854
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:35,438
Leave, all of you.

855
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:36,838
Do I still command your respect?

856
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:42,717
Leave.

857
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,197
Leave now.

858
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:45,878
Let's go.

859
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:54,797
Are you alright?

860
00:34:58,878 --> 00:34:59,597
Let's

861
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,038
give them proper burials.

862
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:57,157
Zhong Xi forged those beads

863
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,797
using his own soul essence.

864
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,597
If not for the act

865
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:05,558
before Jiusu,

866
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:08,878
I would never have

867
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:12,237
borne to destroy them.

868
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,317
I wonder

869
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,358
if Zhong Xi is fine

870
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:21,358
after taking my strike.

871
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,518
Does he realize

872
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:23,478
it was

873
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,958
all an act?

874
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:28,277
I hope he won't misunderstand me.

875
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:37,797
No wonder previous episodes

876
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:39,518
were less agonizing.

877
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,998
The beads were suppressing

878
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,078
my dark cultivation bloodline.

879
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:44,757
There is

880
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:46,048
your spiritual energy on these.

881
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:50,272
Now I must find another way.
