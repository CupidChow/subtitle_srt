=Episode 23=

16
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,024
After being sealed by Luanfeng Peak,

17
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,585
members of Hehuan Sect fled.

18
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:51,785
And this place has been abandoned.

19
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,104
But it's suitable
for our temporary stay.

20
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:55,664
No one knows about it,

21
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:56,945
and no one would come.

22
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,384
Kong Hou.

23
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,904
Someday we'll prove

24
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,225
you're not what they think.

25
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:10,824
What they care about

26
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:12,104
is never

27
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:13,345
what kind of person I am,

28
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:16,225
but my status.

29
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,945
Who am I really?

30
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,025
Kong Hou.

31
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,065
I-I'm not good with words,

32
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:30,345
but believe me.

33
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:34,185
To me, you are simply yourself,

34
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:36,945
the one I love

35
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:38,824
and protect

36
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:39,984
for the rest of my life.

37
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:48,104
I hope we

38
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:51,544
can stay together forever.

39
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,384
Look.

40
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:01,505
Come.

41
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:09,264
All surrounding plants have withered,

42
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,664
yet this flower still blooms.

43
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:12,984
So can we.

44
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:21,664
Ling Bo.

45
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,225
Ling Bo.

46
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,945
We've searched this entire area,

47
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:25,704
and found

48
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:26,625
nothing suspicious.

49
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,144
Okay, understood.

50
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,264
That dark cultivator is cunning.

51
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,104
Tracking her won't be easy.

52
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,264
Stay alert,

53
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,025
don't lose heart.

54
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:35,345
- Yes.
- Yes.

55
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:36,544
Ling Bo,

56
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,025
what's our next move?

57
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,025
Go back to report or...

58
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:41,185
Let's go back.

59
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:41,824
- Okay.
- Okay.

60
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:42,505
Lady Ling Bo.

61
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:49,225
You're here too?

62
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:52,144
We're coming under the head's orders

63
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,225
to find Master Zhong Xi.

64
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:56,625
Master Zhong Xi is missing?

65
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,505
He might have left

66
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,384
with Kong Hou.

67
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:03,225
We've searched

68
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,225
this area and found

69
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:04,905
no trace

70
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,104
of Master Zhong Xi.

71
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,185
Thank you for the information.

72
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:09,745
We'll search elsewhere.

73
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:13,305
Let's go.

74
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:17,784
(Oh no!)

75
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,505
(That direction leads to Hehuan Sect.)

76
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,185
(I can't let Xiao Dong go there.)

77
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:24,024
Ling Bo.

78
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:24,584
Ling Bo.

79
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,784
- Ling Bo.
- Ling Bo.

80
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:26,704
What's wrong?

81
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:27,384
It's nothing.

82
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:28,505
I twisted my ankle.

83
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:29,665
Let me see.

84
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,384
No need.

85
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,105
I've already checked that area.

86
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:34,865
Maybe go over there.

87
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:35,625
We might find

88
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,865
some clues there.

89
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:38,185
You people,

90
00:04:39,224 --> 00:04:40,105
go check that area.

91
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:40,985
If you find

92
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:41,945
any traces,

93
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:42,865
report to me.

94
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:43,865
- Yes.
- Yes.

95
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:45,024
You guys go too.

96
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,105
More people mean better chances.

97
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:48,505
But your ankle...

98
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,344
I'm right here.

99
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,144
Don't worry.

100
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:52,505
It's fine.

101
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,065
If urgent,

102
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,024
send me a message.

103
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,065
- Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:57,704
Go.

105
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:01,505
Tell me,

106
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,384
where is Zhong Xi now?

107
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,224
I-I don't know.

108
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,704
You don't know?

109
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,824
Kong Hou has disappeared.

110
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,224
It must be your

111
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,344
and Zhong Xi's doing.

112
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:16,264
Tell me,

113
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:18,505
did Zhong Xi leave

114
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,824
with Kong Hou?

115
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,464
Say it.

116
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:23,264
I...

117
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:28,665
Y-You...

118
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,584
He's lost his mind.

119
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:37,224
Instead of stopping him,

120
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:38,784
you're being his accomplice.

121
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,665
You know he's crucial

122
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,384
to the entire Liuguang Sect

123
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,865
and the whole Lingyou Realm, right?

124
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,185
Besides, he's injured.

125
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:48,945
Y-You...

126
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,065
- Senior, watch out!
- Master.

127
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:53,904
Let go of me.

128
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,024
Listen,

129
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,224
if anything happens to him,

130
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,264
I'll hold you accountable.

131
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,305
How's it? Feeling better?

132
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,505
You shouldn't exhaust

133
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:34,065
your spiritual energy for me.

134
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,745
We regulate energy for each other.

135
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,665
It's not exhausting at all.

136
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:42,985
It actually eases me.

137
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:43,945
Don't worry.

138
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:47,784
Kong Hou.

139
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:49,985
Once this is over,

140
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,065
let's live in seclusion

141
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,185
in the mortal realm,

142
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,425
and ignore all these conflicts.

143
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:55,545
Okay?

144
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:03,904
Then,

145
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,185
after I recover.

146
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,545
You must be tired
from energy regulation.

147
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,105
I'll get you some food.

148
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:16,865
Wait here.

149
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:22,865
(We've)

150
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:23,985
(already escaped.)

151
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,344
(Maybe Zhong Xi is right.)

152
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:28,665
(We could live in seclusion,)

153
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:30,185
(spending our days)

154
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,185
(in peace.)

155
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:32,704
(But)

156
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:36,105
(why do I feel so scared?)

157
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:53,945
Careful.

158
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:54,945
Thanks.

159
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,185
(What to do?)

160
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:57,425
(I must hold him up)

161
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,584
(for one night.)

162
00:07:58,665 --> 00:07:59,945
(Otherwise,)

163
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:00,625
(if he finds)

164
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,945
(Kong Hou and Master Zhong Xi,)

165
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:02,745
(all our efforts)

166
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:03,584
(will be wasted.)

167
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:04,665
Ling Bo.

168
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:07,224
Your injury

169
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:08,344
doesn't look severe.

170
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:10,985
What? It hurts!

171
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,065
I didn't bring

172
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:16,665
any medicine.

173
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:18,264
Endure it for now.

174
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,464
I'll send you back,

175
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:20,985
and then go meet the others.

176
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:21,784
No way.

177
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:23,105
This...

178
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,704
(Oh no.)

179
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:25,625
(What should I do?)

180
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,464
(I can't let him go.)

181
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,264
(Must hold him up.)

182
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:30,945
M-My...

183
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,545
My foot's injured, and it's hot...

184
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:33,984
Foot?

185
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,785
I feel dizzy and have headache.

186
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,224
Feeling dizzy?

187
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:40,824
Probably exhausted.

188
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,104
Ling Bo, you're a terrible liar.

189
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:45,185
You

190
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:47,265
always touch your ear when lying.

191
00:08:53,425 --> 00:08:54,864
You saw through me.

192
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:56,545
How did you tell?

193
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,945
Never mind. I don't care.

194
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,344
That's the real you.

195
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,425
When you feigned weakness earlier,

196
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:03,704
I knew something was off.

197
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:06,185
Say it.

198
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,145
Why lied to me?

199
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:08,824
Holding me up

200
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,385
to stop me from finding Zhong Xi

201
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:11,305
and Kong Hou?

202
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:15,344
You and Lin Hu

203
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:16,824
helped them

204
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,984
escape, right?

205
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,065
Yes, we did it.

206
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:20,905
So what?

207
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,185
They wanted to strip

208
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,425
Kong Hou's spiritual roots.

209
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:24,425
I had to do something.

210
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:25,224
Besides,

211
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:26,584
Master Zhong Xi

212
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:27,785
is your master.

213
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:28,265
Can't you

214
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,425
trust him more?

215
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,344
Or do you

216
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,265
plan to capture me

217
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:33,145
and interrogate me?

218
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:36,704
Then you've misunderstood me.

219
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:37,984
I am

220
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:39,504
concerned about the Master.

221
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:40,425
Finding him

222
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,344
was only to verify

223
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:42,104
his safety.

224
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,265
I've learned

225
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:44,744
from you that he left safely,

226
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:45,624
and it reassures me.

227
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:47,744
I trust him.

228
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:49,624
And I

229
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,984
thought the same as you.

230
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:19,704
Kong Hou.

231
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,665
I need spiritual energy!

232
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:25,984
Spiritual energy!

233
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,145
Kong Hou, it's me.

234
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:35,385
No!

235
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,305
Zhong Xi, help me.

236
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:51,744
Zhong Xi.

237
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,104
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,464
I couldn't control myself.

239
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:57,385
It's alright.

240
00:10:58,545 --> 00:10:59,704
It's over now.

241
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:02,984
Junior.

242
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:04,425
Senior.

243
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,185
Enough.

244
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:07,744
Just to confine me.

245
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:09,344
I'm even prepared for execution.

246
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:10,385
Think this scares me?

247
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,065
Only punishing you now

248
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:12,824
can we settle

249
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:13,905
the disputes.

250
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:16,504
Senior, just go.

251
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:17,185
They

252
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,224
won't stop

253
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,905
until they see me punished.

254
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,385
And I don't care.

255
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:23,425
My only concern now

256
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:24,185
is if Kong Hou

257
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,185
successfully escaped

258
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,344
the pursuers.

259
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,305
No news

260
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,824
is the best news.

261
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:31,545
It means she's not captured.

262
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,265
With Zhong Xi by her side,

263
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,305
they can support each other.

264
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:37,504
With Zhong Xi,

265
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:38,864
Kong Hou won't need

266
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,464
to tackle too much trouble alone.

267
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:42,624
Now focus on your cultivation.

268
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,425
I'll take care of the affairs.

269
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:45,704
Senior,

270
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:48,025
do you truly

271
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,584
have no questions for me?

272
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:53,584
Kong Hou

273
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:56,425
is a good disciple of Yunhua Sect.

274
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,624
Stay confined here with Tan Feng

275
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,305
to reflect on your actions.

276
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,385
Master.

277
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:15,744
Please don't be angry.

278
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,104
I just didn't want

279
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,464
Kong Hou to be wronged.

280
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,344
I merely wished Kong Hou...

281
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,065
Master.

282
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:23,744
Please don't blame Ling Hui.

283
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,425
Just blame me.

284
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:26,665
I failed to guide them.

285
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:28,385
Helping and trusting

286
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:29,504
your fellows

287
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:30,584
isn't wrong.

288
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,385
Actually,

289
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,224
I'm not a good master.

290
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:38,545
Failed to care for you.

291
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,704
Master, that's not true.

292
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:43,224
You taught me skills since childhood.

293
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,385
You showed me

294
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:45,785
the way to conduct myself.

295
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:48,065
I rarely showed

296
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:49,704
concern for you.

297
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:50,905
And I believed

298
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:52,704
letting you roam free was sufficient.

299
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,744
This forged your independence,

300
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,185
but also made you stubborn.

301
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:58,584
Actually,

302
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:01,104
if you told me about this matter,

303
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,385
I would've gone for you.

304
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:05,065
Master, I know you trust me.

305
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,624
And you trust Kong Hou too.

306
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:07,824
Please don't grieve.

307
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:08,945
I believe

308
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:10,065
everything will

309
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,305
come clear in the end.

310
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:11,864
Master.

311
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,624
When everything comes clear,

312
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:14,504
people will know

313
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:15,464
Kong Hou is innocent.

314
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:16,545
By then,

315
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,025
what Ling Hui and I did

316
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,425
was all worth it.

317
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,665
You all act with loyalty

318
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:22,704
and righteousness.

319
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,584
It's my Yunhua Sect's honor

320
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,145
to have disciples like you.

321
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,584
I also trust Kong Hou.

322
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,945
Everything will come to light.

323
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,025
Kong Hou...

324
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:37,065
Everything will be fine.

325
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:44,824
Master.

326
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:54,265
People are watching us closely now.

327
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:56,744
I must enforce justice impartially.

328
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,624
Rest within the barrier

329
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,864
for now.

330
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:01,464
I will tell you

331
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:03,464
about any update.

332
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:08,145
Rest assured.

333
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:09,945
Master will understand.

334
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:11,905
I'll stay by your side.

335
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,385
Zhong Xi, I'm sorry.

336
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:25,464
It doesn't matter.

337
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:26,785
It's all over.

338
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,344
You've grown.

339
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,665
When you saw me heal wounds this way,

340
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,065
you found it fascinating.

341
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:42,145
But...

342
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,665
Zhong Xi, I...

343
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:44,785
Alright.

344
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,504
I told you it's all over.

345
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,425
Besides,

346
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,425
that wasn't the real you.

347
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,104
But,

348
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:54,025
this will happen

349
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:54,984
frequently.

350
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:56,945
I'm scared.

351
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,984
If I'm not scared, why should you be?

352
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:00,305
Moreover,

353
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,704
there are so many shrews

354
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,104
in the world,

355
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:03,665
yet no

356
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,025
husband got killed by their wives.

357
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:07,065
Besides, I'm no ordinary one.

358
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:07,945
I'll get used to it.

359
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:09,665
What are you saying?

360
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:11,385
I'll get used to it.

361
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,584
The previous line.

362
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:18,145
Well,

363
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:20,425
there are

364
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,905
so many shrews in the world.

365
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:24,824
Who is the shrew?

366
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,425
Who is the shrew?

367
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,785
Who is the shrew?

368
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,065
Who is...

369
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,065
I'm serious. No need to fear.

370
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,025
I'll stay with you.

371
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:44,224
Okay.

372
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:46,185
I understand.

373
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,425
Ling Bo.

374
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:02,265
For you.

375
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:03,624
What is this?

376
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,385
The Heavenly Cloud Manual.

377
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,385
You've been wanting to read it.

378
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,265
It took me a lot of effort to get it.

379
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:13,744
I already have one.

380
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:15,305
Keep it for yourself.

381
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,065
Why do you stare at me?

382
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,224
How do you

383
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:35,145
know I stare at you?

384
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:35,744
You...

385
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,425
When did you become

386
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:38,824
so eloquent?

387
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:40,104
Not at all.

388
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,744
I was just thinking

389
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:45,104
people say

390
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,425
marriage changes

391
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,464
a person.

392
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:49,265
But to be honest,

393
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:50,665
I never imagined

394
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:51,665
I'd live such a life.

395
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,504
To have a loved one by my side

396
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:56,905
is truly wonderful.

397
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:03,025
Kong Hou.

398
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,105
Tie me up.

399
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:45,185
Ling Bo.

400
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,425
I might carry you inside.

401
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:51,345
What? Why?

402
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:52,665
Don't misunderstand.

403
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,224
I mean,

404
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,224
we need a plausible reason

405
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:58,865
to return together, right?

406
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:00,105
You

407
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,145
twisted your ankle,

408
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,865
and then I helped you return.

409
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,024
Otherwise, gossip might spread.

410
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,345
Why aren't they back yet?

411
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:13,865
Ling Bo

412
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:15,345
said to pretend it.

413
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:23,185
Why do

414
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,304
you two return together?

415
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:25,665
Why are you carrying her?

416
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:28,064
Put me down first.

417
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,145
Okay.

418
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,825
I met her in the outskirts.

419
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:35,425
And she got her foot injured.

420
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:36,704
So I carried her back.

421
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,024
Injured? Where?

422
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,585
(This act is too obvious.)

423
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:43,825
(If I care about her,)

424
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,145
(she'll laugh at me.)

425
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:49,385
Lady Ling Bo,

426
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,264
you should practice more.

427
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,665
Getting injured that easily

428
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,304
won't do.

429
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:54,425
None of your business.

430
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,345
What?

431
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,105
Last time, you...

432
00:18:58,865 --> 00:19:01,304
What are you two talking about?

433
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:02,905
Just drop me here.

434
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:03,865
You may return.

435
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:04,425
Alright.

436
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,585
I'll go back to report.

437
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,224
W-What do you mean?

438
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,625
Just leave.

439
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:13,425
Wait.

440
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:14,825
Don't we leave together?

441
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,024
I need to chat with Ling Bo.

442
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,024
You go ahead.

443
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:19,984
I'm tired. I'm going back.

444
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:21,464
Let me support you.

445
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:22,105
Well...

446
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,145
Master is waiting.

447
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:23,984
Go back now.

448
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:25,024
Wait, you...

449
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,064
Be careful.

450
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:27,945
Careful.

451
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:29,945
What could he possibly chat

452
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,145
with Lady Ling Bo?

453
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:32,544
He...

454
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,064
Be careful.

455
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,665
Where exactly are you injured?

456
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:43,544
I'm okay.

457
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:45,185
Wait, Ling Bo.

458
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,385
I know some healing arts.

459
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:46,825
If needed,

460
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:47,865
I could treat you.

461
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,185
See? I'm okay.

462
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,105
Are you truly okay?

463
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:55,865
Alright. I need rest.

464
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:56,544
You may leave.

465
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:59,105
Well, I have a question.

466
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,945
Did you really stay with Xiao Dong

467
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:03,704
last night?

468
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,185
Yes.

469
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,385
H-How could you?

470
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,385
What's wrong?

471
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,145
I was worried

472
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,945
Xiao Dong might find
Kong Hou and Zhong Xi,

473
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:12,064
so I pretended to twist my ankles.

474
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:13,024
Well,

475
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:15,024
t-that's still inappropriate.

476
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:15,665
You shouldn't

477
00:20:15,665 --> 00:20:16,905
let him carry you back.

478
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:17,544
If needed,

479
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:18,585
you could've messaged me,

480
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,385
and I'll fetch you.

481
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:20,024
Or had

482
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,024
your fellows

483
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:21,625
fetch you.

484
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,905
You're quite good at it.

485
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,464
Told me to message you

486
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:25,544
or have my fellows

487
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:26,264
fetch me.

488
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:27,865
Xiao Dong was right beside me.

489
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:28,945
If I did that,

490
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,145
that would seem

491
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:30,905
suspicious.

492
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,585
Well, you're right.

493
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,504
Fine. Since you're okay,

494
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,585
I'll leave.

495
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:38,064
Rest early.

496
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,304
Take good rest.

497
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:45,385
Lin Hu.

498
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,185
Where has the Master gone?

499
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,345
How much do you know?

500
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:54,865
If you ask me,

501
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:55,544
I know some.

502
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,184
If you ask me to tell, I know nothing.

503
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:58,185
Stop confusing me.

504
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:00,625
You released the Master?

505
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,905
W-What?

506
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:04,625
Whose side are you on?

507
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,464
Now even you

508
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,744
are targeting Young Master?

509
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,264
Fine. I'll tell you.

510
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:10,744
I released Young Master.

511
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:11,744
If you want to snitch,

512
00:21:11,744 --> 00:21:12,504
go ahead.

513
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,625
I accept any punishment.

514
00:21:14,224 --> 00:21:14,665
Okay.

515
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,504
The Master was released

516
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,704
by you and Ling Bo, right?

517
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,544
What?

518
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,504
Why involved Ling Bo?

519
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:23,464
I've told you

520
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:24,744
I released Young Master.

521
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:25,704
Why involved her?

522
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:27,665
Okay, I believe you.

523
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,185
You've been visiting Ling Bo every day.

524
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,345
Do you have

525
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:32,145
a crush on her?

526
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,345
What?

527
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,024
I visit her because

528
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:35,825
we have matters

529
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:37,385
to discuss.

530
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:38,464
We always argue

531
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,304
when we're together.

532
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:41,625
Have a crush on her?

533
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,544
Fine, I believe you.

534
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:44,744
You'd better

535
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:45,905
tell me the truth.

536
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,345
Because I like Ling Bo.

537
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,345
What?

538
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,145
D-Don't lie to me.

539
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,704
You have a crush on someone.

540
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:56,625
I'm not lying.

541
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,425
My crush is Ling Bo.

542
00:21:59,024 --> 00:22:00,665
Well...

543
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,704
The girl you mentioned

544
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:04,744
was Ling Bo?

545
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:05,105
Yes.

546
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:14,024
Ling Bo.

547
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:15,704
Ling Bo.

548
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:17,544
Ling Bo.

549
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:18,704
Ling Bo.

550
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:22,385
Knocking on my door at this hour,

551
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:23,145
you better have

552
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:24,185
a proper reason.

553
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:25,945
I wanted to check if there are

554
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:26,825
bugs in your room.

555
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,544
Wait.

556
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,345
Wait.

557
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:30,304
I mean it.

558
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:31,464
Don't think I'm overreacting.

559
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,105
At this hour,

560
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:33,425
those bugs could be hiding

561
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,665
under tables, beds,

562
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:35,665
or even your pillow.

563
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:36,665
You can't see them now.

564
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,625
If one crawls over you,

565
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,385
you'll be crying.

566
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,145
Lin Hu.

567
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,504
Who said that

568
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:42,744
it's inappropriate for me

569
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:44,504
to stay with Xiao Dong last night?

570
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,385
Do you think

571
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,224
your coming here

572
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:49,224
is appropriate?

573
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,064
I...

574
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:51,585
Enough.

575
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:52,385
No bugs in my room.

576
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:52,945
You may go.

577
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:55,865
I have a question.

578
00:22:58,784 --> 00:22:59,425
Well,

579
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:03,544
did you date Xiao Dong before?

580
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:05,304
Are you here to gossip?

581
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,665
Coming here so late

582
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:07,544
just to ask that?

583
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,385
No! I'm just concerned about you.

584
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:10,105
What?

585
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,504
This is my private matter.

586
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:12,585
None of your business.

587
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:13,385
Besides,

588
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,185
what if I did?

589
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:14,905
What if I didn't?

590
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:16,105
Who are you to me?

591
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,464
Why would I tell you?

592
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,625
Enough. Go back to bed.

593
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,544
This is inappropriate.

594
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:21,064
Wait.

595
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:22,504
I...

596
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:25,224
I haven't finished speaking.

597
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,504
Bugs?

598
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:34,945
You're just jealous.

599
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,145
Still deny it? How childish.

600
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:42,665
Why am I smiling?

601
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:44,185
What's so funny?

602
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,825
He's being jealous.

603
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:47,024
What's it to do with me?

604
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:28,625
Kong Hou.

605
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,024
Every time,

606
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,425
he gets hurt because of me.

607
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,224
What if someday,

608
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:47,385
I lose control of myself?

609
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:56,185
(Are you getting)

610
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,064
(less able to control)

611
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,224
(your spiritual energy?)

612
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,984
(Want to learn how?)

613
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,024
(Come find me.)

614
00:25:01,704 --> 00:25:03,145
(You can find me.)

615
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,385
Master.

616
00:25:20,464 --> 00:25:21,185
What's

617
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:21,984
the matter?

618
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:25,984
Sit down first.

619
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,264
Master.

620
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,425
Is there something important?

621
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:37,784
I have sword practice soon.

622
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:41,464
I asked you to sit,
so you wouldn't be startled.

623
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:45,625
Master, what's wrong?

624
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:47,464
Ling Bo.

625
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:49,504
Tell me,

626
00:25:50,024 --> 00:25:51,185
have you truly broken up

627
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:52,425
with that Xiao Dong?

628
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:54,984
Why mention him suddenly?

629
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,425
There's nothing

630
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:57,744
between us anymore.

631
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,464
Seriously?

632
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:02,945
Then why did he

633
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:03,825
suddenly come to me?

634
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,105
To propose a marriage to you.

635
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:09,945
What?

636
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:11,345
Propose marriage?

637
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:13,504
Xiao Dong.

638
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:14,784
Ling Bo.

639
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:16,304
Did you

640
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,385
propose a marriage to me?

641
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:18,105
Yes.

642
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:22,464
What's wrong with you?

643
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:23,425
Ling Bo.

644
00:26:25,304 --> 00:26:26,425
I can't lose you again.

645
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:27,304
I've wasted many

646
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:28,464
chances and time already.

647
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:29,105
This time,

648
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,464
if your master consents,

649
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,905
we'll marry soon.

650
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:33,585
My master's consent means nothing.

651
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:34,784
I haven't agreed.

652
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,585
I know you're still mad at me

653
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,585
that I didn't come to you back then

654
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:41,585
and took

655
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:42,784
your angry words seriously,

656
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:43,784
making us part ways.

657
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:44,744
I am not.

658
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,185
No more angry words, Ling Bo.

659
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,064
I did speak angry words back then,

660
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:52,345
but I am telling you
the honest words now.

661
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:53,385
I can understand

662
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:55,185
why you're mad at me.

663
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:56,704
Had I been...

664
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:57,585
Had I been

665
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:58,625
more resolute,

666
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,625
you wouldn't leave me,

667
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:00,304
and I...

668
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,945
Why don't you listen to me?

669
00:27:01,984 --> 00:27:03,024
I was ignorant before,

670
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:05,385
but now,

671
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:06,425
I won't give up on you.

672
00:27:10,224 --> 00:27:10,704
Ling Bo.

673
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:30,544
My sister.

674
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:31,625
Who's your sister?

675
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:34,625
If not my sister,

676
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:36,665
why come to see me?

677
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:39,585
Zhong Xi

678
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,224
has real skill.

679
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:43,145
I feared

680
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,105
you'd suffer

681
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,784
from unstable spiritual energy.

682
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,825
But even so,

683
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,945
he's not worthy to marry you.

684
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,544
Enough talk.

685
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,704
He's not involved.

686
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,224
I love him,

687
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,865
so I won't stay

688
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:00,665
to hurt him.

689
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:01,464
Tell me,

690
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:03,024
how exactly

691
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,064
can I control this dark energy?

692
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:07,504
Come with me,

693
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:08,865
and I'll tell you.

694
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:13,905
(If I stay here,)

695
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:15,504
(I might)

696
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:16,945
(accidentally hurt Zhong Xi.)

697
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:19,105
(And I still didn't)

698
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:21,024
(clarify my origins.)

699
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:22,304
(If he's up to)

700
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,464
(something evil,)

701
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,504
(I'd better go with him)

702
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:26,784
(to find out.)

703
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:28,784
Fine. I'll go with you.

704
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,425
How dare you, Jiusu!

705
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,625
Where are you going? Let her go.

706
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,585
Taking Kong Hou home.

707
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:46,984
Considering your care

708
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,145
for her these days,

709
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,224
I'll spare you

710
00:28:49,665 --> 00:28:50,744
today.

711
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,064
Moreover,

712
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:53,865
are you blind?

713
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:55,425
Do you think

714
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,385
I kidnap her?

715
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,224
Kong Hou

716
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,585
came with me willingly.

717
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:04,984
Impossible.

718
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:06,024
Kong Hou.

719
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:07,865
You promised

720
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:10,425
to leave this place

721
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:12,704
and live in seclusion with me.

722
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,464
Who promised you?

723
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,464
I said,

724
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,064
after I recover.

725
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:27,024
But

726
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,784
when I'm with you,

727
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:31,784
I can't even

728
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:33,304
control my spiritual energy.

729
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:35,385
My pain only grows.

730
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:39,625
But my brother

731
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,185
can ease my pain,

732
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:42,984
so I must go with him.

733
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:44,064
Kong Hou.

734
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,345
Zhong Xi.

735
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,105
Given

736
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:48,224
our past bond,

737
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:49,945
I'll be honest.

738
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,024
I am the Dark Sovereign's daughter.

739
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:54,984
My bloodline defines me.

740
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,345
I and you guys

741
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,145
are at odds.

742
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:01,264
I have my path to go.

743
00:30:02,145 --> 00:30:03,464
Righteous sects oppressed my kin.

744
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,744
And I will reclaim our honor.

745
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,425
Kong Hou.

746
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:27,544
Kong Hou.

747
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,064
Don't trust him.

748
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:30,585
Don't trust him.

749
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:44,544
Awesome, Kong Hou!

750
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:46,504
Not blinded by affection

751
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:47,625
and emotions.

752
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,145
Why do you

753
00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:16,345
bring me here?

754
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,304
You are a dark cultivator.

755
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:20,304
This is where you belong.

756
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,064
You didn't know it before.

757
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:22,825
But now,

758
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,585
why still talking nonsense?

759
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,105
Don't forget

760
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:27,744
we are family.

761
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:29,224
No way.

762
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:31,825
I understand

763
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:32,865
you're mad at me.

764
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,704
After all, we have

765
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:35,744
past misunderstandings.

766
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:36,945
What?

767
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:38,064
Exactly.

768
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:40,064
Had I known you were my sister,

769
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,464
I'd never have harmed you.

770
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:44,984
So you can harm

771
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:46,784
righteous cultivators?

772
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,024
Righteous?

773
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,185
Such labels

774
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:53,105
mean nothing.

775
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,224
You've committed evil deeds.

776
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:56,544
So you'd say that.

777
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:58,345
You don't understand.

778
00:31:58,704 --> 00:31:59,264
And I'll

779
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:01,264
tell you one day.

780
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,425
One day?

781
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,145
Then I'll

782
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,105
be all ears

783
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:09,145
to your lies.

784
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:13,024
You're quite composed.

785
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,544
I saw you're lively and mischievous,

786
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:17,145
and doubted

787
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:18,905
your capabilities.

788
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,024
In that case,

789
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:20,905
why bother

790
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,865
bringing me here?

791
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:23,145
If you hate hearing it,

792
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:24,504
I'll stop.

793
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:25,625
I don't

794
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,984
expect you to accept me now.

795
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,825
Rest now.

796
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,024
Later, I'll introduce everyone.

797
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:32,825
Everyone?

798
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:35,945
Who's everyone?

799
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,865
Our kin, of course.

800
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:39,825
Now that you're here.

801
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:41,385
You'll lead our kin

802
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:42,984
to forge a new era.

803
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:44,185
I believe

804
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,984
everything will change.

805
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:06,865
This is

806
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:08,304
the Yunhua Sect's...

807
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:09,105
Your Eminence.

808
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,185
Why do you bring
a righteous sect's disciple?

809
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,544
Stop

810
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:13,744
the commotion.

811
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:15,865
Father's dying wish

812
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,784
was for Kong Hou

813
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,784
becoming our Sovereign.

814
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,105
All these years,

815
00:33:21,425 --> 00:33:23,024
I have been too incompetent

816
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:24,905
to bring her back.

817
00:33:25,544 --> 00:33:26,544
Now,

818
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:28,464
Kong Hou has returned.

819
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:29,665
From now on,

820
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:31,345
she shall be our Yueluo Clan's

821
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,464
newly appointed Sovereign.

822
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,264
We must all wholeheartedly support her.

823
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:36,464
No defiance tolerated.

824
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:37,504
- Well...
- Well...

825
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:40,984
Right.

826
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,145
Your Eminence,

827
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,224
this woman

828
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:45,105
was cultivated by

829
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,024
the hypocritical sect.

830
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,544
She doesn't side with us.

831
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:48,704
She even injured you.

832
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:50,105
Why are you doing this?

833
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:52,105
I wonder why too.

834
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,665
You're abandoning

835
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,145
your position as Dark Sovereign

836
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:56,665
and handing it over to me?

837
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:59,504
You possess the Five Spiritual Roots,
with excellent talents.

838
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,784
The Dark Sovereign title
rightfully belongs to you.

839
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:05,744
What? Don't you want it?

840
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:07,825
Since I'm here,

841
00:34:08,024 --> 00:34:09,504
it makes no difference to me.

842
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:14,345
But your people might not be convinced.

843
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:16,064
Exactly. So what?

844
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:17,144
You're just here

845
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:17,905
to spy on us.

846
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:26,305
Well?

847
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,305
Anyone else?

848
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:38,664
Starting today,

849
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:41,385
I am your Sovereign.

850
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:46,104
Your Eminence,
please take your seat of honor.

851
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:07,705
- All hail the Sovereign!
