16
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,305
Why isn't there any response?

17
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,505
How could this happen?

18
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:08,544
Have we been exposed?

19
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,424
It's fine.

20
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,665
I have an idea.

21
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:12,464
What is it?

22
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:14,024
Do you know Tracking?

23
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:16,024
I don't know

24
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:16,984
Tracking.

25
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:17,984
And spells are

26
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:18,704
not my expertise.

27
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:20,625
But I have talents.

28
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:34,304
There.

29
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,264
It's been all night.

30
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,984
Why hasn't Lin Hu arrived yet?

31
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:53,264
They told me

32
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,984
not to act alone.

33
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,665
Yet they didn't show up.

34
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,665
What's going on?

35
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,864
Where's he heading?

36
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:11,544
That way.

37
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:13,304
Can I trust you?

38
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,225
Let's go.

39
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:17,304
Trust me.

40
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:18,464
Over there. Let's go.

41
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:19,945
Why didn't I smell it?

42
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:21,304
Are you a hound or a fox?

43
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,520
Tell me. I don't hate demon cultivators.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,905
They're getting along well.

45
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:25,424
You...

46
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,625
This beggar seems suspicious.

47
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,464
Something's off.

48
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:43,704
Let's go.

49
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,825
What should we do now?

50
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:05,864
If he goes further,

51
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:06,905
he'll fall off.

52
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,744
This isn't normal human behavior.

53
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:09,945
Might be a puppet.

54
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,144
A puppet?

55
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:18,945
Who are these people?

56
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,065
Puppets.

57
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:21,224
Puppets?

58
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,625
They are surrounding to attack him.

59
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:26,305
Let's rescue him

60
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,024
first.

61
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,825
Lady Ling Bo.

62
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,065
I knew

63
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,664
only you could

64
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:38,904
subdue them swiftly,

65
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,305
Lady Ling Bo.

66
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:47,945
I didn't do it.

67
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:48,745
Not you?

68
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:50,625
I see.

69
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,065
Something's off down the cliff.

70
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:53,305
I'll go investigate.

71
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,464
By the way, Lady Ling Bo.

72
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,664
- Young Master.
- Are you here

73
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,784
for Chang De?

74
00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:57,945
No.

75
00:04:58,664 --> 00:04:59,625
No?

76
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,545
Didn't you say

77
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:01,825
to go to Fengyi to find him?

78
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:02,825
None of your business.

79
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:03,344
I...

80
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:05,584
I get it now.

81
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:06,664
You must be tracking

82
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:07,584
his trail

83
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:08,625
to steal his glory, right?

84
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,104
You!

85
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:10,945
Doesn't matter.

86
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:11,784
Anyway,

87
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,904
I've tracked the target.

88
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:14,264
These are just decoys.

89
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:15,264
The real catch

90
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:15,985
is over there.

91
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:17,425
What's wrong with

92
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,584
those puppets?

93
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:19,664
There's a hut nearby.

94
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,904
You'll know there.

95
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,024
Aren't you coming?

96
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:22,945
No.

97
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,344
Passing up such a chance

98
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,104
to get the glory?

99
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,745
I have more important things to do.

100
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:27,985
Farewell.

101
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:31,784
Tan Feng.

102
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,464
Do you smell

103
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,185
a strange stench here?

104
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:34,825
Let's go.

105
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:35,904
After all these days,

106
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:37,065
I've gotten used to it.

107
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:52,904
Finally.

108
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,065
I can't stand

109
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,344
the stench anymore.

110
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:58,344
Come on.

111
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:19,704
Here. Over here.

112
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:23,825
Oh my.

113
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,664
This is horrifying.

114
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,144
All these were made from

115
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,104
living people?

116
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,464
This is the cruelty of creating puppets.

117
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,745
This complicates things.

118
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,024
Not a living creature here.

119
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,264
We can't interrogate anyone.

120
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:37,464
Stay calm.

121
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,464
We might find clues here.

122
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,104
I thought I just saw

123
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,104
this one blink.

124
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:54,505
You must be mistaken.

125
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,224
Just figure it out.

126
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,625
- He moved.
- Stop!

127
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:21,904
Guys,

128
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,264
why are you detaining me?

129
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,505
I know nothing.

130
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,505
I truly know nothing.

131
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,945
You control the puppets, right?

132
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,344
Why did the puppets
climb up from the cliff?

133
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:34,344
I know nothing.

134
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:35,985
I've told you I don't know.

135
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,024
If you don't tell,

136
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,144
I'll make you die here.

137
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,144
Even if you kill me,

138
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,704
I still don't know a thing.

139
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:43,425
I know nothing.

140
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:45,264
Think I won't kill you?

141
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:45,945
Right?

142
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:46,945
Tan Feng,

143
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:48,625
don't actually kill him.

144
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,425
Let me handle this.

145
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,224
You're allergic to feathers?

146
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:57,104
Talk.

147
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:58,904
Or else...

148
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:00,904
Don't use the feather.

149
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:02,825
I'll talk.

150
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,945
Down that cliff

151
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:10,385
lies a village.

152
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,664
Many years ago,

153
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,144
the master of Fengyi Realm,

154
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,264
Immortal Bo Yuan,

155
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,664
hid the realm's key

156
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:17,024
in the village.

157
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,745
Immortal Bo Yuan, master of the realm?

158
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,745
Exactly.

159
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:22,945
So you sent puppets down

160
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,625
to retrieve the realm key?

161
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,224
It's not

162
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,464
a simple task.

163
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:29,104
I've been

164
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,185
in this desolated place

165
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,305
scheming for so long,

166
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:32,224
yet still can't get it.

167
00:08:32,504 --> 00:08:33,945
Why do you want the key?

168
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:34,984
I'm just...

169
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:40,185
Who sent you?

170
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:41,785
I can't tell you.

171
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,864
No.

172
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,864
Spare me, please.

173
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:48,344
Spare me.

174
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,104
Lord Jiusu

175
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:52,425
sent me.

176
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,624
Listen carefully.

177
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:55,825
The village

178
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,384
lies down this cliff.

179
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,104
After finding a path,

180
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:00,825
sneak in secretly.

181
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,785
Even it means to search every inch,

182
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,145
you must find me

183
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,265
the realm key.

184
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:06,864
Understood?

185
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:07,744
- Yes!
- Yes!

186
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:08,584
Go.

187
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:18,665
(He ordered me)

188
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,464
(to obtain the realm key,)

189
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,825
(so I brought men)

190
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:22,945
(here)

191
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,945
(and asked them to descend the cliff.)

192
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,785
(But after waiting for a long time,)

193
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,185
(none returned.)

194
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,025
(Later,)

195
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:29,785
(I sent)

196
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,464
(more teams down,)

197
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:35,344
(yet still, none returned.)

198
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,305
(Soon,)

199
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:38,665
(all the dark cultivators I sent)

200
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,504
(perished.)

201
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,665
(Without obtaining the key,)

202
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,344
(I couldn't go back to the Lord.)

203
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:44,864
(Fortunately, I can craft puppets.)

204
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,665
(So I captured homeless beggars)

205
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,025
(from the city)

206
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,185
(and transformed them)

207
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:50,384
(into puppets)

208
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:51,425
(to continue)

209
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,545
(the mission.)

210
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,744
(Yet after these puppets)

211
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:54,704
(entered the village,)

212
00:09:54,704 --> 00:09:56,305
(like the others before,)

213
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:57,945
(none returned)

214
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,025
(and I lost their track.)

215
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:02,864
That's brutal.

216
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:04,065
You're just sending them

217
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:04,984
to their deaths.

218
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,984
Those are practically living dead.

219
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:08,425
At first,

220
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:09,305
I thought

221
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,504
my control methods might be wrong.

222
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:12,425
So,

223
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:13,864
I kept

224
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,305
making adjustments.

225
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,065
Well,

226
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,624
I sent another one down today.

227
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,984
Tell me about today's situation.

228
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,704
How did he perform?

229
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,145
How dare you ask!

230
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:24,224
He almost got killed by

231
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,185
puppets that climbed up.

232
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,104
The puppets we encountered earlier

233
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,545
were also the ones you sent down?

234
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,344
I didn't expect it.

235
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,665
I wonder what it is

236
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,864
down there

237
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,025
that can counter my puppets.

238
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:36,825
No way.

239
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,384
I need to properly

240
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,025
craft a new batch of puppets

241
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,464
and fight against it.

242
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,384
What are you doing?

243
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:44,145
You're so wicked.

244
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:44,945
Wicked.

245
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,744
It seems the village

246
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:48,545
must've had

247
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:50,185
some mechanism to protect the realm key.

248
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:52,584
It can counter the puppets.

249
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:54,545
Impressive.

250
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:56,785
But this is just a speculation.

251
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,305
Old man,

252
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:00,584
tell us something useful.

253
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:01,504
Everything I said

254
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,704
was useful.

255
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,185
Then earlier,

256
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,384
the puppet that tried
to steal the Azure Phoenix

257
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:07,624
was also your creation?

258
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,425
Of course.

259
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,584
I'm not boasting,

260
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,185
but there are only

261
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:12,825
few people

262
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:13,864
who can craft puppets

263
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,224
that exquisitely as I do.

264
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,185
But the way

265
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,185
to control puppets

266
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,584
is extremely challenging.

267
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:19,905
If you apply too much force,

268
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:21,224
they become brainless brutes.

269
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,224
Too little force,

270
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,025
and they go rogue,

271
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,624
even betray me.

272
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,744
That's why

273
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,504
I can only crush them.

274
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:30,504
Tell me,

275
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:31,584
is my skill

276
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,065
remarkable?

277
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:34,344
Right?

278
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:35,545
Your skill is decent,

279
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:36,504
but you are not.

280
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,065
How dare you take innocent lives.

281
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:40,545
You've beaten me three times.

282
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,785
Everyone,

283
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,104
please

284
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:44,185
spare me.

285
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:47,025
I've told you everything I know.

286
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,104
Think about

287
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,504
those people you sent

288
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,224
to their deaths.

289
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,025
Enough.

290
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:52,704
Lin Hu,

291
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,265
take him with us.

292
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:55,224
Understood.

293
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:56,905
He's of some help to us.

294
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,864
My head hurts.

295
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:03,704
My legs ache.

296
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,504
Enough.

297
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:05,425
I gave up

298
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,464
this old trick years ago.

299
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,624
Wait, wait.

300
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,984
Please,

301
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:14,624
I'm begging you.

302
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,065
Have mercy, please.

303
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,785
I really can't walk anymore.

304
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:18,785
Stop dragging our feet.

305
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:19,704
Move.

306
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,025
I am completely

307
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:21,905
exhausted.

308
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,384
Especially my buttocks,

309
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,665
they're in pain.

310
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,744
I can't walk anymore.

311
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:27,864
Putting on an act now?

312
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:30,504
Where's that arrogance from earlier?

313
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,104
Alright.

314
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:33,984
Maybe

315
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,584
we'll rest here for a while.

316
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:05,624
Tan Feng, want some?

317
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,624
It's really delicious.

318
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:09,425
I roasted this especially for you.

319
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,425
Don't you give this to

320
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,265
your best friend first?

321
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,665
Don't try to please me.

322
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:21,224
Tan Feng.

323
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,704
If you don't eat,

324
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:23,864
then I won't, either.

325
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,265
I'll starve

326
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:26,464
with you.

327
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:28,665
Fine.

328
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,065
We've endured punishments

329
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,584
together since childhood.

330
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,025
We share the hardships.

331
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:36,665
Silly girl.

332
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:40,344
Your senior brother
has profound cultivation.

333
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,025
Not eating for half a day

334
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:43,624
or even half a year

335
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:44,984
wouldn't starve him.

336
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,785
But you're different.

337
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,584
Your cultivation is still shallow.

338
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,825
You eat three meals daily.

339
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:51,785
If you stop suddenly,

340
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,224
your body can't stand it.

341
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,504
Don't overestimate yourself.

342
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,344
If he doesn't eat, you should eat it.

343
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,624
What did you say?

344
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,384
Only I can instruct Kong Hou.

345
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:02,545
Why do you interrupt?

346
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:07,945
You!

347
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,185
Come with me for a chat.

348
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:16,584
Tan Feng.

349
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:18,864
Huan Zong.

350
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,185
You and Kong Hou are friends?

351
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:24,905
Yes.

352
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,224
Then

353
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,704
act like proper friends.

354
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,584
Do you know how friends should act?

355
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,305
Friends maintain proper boundaries.

356
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:39,265
No matter what,

357
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:40,545
Kong Hou is a young lady,

358
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:41,665
and you're a man.

359
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,305
Respect the boundaries.

360
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:44,584
Don't give people wrong ideas.

361
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:45,785
Tell me,

362
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,425
can you do that?

363
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:49,104
No.

364
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:49,905
You!

365
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,825
You have ulterior motives.

366
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,704
You exaggerate.

367
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:56,945
Kong Hou

368
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:58,905
is straightforward,

369
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,065
kind-hearted,

370
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:01,344
and always helpful.

371
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,905
Naturally worth befriending.

372
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:04,065
If someone develops

373
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,305
affections for her,

374
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,025
I'd say

375
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,344
that's understandable.

376
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,185
Unless you think

377
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:10,864
she's unworthy?

378
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:22,905
Young lady.

379
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:24,065
Young lady.

380
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,344
Stop tossing leaves around.

381
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,265
Look at me now.

382
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:31,945
They've gone

383
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,025
to chat for quite a while.

384
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,545
I wonder what they're chatting.

385
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:35,825
Exactly.

386
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,025
What could Tan Feng

387
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,825
and Huan Zong be talking about?

388
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,025
Who knows?

389
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:41,224
Anyway,

390
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,825
judging from Tan Feng's demeanor,

391
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:45,224
he wants a fight.

392
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,265
Fight?

393
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:47,384
Go check it out.

394
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,425
You watch him,

395
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,104
and I'll go mediate.

396
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:55,945
Kong Hou

397
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,984
h-has many flaws.

398
00:15:58,185 --> 00:15:59,104
Don't be fooled

399
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,104
by her pretty appearance.

400
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:01,248
Her room is in a mess.

401
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:02,945
She burps while eating
and picks at food.

402
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:03,864
Hates washing her hair.

403
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,464
Her hair

404
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,425
is so greasy.

405
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,384
Really?

406
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,665
What's so funny?

407
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:10,945
Everything you mentioned

408
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:11,905
sounds adorable.

409
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,025
Do you really

410
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,025
fall for Kong Hou?

411
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:18,744
Exactly.

412
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:19,864
Have you lost

413
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:20,984
your mind?

414
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:21,785
Let me tell you.

415
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,104
You don't understand her at all.

416
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,624
She's stupid
and has poor spiritual energy.

417
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:26,704
Got no improvement.

418
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,945
And she's not aware of it,

419
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:28,984
always being impulsive.

420
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,945
Likes to wander around to have fun.

421
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:33,384
She's just too playful.

422
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:34,984
Once she returns and focuses

423
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:35,825
on cultivation,

424
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,065
she'll forget

425
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,344
all the others.

426
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,344
Tan Feng.

427
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:41,744
Kong Hou, I said...

428
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,624
Kong Hou, why are you here?

429
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,825
I never expected

430
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:48,624
you to talk ill

431
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,104
behind me here.

432
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,945
Kong Hou, I-I...

433
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,265
Even if I have flaws,

434
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:54,704
you could tell me directly,

435
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:55,825
and I'll correct them.

436
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:56,945
How could you do this?

437
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,185
Kong Hou, I...

438
00:16:58,265 --> 00:16:58,945
Kong Hou.

439
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:00,025
Don't

440
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,344
blame your senior brother.

441
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,945
In fact, I quite envy him.

442
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:04,864
Having spent so much time with you,

443
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:06,225
he notices every detail

444
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:07,624
and remembers

445
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,344
every awkward yet adorable moment

446
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:10,384
of you.

447
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:12,065
Tan Feng, what did you tell

448
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,144
Huan Zong?

449
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,025
Kong Hou, I...

450
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,344
You may think this way.

451
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:16,144
He can remember

452
00:17:16,144 --> 00:17:17,265
all your awkward moments

453
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:18,465
so clearly.

454
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,465
It proves how much he cares about you

455
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,225
and the depth of

456
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:23,705
your bond.

457
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:26,065
Kong Hou, I...

458
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,624
What are those?

459
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,384
Huan Zong, what are those?

460
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:45,465
Why are they following us?

461
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:46,424
Bone-devourers.

462
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,265
Bone-devourers?

463
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,065
Impossible.

464
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:50,336
They're the fiercest raptors
in the cultivation world.

465
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,624
They devour humans whole.

466
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:52,344
Someone must have

467
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,184
released them.

468
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,545
Could it be that Wu Xi?

469
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,065
Move!

470
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:25,856
Third brother.

471
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:27,825
Go!

472
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:28,664
You finally came.

473
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:31,584
He ran away.

474
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:32,864
Protect Kong Hou.

475
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,545
Do me a favor.

476
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,584
At least

477
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,104
work once.

478
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:41,664
Are you okay?

479
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:42,985
I'm fine.

480
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:45,985
Smart move.

481
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,465
At least you helped.

482
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,440
Even the phoenix-headed konghou
couldn't stand it

483
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,505
and came out to fight.

484
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:51,745
Alright.

485
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:52,985
Go find Tan Feng.

486
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:00,384
Tan Feng.

487
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:05,545
Kong Hou.

488
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,664
Kong Hou. Save Kong Hou.

489
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:08,384
Kong Hou.

490
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:14,184
Kong Hou.

491
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,184
Kong Hou.

492
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:30,384
Huan Zong.

493
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,904
Huan Zong.

494
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,465
Huan Zong.

495
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:40,944
Huan Zong.

496
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:41,944
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

497
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:42,825
Huan Zong.

498
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,184
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

499
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:46,144
Huan Zong.

500
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:46,584
Kong Hou.

501
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:47,144
Young Master.

502
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:48,904
Tan Feng, let me go!

503
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:49,864
Calm down, Kong Hou.

504
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,065
Huan Zong is down there.

505
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,584
I need to save him.

506
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,144
- Kong Hou.
- Huan Zong.

507
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,584
- Huan Zong.
- Kong Hou.

508
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,344
When Huan Zong grabbed me,

509
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:01,985
I saw a mass of mist,

510
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,745
and then he got pulled downward.

511
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:04,745
Impossible.

512
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,424
There must be something or someone

513
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:07,424
in the mass of mist.

514
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:08,904
I didn't see anyone,

515
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,864
but only a mass of mist.

516
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:11,785
Didn't you see it?

517
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:12,424
Enough.

518
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:13,624
Kong Hou told you everything.

519
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:14,944
Done with asking.

520
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:16,065
You two

521
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,265
must know

522
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,184
what happened.

523
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:19,225
Say it!

524
00:22:19,424 --> 00:22:20,505
Second brother, this...

525
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,225
Shut up!

526
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:23,624
Talk or I'll kill you!

527
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:24,664
No, no.

528
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:25,624
Be careful.

529
00:22:25,705 --> 00:22:27,225
My second brother

530
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:28,545
truly knows nothing.

531
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:29,465
I

532
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:31,624
might know a bit more.

533
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:33,184
Actually, when we

534
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,624
let dark cultivators go down there,

535
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,664
not all of them failed to return.

536
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:38,225
There's one...

537
00:22:44,384 --> 00:22:44,944
Stay back.

538
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:46,065
Stay back.

539
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,545
This is my

540
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:52,424
puppet?

541
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,545
Wake up.

542
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:03,785
Let me go.

543
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,584
What happened to you?

544
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:11,664
Yesterday,

545
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,184
after descending the cliff,

546
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:15,305
I saw

547
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:16,985
a mass of mist.

548
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:18,225
Then

549
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,065
I got sucked into it.

550
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,065
Sucked right in.

551
00:23:21,144 --> 00:23:22,184
After I woke up...

552
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,305
I woke up...

553
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:25,424
What happened?

554
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:26,944
Say it.

555
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:29,465
I woke up...

556
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:31,785
I...

557
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,664
I saw events from long ago.

558
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:37,104
I saw my wife.

559
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:42,584
I killed her.

560
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:43,864
(He couldn't explain)

561
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,104
(how he escaped properly.)

562
00:23:45,265 --> 00:23:46,624
(From his description,)

563
00:23:46,864 --> 00:23:47,985
(I think he was trapped in)

564
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,184
(his most painful memories)

565
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:50,664
(and imprisoned)

566
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,664
(by his inner demons.)

567
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:54,424
Then Huan Zong

568
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:55,904
would get trapped as well.

569
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,825
I am not sure.

570
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:58,705
Then,

571
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,505
we scoured through ancient texts,

572
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:02,624
and finally uncovered the secret.

573
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,424
Whether a cultivator or mortal,

574
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:05,424
anyone who enters

575
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:06,545
would get trapped,

576
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:07,265
and then

577
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:08,985
live within the illusion

578
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,465
created by their inner demons

579
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,025
and never escape.

580
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:12,785
No way.

581
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:15,225
(Even if the body returns,)

582
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:16,785
(without conquering inner demons,)

583
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:18,904
(one would remain mindless)

584
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,424
(or die.)

585
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,872
(Zhaoqian Hall)

586
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:56,864
Your Highness,

587
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:58,864
good that you're safe.

588
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:01,025
Good that you're safe.

589
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:03,424
His Highness is awake.

590
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,225
His Highness is awake.

591
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:07,745
His Highness is really awake.

592
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,624
Hurry!

593
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:14,985
Quiet. Don't disturb His Highness.

594
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:23,265
Your Highness,

595
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:24,864
please have the meal.

596
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:28,025
You may leave.

597
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:29,705
I need to be alone.

598
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:31,305
Yes.

599
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:34,305
Leave.

600
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:35,465
All of you, leave.

601
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:58,144
Your Highness.

602
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:58,904
Your Highness.

603
00:25:59,025 --> 00:25:59,985
You haven't

604
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:00,545
recovered.

605
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:01,864
You should return to rest.

606
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:02,985
Where is my mother?

607
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:03,944
Your Highness,

608
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:05,545
please take good rest now.

609
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,265
Where is my mother?

610
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:08,344
I want to see her.

611
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:10,904
Your Highness, please return to rest.

612
00:26:11,745 --> 00:26:13,384
Has something happened to my mother?

613
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:15,305
Your Highness, this...

614
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:16,584
Go away.

615
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:17,465
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

616
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:18,705
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

617
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:27,825
Mother.

618
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:31,265
The Empress has passed away.

619
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:39,785
The Empress has passed away.

620
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:31,184
Why?

621
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:33,944
You want me

622
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,065
to remain subordinate to a woman?

623
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:38,065
She's my mother,

624
00:27:38,664 --> 00:27:40,384
your legitimate wife.

625
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,624
How could you do this?

626
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:44,025
You have no ambition,

627
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,624
not fighting for
the Crown Prince position,

628
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:47,985
letting that brat

629
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:48,745
snatch it away.

630
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:49,624
Remember.

631
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,944
Never compromise with women.

632
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:52,785
Don't let them

633
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:53,904
trample over you.

634
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:56,944
Spare no cost to achieve this.

635
00:28:00,465 --> 00:28:02,305
I'll kill you now!

636
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:03,825
From now on,

637
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:05,944
address me as Emperor.

638
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,184
Remember

639
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,785
to always respect me.

640
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:10,825
Go away.

641
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,184
I'll kill you!

642
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:21,952
Let go!

643
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:45,864
Your Majesty,

644
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,424
I have one thing

645
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:48,265
to discuss with you

646
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:49,904
and the ministers.

647
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:52,265
Okay. Speak freely.

648
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,104
The Empress's passing
brings national mourning.

649
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:56,384
I assume

650
00:28:56,424 --> 00:28:58,545
you feel sad as well.

651
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:01,144
We shared profound marital devotion.

652
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:03,104
Through years of marriage,

653
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:05,465
how could I not feel sad?

654
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,505
But this nation

655
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:08,785
was her very flesh and blood.

656
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:11,104
I must prioritize the nation.

657
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,384
Only when peace reigns across the land

658
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:15,705
and the people prosper,

659
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:16,864
will her spirit

660
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,545
find true rest.

661
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,904
Your Majesty, I'm impressed

662
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:23,184
by your profound devotion.

663
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:27,065
Yet I must remind you of a concern.

664
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,864
The Empress has passed away.

665
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,825
Protocol demands
the Crown Prince succeed

666
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:33,944
to convince the nation.

667
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,505
Before the Empress passed away,

668
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:41,904
she left a verbal decree

669
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:43,864
to yield the throne to me.

670
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,785
The Crown Prince is young,

671
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:47,545
not up to the task.

672
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:49,745
Though the Crown Prince is young,

673
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:53,184
we veteran ministers can support him

674
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:54,904
to surely mold him

675
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:56,745
into a proper emperor.

676
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:59,184
I'm afraid your excuse...

677
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,384
won't convince the people.

678
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:06,184
Indeed.

679
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:08,624
It won't convince the people.

680
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:09,944
Indeed.

681
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:11,624
Outrageous!

682
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,664
I've long heard rumors

683
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:16,025
of rebellion brewing.

684
00:30:16,265 --> 00:30:18,265
Had I not witnessed it today,

685
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:19,904
I'd have doubted it.

686
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:21,505
Do you think

687
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:22,505
I don't know

688
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:23,705
your schemes?

689
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,424
Should the Crown Prince ascend,

690
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:27,584
you ministers would

691
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,424
control the nation,

692
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:30,545
reducing him to a puppet,

693
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:32,545
and acting

694
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:33,864
without restraint!

695
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,305
How bold you are

696
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:38,265
to say that

697
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,825
in the court!

698
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:40,864
Guards!

699
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:42,225
Drag this traitor out

700
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:43,424
and behead him publicly.

701
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,104
This is treason.

702
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:49,584
You're usurping power! Deserve death!

703
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:52,505
You're usurping power,
harboring wild ambition!

704
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,584
You're usurping power,
harboring wild ambition!

705
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:57,985
From now on,

706
00:30:58,104 --> 00:31:00,225
anyone who mentions this

707
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:02,144
would meet his fate.

708
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,305
Easy, easy.

709
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:11,305
Behave.

710
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,305
We'll shelter here

711
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:14,384
and plan our next move.

712
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:16,745
Don't waste your time.

713
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:17,864
He's beyond saving.

714
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,104
Go join him then.

715
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,144
Second brother, you...

716
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:23,025
Seeking death!

717
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:23,664
Tan Feng.

718
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,944
I must go down there.

719
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:27,664
Huan Zong got down to save me.

720
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:28,305
Kong Hou.

721
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,424
Huan Zong saved you,

722
00:31:29,465 --> 00:31:30,944
and now we must save him.

723
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:32,305
Don't act impulsively.

724
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:33,465
This requires a plan.

725
00:31:33,465 --> 00:31:34,144
Don't act rashly.

726
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,944
Or you'd trap

727
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,025
yourself in there too.

728
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:38,465
But I...

729
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:40,225
I have

730
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:42,344
an idea.

731
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:43,624
Say it.

732
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:46,424
When we threw those beggars down there,

733
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:48,344
we used Mind Stones on them.

734
00:31:48,505 --> 00:31:49,545
What's that?

735
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:52,225
Something to test inner demons.

736
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:53,624
The less fierce inner demon,

737
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:55,104
the higher survival chances.

738
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:56,344
You three could make a test.

739
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:58,624
The one with the less fierce inner demon
could go down.

740
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,344
Give me the Mind Stone.

741
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,785
Just put your hands on it,

742
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,344
and you'll know.

743
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,825
Is this crap

744
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,144
that amazing?

745
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:15,305
Take this.

746
00:32:27,785 --> 00:32:28,864
A tiger?

747
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:31,785
So you fear tigers.

748
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:33,184
You understand nothing.

749
00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:34,465
Quit the nonsense.

750
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:35,545
I'll try it.

751
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:51,144
What's wrong?

752
00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:52,785
Tan Feng, what's wrong?

753
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,184
Nothing.

754
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,424
Impossible.

755
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,144
She has no inner demons.

756
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:13,144
How's this possible?

757
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,144
Does that mean

758
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:15,584
I can go down to save Huan Zong?

759
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:16,344
Absolutely not.

760
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:17,344
We don't even know

761
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:17,985
if this works.

762
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:18,825
Even if it works,

763
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:19,624
how would you

764
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:20,624
avoid detection?

765
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:23,184
What are you doing?

766
00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:25,144
Lift the spell.

767
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:26,745
Talk.

768
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:28,424
If you want to go,

769
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,384
there's a path,

770
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,305
the Wuchang River

771
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:33,184
to Puppet Village.

772
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,705
But the riverbanks have low trees.

773
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,505
Flying by sword

774
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:39,424
would expose you.

775
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:40,624
What about a boat?

776
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:41,424
Impossible.

777
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,104
Absolutely not.

778
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:45,225
Boats, rafts...

779
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,705
All vessels don't work.

780
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:47,624
The river's water

781
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:48,785
is extremely

782
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,545
corrosive.

783
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,985
Stone puppets

784
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:53,384
dissolve

785
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,344
within moments

786
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:55,904
in the river.

787
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:57,745
Though we dark cultivator

788
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,785
has spiritual energy

789
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:01,584
to protect us from corrosion,

790
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,144
once you touch the river's water,

791
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,344
guess what'd happen?

792
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:07,424
It's like a thousand insects

793
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:08,904
burrowing through your flesh.

794
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:11,825
I'll go.

795
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,825
These are nothing to me.

796
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:15,024
Wait.

797
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,464
Even if you can enter

798
00:34:16,464 --> 00:34:16,904
undetected,

799
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:17,745
how will you remain

800
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,265
hidden in the village?

801
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:25,305
Come on.

802
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:26,785
There's no such thing

803
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,344
as Concealment Pills.

804
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:29,745
Tan Feng.

805
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:31,384
Stop lying.

806
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:32,705
I know the sect provides

807
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:33,665
Concealment Pills

808
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:35,544
for everyone who goes out for mission.

809
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,344
It can

810
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,384
hide one's presence.

811
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,064
Once taking it,

812
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,344
one can hide

813
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:42,544
his presence.

814
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:43,544
Tan Feng.

815
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,105
You're always out on missions.

816
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:45,904
You must have some.

817
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:47,585
Who told you this?

818
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:49,105
As if it were truth.

819
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:50,504
Stop fooling me

820
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,585
around.

821
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:53,745
I know you have some.

822
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,265
Even if you refuse me,

823
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,864
I'll still go.

824
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:02,504
I know what you are thinking about.

825
00:35:03,464 --> 00:35:04,185
But I couldn't

826
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,064
let you go down there

827
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:06,305
just because

828
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:06,984
he saved you.

829
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:07,904
Tan Feng.

830
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,424
I know you care for me.

831
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:10,544
But...

832
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:12,064
Look,

833
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,185
my cultivation's advanced

834
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:13,825
significantly.

835
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:15,024
And I have spiritual tools

836
00:35:15,024 --> 00:35:15,785
for protection.

837
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:17,064
If you use Concealment Pills,

838
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,344
you can't use spiritual tools.

839
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:19,625
Once spiritual energy used,

840
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:20,625
you'll get exposed.

841
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:22,504
But I'm blessed

842
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,625
with fortune.

843
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:24,424
Forgot it?

844
00:35:24,464 --> 00:35:25,585
Don't worry.

845
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,344
I will be definitely fine.

846
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:29,384
Besides,

847
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:30,504
you and Master taught me

848
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:32,145
since childhood

849
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:32,825
that

850
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:34,904
I have to act
with loyalty and sincerity.

851
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:36,625
Huan Zong took risks saving me.

852
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,145
How could I abandon him

853
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,344
now?

854
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,024
Tan Feng.

855
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,265
Please help me.

856
00:35:46,904 --> 00:35:47,625
Remember.

857
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:49,105
The pill's effect is temporary.

858
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:50,145
Once it expires,

859
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:51,384
go back immediately.

860
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,464
Be swift.

861
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:53,864
Never use spiritual energy.

862
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:55,305
Or you'll get caught.

863
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,344
Understood.

864
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:19,665
Tan Feng, Lin Hu.

865
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:21,424
Wait for my good news.

866
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:23,464
Kong Hou.

867
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:25,904
I...

868
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:29,944
Pity that I'm a demon cultivator,

869
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,705
so I couldn't rescue him myself.

870
00:36:31,904 --> 00:36:32,424
I...

871
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:33,785
Alright.

872
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:35,344
Huan Zong took risks

873
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:36,585
saving me.

874
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,064
No matter what,

875
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:40,145
I must bring him back.

876
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:41,504
Kong Hou.

877
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,625
- Kong Hou.
- Be careful.

878
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,785
Bring Young Master

879
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:23,544
back.

880
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:24,145
Kong Hou,

881
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:25,665
