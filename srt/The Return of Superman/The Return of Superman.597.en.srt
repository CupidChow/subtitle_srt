1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,720
Let's go, Haru.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,350
You were great today.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,649
I just need to feed you. That's it.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,560
I didn't have anything to eat today.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,400
We're at a cool cafe in Gangnam.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,930
Let me have some food here, Haru.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,070
Gosh, this is comfortable.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,510
The back of your hair is puffing up a bit.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,410
It must be because you got your haircut today.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,110
Why don't you sit in your chair now?

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,450
You're melting my heart away.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,220
I'm suddenly in a great mood.

13
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,830
Let me have some food here, Haru.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,230
Gosh, this is comfortable.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,530
The back of your hair is puffing up a bit.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,370
It must be because you got your haircut today.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,110
Why don't you sit in your chair now?

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,380
You look so beautiful.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
Haru, you look amazing.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,190
It was your first haircut today.

21
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,150
It was your first haircut today.

22
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,010
You're melting my heart away.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,570
I'm suddenly in a great mood.

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,350
All right.

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,530
Let me tell you where we are.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,259
Haru.

27
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,170
Before going to my shoot,

28
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,270
I always stop by here.

29
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,400
You will now carry on the family tradition.

30
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,640
You'll be getting your hair done at this hair salon.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,609
My wife carried him for ten months.

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,150
And you saw him when he was born.

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,380
He already had a full head of hair at birth.

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Since then, it's been nine months.

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,410
He's had his birth hair for 19 months.

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,080
But today, he'll get his first haircut.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,750
Let's go.

38
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,660
All right.

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Ta-da. This is the hair salon I come to.

40
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,570
Okay. This is my regular hair salon.

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,670
- Hey. - Hello.

42
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,539
Hey.

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,040
- Hey. - Hello.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,800
He's the first-generation hair master.

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,340
I've been coming here for seven years.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,939
I'm really grateful to him.

47
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,540
This is what he said to his salon crew.

48
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,780
"I think Shim Hyoung Tak will be even more successful later."

49
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,210
"So take good care of him when he comes."

50
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,450
He said that even when we didn't know each other.

51
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,390
That's what he told people.

52
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,950
Like he said, I got married...

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,820
and had a child.

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,560
I thought his foresight was spot-on.

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,160
He's going to cut Haru's hair today.

56
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,870
- Soon Cheol. - Yes.

57
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,999
Let me introduce my son to you.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,309
- Hello, Haru. - This is Shim Haru.

59
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,439
How do you know his name?

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,469
- Hello, Haru. - This is Shim Haru.

61
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,510
How do you know his name?

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,549
Of course, I know. I watched him on TV. I've been watching the show.

63
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,580
- Really? - Yes.

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,280
Haru. Look at this. What is this?

65
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,189
Look at this.

66
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,590
My gosh. His hair is so long.

67
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,119
His hair...

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,829
So he's never had his birth hair cut.

69
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,799
I've been a hairstylist for 30 years.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
I've never seen a baby with such thick hair.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,400
One, two, three, four.

72
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,940
Gosh, my arms feel tired.

73
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,539
- Most times, - Yes.

74
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,279
- birth hair is very thin. - Right.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,310
- They're usually thin like threads. - Okay.

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,480
His hair is almost as thick as a grown-up's.

77
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,659
- Like a college kid? - It's even thicker than mine.

78
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,459
- Really? - I'm serious.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
You...

80
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,999
So there are hair follicles.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
- They're like pores on our scalp. - Yes.

82
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,960
- Each follicle has 2 to 3 strands. - Okay.

83
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,600
Other people might think...

84
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,270
he's wearing a wig.

85
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,999
I sometimes feel that too.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,839
He has the thickest hair. Seriously.

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Really?

88
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:38,839
In a way, his hair became his signature quality.

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,709
- I'll give him a good haircut. - He doesn't cut just anyone's hair.

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,210
I'll make you look really handsome.

91
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,319
- Then... - Okay.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,879
- We must put a gown on him first. - Yes.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,649
- Okay. Let me take off his jacket. - Should we take it off?

94
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,020
- Yes. I do. - Do you need my help?

95
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,359
- Soon Cheol. We're ready. - Okay. This way.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
- Sit right here. - Okay.

97
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,759
Soon Cheol. Why am I wearing a gown too?

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,059
He should sit in the baby chair...

99
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,399
- for the haircut. - Okay.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,270
But as for infants like Haru,

101
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,370
they're not strong enough to keep their head up.

102
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,239
That's why parents also...

103
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,569
- put on a gown... - I see.

104
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,939
and we put the cape on the parents,

105
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,280
so hair doesn't get into their clothes.

106
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,209
That's how we do it. So just like any other parent,

107
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,050
you're wearing the gown and cape.

108
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,979
As for Haru,

109
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,849
- we put a baby gown on him. - Yes.

110
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,520
I'm going to put the cape around him next.

111
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,219
First of all, let's talk about the hairstyle you want for him.

112
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,560
Well,

113
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,160
my wife wants the K-pop idol's hairstyle.

114
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,000
An idol's hairstyle?

115
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,269
When people think of the K-pop idol's hairstyle,

116
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,099
the bangs fall just above their double eyelids,

117
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,900
almost poking their eyes.

118
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,409
- Their bangs look dandy. - Yes.

119
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,380
We call it the leaf cut. It leaves the back hair long...

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,809
- while trimming the sides neatly. - I see.

121
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,550
- That will look great on him. - Okay.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,489
- Let's get started now. - Okay.

123
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,860
Let's give him a haircut now.

124
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,760
What's this for?

125
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,330
We can put it on the mirror.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,270
- Like this? - Or...

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
- I can put it on me. - Like this?

128
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,970
Just like that?

129
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,169
- Like this. - This toy is meant to be attached?

130
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,170
Yes.

131
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,510
- Oh, my. What a unique toy. - I can do this. Yes.

132
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,180
- So he doesn't cry. - I see. It's for that?

133
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,179
- Yes. I can stick it on there. - Can I put it on here?

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,650
- Yes. - He'll look at this. Right?

135
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,050
Look at this.

136
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,090
There's another one here.

137
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,520
- Oh, my. - What's this?

138
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,289
- My gosh. - Yes. Look at his toy.

139
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,490
- It spins, right? - My gosh.

140
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,889
- It spins, doesn't it? - Look at this.

141
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,960
- Look at that. - My gosh.

142
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
- It spins, doesn't it? - Look at this.

143
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,660
- Look at that. - My gosh.

144
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,929
- How fascinating. - Isn't this fascinating?

145
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,970
Look at this.

146
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,970
- Let me cut your hair now. - Look. Grab the back.

147
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,710
- Yes. Spin it here. - Let's cut your hair.

148
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,040
This is the standard order for everyone.

149
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,439
- I'll start with the bangs. - Yes.

150
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,579
- That will be better. - The bangs first?

151
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
- The bangs first. - Yes.

152
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:57,549
Soon Cheol. His birth hair is so precious.

153
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,550
Okay.

154
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,949
- If it's not too much to ask, - Okay.

155
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,990
I'd like to have the honour of cutting the first trim.

156
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,869
- If it's not too much to ask, - Okay.

157
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,570
I'd like to have the honour of cutting the first trim.

158
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,909
- But if you do it wrong, - Okay.

159
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,040
- you know it'd be a disaster. - I know.

160
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,379
- So... - So I couldn't do it at home.

161
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,510
- That's why I'm here. - Right.

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,180
- I can help you cut... - Yes.

163
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,009
a little bit of his back hair.

164
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,049
Okay.

165
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,180
- I'll give you my scissors. - Okay.

166
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,049
- Try it. - I can do this, right?

167
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,120
Of course.

168
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,119
My gosh.

169
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,090
Make sure to cut his hair, not your finger.

170
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,390
Okay?

171
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,430
All right, Soon Cheol.

172
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,060
- Haru seems to be in a good mood. - Okay.

173
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,399
This is our chance then.

174
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,430
So...

175
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,100
Hold on.

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,600
- Tie it up with a band. - Okay. Right here.

177
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,239
- I'm going... - I'll cut that then.

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,609
- Look over here. - Yes.

179
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,939
This is the longest part.

180
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,240
- Grab it here. - Okay.

181
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,949
- Grab it and cut it here. - Right above the band.

182
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,210
- Right above the band. - Okay.

183
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,020
- Got it? - Yes.

184
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,950
- Like this. Cut it here. - Okay.

185
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,490
I got it.

186
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,759
- Do a good job. - Okay.

187
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,159
My gosh. Then hold his arms like this.

188
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,560
- Okay. Like this. - Yes.

189
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,300
What's this?

190
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,769
- No. - What's this?

191
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,099
- No. - What's this?

192
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,940
- It's nothing. - No.

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,570
What's this?

194
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,940
Let me tie up your hair. Come here.

195
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,350
All right. Let me tie up your hair.

196
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,149
- No. - What's this?

197
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,860
- It's nothing. - It's nothing.

198
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,520
What's this? There.

199
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,770
Let me see. Gosh, you're so handsome.

200
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,140
What is this?

201
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,909
What's that?

202
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,539
- No. - What's this?

203
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,579
- It's nothing. - It's nothing.

204
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,810
It's nothing. What's this?

205
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,890
There. Oh, no.

206
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,660
Oh, no.

207
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,230
What's that?

208
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,629
What's that?

209
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,699
What is it?

210
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,959
What is it? Try it. It's tasty.

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,930
Here you go. Isn't it tasty?

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,340
What is it? Try it. It's tasty.

213
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,570
- This is... My gosh. - What's this?

214
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,340
- Is it tasty? - The band keeps getting loose.

215
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,910
What's this?

216
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,349
- Is it good? - Yes. Higher.

217
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,250
- Is this good? - Yes.

218
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,750
Cut it higher. Don't cut your finger.

219
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,350
This is crazy.

220
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,090
- This is... My gosh. - What's this?

221
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,920
What is this? Haru, go on.

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,720
Isn't it tasty?

223
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,460
Isn't it tasty?

224
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,130
What's this? Look.

225
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,010
What's this? Look.

226
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,350
That's tasty too?

227
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,920
That's tasty too?

228
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,089
- I did it. Yes. - You did it.

229
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,289
You cut it.

230
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,920
- Gosh, I think I did a bad job. - What's that?

231
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,359
What's this?

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,929
There's another one.

233
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,160
What's this?

234
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,800
Look at this.

235
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,070
What's this?

236
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,900
Is this a helicopter?

237
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,770
What's this?

238
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,570
- Isn't this fascinating? - Gosh, I did it.

239
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,010
- I did it. - You did a good job.

240
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,240
- Look at your cut. - Gosh. I don't know.

241
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,049
- The first trim. - Gosh. That's so precious.

242
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,280
- This is a valuable memory. Right? - Yes.

243
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,850
Thank you so much. Let me wrap this precious hair up.

244
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,360
- You must keep it. - Maybe, I did a bad job.

245
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,659
- No, it's okay. - My gosh.

246
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
- I can totally work with this. - Are you sure?

247
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,590
- I can take it from here. - Okay.

248
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,400
- I'll start now. - Now...

249
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,959
Look at this. What's this?

250
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll hold him tightly.

251
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,700
What's this?

252
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,240
- What's this? - Look.

253
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,470
What's this, Haru?

254
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,010
How interesting, right?

255
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,780
You're doing a great job.

256
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,510
- You know? You're so good, Haru. - You're great.

257
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,049
It's so hard to give a haircut to a baby.

258
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,319
Of course, it's really hard.

259
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,319
This haircut requires three people.

260
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,449
- I had a customer yesterday. - Yes.

261
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,690
- A parent came with a baby. - Okay.

262
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,319
- The baby cried so much. - Okay.

263
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,659
They had to leave, halfway through.

264
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,059
- Really? - For real.

265
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,929
- Haru is doing a good job then. - He's doing a great job.

266
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,460
- Okay. - He's great.

267
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,569
- Gosh, look at this cutie pie. - Gosh.

268
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,870
- Gosh, we're done with the bangs. - Look.

269
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,539
I can see your eyes now. Look.

270
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,940
- Let me see. - You can see better, right?

271
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,239
- Look. Just his eyes... - How cute.

272
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,780
How beautiful.

273
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,810
- He's so cute. - He's adorable.

274
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,919
- He looks great. - I knew you could do it.

275
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,580
- How beautiful. - Yes.

276
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,989
- He's so adorable. - How beautiful.

277
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,189
- How cute. - You look great.

278
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,720
- It's your 30-year career. - How cute.

279
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,590
- My gosh. You look great. - Gosh. My son...

280
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,230
Okay. Let me remove the hair.

281
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,499
- What's that? - What is this?

282
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,829
Okay. Let me remove the hair.

283
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,830
- What's that? - What is this?

284
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,070
- What's that? - What is this?

285
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,630
How soft.

286
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,399
- What's that? - What is this?

287
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,110
- It's a sponge. - It's a sponge.

288
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,209
- Fascinated? - Gosh, it's interesting.

289
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,779
- Is it interesting? - I see.

290
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,439
- Let me cut your side hair now. - Yes.

291
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,609
Okay. Let's begin.

292
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,849
- His side hair. - Okay.

293
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,009
- Look ahead. - Look at this.

294
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,449
- What's this? - What is this?

295
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,390
- What's this? - What is this?

296
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,690
I think it looks like a sunflower.

297
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,889
All right. Look at this.

298
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,130
- Gosh, I cut it. - Oh, my.

299
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,830
- Gosh, that's a lot. - All right.

300
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,030
- Gosh, that's a lot. - All right.

301
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,140
My gosh. Seriously. This is no joke.

302
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,980
- Peekaboo. - You're wonderful.

303
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,849
- Haru, you're great. - Haru is feeling great.

304
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,519
- Here. - Haru, you're doing a great job.

305
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,860
- Haru, look at this. - You're doing a great job.

306
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,319
He must look the other way now.

307
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,290
- Look over here. - That way.

308
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,759
- Look at that. - What's this?

309
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,859
- What's this sound? - Look.

310
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,059
- Look the other way around. - My gosh.

311
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,530
- Look at this, Haru. - Look over there.

312
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,829
- Haru. What's this? - Look at this.

313
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,899
- What's this sound? - Look at this.

314
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,399
- Yes. That's more like it. - Look at this.

315
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,100
- There you go. - Yes. All right.

316
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,370
It's spinning.

317
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,080
What's this?

318
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,809
- I'm done cutting the sides. - How...

319
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,979
How far along are we with the haircut?

320
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,779
- I'd say from 50 to 70 percent. - About 70 percent?

321
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,079
I'm done cutting this part of his hair.

322
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,550
- I just need to cut the back hair. - Okay.

323
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,949
- Here's what I'm going to do. - Okay.

324
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,419
- It's better if he looks ahead. - Okay.

325
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,589
Just hold him like this.

326
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,460
- Whose hair is this? - Your son's.

327
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,860
My gosh.

328
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,009
- I can cut his hair like this. - Really?

329
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,080
- Yes. - Okay.

330
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,440
- Look. - Okay.

331
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,510
Oh, beautiful days

332
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,320
My lovely Haru

333
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,850
Haru

334
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,260
A caterpillar came to say hello. He came over.

335
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,390
Oh, it's a caterpillar.

336
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,859
One, two.

337
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,130
- What's that? - One, two.

338
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,130
- What's this? - What is that?

339
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,599
It's raining, right?

340
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,700
Look at this.

341
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,010
- It's raining, the music is playing - Look at this, Haru.

342
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,739
- What is that? - Doesn't this feel cool?

343
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,079
- Should we try it? It's cool. - Is the water cool?

344
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,539
- I think of you - What's so cool?

345
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,750
It's cool, right?

346
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,080
Which is more interesting for you, Haru?

347
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,620
- Which one is more interesting? - What's this?

348
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,650
Which one is more fun for you, Haru?

349
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,689
Wait. Who's this?

350
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,430
Who is this handsome boy?

351
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,229
- Gosh, this is great. - Doesn't he look very handsome?

352
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,100
- This is wonderful. - Doesn't he look so cool?

353
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,839
Because you have to cut it from a higher angle,

354
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
you have to bend over, right?

355
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,210
- Oh, my back. - You're so professional.

356
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,980
- We're almost done. - Bending over...

357
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,719
- Let's stand up now. - Okay.

358
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,249
You have to put him in your arms, so he's looking over your shoulders.

359
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,989
- Over my shoulders? Okay. I got it. - Yes.

360
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,559
- Distract him with the toy. - Okay.

361
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,090
- I know what I have to do now. - Right?

362
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,430
- What's this? - Wait.

363
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,030
What am I, a big foot? What's this?

364
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,969
I think you're sweating more than your son.

365
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,069
Right. I'm sweating like a pig.

366
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,139
Haru, how about an airplane ride?

367
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,770
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

368
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,410
Gosh, you're amazing.

369
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,450
- We're almost done. A little more. - Look at this. It's another friend.

370
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,720
- What's this? - Look over here.

371
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,830
Great.

372
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
My arms are about to fall off.

373
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,970
I'm almost done.

374
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,939
The bee is back!

375
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,769
I finished. He's done with his haircut.

376
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,870
Gosh, what...

377
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,940
What's with this mess, Soon Cheol?

378
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,709
- It's... - This...

379
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,179
Look at the heap of his hair.

380
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Look at this. This is...

381
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Look. It's thicker than my hair.

382
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,190
I can't believe this.

383
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,020
- Isn't this crazy? Look. - Gosh, this is crazy.

384
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,219
Only the top one percent of babies can have this thick hair.

385
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,689
- It's super thick. - This is just crazy.

386
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,059
Only the top one percent of babies can have this thick hair.

387
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,560
- That's it. - Haru's thick hair.

388
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,330
- And then... - Okay.

389
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,930
- let me remove the cape. - Okay.

390
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,870
- Let's go to the shampoo chair. - Great.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,140
- Put his head on here. - Okay.

392
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,910
Will he cry?

393
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,810
- What's this? - Peekaboo.

394
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,350
Rice snacks.

395
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,850
Doesn't it feel cool?

396
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,920
- Even a baby can use this chair. - Of course.

397
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,159
I've never seen a baby as calm as this one.

398
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,389
- Really? - I've never seen a baby like him.

399
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,790
- I'm not trying to flatter you. - Okay.

400
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,330
When parents bring babies here for a haircut,

401
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,700
so many of them give up because they cry so much.

402
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,330
It's rare for me to finish a haircut like this.

403
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,000
This is just like...

404
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,570
What's that called?

405
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
- What do you call that? - He's pure?

406
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,810
- No. It's... - He's pure?

407
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
- No. It's... - He's pure?

408
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,619
- No. It's... - He's pure?

409
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
He should get a Nobel Prize for this.

410
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,050
He should get a Nobel Prize for this.

411
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,120
Really?

412
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,620
- The Baby Nobel Peace Prize. - For being a baby angel?

413
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Great!

414
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,950
I'd rather

415
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,490
- The Nobel Prize? - He should get one.

416
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,120
All right. Let me wash your hair.

417
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,160
- Right. - Sir.

418
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,090
- Doesn't it feel good? - You're here.

419
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,530
It's over now.

420
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,330
Haru.

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,300
- Let me dry his hair. - Okay.

422
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,670
- His hair puffs up a lot. - Yes.

423
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,440
I was shocked when I watched your show.

424
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,980
You have a standing hair dryer.

425
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,509
- Yes, I do. - But there's a downside to that.

426
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,149
If you dry his hair with the standing hair dryer,

427
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,749
it will be dishevelled.

428
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,019
- Right. That does happen. - So...

429
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,790
- I call it the Pineapple Hair. - Right. You can't let that happen.

430
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,159
When you're drying his hair,

431
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,999
always blow from above. That way, his hair won't puff up.

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,869
- Use cool air from above. - Okay.

433
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,429
- Like this. Use cool air. - And use cool air?

434
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,599
Don't dry it with hot air.

435
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,840
But he's only nine months old. Is that necessary?

436
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,409
But it's as thick as an adult's.

437
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,139
- Grown-ups dry their hair. Right? - Yes.

438
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,409
- So don't use hot air. - Okay.

439
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,150
- I got it. - Use cool air like this.

440
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,380
Doesn't it feel cool? Why does it feel so cool?

441
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,349
- Doesn't it feel cool? - His hair...

442
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,619
- I need a helper here. - Yes.

443
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,160
- He has a lot of hair. - He has a lot of hair?

444
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,489
- He has a lot of hair. - He has a lot of hair?

445
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,290
The two of us will dry your hair, sir.

446
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,900
The two of us will dry your hair, sir.

447
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Please use cool air.

448
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Use cool air to dry his hair.

449
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,699
- Why does it feel so cool? - This is nice.

450
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,970
Right? Gosh, this is nice and cool.

451
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,880
Oh, this must feel so cool. How beautiful you look.

452
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,420
Doesn't it feel so cool?

453
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,090
It feels cool, doesn't it?

454
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,120
I can't believe this.

455
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,760
I don't even get two hairstylists when I get my hair dried.

456
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,060
It feels cool, right?

457
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,600
Haru, you're a star.

458
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,669
I'm so envious of his hair.

459
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,130
I envy you, Haru. I truly do.

460
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,800
You'll never have to worry about hair loss.

461
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,269
- Not about hair loss. - Right. Not about that.

462
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,209
- Don't worry about hair loss. - No.

463
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,410
Never.

464
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,839
- He's such a sweet boy. - Right.

465
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,809
- I love it. - He is?

466
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,120
He's the sweetest.

467
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,920
- I love this kind of compliment. - What a sweet boy you are.

468
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,220
- This is good. We can stop here. - Okay.

469
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,190
How beautiful!

470
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,020
He's such a sweet boy.

471
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,460
I'm going to apply a styling product on your hair.

472
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,459
- A styling product? - You bet.

473
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,800
- Just a little bit. - Okay.

474
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,129
Who would get to style a nine-month-old baby's hair?

475
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,139
- A nine-month-old baby... - They need to have decent hair.

476
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,270
- Right. They'll need hair first. - They need to have decent hair.

477
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,970
How could I style their hair if they don't have any hair?

478
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,980
I'll make you look like a member of BTS.

479
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,280
- Good for you. - Okay?

480
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,549
Is that the hair essence...

481
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,980
- Yes. - good for the scalp?

482
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,680
I give him a wet look.

483
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,720
So he looks sexy.

484
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,520
Sexy? He's nine months old.

485
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,589
- A nine-month-old can look sexy. - Of course.

486
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,490
The hairstyle can make him look sexy.

487
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,400
Now... My gosh.

488
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,970
He still looks so cute even after the haircut.

489
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,199
- He's just cute. Period. - Of course.

490
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
His hair had nothing to do with that.

491
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,369
- It's all about his face. - Yes.

492
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,569
He's got a handsome face.

493
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,870
Seriously. You already looked so handsome. I didn't do much.

494
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,880
- I didn't do much. - Gosh, no.

495
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,680
How beautiful you look. It's over.

496
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,850
How beautiful.

497
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,220
I did wonder if it was his hair that made him look so cute.

498
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,650
But I was wrong.

499
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,620
It was all thanks to his face.

500
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,160
Haru can pull off any hairstyle.

501
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,690
That boosted my confidence.

502
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,830
I realised that Haru looked so beautiful...

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,470
and handsome.

504
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,940
I need to try out different hairstyles from now on.

505
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,570
- How beautiful. - Your hair got short.

506
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,339
Who's that?

507
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,540
You look like a prince.

508
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,880
Which kingdom do you reign over?

509
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,950
- He looks so beautiful. - He does, doesn't he?

510
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,149
Gosh, you look so beautiful.

511
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,719
- You look like an idol star. - Yes. He's an idol star. Right?

512
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,619
- Gosh. He's super handsome. - My gosh. He's so handsome.

513
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,690
Right?

514
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,290
- Make sure to take it. - Okay. Thank you.

515
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,029
- Thank you for today. - Thank you.

516
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,399
- Say goodbye to him. - Bye, Haru.

517
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,130
- Bye. - Bye.

518
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,530
I can use your hair generously, Haru.

519
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,710
It's called framing the birth hair.

520
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,610
I'll frame his birth hair from his first haircut.

521
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,020
My wife drew this. She's so talented, isn't she?

522
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,040
He had pineapple hair when he first appeared on the show.

523
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,059
Let's go.

524
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,560
Haru, you did great today.

525
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,229
You're the only one who ate. That's not okay.

526
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,170
I haven't eaten anything today.

527
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,300
Let me eat something at a nice cafe in Gangnam, Haru.

528
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,210
Since Haru had his hair cut...

529
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,910
and got it styled nicely,

530
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,010
I didn't want to go straight home.

531
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,820
I wanted to enjoy a date with my son.

532
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,419
It was my first time going to the area with my son.

533
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,960
So I wanted to visit a trendy place.

534
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,030
Haru.

535
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,340
We're making a lot of good memories.

536
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,540
I can't believe I'm eating with you out on the terrace.

537
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,340
I'm so happy.

538
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,250
- Here's your food. - Thank you.

539
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,020
Oh, my. Thank you.

540
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,770
I haven't eaten anything. I'm telling you the truth.

541
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,910
Haru, you can eat this.

542
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,820
I will have three meals today.

543
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,850
I'll have three different dishes at once.

544
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,620
It looks so good.

545
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,530
Look at this.

546
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,700
Look at this.

547
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,160
You know what guys do when they meet.

548
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,589
They come to Gangnam to have their hair cut...

549
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,530
and then eat some food together, just as we do now.

550
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,100
That's what guys do.

551
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,400
When you grow up, let's eat a lot of spicy food together.

552
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,140
It looks spicy even at a glance, isn't it?

553
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,540
All right. One bite for me.

554
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,770
One bite for you.

555
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,550
The food is really good here.

556
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,630
Look at this waffle.

557
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,339
Haru, the thing about this neighbourhood...

558
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,910
I used to come here to do modelling work.

559
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,980
This is called Rodeo Street.

560
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,119
I pursue my own unique fashion style...

561
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,229
that can differentiate me from others.

562
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,460
I did it because it's pretty and unique.

563
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,780
But seeing you off makes me feel like something's missing.

564
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,350
I used to go to a cafe in this neighbourhood.

565
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,649
There were Bodyguard 1, 2, and 3,

566
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,120
as far as I remember.

567
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,160
In Bodyguard, there was a phone on each table.

568
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,040
So I sat at a table...

569
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,370
and waited for a call when I needed to.

570
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,840
I also made some calls and then put the phone down.

571
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,779
And there's more.

572
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,150
We got free refills of coffee.

573
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,020
The waiter would come to my table with a coffee pot...

574
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,720
and pour some more coffee.

575
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,919
I would stay in the cafe...

576
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,190
for 3 or 4 hours and drink 4 or 5 cups of coffee.

577
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,230
It felt like a waste of money if I had just one cup of coffee.

578
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,140
I can't believe I came here with you.

579
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,750
- Haru? - Can we say hi to him?

580
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,120
- Excuse me. - Can we go and say hi to Haru?

581
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
- Hi. How old is your baby? - She's five months old.

582
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,660
- Yes. Is your baby a girl? - Yes.

583
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,160
- Do you want to say hi? - Hi.

584
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,710
Haru, she's the same age as you.

585
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,410
Say hi to your friend.

586
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,410
You can't eat it yet, right?

587
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,720
- He's so gorgeous. - Thank you.

588
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,520
- He's beautiful. - He has such big eyes.

589
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,020
He also has double eyelids. He's gorgeous.

590
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,260
- He's so gorgeous. - Thank you.

591
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,029
Haru is only four months older than her,

592
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,499
- but the difference is quite big. - Exactly.

593
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,010
- He has a lot more hair than her. - Oh, the hair?

594
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,880
- He got his hair trimmed earlier. - I see.

595
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,480
She reminds me of Haru when he was at her age.

596
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,750
I'm reminded of Haru when he was five months old.

597
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,219
Her teeth are about to come out.

598
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
- Is that so? - Yes.

599
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,789
Her gums must itch. She chews on her teething toy a lot.

600
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,620
- Now? - Yes, she does that now.

601
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,289
As a parent with more experience, I'd like to give you advice.

602
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,159
- Prepare several teething toys. - Really?

603
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,229
Yes, get her all types.

604
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,429
- Do they have different uses? - Here's why.

605
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,400
She could get tired of the toy if she has only one type.

606
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,669
So you should get several types and let her enjoy all of them.

607
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,470
Then she won't whine in her stroller.

608
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,270
You need several types of them.

609
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,780
You need several types of them.

610
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,449
- We'll get several teething toys. - Yes, get all types of them.

611
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,920
You're the parenting master for a reason.

612
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,820
I'm not that good.

613
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,519
Guess what I'm happy about these days.

614
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,290
- Many couples with one baby... - Yes?

615
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,929
plan to have another one.

616
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,229
- Us too. - We'll have another one.

617
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,230
- You will, right? - Yes.

618
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:33,330
Us too.

619
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,269
Right? We plan to have three kids.

620
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,430
- Three kids? - Does your wife want that too?

621
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,139
Does your wife want that too?

622
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,139
- She wanted 4 kids, but I said no. - She wanted 4 kids?

623
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,440
I convinced her to have three kids.

624
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,910
Okay.

625
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Good luck.

626
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,780
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

627
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,620
Thank you for making a good memory with us.

628
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,390
The baby whom we just met...

629
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,460
reminded me of you when you were younger.

630
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,490
It's not that long ago since it's four months ago.

631
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,700
Is it good? Oh, it is, right?

632
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,210
I'm reminded of those days when you couldn't do anything.

633
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,240
But now...

634
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,180
When I give you popped rice,

635
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,580
you eat it well by yourself.

636
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,720
Now that you've grown,

637
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,120
there are so many things we can do together.

638
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,159
Really.

639
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,490
I became so happy.

640
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,960
How about we clink?

641
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Cheers.

642
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,570
Let's try many more things together.

643
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,689
- Congratulate your mom. - Mom.

644
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,719
Jung Woo.

645
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,390
- Mom. - Jung Woo.

646
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,090
How much did you miss me?

647
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,700
How much did you miss me?

648
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,700
How do I look?

649
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,530
How do I look?

650
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,249
- How do I look with this? - You look pretty.

651
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,380
- How do I look? - Does she look pretty?

652
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,519
- You look pretty. - Does she look pretty?

653
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You look pretty.

654
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:37,890
Princess!

655
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,960
My prince, come here.

656
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,860
Princess.

657
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,660
My dear princess.

658
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,770
Since you're a princess, honey,

659
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,269
I'll give you the Woo Brothers Aesthetic Treatment.

660
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,700
- Mom, put this on. - Come and lie down here.

661
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,270
Really?

662
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,439
Is it Kim Jun Ho Aesthetic Clinic?

663
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Yes.

664
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,980
But why are you doing this for me suddenly?

665
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,610
Because today is your birthday, I'll make it the best day ever.

666
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,480
Jung Woo and my birthdays are in May.

667
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,650
And my wife and Eun Woo's birthdays are in October.

668
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,620
- Go for it. - Ta-da.

669
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,630
- What? - Ta-da.

670
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,930
There. This is your gift.

671
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,330
You're the only one who celebrates my birthday.

672
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,900
Just for today,

673
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,970
I'll treat her like a princess.

674
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,190
There are many jjajangmyeon restaurants that you like.

675
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,620
- Brother. - Brother.

676
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,290
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

677
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,970
Here it is!

678
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,490
What colour is that?

679
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,890
Look at that.

680
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll give you the Woo Brothers aesthetic treatment.

681
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,000
Here.

682
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
- The skin... - How did you know how to use that?

683
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,670
Stay still.

684
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,369
The children received the treatment from me.

685
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,270
- Do it on me too. - Okay.

686
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,680
If you apply this,

687
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,580
your skin will glow.

688
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,410
You also have to apply this.

689
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,520
When you apply the cream as well,

690
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,719
your skin will become firm...

691
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,719
and elastic.

692
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,790
Okay.

693
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,290
I also want to apply the cream.

694
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,929
You can do it.

695
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,060
Do you want to do it as well?

696
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,170
That's right. Rub it on her neck.

697
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,910
You have to do it well on the neck.

698
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,180
Right.

699
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,180
Our first son is applying a generous amount.

700
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,220
I'll give you a gift, Eun Woo.

701
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,360
The skin is red here.

702
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,960
It can be calmed with a soothing gel.

703
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,560
This is the last one.

704
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,099
Do it for Mom.

705
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,270
Apply it on Mom.

706
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,710
There are three therapists here.

707
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,409
It feels like I've come to a skin care salon.

708
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,110
- How is it? Are you satisfied? - I'm very satisfied.

709
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,650
Your skin did improve.

710
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,920
All you did was apply them in order.

711
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,490
Okay.

712
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,260
It's done.

713
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,930
You can get up and check.

714
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,930
- I look prettier. - Mom looks prettier, right?

715
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,029
- Let me see. - You look younger.

716
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,370
You look pure and young.

717
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,369
It's not easy to take care of my skin...

718
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,070
while taking care of the kids.

719
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,339
But this is simple and effective,

720
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,470
so I keep using it.

721
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,040
You look pretty, Mom.

722
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,550
You look pretty, Mom.

723
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:23,709
- Really? - Is Mom pretty?

724
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,580
- You're pretty, Mom. - Really?

725
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,290
I think Eun Woo and Jung Woo are the prettiest.

726
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,420
Kiss.

727
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,160
What about Dad?

728
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,060
What about Dad?

729
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,799
- Who is Mom today? - Princess.

730
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,200
- She's a princess. - Princess.

731
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,440
It's the princess's birthday today.

732
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,310
Shall we go out and have fun with her?

733
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,009
Let's go, Princess.

734
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,710
- Let's go. - Let's go.

735
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,350
You have to take care of your brother well, Eun Woo.

736
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,520
Bye.

737
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,260
If you want to eat or buy something, just say it.

738
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,260
You're really good, Eun Woo.

739
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,600
Well done, Eun Woo.

740
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,429
I travelled with the Woo Brothers a lot...

741
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,940
in spring, summer, fall, and winter,

742
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,970
but my wife couldn't be with us.

743
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,540
Mom would have really loved to watch this. Isn't that right?

744
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,210
Right?

745
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,809
It was my wife's birthday as well.

746
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,180
So I'm planning to go on a family outing...

747
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,920
to Incheon.

748
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,530
Where are the seagulls going?

749
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:50,569
- Look at the colour. - It's so pretty.

750
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,000
Fall leaves.

751
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,169
It's going to move now.

752
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,739
- It's going to move. - Let's go!

753
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,010
That's right! Let's go.

754
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,650
That's right! Let's go.

755
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,650
Is it Jung Woo's first time riding a train?

756
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,150
- Ship. - Ship.

757
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,060
- Ship. - Ship.

758
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,130
- It's a really big ship. - It is.

759
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,899
- Sea. It's the sea. - It's the sea.

760
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,170
- Sea. It's the sea. - It's the sea.

761
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,340
Sea. It's the sea.

762
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,209
There's a white ship passing by here.

763
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,280
That's right.

764
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,749
There's a very long ship in black and red.

765
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,380
It's very long, right?

766
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,890
- Look at that. It's the sea. - It's the sea.

767
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,320
- It's the sea. - It's the sea.

768
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,930
What do we do if the train falls into the sea?

769
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,470
What do we do if the train falls into the sea?

770
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,800
What do we do if the train falls into the sea?

771
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,970
It's going to the sea.

772
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,380
What do we do if the train falls into the sea?

773
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,050
What do we do if the train falls into the sea?

774
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,720
If the train falls into the sea,

775
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,520
I'll save you all. Don't worry.

776
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,530
You're like the subway train driver.

777
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,530
It really looks like you're driving it.

778
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,500
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

779
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,539
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

780
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,340
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

781
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,180
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

782
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,110
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

783
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,880
I think it would feel great if the train flew to the sky.

784
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,719
I think he's imagining that...

785
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
because it's up in the air.

786
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,830
It turned red here.

787
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,599
The trees turned red.

788
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,700
The trees turned red.

789
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,269
It turned red here.

790
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,840
There's a red tree.

791
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,039
Yellow tree! Yellow tree.

792
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
That's right.

793
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,410
Yellow tree!

794
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,050
- Yellow tree. - That's right.

795
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,549
Why are you frowning?

796
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,190
- Why are you so serious? - You should smile.

797
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,560
- Talk with a smile. - There's a yellow tree.

798
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,890
You can't see fall foliage because of the weather these days.

799
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,829
- It turned red here. - It's red...

800
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,030
and yellow.

801
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,000
What colour of tree do you like?

802
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,939
This one...

803
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,109
- You like them all? - and this one.

804
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,239
I like them all.

805
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,410
- You like them all. - You like them all?

806
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,779
I like them all.

807
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,110
- You like them all. - You like them all?

808
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,550
It's really big.

809
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,080
Goodness, it's big?

810
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,549
I want to ride it.

811
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,550
It's tough?

812
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,059
- Gift. - Seoul?

813
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,690
- Gift. - Gift?

814
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,630
- There's a railway here too. - The railway.

815
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,230
That's the railway. Do you see that?

816
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,470
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

817
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,770
What do we do if the train flies to the sky?

818
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,709
There are many trees.

819
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,470
- There are many trees, right? - There are many trees.

820
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,679
There's a red tree there. Do you see the red tree?

821
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,810
Red, yellow.

822
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,449
Do you remember when we took a train...

823
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,920
to see the cherry blossoms?

824
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,760
Look at me too. Don't just look outside the window.

825
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,730
Look over there. One, two, three.

826
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,599
Are you doing okay?

827
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,270
- I'm on my way. - You should have come.

828
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,870
I'll capture everything.

829
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,739
Do you remember?

830
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,210
- I don't. - You don't?

831
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,479
Jung Woo wasn't there back then.

832
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,149
- Right. - Jung Woo...

833
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,149
We said we should come again with Mom.

834
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,320
We're really here after so many years.

835
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,819
We came to see the fall foliage...

836
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,019
- instead of the cherry blossom. - That's right.

837
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,190
- Isn't that right? - Right.

838
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,120
Please take a picture of Mom.

839
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,690
Together.

840
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,800
Together.

841
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,700
All right. My baby boy.

842
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,630
Jung Woo is posing.

843
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,399
Say, "I love you, here's my heart."

844
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
Look at the camera.

845
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,310
I love you, here's my heart.

846
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,840
I love you, here's my heart.

847
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,210
That's right. Nice.

848
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,880
He took a picture.

849
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,590
Heart!

850
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,889
Which is more fun? The three of us travelling,

851
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,330
or all four with Mom?

852
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,499
- The four of us with Mom. - See?

853
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,299
- The four of us with Mom. - See?

854
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,370
Okay.

855
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,900
It's a really big ship.

856
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,540
No.

857
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,340
- A bird. - I'm...

858
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,850
Why does Jung Woo look like a child?

859
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,379
If you look at him like this, Jung Woo has grown up a lot.

860
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,349
- I know, right? - He's grown big.

861
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,489
His back looks like a child's. He used to be a baby.

862
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,990
Eun Woo looks like an elementary school child.

863
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,529
They'll continue to grow big, right?

864
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,560
That's right.

865
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,530
They'll become as big as you.

866
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,030
They'll be so dependable.

867
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:25,570
They'll be so dependable.

868
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,610
- How cute! - He's cute, right?

869
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,510
I'll give you a hug.

870
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,280
Baby, my baby.

871
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,000
Jung Woo.

872
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,839
Jung Woo, ride it gently. There you go.

873
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,010
Do you like it? Jung Woo is something else.

874
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,249
He's in the top one percent.

875
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,320
Good.

876
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,920
If it's this one, wink.

877
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,920
Okay. It must be this one.

878
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,660
I love you. Heart.

879
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,000
- I love you. Heart. - I didn't tell you to say that.

880
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,699
Jung Woo.

881
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,440
We're here.

882
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,069
Mom, is it fun?

883
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,710
It's fun. It's very fun to ride it with you and Jung Woo.

884
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,650
Mom, happy birthday.

885
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,850
Mom, happy birthday.

886
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,220
- Mom, happy birthday. - Thank you.

887
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,290
- Mom, happy birthday. - Thank you.

888
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,370
- Thank you. - Jung Woo, you too.

889
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,700
- Bye. - Bye.

890
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,310
Let's go. Let's move on to the next course.

891
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,340
The entire street is red.

892
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,080
Kids, isn't it really fancy?

893
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,980
I feel like I'm actually in China.

894
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,720
It's a place that's special to me and my wife,

895
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,050
Incheon Chinatown.

896
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,029
When my wife worked in Incheon,

897
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,760
he visited Chinatown often for dates.

898
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:35,899
Since Jun Ho couldn't leave the training center freely,

899
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,900
I had to travel to see him.

900
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,610
After the flight, I picked him up at the training center...

901
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,470
and dropped him off at home.

902
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,279
It's about 140km to the Jincheon National Training Center.

903
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,050
I did that for about three years.

904
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,179
He won...

905
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,250
- two medals. - Yes.

906
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,589
To celebrate my wife's birthday,

907
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:01,120
we revisited the place as a family of four.

908
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,149
It's said...

909
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,620
that Chinatown has two brothers who are martial arts masters.

910
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,850
He's a martial arts master with sharp eyes.

911
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,930
He's mischievous and lazy.

912
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,970
The two brothers set out to view the martial arts world.

913
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,839
They'll turn over a new leaf...

914
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,170
and take over the martial arts world.

915
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,810
- Big brother. - Big brother.

916
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,850
Look at this.

917
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,690
One, two, three. Ta-da.

918
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,920
- One, two, three. - Two, three. Ta-da.

919
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,529
One, two, three. Ta-da.

920
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,330
- One, two, three. - Two, three. Ta-da.

921
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,300
Make a heart.

922
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,080
- There's so much food to eat. - I know.

923
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,420
Eun Woo, many places serve your favourite dish, jjajangmyeon.

924
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,480
There are so many jjajangmyeon places.

925
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,190
Eun Woo and Jung Woo will eat jjajangmyeon as much as they want.

926
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,490
Jung Woo, there is your favourite dish, dumplings.

927
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,300
This one and this one.

928
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,070
Look at this. These dumplings are green.

929
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,100
- I'll eat all of them. - Will you eat all of them?

930
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,869
I'll eat all of them.

931
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,400
- Will you eat all of them? - Yes.

932
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,510
- Hello. - Hello.

933
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,110
Let's eat one.

934
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,549
Here you go.

935
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,650
Thank you.

936
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,420
Thank you.

937
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,830
- Here you go. - Thank you.

938
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:23,970
Say, "Please give me one."

939
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,940
- Here you go. - Thank you.

940
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,310
Thank you.

941
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,180
- Big brother. - Big brother.

942
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,449
How cute!

943
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,050
- Big brother. - Big brother.

944
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:39,980
Thank you.

945
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,350
Thank you.

946
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,690
- Say, "Big brother." - Big brother.

947
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,020
Eun Woo, it's your turn.

948
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,359
"Big brother" was so cute.

949
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,600
Say, "Thank you."

950
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,200
Shall we go and eat?

951
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,010
We came here back in the day, right?

952
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,780
I think so.

953
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,350
You sound unsure.

954
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,050
You sound unsure.

955
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,020
- You have something on your mouth. - Where?

956
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,160
- Since when did I have it? - Stay still.

957
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,230
- Is it a crumb? - Yes.

958
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,610
Let's go and eat.

959
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,480
- Let's go. - Let's eat something tastier.

960
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,010
Let's eat jjajangmyeon.

961
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,780
It's shrimp.

962
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,280
Ta-da.

963
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,889
Ta-da.

964
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:23,950
What's that?

965
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,190
What's that?

966
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,390
To celebrate my wife's birthday,

967
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,230
I prepared a special present for my wife.

968
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,300
What's this?

969
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,899
"You're the one and only flower of the Ho Woo Kingdom."

970
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,440
"Princess Yoo Jung Hyun, happy birthday."

971
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,970
A round of applause.

972
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,740
It's fascinating. Shall I show you or not?

973
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,410
- Do you pop it? - Shall I show you or not?

974
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,050
- Show me. - Shall I show you?

975
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,120
Show me a cute act.

976
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,490
Show me a cute act.

977
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:05,030
All right. Make sure you pop it. Aim well.

978
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,960
Get ready. Do it on the count of three.

979
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,100
- One, - One,

980
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,900
- two, - two...

981
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,240
- three. - Three.

982
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,440
- Three. - Three.

983
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,040
- Three. - Three.

984
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,950
I used to prepare a present every year.

985
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,380
For Jung Hyun.

986
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,189
Time passes fast.

987
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:34,220
Honey, take a seat.

988
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,130
- I love you. - Drive safely.

989
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,929
What's this? Thank you, honey.

990
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,240
- Enjoy it. - I really like it.

991
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,200
I prepared cash...

992
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,240
so that she could buy what she wanted.

993
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,410
I prepared a cash bouquet.

994
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,180
It's cash!

995
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,180
A round of applause. Kids, this is mine.

996
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,050
It's nice.

997
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,459
- How did you prepare this? - What's that?

998
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,860
Isn't it what you like the most?

999
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:09,990
You're right.

1000
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,429
Thank you for the birthday present.

1001
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,460
Okay.

1002
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,999

1003

- I love you. Heart. - I love you. Heart.

1004
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,300
Thank you.

1005
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,569
- Shall we eat now? - Okay.

1006
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,909
Are you ready to eat?

1007
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,879
- Yes, Dad. - "Yes, Dad."

1008
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,410
This table turns. Turn it and...

1009
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,579
- Say, "Stop." - Yes. if there's a dish you want,

1012
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,490
. if there's a dish you want, say, "Stop."

1013
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,360
What do you want?

1014
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,890
- This one. - This one?

1015

I can't eat it either.

1043
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,620
I can't eat it either.

1044
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,760
Smell it.

1045
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,560
Smell it.

1046
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,360
- It's spicy. - See? It's spicy.

1047
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,830
- It's spicy. - See? It's spicy.

1048
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,540
Jung Woo, try this.

1049
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,270
It won't be spicy. Look.

1050
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,940
- Shall I try it? - Yes, try it.

00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,190
Is it good?

1054
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,140
Is it good?

1055
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,980
This is white jjajangmyeon.

1056
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,420
It's crispy.

1057
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,090
Mom, it's really tasty.

1058
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,760
Mom, it's really tasty.

1059

00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,940
It's very tasty.

1063
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,620
You guys haven't had white jjajangmyeon, right?

1064
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,260
Who wants to try white jjajangmyeon?

1065
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,329
It's jjajangmyeon, but white in colour.

1066
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,860
It's white, not black.

1067
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,400
Honey, here you go.

1068
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,900
Thank you.

1069
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,909
Stay there. That's now how you do things here.

1070
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:45,670
- Stay there. - Okay.

1071
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,009
- Don't move. - You're right.

1072
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,240
I'll use this. Here.

1073
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,649
I'll use this. Here.

1074
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,550
- There you go. - Stop.

1075
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,140
It's so tasty. This is it.

1076
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,140
The taste is clean, not heavy.

1077
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,880
I'll put it here.

1078
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,009
- I want to turn the table. - Okay.

1079
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,420
Turn the table, Eun Woo.

1080
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,880
Let's turn it.

1081
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:30,550
Let's begin.

1082
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,520
Stop.

1083
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,030
Stop.

1084
00:57:38,031 --> 00:57:39,129
- Stop. - Stop.

1085
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,200

- There you go. Eat it. - Here.

1087
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,240
It's tasty, right?

1088
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,420
Don't drop the food. Lean forward.

1089
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,490
There you go.

1090
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,790
Eat comfortably.

1091
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,110
- Is it tasty? - Is it tasty?

1092
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,939
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

1093
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,710
- How is it? - It's tasty.

1094
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,820
Does it taste the same as the black jjajangmyeon?

1095
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,120
Does it taste different?

1096
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,289
Eat more jjajangmyeon, Eun Woo. Eat up.

1097
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,459
I ate this much already.

1098
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,520
It's tasty, right?

1099
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,589
Dad, give me more jjajangmyeon.

1100
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,630
Okay.

1101
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,600
Here it comes. Say, "Stop." It'll pass by quickly.

1102
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,000
- Stop. - The table stopped.

1103
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,700
Enjoy the food.

1104
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,310
Slurp them. You're good at slurping noodles.

1105
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:04,680
Slurp them.

1106
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,780
Well done.

1107
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,019
Is it tasty?

1108
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,350
Dad, look at me.

1109
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,519
I'm looking at you.

1110
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,860
Slurp the noodles. Slurp them.

1111
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,700
Try it. It's meat.

1112
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:25,600
It's meat.

1113
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,970
It's too spicy.

1114
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,680
It's too spicy.

1115
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,209
It isn't spicy.

1116
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,580
Trust it. It isn't spicy.

1117
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,620
It's too hot.

1118
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,120
It isn't hot. Trust me.

1119
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,860
Don't look at me with those eyes.

1120
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,230
Don't look at me with those eyes.

1121
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,570
It really isn't hot or spicy.

1122
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,400
It really isn't hot or spicy.

1123
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,310
It isn't spicy or hot.

1124
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,140
It isn't spicy or hot.

1125
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,380
Try it.

1126
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,180
Try it.

1127
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,550
Come on. I didn't lie.

1128
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,890
It's cool. Try it.

1129
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,690
Try it.

1130
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,970
It's too big.

1131
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,940
The hat fell.

1132
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,410
- Is it tasty? - Give me more.

1133
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,060
Guys.

1134
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,360
- Isn't the food tasty? - Yes.

1135
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:06,600
Honey, didn't we come here when we were dating?

1136
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,539
I think I remember this white jjajangmyeon.

1137
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,640
I think we sat by the window.

1138
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:15,240
- I think we ate on the 1st floor. - I ate on the 2nd floor.

1139
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,010
I ate on the second floor.

1140
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,550
- You were here with another woman. - Was it another occasion?

1141
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,580
- First floor versus second floor? - Yes.

1142
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:24,719
I bet she'll watch the show...

1143
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,690
and go, "It was me."

1144
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,220
Maybe I'm wrong.

1145
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:32,760
In any case, we came here as a group of two in the past.

1146
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,830
- We're a family of four already. - Yes.

1147
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,999
It feels just like yesterday...

1148
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,700
that Eun Woo and Jung Woo were in my belly.

1149
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,210
When did you guys grow up to eat food so well?

1150
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,810
Eun Woo.

1151
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,910
It's tasty, right?

1152
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,799
Jung Woo, what did you do in Mom's belly?

1153
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,900
Do you remember?

1154
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,340
It was dark in Mom's belly.

1155
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:23,610
It was dark in Mom's belly.

1156
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,479
- Was it dark in Mom's belly? - Yes.

1157
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,779
How was it when you came out?

1158
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,050
Do you remember?

1159
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,350
Doctor.

1160
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,890
Doctor.

1161
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,460
Doctor.

1162
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,700
Did the doctor take you out?

1163
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,129
But...

1164
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,600
I cried, "Wah, wah."

1165
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:48,440
I cried, "Wah, wah."

1166
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,010
Is that so?

1167
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,010
Is that so?

1168
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,380
I cried "Wah, wah" like this.

1169
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:59,009
I cried "Wah, wah" like this.

1170
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:00,119
It's spicy.

1171
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,479
It isn't spicy.

1172
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,450
- It's spicy. - It isn't spicy.

1173
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,990
- This one? - No.

1174
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,860
Find it well.

1175
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:14,460
- I cried "Wah, wah" like this. - Is that so?

1176
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,200
I cried "Wah, wah" like this.

1177
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,940
- Is that so? - Yes.

1178
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,340
When you were born?

1179
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,850
Where is it coming from?

1180
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:52,900
The colour changed! Which colour is it?

1181
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:03,850
Which colour is it?

1182
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,750
- Which colour is it? - Which colour is it?

1183
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,750
Which colour is it?

1184
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,160
Look.

1185
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,300
Look.

1186
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,070
High five.

1187
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:30,540
- Jung Woo, high five. - Jung Woo, you too.

1188
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,020
Uncle, please come again.

1189
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,789
To which colour did the face change?

1190
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,990
- Green. - And?

1191
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,600
- Blue. - Blue. And?

1192
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,929
Orange? Yellow.

1193
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,700
Yellow. You're right. And?

1194
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,040
- Black. - That's right. Black.

1195
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,869
Was it cool?

1196
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:05,910
- It was cool. Yes. - Was it fun?

1197
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,310
We had a family outing for the first time in a while.

1198
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,649
How was it?

1199
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,350
- Since we were here as two, - That's right.

1200
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,850
- it's strange to be here as four. - That's right.

1201
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,360
And I got treated like a princess on my birthday.

1202
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,389
I'm so grateful. Thank you for the birthday present, honey.

1203
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,460
Okay.

1204
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,670
Dad, let's visit the place again.

1205
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,030
Okay. With whom?

1206
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,700
- Eun Woo, Mom, - Okay.

1207
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,540
- Dad, and I... - Okay.

1208
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,540
- should ride Dad's car together. - Dad's car?

1209
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,450
Should ride Dad's car together.

1210
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,450
- Should ride Dad's car together. - Dad's car?

1211
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,490
How cute.

1212
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,590
Should ride Dad's car together.

1213
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,460
Let's go!

1214
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,830
Big brother!

1215
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,400
Big brother!

1216
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,999
All right!

1217
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,240
- Bye. - Bye.

1218
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,470
Haru, while your hairstyle looks cool today...

1219
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,310
All right. Let me tie your hair.

1220
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,880
All right. For Haru,

1221
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:27,260
I brought this. Use your strength. Enjoy it however you want.

1222
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,030
Use your strength. Enjoy it however you want.

1223
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:32,830
You can do it!

1224
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,100
You're doing great.
