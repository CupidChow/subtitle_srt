1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,400
There will be more.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,830
Let's go over there.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,330
Possible.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,470
Possible.

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,330
- Gosh. It's Aunt Myung Hwa. - All right. Hello.

6
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:37,905
- Gosh. It's Aunt Myung Hwa. - All right. Hello.

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,230
- Are you Park Jong Min? - What?

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,770
I'm Kim Jong Min.

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,240
When you see someone older than you, you must say hello first.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,500
Okay. Hello.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,770
- Bow deeper to a 90° angle. - Hello.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,240
- All right. - What...

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,310
How come you're here? Where's Ralral?

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,280
- Are you singing? Are you happy? - What?

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,280
How come you're here? Where's Ralral?

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,450
- Are you singing? Are you happy? - What?

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,850
- Yes. - Sit down.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,350
I heard that we'd be working together today.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,790
- What? - You look good.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,090
I'm going to work with you?

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm supposed to work with Ralral.

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,060
You can be in a good mood and sing all you want. But no.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,300
- What are you thinking? - No.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,830
- It's... - Stop it. Be quiet.

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,100
- Play the video now. - This is...

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,370
- Bring the remote. Let's watch. - Remote?

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,570
People watch videos on this show.

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,070
The Return of Superman. Episode 598.

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,970
Run, Family Superman.

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,880
Haru. Peekaboo.

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,650
Haru. Peekaboo.

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
Peekaboo.

33
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,450
He's so beautiful. How adorable.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,660
- Gosh, your hair. - Look at his hair.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,420
He has the Astro Boy's hairstyle from the old days.

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,490
How is this possible?

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,560
- you got a blowout. - I think he has...

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,860
- more hair than me. - Of course.

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,900
- Really? - Yes.

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,970
Gosh, he has such thick hair.

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,670
Peekaboo.

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,970
One, two, three. Peekaboo.

43
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,970
He's going to walk soon. He's grabbing onto the slide.

44
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,980
One, two, three. Peekaboo.

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,110
- Did he already start walking? - Hey, look.

46
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,320
Peekaboo.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,390
Look at you standing.

48
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,920
You look so natural standing up like that.

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,290
- He's standing now. - You know?

50
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,430
He's gotten stronger.

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,130
I can see that his glute muscles are developing.

52
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,930
- He's so cute. - What's wrong with his feet?

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,730
Why did you say it like that?

54
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,070
- His feet... - Gosh.

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,540
See? This is why you must have babies.

56
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,200
You need to be a father to have this experience.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,870
Bones and muscles are very flexible for babies. So it's okay.

58
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,640
- He's okay? My gosh. I see. - Yes.

59
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,820
I guess he's getting stronger now.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,120
He's stronger.

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,320
He's so cute.

62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,890
- He'll start walking soon. - Yes.

63
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,190
His parents should put a lot of things he can grab to stand up.

64
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,190
That's right.

65
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,030
You can stand perfectly on your own now.

66
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,370
Haru. Come here.

67
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,700
Hold onto that tight.

68
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,710
He's so cute. How did he end up with such thick hair?

69
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
Seriously.

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,980
Haru. Your hair looks cool. But...

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,680
Let's make sure your face is visible.

72
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,690
All right. Let's tie it up.

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,260
Come here. Okay.

74
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,990
Great.

75
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,330
He looks like a doll.

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,240
All right. Let me tie up your hair.

77
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,670
There.

78
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,580
- He's so cute. - He's adorable.

79
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,050
No matter the hairstyle, you always look great, my son.

80
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,350
After watching Haru's clip,

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,250
I need to go right now.

82
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,280
- To your wife? - Seriously.

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,990
- I really want a child. - I bet.

84
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,160
From ovulation to implantation,

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
- it takes 4 weeks. - It takes 4 weeks?

86
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
- Yes. It takes four weeks. - I see.

87
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,500
All right, Haru. Let's get you changed.

88
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,070
How does he have such beautiful eyes?

89
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,300
- He's so beautiful. How cute. - Look at his legs.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,010
All right. These are for you, Haru.

91
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,680
I brought them for you.

92
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,580
Look at these.

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,150
All right. Show me your strength.

94
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,660
- What's that? - He can't go to the playground.

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,660
He could get hurt there.

96
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,960
- Is he too young for that? - Yes.

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
My daughter climbs up and down 50 times a day.

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,160
We must clap for her over 50 times a day.

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,530
- Gym. - Get pregnant first.

100
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,830
Take notes later.

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,000
It's not like you can buy that first. No.

102
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,610
Climbing up the stairs is a good workout even for adults.

103
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,780
Show me your strength.

104
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,940
Play with it however you want.

105
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,750
You can do it!

106
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,050
Can babies just climb up on their own?

107
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,890
When they haven't been taught?

108
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,760
Right. They want to climb up. But it's a challenge.

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,990
Gosh, he stood up.

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,790
That's how they develop muscles.

111
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,700
They stand on their legs and hold it with their hands.

112
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,680
They are Haru's favourite blocks these days.

113
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,350
His dad put them there on purpose.

114
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,120
I see. His dad put the blocks on the steps.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,020
To get Haru to climb up and to exercise.

116
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,000
You can do it.

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,630
You shouldn't grab them from there.

118
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,600
Start from here.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,670
Like this.

120
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,500
That's it.

121
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,870
That's it.

122
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,070
Let's go.

123
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,370
One.

124
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,580
You can do it.

125
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,250
Haru, you can do it.

126
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,010
You can do it.

127
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,850
Let's go. One step at a time.

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,550
He's so cute. Oh, my.

129
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,590
What's wrong?

130
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,130
- He doesn't know how to climb up? - Right.

131
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,700
He can see the blocks, though.

132
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,770
- Right. - Yes.

133
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,370
- My gosh. What will he do? - He's so cute.

134
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,140
- Oh, my. - Does he want his dad to get them?

135
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,680
- He doesn't know how. - Look at his bottom.

136
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,680
You're doing a good job.

137
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,780
- That's it. One step at a time. - He's going up.

138
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,250
We must root for him and watch.

139
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,720
That's how you go up. Yes.

140
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,990
One step at a time.

141
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,090
Look at this.

142
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,230
It's jumping.

143
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,830
There you go.

144
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,970
He's so cute.

145
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,840
- He's almost there. - Yes. Take the last step.

146
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,540
- Haru, you're almost there! - To the top.

147
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,780
- Go. - To the top.

148
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,680
- One more step. - I can see his glutes engaged.

149
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,380
- There you go. - He's there.

150
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
That's it.

151
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,290
There you go. That's it.

152
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,550
- You look like Simba. - From "The Lion King?"

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,190
Roar.

154
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,630
That's a lot of work, you know?

155
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
Babies sigh a lot after holding the pose for a long time.

156
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,860
It's exhausting.

157
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,770
- What's he saying? - He's babbling.

158
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,770
He's babbling?

159
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,310
That's it. When you climb to the top,

160
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,550
you say, "Hooray."

161
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,310
You say, "Hooray."

162
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,380
You say it just like that.

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,250
Scream just like that.

164
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,620
There you go. Just like that.

165
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,820
There you go. Just like that.

166
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,290
That's what a man of mountains does.

167
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,860
A real man?

168
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,460
He's way too cute for a man of mountains.

169
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,930
Well, for him, it's the same as hiking.

170
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,010
My gosh. He's at the top.

171
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,840
Let's dance at the top of the mountain

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,210
Hooray

173
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,160
His hair is fluttering like the dandelion seeds.

174
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,090
- Yes, they come down on a slide. - There's a slide too.

175
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,300
They love the slide?

176
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,530
All right then.

177
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,330
You know what? I...

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,900
All right then. You know what? I...

179
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
- Let me show you what this is. - What's that?

180
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,910
- Every family has one. - You started to stand up.

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,540
It's the baby walker.

182
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,580
Haru. Let me tell you what it is.

183
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,750
Jung Sung Ho gave this to us. Okay?

184
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Uncle Jung Sung Ho wanted you to have this when you were born.

185
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,950
His family starred on the show too.

186
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,460
Jung Sung Ho's family gave it to us as a present.

187
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,560
Here's what he said when he gave it to me.

188
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,490
"I got it as a present too."

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,430
He had gotten it from Do Kyung Wan.

190
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,860
I see. From Do Kyung Wan?

191
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,670
Nationally popular toys like that go from family to family.

192
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,300
You have to be grateful when you get it.

193
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,470
It's hard to find and buy popular toys like that.

194
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,810
Really? It's hard to come by?

195
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,810
- Yes. - My gosh.

196
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,140
My gosh. There she goes. Goodness.

197
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,980
Come here.

198
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,020
Yes.

199
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,620
Look. She walks really well.

200
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,420
Jung Sung Ho got it...

201
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,860
from Do Kyung Wan.

202
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,560
Then I'm taking it now.

203
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,130
That's how Haru ended up with it.

204
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,000
This toy has a long history.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,240
That's how the phone is gone.

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,940
- There's no phone now. - The toy comes with a long history.

207
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,980
That's a useful toy for babies.

208
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,040
- How fascinating. - I...

209
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Let's play with this toy.

210
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,350
All right. You...

211
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,680
All right. You...

212
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,990
All right. You...

213
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,050
Don't fall.

214
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
Hold onto that.

215
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,760
Haru is cute like a figurine.

216
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,930
He looks like a doll, straight up.

217
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,600
Doesn't he look like a doll that comes with the toy?

218
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Right. Totally.

219
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,470
He's just so adorable.

220
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,910
But it seems Haru can't move forward.

221
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,380
He's never done this before.

222
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,080
He doesn't know how to use it...

223
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,150
just like he didn't know how to climb up the steps.

224
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,160
I think he's thinking.

225
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,060
- "What should I do?" - Yes.

226
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,600
Haru. Come here.

227
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,570
Come here. Look at this.

228
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,370
Look at this, Haru.

229
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,240
I see. He has to lure Haru with the blocks.

230
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,870
He likes it.

231
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,350
He's strong. He can stand up for a long time.

232
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,950
Come to me.

233
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,160
All right. I'll help you, so you don't slip.

234
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,000
- Seriously? - Is that early for his age?

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
- Yes. - I see.

236
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,700
- Some babies struggle to walk... - Okay.

237
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,170
- even after their first birthday. - Right.

238
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,570
- Some can't walk on their own. - Right.

239
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,740
Great, Haru.

240
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,470
- He's walking. - You're walking.

241
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,870
- He's walking. - He's only nine months old.

242
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
You're walking.

243
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,450
Great job.

244
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,950
He grabbed the toy and started walking.

245
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,990
See? Babies grow up fast.

246
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,420
- Look at his round calves. - My gosh.

247
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,760
Go to the side, Haru.

248
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,090
You had to speed up the footage.

249
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,160
Do you remember that?

250
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,330
- You had to speed up the footage. - Because it was that slow?

251
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,360
Do you remember that?

252
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,570
Great. Come to Daddy.

253
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,070
There you go. Yes.

254
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,370
That's it.

255
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,740
There you go.

256
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,910
- Hyoung Tak must feel so proud. - There you go.

257
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,620
There you go.

258
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,250
The first time they say "Mom" or "Dad."

259
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,850
The moment of their first step.

260
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,560
Everything is a first time for him.

261
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,830
Many years later,

262
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,900
Haru will say, "Dad," while running to me...

263
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,460
when I come home after work.

264
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,100
Thinking about how I would hold him in my arms...

265
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,570
made me hope that Haru would practice walking more.

266
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,910
That crossed my mind.

267
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,880
Just like this.

268
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,250
Do you know what this is?

269
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,480
What's that now?

270
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,120
- What's that? Is he flying? - That's to help him walk.

271
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,750
Haru isn't flying.

272
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,060
You know, some people go skydiving.

273
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,760
Does that toy give the same thrill to the babies?

274
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,060
- No. It also helps them walk. - What's that?

275
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,660
- It's scary without any help. - Yes.

276
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,100
Parents can't constantly hold them.

277
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,330
So parents can support them from above.

278
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,800
This exercise helps babies maintain their balance.

279
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,570
So it helps babies walk.

280
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,140
Let's try walking together.

281
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,650
Try this.

282
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,320
I see. His dad is teaching him everything from A to Z.

283
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,050
- Peekaboo. - Isn't this a lovely sight,

284
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,620
- watching him teach his son? - It is.

285
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,950
Why don't we walk together?

286
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,290
Why don't we walk together?

287
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,390
All right. That's it.

288
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,660
I didn't know about this exercise.

289
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,370
Every day is a journey of effort.

290
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,140
- He's so cute. - Gosh.

291
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,840
- He got a nice sense of rhythm. - He gets excited easily.

292
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,450
I mean, he might feel like this is a hassle...

293
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,120
or it might exhaust him, but Haru seems to like this.

294
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,690
- Haru? This is fun for him. - Yes.

295
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,690
He's never done this before.

296
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,360
It's waking up the muscles in his body.

297
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,330
Actually, babies love it when they do physical activities.

298
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,800
One.

299
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,330
One.

300
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,640
Two.

301
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,970
- One. - Yes.

302
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,850
- One. - Oh, my.

303
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,050
- Two. - Where are they going?

304
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,180
One.

305
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,380
Two.

306
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,820
- One. - My goodness.

307
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,120
- Two. - He's so cute.

308
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,160
Oh, my.

309
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,190
- I want to go and pinch him. - Pinch him where?

310
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,730
His cheek.

311
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,200
That's the kind of thing an uncle would say.

312
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,530
One. That's it.

313
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,130
That was amazing just now.

314
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,570
- One. That's it. - My gosh.

315
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,970
- Great. - That was amazing just now.

316
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,340
Let's go, Haru.

317
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,410
It looks like he's matching his steps with his dad's.

318
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,810
- Yes. - That's what it looks like.

319
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,550
Two.

320
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,650
One.

321
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,890
Two.

322
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,950
One.

323
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
Two.

324
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,860
We walked side by side for the first time.

325
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,100
- I saw his feet too. - He must feel touched.

326
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,670
- His legs aren't strong enough yet. - Right.

327
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,600
He was dragging his feet to step forward.

328
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,540
When I saw him move forward with each step...

329
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
I wonder...

330
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
if he will walk with me,

331
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
I wonder about that too.

332
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,920
You're the best, Haru.

333
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,020
Keep filming him up close.

334
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,420
He's so tiny. I can't see him.

335
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,360
- Does he know he's being filmed? - My gosh.

336
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,030
- So cute. - Can you keep filming like this?

337
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,270
It's time for your meal now.

338
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,800
- Time for food. - Let's eat, Haru.

339
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,170
He's still on baby food.

340
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,310
Here.

341
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,950
- He's opening his mouth. - Here.

342
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,780
Babies open their mouths wide.

343
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,020
I find that super cute.

344
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,150
When they see a glimpse of the food, they go like this.

345
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,730
He's opening his mouth big. Right.

346
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,530
- It's like feeding baby birds. - Yes.

347
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,670
He's such a gentle baby.

348
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,410
Gosh, he likes it.

349
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,380
- He's in a good mood. - Here.

350
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,110
You grew up a lot.

351
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,730
Right. You have to play with kids.

352
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,560
- Playing with food... - No. You do that...

353
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,690
when they don't want to eat.

354
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,560
That's annoying for kids when they're hungry.

355
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,780
Here.

356
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,380
I'll get you another spoonful fast.

357
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,850
I'll get you another spoonful fast.

358
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,550
For babies who love to eat, you must keep going without a break.

359
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,650
When they're chewing, you must scoop up another bite.

360
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,290
- He keeps on eating. - Here.

361
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,690
Haru is enjoying his food.

362
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,000
Let's move on to the banana.

363
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,500
- Babies love bananas. - They love bananas.

364
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,530
- Okay. - They love bananas.

365
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,700
- Is that the happy face? - Yes.

366
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,340
Not that. Here.

367
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,770
This one.

368
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,140
Great. All right.

369
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,650
Something is off. Does he want something else?

370
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,750
You're almost done with it. I swear. Here.

371
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,120
You're almost done with it. I swear.

372
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,290
Here.

373
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,460
Haru. You finished it. You just have a tiny bit left.

374
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,860
- He ate the banana. - Look at this.

375
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,790
He won't eat the baby food. Why is that?

376
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,400
The moment they taste the fruit, they don't eat their meal.

377
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,330
It's the same for everyone. Once you taste something good,

378
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,130
- you want to keep eating that. - Yes.

379
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,200
It's the same for Haru.

380
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,540
Peekaboo.

381
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,110
He's in a good mood.

382
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,180
My gosh, I love this.

383
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,180
You finished it. I swear. You're almost done.

384
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,150
Then the banana.

385
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,290
Then the banana.

386
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,460
Then the banana.

387
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,260
- See? What? - Bananas are the tastiest.

388
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,860
He had already tasted the banana.

389
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,160
That's fascinating.

390
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,860
Haru knows everything by now.

391
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,570
He'll only eat the banana now.

392
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,870
- Let's eat the baby food, Haru. - Yes?

393
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,780
- Gosh, he's checking it now. - See? He checked it.

394
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,640
- It's not the banana. - Gosh, he's checking it now.

395
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,280
- Kids know everything. - Banana.

396
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,550
- How does he know that? - See?

397
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,820
Okay. It's the banana.

398
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,050
All right.

399
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,890
Okay. Let's take one last bite. I'm begging you.

400
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,090
One last bite.

401
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,660
Just play along one last time.

402
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,730
Nice.

403
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,460
There you go. He ate it.

404
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,470
- He's eating a lot. - What's that?

405
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,740
- It's a new world, isn't it? - A dessert?

406
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,940
- Is it the rice snack? - The peels?

407
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,680
This was it, right?

408
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,210
Do you know what this is?

409
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,150
You've never eaten this before.

410
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,050
- Smell it first. - What's that?

411
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,750
- You've never eaten this before. - Tangerines?

412
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,560
Smell it first.

413
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,890
"Give him his first tangerine as his dad."

414
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,930
- He's never had this before. - "Peel the second layer."

415
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,030
"Then get the flesh."

416
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,330
Look at the drawing.

417
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,030
What's this? Who drew this?

418
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,940
Haru's mother drew it herself.

419
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,370
- Really? She's good. - Gosh, how adorable.

420
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,540
Okay. Let's eat tangerines, Haru.

421
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,410
You've never had tangerines before, right?

422
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,550
Great.

423
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,350
Do you know what this is?

424
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,250
- All right. - He's so cute when he eats.

425
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,920
You're eating this for the first time today.

426
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,690
Smell it first.

427
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,390
Since he's never had it before, he won't know what it is.

428
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,260
- No. - What? He went for a bite.

429
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,400
No.

430
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
Don't open your mouth. Just smell it.

431
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
- How does he know it's tasty? - No.

432
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,570
Babies open their mouth when we give something to them.

433
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,940
No. Don't open your mouth.

434
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,340
It's your first time ever.

435
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,540
All right, Haru.

436
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,910
- His first tangerine. - It won't be too sour, right?

437
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,550
I think it will be.

438
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,320
- What? - Each tangerine is different.

439
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,220
Haru, how is it?

440
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,960
It's your first tangerine.

441
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,090
- How is it? - How is it?

442
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,060
Haru, tell us how it tastes.

443
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,930
- How many points? - Is it slightly sour?

444
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,130
It must be slightly sour.

445
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,110
He's having his first sour fruit.

446
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,220
- How is it? - He likes it.

447
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,120
You're loving this. Oh, my.

448
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,920
- I guess he likes it. - You like it?

449
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,160
So he likes it?

450
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,030
He loves it.

451
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,270
He approves.

452
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,200
- You like it that much? - He approves.

453
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,640
He's dancing.

454
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,280
Are you all right?

455
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,610
- Because it's sour. - His body shook just now.

456
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,780
It's sour.

457
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,080
Let me try it too.

458
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,860
It's good.

459
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,990
Okay. Why are you so impatient?

460
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,830
Why are you so impatient?

461
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,500
He likes it.

462
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,570
- What? You finished that? - Look at him. He keeps getting up.

463
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,670
Okay. I'm...

464
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,670
I'm a bit slow.

465
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,410
I'm sorry. Okay? Here.

466
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,110
- He's too slow. - He's too slow at feeding Haru?

467
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,250
He must keep on eating.

468
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,810
But Hyoung Tak is taking too long.

469
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
Look at his eyes.

470
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,350
All right.

471
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,290
He loves it.

472
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,660
Come into my mouth, tangerine.

473
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,390
- Gosh. - He loves it.

474
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,930
Here you go. Give me your hand.

475
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,570
You've never touched a tangerine before, right?

476
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,570
My gosh. He's putting it in his mouth. Oh, my.

477
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,840
He can eat on his own now.

478
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,770
He's all grown up.

479
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,880
Let me hold that for you.

480
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,980
Use the finger to eat it. Come on. Just have one.

481
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Watching him enjoy his food...

482
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,150
- makes me so happy. - He loves it.

483
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,160
- Of course. - Yes.

484
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,690
Is it that good?

485
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,800
You really liked your meal.

486
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Okay. Let's get you changed now.

487
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,910
What does he mean by cooing?

488
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,380
He's just learning how to make sounds...

489
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
- starting with vowel sounds. - I see.

490
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,230
Today's theme is...

491
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,200
an animation theme that I like.

492
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,570
Hyoung Tak seems so happy.

493
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,270
It looks like a TV commercial.

494
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,970
- It does look that way, indeed. - Yes.

495
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,210
He's cooing with his arms and legs.

496
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,920
- What does that mean? - He keeps moving his limbs.

497
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,320
Look. He's wiggling.

498
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,060
Here you go, Haru.

499
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,890
Today, Haru is dressed...

500
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,030
as Jerry from "Tom and Jerry."

501
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,200
Babies look so cute when they're dressed as a character.

502
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,530
He's dressed as Jerry.

503
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,300
Oh, my. Haru...

504
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,540
He's cuter than Jerry.

505
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,970
He looks great in all outfits.

506
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,240
My, he's so cute.

507
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,980
- He looks great in this outfit too. - He looks good in any outfits.

508
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
He looks like an animal.

509
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,040
Any outfits...

510
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,980
- He looks like an animal? Come on. - I mean, he looks so cute.

511
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,780
- How could you say that to a baby? - I didn't mean it like that.

512
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,250
He looks so cute in that animal costume.

513
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,450
All right. Wait here. I'll bring something.

514
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,990
Haru, this is toilet paper.

515
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,690
Toilet paper.

516
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,700
Okay.

517
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,130
I'm not sure if you'll succeed.

518
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,900
- But... - What?

519
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,700
He knows how to play with his baby.

520
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,170
Why is he stacking so many toilet paper rolls?

521
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,180
It helps a baby's brain development.

522
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,080
- Toilet paper is not dangerous. - I see.

523
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,250
You stack toilet paper rolls around your baby...

524
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,620
and see if he or she can escape.

525
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,260
You can encourage curiosity in your baby that way.

526
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,990
- So that the baby thinks? - It makes the baby think, yes.

527
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,670
Good. Hold one of the rolls and look at it.

528
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,870
Appreciate it.

529
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,110
If you stack toilet paper high,

530
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,710
won't that scare Haru?

531
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,720
I mean, it's his first time.

532
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,450
- I think she can escape. - No, she can't escape.

533
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,350
Come here.

534
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,160
Come here.

535
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,130
How should they come out? How are they supposed to come out?

536
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,330
Maybe you should move some aside.

537
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,600
- Move them aside and crawl out. - Yes, that's right.

538
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,900
That's too tall.

539
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,100
It's as tall as Haru.

540
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,110
From babies' perspective, every day is full of quizzes.

541
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,310
"What in the world is this?" I mean, full of missions.

542
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,850
He knocked them down.

543
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,850
They're like cats.

544
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,420
Babies at his age act like cats.

545
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,960
That encourages the baby to use his hands.

546
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,500
All right.

547
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,040
It's exhausting for his dad, though.

548
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,910
You just let your baby do whatever he or she wants.

549
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,310
You can use everything for tactile play.

550
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,210
Wait for a while.

551
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,620
- Wait for a while. - "Jerry, please."

552
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,150
He really is like Jerry in many ways.

553
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,860
I can't seem to complete it.

554
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,100
Nothing goes the way I expect it to.

555
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,800
You seem excited, my dear Haru.

556
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,570
You're doing well.

557
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,870
- The toilet paper seems so big. - Indeed.

558
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,000
It's bigger than Haru's face.

559
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,310
It's done. It looks perfect.

560
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,550
We'll see how Haru will escape.

561
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,650
- How will he get out? - I'm curious.

562
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,350
I believe, Haru,

563
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,990
that you'll use your brain to find a way to get out.

564
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,490
- Because I know... - I think it's difficult for him.

565
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,630
how high your IQ is.

566
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,200
All right. Ready.

567
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,640
- Ready. - I see space he can go through.

568
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,770
Where?

569
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,470
- To the side. - Where?

570
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,940
- Maybe I'm wrong. - Where and how...

571
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,310
Where are you looking?

572
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,950
What?

573
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,020
Break them all.

574
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,320
Haru is so smart.

575
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,820
Haru is so smart.

576
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,090
My, he's cute.

577
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,830
He knocked down the wall with his entire body.

578
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,300
He got out. That's all that matters.

579
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,440
That was too easy for him.

580
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,170
What just happened?

581
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,880
- Yes! You got out! - He used his head in another way.

582
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,480
- Oh, I see. - He used his head to break it.

583
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,850
He used his head.

584
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,650
Haru, you're amazing.

585
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,150
That was really good.

586
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,750
Look at his hair.

587
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,160
His hair spreads as he falls down.

588
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,730
The next one will be very difficult.

589
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,860
I thought long and hard to come up with this idea.

590
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,370
Is he going to try something else? Oh, my.

591
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,800
How is Haru supposed to break this?

592
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,170
He could see me between the toilet paper rolls.

593
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,610
Come on, Haru.

594
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,880
But the boxes were put together tightly.

595
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,320
I wondered if Haru could break the wall of boxes as well.

596
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,120
So I prepared boxes to see if he could do it.

597
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,490
Let's give it a try, Haru.

598
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Haru.

599
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm here.

600
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,600
Haru.

601
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,800
Haru.

602
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,940
- Haru could see him earlier. - Haru.

603
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,140
But now he can't see him.

604
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
- He can't see his dad now. - That's right.

605
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,540
- Haru. - He can only hear his dad's voice.

606
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,440
- I'm here. Peekaboo. - Where?

607
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,910
- All right. Let's go. - He can hear his dad's voice.

608
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,150
- Haru. - Shim Haru.

609
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,410
Let's go.

610
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,350
- Haru. - He can't see his dad.

611
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,290
- He can hear his dad somewhere. - I'm here.

612
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,150
- Will he break the wall? - Haru, use your head again.

613
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,090
- Will he be able to do that? - Use your head.

614
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm here. Peekaboo.

615
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,360
Come here if you want to play with me.

616
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,230
- He won't succeed this time. - I'll see how you handle it.

617
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,870
Look here.

618
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,070
Peekaboo. Look at me, Haru.

619
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,040
He's not coming.

620
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,210
- It's hard. - Right.

621
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,840
All right. Then I'll give you this.

622
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,820
What is it?

623
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,380
He's smiling.

624
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,590
- What is it? Banana? - What could it be?

625
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,190
What is it? It's a secret weapon?

626
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
- Rice snack. - What's the secret weapon?

627
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,160
- Oh, rice snack. - Here's a rice snack.

628
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,490
Here's a rice snack.

629
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,830
Rice snack.

630
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,430
I have a rice snack here.

631
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,230
Come here. Come.

632
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,370
It's right here.

633
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,640
Oh, he's coming.

634
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,310
- He's reaching for the rice snack. - What's he doing between the boxes?

635
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,350
- What is he doing? - Here.

636
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,480
- Is he only reaching out his hand? - That's the best item.

637
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,780
My, he's so cute.

638
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,990
- He figured it out. - What will he do?

639
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,220
He knows that he can push it over.

640
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,290
Push it harder.

641
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,720
- I wonder what he'll do. - Haru, push it over.

642
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,030
- Push it over. - Push!

643
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,330
You can do it. It's right here.

644
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,260
Oh, he's pushing the wall.

645
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,900
He broke the wall only for a rice snack?

646
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,640
- Babies can't resist rice snacks. - I'm impressed.

647
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,810
Great job.

648
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,410
I'll be sure to try rice snacks.

649
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,950
- It must be really delicious. - Gosh, seriously.

650
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,580
Knock them down. No, stop. That's not for you.

651
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,620
What?

652
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,320
Are boys different? Oh, my.

653
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,960
- He just knocked the boxes down. - That's amazing.

654
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,690
Jung Woo just ran against the boxes.

655
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,900
That's good. He did a wonderful job.

656
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,040
How cute.

657
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,870
You earned it.

658
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,250
You knocked this wall down too?

659
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,450
Weren't you afraid at all?

660
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,180
You're amazing.

661
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,550
I give you a thumbs-up.

662
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,890
- Oh, my. He's eating it with gusto. - He's so adorable.

663
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,130
Haru is growing up so fast.

664
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,570
He's becoming able to do more things every day.

665
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,230
He started standing up on his own.

666
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,870
Now he's practising to walk.

667
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,240
I want to help Haru learn to do many things.

668
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,010
I hope...

669
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,480
there will be more things that make him happy.

670
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,350
What?

671
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,880
My, he's so cute.

672
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,160
He's so cute.

673
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,190
Who is it?

674
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,230
- Oh, it's Haru. - Haru.

675
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,430
He's like a fairy. He's gorgeous.

676
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,730
That's good. You're in a good mood right now.

677
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,000
What's going on?

678
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,810
Haru got cast for a TV commercial.

679
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,510
So we're at a filming studio for the commercial.

680
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,410
He's a model.

681
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,750
That's great. Congratulations, Haru.

682
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,380
Hyoung Tak must be smiling from ear to ear.

683
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,290
Congratulations, Hyoung Tak. He must be so happy.

684
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,760
He's so gorgeous, you know.

685
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,290
- He's really gorgeous, indeed. - He's gorgeous.

686
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,630
Check out the number of views.

687
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,860
It got 4.62 views?

688
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,570
The total number of views of his videos is 17 million?

689
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,370
So cute.

690
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,570
He's so pretty.

691
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,210
People from every nation.

692
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,580
Patriotic or not, everyone watches Haru.

693
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,590
He's a superstar.

694
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,690
The commercial Haru will shoot today...

695
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,190
is for a baby fabric softener.

696
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,200
It is amazing.

697
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,340
The first commercial I shot...

698
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,000
was after I was past 20.

699
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,140
He filmed it 20 years ago.

700
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,480
Haru went to shoot a commercial...

701
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,020
before he even turned one.

702
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
Thank you, The Return of Superman.

703
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,820
It's his first commercial shooting,

704
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,790
but I believe he'll do it well.

705
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,340
You have to lift the baby's spirits like that.

706
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,510
Let's get changed.

707
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,980
You like that.

708
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
He's a doll.

709
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,790
- Right. - Goodness.

710
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,860
Please come, Haru.

711
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,490
Please come, Haru.

712
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,370
He's only nine months old.

713
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,140
Can someone so young have a hair stylist?

714
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,040
He...

715
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,410
- I think it's the 1st time. - The 1st time?

716
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,840
You have to be at least three to have such long hair.

717
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,480
Haru!

718
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,290
It's fun, Haru. Haru!

719
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,400
He looks a bit nervous.

720
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,610
I should do it again.

721
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,070
Haru!

722
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,110
Look at this!

723
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,840
Macaras?

724
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,110
- Maracas. - Maracas.

725
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,350
- Right. - It makes sound.

726
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,020
He likes it.

727
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,760
Haru! Look at this!

728
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,360
Haru! Look at this!

729
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,870
He likes it.

730
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,810
Hyoung Tak is an expert in making Haru smile.

731
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,250
Peekaboo!

732
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,980
Peekaboo!

733
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,360
- That's like a painting. - That's...

734
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,490
That looks Photoshopped.

735
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,760
- It really looks Photoshopped. - Right?

736
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,200
It doesn't look real.

737
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Peekaboo.

738
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,780
Dad is good at taking care of his child.

739
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,480
- How cute. - How could he be so cute?

740
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,450
Just looking at it, I think I can almost smell it.

741
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,020
Peekaboo!

742
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,970
What?

743
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
What?

744
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,810
It looks like he knows what's going on.

745
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,680
He's a superstar.

746
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,880
He's nine months old,

747
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,250
but I think Haru will talk better than you.

748
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,310
Well...

749
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,350
He's still babbling.

750
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,770
He smiles really well.

751
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,980
Goodness.

752
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,280
He was born with it.

753
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,660
The best cut just came out. Isn't that right?

754
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,160
It's amazing.

755
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,830
You got it. It's over.

756
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,400
- Gosh. - Goodness.

757
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,070
They all came out well.

758
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,670
Dad would feel so proud.

759
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,080
Haru did so well.

760
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,310
I was surprised.

761
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,380
It's something I did for more than 20 years.

762
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,320
But in less than a year,

763
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,650
he showed such professionalism.

764
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,660
You wouldn't know Haru is the son unless he said so.

765
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,290
- Right? - He's so cute.

766
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,660
He's so cute.

767
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,140
Haru! Look at this.

768
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,210
I want to tell Haru that he did really well.

769
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,880
Keep growing up like that, Haru!

770
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,480
Gold medal!

771
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,960
I think it's Eun Woo and Jung Woo's house.

772
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,490
I can do it!

773
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,160
I can do it!

774
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,260
That's right!

775
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,300
Things are already crazy here.

776
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,930
They're working out with Dad since morning.

777
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,030
That's right.

778
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,340
That's right.

779
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,370
What is this?

780
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,570
Gwanghwamun Square?

781
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,910
Why are there so many people?

782
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,110
What's going on? Yeouido Park.

783
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,990
Today, there's a stroller run...

784
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,260
organised in Seoul,

785
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,190
and The Return of Superman families will participate in it.

786
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,430
The Return of Superman 12th anniversary mega project!

787
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,770
The Super Men and Super Moms will run down the roads!

788
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,570
There are many world-famous marathons.

789
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,410
Right. There are many of them these days.

790
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,680
There are so many of them all around the world.

791
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,280
But in Korea,

792
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,680
there's a stroller run unlike any other.

793
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,390
The number of participants is 25,000.

794
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,260
- Twenty-five thousand participants? - Twenty-five thousand participants.

795
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,490
There are so many participants.

796
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,760
That's...

797
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,900
Faster!

798
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,340
Do you aim to be the first among The Return of Superman families?

799
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,770
Of course. It wouldn't make sense if I weren't first.

800
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,980
Jung Woo participated in a 5km marathon...

801
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,910
- right after he turned one. - Right.

802
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,720
That's right. You're almost there. That's right!

803
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,150
That's right!

804
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,620
The national team player's son is surely different.

805
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,160
His athletic skills are different.

806
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,790
Can you finish the race?

807
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,390
Can you earn the gold medal?

808
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,330
- Gold medal. - That's right. Gold medal.

809
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,460
Gold medal.

810
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,730
I have to eat the gold medal.

811
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,740
I have to eat the gold medal.

812
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,600
That's right. You should eat it.

813
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,570
I think he's really going to eat it.

814
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,240
I want to eat this, Dad.

815
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,780
I want to eat this, Dad.

816
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,880
All right. Let's eat that before heading out.

817
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,850
We should eat probiotics before going out.

818
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,790
- I eat it too. - That's how you grew up well.

819
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,460
We should eat probiotics before going out.

820
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,560
- Probiotics. - That's right.

821
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,600
Take only one before going out.

822
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,200
They listen to Dad well.

823
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
Thank you.

824
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,940
- Thank you, Dad. - Goodness.

825
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,680
You should also eat it, Dad.

826
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,010
You should also eat it, Dad.

827
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,610
- You're really good sons. - They're really good sons.

828
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,820
Dad eats the yellow one.

829
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,120
Jung Woo eats the green one.

830
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,850
- Okay. - He talks well.

831
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,320
- Let's eat probiotics. - Cheers.

832
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,160
Let's eat probiotics.

833
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,730
Here's to our healthy gut!

834
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,060
Cheers!

835
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,560
Cheers!

836
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,130
- Cheers. - Cheers.

837
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,730
- Here's to our healthy gut. - Eun Woo as well.

838
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,070
Probiotics.

839
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,670
Probiotics.

840
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,800
Probiotics.

841
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,810
Just pour it into your mouth.

842
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,270
He can eat well on his own.

843
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,840
Tilt your head back.

844
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,110
That's right.

845
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,350
Okay.

846
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,320
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

847
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,650
You eat it every day. Is it still tasty?

848
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,090
Yes.

849
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,430
We took care of our family's digestive health today as well.

850
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,930
Let's go and work out well.

851
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,700
Let's do this!

852
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,430
- Look at his expression. - He's being cute.

853
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,300
We have to go out now. Let's get ready.

854
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,840
Let's go! Let's go now!

855
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,980
- From 8am? - It starts early in the morning.

856
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,880
They're coming from all around the country.

857
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,950
It's tiresome for the mothers and fathers to just stay home.

858
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,490
You get energy...

859
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,760
Gwanghwamun Square is huge,

860
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,430
but it's completely packed.

861
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,000
This should be held more often.

862
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,770
It's such a lovely sight.

863
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:01,900
I agree.

864
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,840
It'll be a good memory for children.

865
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,870
That's right.

866
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,880
They'll enjoy being outside...

867
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,580
One, two, three! Let's go!

868
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,220
- Follow me. Follow Jun Ho Train. - They're warming up.

869
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,750
Follow Jun Ho Train.

870
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,650
- There you go. - How cute.

871
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,120
He's following his dad.

872
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,490
Jung Woo keeps eating.

873
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,060
He wants to eat a gold medal already.

874
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,660
That family has experience with a marathon.

875
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,670
Eun Woo, be careful.

876
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,400
I can tell that his dad is a national athlete.

877
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,470
He has that DNA.

878
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,170
Yes, he definitely has that DNA.

879
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,350
You don't even look at me when I talk.

880
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,620
When Jung Woo was just over a year old...

881
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,380
They were influenced by their parents.

882
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,320
I think they'll win a gold medal today.

883
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,230
Come here. Follow me.

884
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,300
It's so cute that he already has a gold medal around his neck.

885
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,500
Jung Woo.

886
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
They're here. Hello. Say hello.

887
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,070
- Who is it? - Say hello.

888
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,840
- They're here. Everyone is here. - Ella.

889
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,610
- Hello. - Hello.

890
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,210
That mom is insanely athletic.

891
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,180
She's a global star.

892
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,310
That's right.

893
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,090
I prefer the exercises I can do consistently.

894
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,460
Exercising just ten minutes a day...

895
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,730
makes a difference in my body. That's how I maintain my figure.

896
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,930
Firstly, it's my goal to complete the run.

897
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,600
I want to run at full speed with Ella.

898
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,240
It's nice to see you.

899
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,370
- I know. Nice to see you. - Nice to see you.

900
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,840
I have terrible stamina. I don't enjoy exercising.

901
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,310
I especially have no confidence in running.

902
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,980
I worried a lot...

903
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,150
because I didn't know how difficult the marathon would be.

904
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,250
If I'm running alone, I can give up easily.

905
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,720
By looking at my children...

906
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,060
as well as other moms and children,

907
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,930
I'll gain energy and finish the marathon.

908
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,600
It gives you more willpower.

909
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,370
When you do it with your child, you don't give up.

910
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,840
- You're a mom. - It makes you work harder.

911
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,970
- Moms are strong. Dads are strong. - Yes.

912
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:18,410
Today, I'm here to practice with Si Woo.

913
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,550
Since I've never done this before, I'm very nervous.

914
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,090
I'm so exhausted.

915
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,530
I've run 2km.

916
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,300
When else would I get to run...

917
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,870
in the middle of the city that's full of traffic with Ella?

918
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,940
The course of the Stroller Run that's hosted by Seoul...

919
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,340
is 7km long.

920
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,350
The course takes you...

921
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,420
- along the main roads of Seoul. - That's right.

922
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,260
Children will run on those roads.

923
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,300
That's right. So it's meaningful to run on those roads.

924
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,860
It's nice to see children and families run together.

925
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,300
When else would you run on the Mapo Bridge...

926
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,070
- while pushing a stroller? - That's right.

927
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,100
That's right.

928
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,270
The meaning of the challenge and event is so nice.

929
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,140
- Let's go. - Let's go.

930
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,840
- Let's go. - Let's go.

931
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,980
Seriously.

932
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,320
What's the age difference?

933
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,220
Eun Woo was born in 2021, and Jung Woo was born in 2023.

934
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,890
Si Woo was born in 2022.

935
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,350
Ella was born in 2024.

936
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,220
- The years are 1, 2, 3, 4. - The years are 1, 2, 3, 4.

937
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,590
All of them are a year apart.

938
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,160
Hello.

939
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,100
- Hello. - Say hello.

940
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,260
Hello.

941
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,330
Hello.

942
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,080
"Here I go!"

943
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,680
No, that isn't yours.

944
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,650
- Dad! - There you go.

945
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,350
- They grew up strong. - Sons sure are different.

946
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,990
Hammer.

947
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,720
There you go!

948
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,560
Let's go!

949
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,860
There you go.

950
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,060
The two of them will have a match.

951
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,570
What will you do?

952
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,640
That's it.

953
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,310
- "What's wrong with them?" - She doesn't understand.

954
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,110
That's it.

955
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,180
Let's go.

956
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,580
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's set off.

957
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,420
It's time to set off.

958
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,720
First group, let's go.

959
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,890
There are so many people.

960
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,730
They'll run in groups.

961
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,830
There are many famous marathons around the world.

962
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,870
- Yes. Many people do it these days. - Yes.

963
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,770
There are so many marathons around the world.

964
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:03,870
In Seoul, Korea,

965
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,440
there's the Stroller Run that's on another level.

966
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,010
- About 25,000. - About 25,000.

967
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,750
So many people came.

968
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:12,950
- The road is full. - Yes.

969
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,580
That's more than the seats in the Seoul World Cup Stadium.

970
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,330
- What a lovely sight. - Children are running together.

971
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,800
Children love that, as it feels like they're on an amusement park ride.

972
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,740
Seo Bin screams when I pull her stroller.

973
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,870
She gets mad when I stop.

974
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,970
What's that? It's a dinosaur.

975
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,780
They're working hard.

976
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,110
They're wearing unique outfits with their children.

977
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,320
Let's go.

978
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,660
- Oh, my gosh. - How fast should we go?

979
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,430
- I don't know either. - How fast should we go?

980
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,060
Hello.

981
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,900
Jun Ho is competitive.

982
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,230
Perhaps they're running like crazy at the very front.

983
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,340
Jung Woo, why did you poop right before we set off?

984
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,240
- What? - Let's change the diaper and go.

985
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,270
Haven't they set off yet?

986
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:11,840
My goodness.

987
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:14,110
It can't be helped. It isn't something he can control.

988
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,350
Follow me.

989
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,650
There you go. Follow me.

990
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,920
He has been eating nonstop since morning.

991
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,250
He has been eating continuously.

992
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,820
My goodness.

993
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,990
You shouldn't eat before running.

994
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,260
Will you be okay?

995
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,430
There you go.

996
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,830
He had probiotics too.

997
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,700
That's a good supplement. He pooped right away.

998
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,560
Did you poop?

999
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,830
Running together would've given them stamina.

1000
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:40,970
Jung Woo will be refreshed.

1001
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,640
A care zone like that is very important anywhere.

1002
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,280
It looks nice.

1003
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,150
Let's go, kids. Are you guys ready?

1004
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,720
- Okay! - Okay!

1005
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,790
Thank you.

1006
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,120
- He's eating again. - It doesn't end.

1007
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,960
Here we go.

1008
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,360
Let's go.

1009
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,900
He's revving up.

1010
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,810
I'm running in the bus lane thanks to you guys.

1011
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,150
Since this is Eun Woo and Jung Woo's third marathon,

1012
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,550
they're relaxed.

1013
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,320
I don't think it'll be easy.

1014
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,490
Why is the uphill road never-ending?

1015
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,490
Why?

1016
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,490
Why is the uphill road never-ending?

1017
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,930
Kids, we'll need to walk.

1018
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,830
I think Jun Ho is a bit tired.

1019
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,070
What?

1020
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,110
It's comfortable for children. They sleep well.

1021
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,150
They sleep in a similar way...

1022
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,720
- because they're brothers. - That's right.

1023
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,620
I underestimated this marathon.

1024
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,820
My kids became heavier.

1025
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,960
How much do they weigh?

1026
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,760
How much does he weigh?

1027
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,570
There's over 7kg in combined weight.

1028
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,540
Kids, I underestimated this marathon.

1029
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,870
I underestimated it.

1030
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,570
Is the combined weight 31.7kg?

1031
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,910
My goodness.

1032
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,980
Still, I won't give up. I'll keep going.

1033
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,910
Jun Ho can't weigh much.

1034
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,720
He's pushing 31.7kg.

1035
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,290
Let's just not give up.

1036
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,890
- He ran 7km. - Did he run 7km in 28 minutes?

1037
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,400
- While pushing a stroller? - He moved through the wind.

1038
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,060
- Impressive. - He's impressive.

1039
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,070
Running alone is hard enough.

1040
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,870
That's right. He ran 7km.

1041
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,200
He's very competitive.

1042
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,970
- There he goes. Make way. - Let's go. Thank you.

1043
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,610
- Run. - Kim Jun Ho, let's go.

1044
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,710
Let's go.

1045
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,110
Good luck.

1046
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,340
Hello.

1047
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
- You're handsome. - Thank you.

1048
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,050
Hello.

1049
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,860
We've run 2km.

1050
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,760
We're at Chungjeong-ro now.

1051
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,130
- Traffic is heavy there. - Yes.

1052
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,330
The strollers make the place appear peaceful.

1053
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,330
You're right.

1054
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,440
The course is 7km long,

1055
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,670
so I'll run 4km in 20 minutes.

1056
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,510
It's hard to run without taking a break.

1057
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,650
He has stamina.

1058
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,950
- He's incredible. - He's incredible indeed.

1059
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,380
Jung Woo, we're at Gongdeok Station.

1060
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,490
If they take a detour and eat jokbal...

1061
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,390
at the Jokbal Alley, they'll be able to run better.

1062
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,620
The Jokbal Alley is good.

1063
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,160
They give you sundaeguk and tteokbokki. You know that, right?

1064
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,230
Of course.

1065
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,700
They should go there.

1066
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,060
They'll have energy to run if they eat some food.

1067
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,230
My mouth is watering.

1068
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,730
- I want to order a takeout. - It looks tasty.

1069
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,770
Jeon looks tasty too.

1070
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:06,310
One, two.

1071
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,140
- Did they wake up? - They woke up.

1072
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,340
There you go. Run slowly.

1073
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,150
It's refreshing.

1074
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,590
It isn't easy to walk on the road like this.

1075
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,790
He's grimacing.

1076
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,530
- Jung Woo entered a marathon... - Let's go.

1077
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,830
at the age of 12 months.

1078
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,000
He's careful.

1079
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,670
- He was a baby. - There you go. You're nearly there.

1080
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,140
- There you go. - My goodness.

1081
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,470
There you go.

1082
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,640
- One step. - There you go. You're nearly there.

1083
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,210
Be careful not to fall down.

1084
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,550
The baby who was toddling...

1085
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,950
is racing across the Mapo Bridge.

1086
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,420
- Children grow up fast. - Seriously.

1087
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,820
Children grow up fast.

1088
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,590
There you go. Run slowly.

1089
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,120
They're so cute.

1090
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,820
It isn't easy...

1091
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,830
for the dad and the sons to hold hands and run together.

1092
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:59,560
- They listen to their dad. - It really isn't easy.

1093
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,230
- They aren't going to places. - No.

1094
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,600
- A Tyrannosaurus... - What?

1095
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,170
stepped on this.

1096
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,970
What did he say? Jung Woo?

1097
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,010
A Tyrannosaurus...

1098
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,680
stepped on this.

1099
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,720
What did he say?

1100
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,320
"A Tyrannosaurus stepped on this."

1101
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,850
Did you hear that?

1102
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,390
"There are cracks because a Tyrannosaurus stepped on this."

1103
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,660
A Tyrannosaurus stepped on this.

1104
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,900
Jung Woo is imaginative.

1105
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,970
You're right.

1106
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,940
- We caught up! - What?

1107
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,170
Really?

1108
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,080
Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed sports.

1109
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,320
And I'm someone who is competitive.

1110
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,850
- She's good at running. - I ran as fast as I wanted.

1111
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,620
It felt so nice.

1112
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,560
It was better than I expected.

1113
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,860
She ran without stopping.

1114
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,560
Ella, it'll be Yeouido once we cross that bridge.

1115
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,470
Is it Yeouido already?

1116
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,570
Once you cross the Mapo Bridge, it's the finish line.

1117
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,610
- They came straight to Yeouido. - Yes.

1118
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,680
There are many nice places in Seoul.

1119
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,650
- It's KBS. - There it is.

1120
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,490
- That's where you speed up. - That's right.

1121
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,220
Yes. That's how you do it.

1122
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,460
The finish line is in Yeouido, right?

1123
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,860
That's right. It's a grand sight.

1124
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,360
Look at the Han River.

1125
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,500
It's a grand sight.

1126
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,970
Shall we give it the last spurt?

1127
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,570
- She runs well. - Ella's mom runs well.

1128
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,240
Ella is comfortable. It must be cool.

1129
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,210
Supermom still has it.

1130
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,420
Ella, let's go!

1131
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,150
The current first place is Ella's mom.

1132
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,590
The second place is Eun Woo's dad.

1133
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,290
Be careful.

1134
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,390
Eun Woo's dad set his jaw.

1135
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,630
- He's running at full speed. - Faster.

1136
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,030
- He's fast. - He isn't taking a break.

1137
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:17,670
He's going even faster.

1138
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,670
We'll take first place.

1139
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,400
Let's go.

1140
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,800
- Let's go. - Go.

1141
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,350
Where did your pacifier go?

1142
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,350
Did she drop her pacifier? Did she lose it in the wind?

1143
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,550
Oh, no. They were going too fast.

1144
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,090
Her mom was running too fast.

1145
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,490
Faster!

1146
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,860
Now, he might get ahead.

1147
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,260
- Passing through. - Oh, no!

1148
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,670
- Passing through. - Oh, no!

1149
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,270
Eun Woo's dad took 1st place for the 1st time.

1150
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,910
We're nearly there.

1151
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,980
- We're nearly there. - They're nearly there.

1152
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,750
What happened?

1153
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,090
- Dad, cheer up. - Okay.

1154
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,750
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1155
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,190
We reached the end.

1156
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,000
- My goodness. - They placed first.

1157
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,130
A national athlete sure is different.

1158
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,670
We reached the end.

1159
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,000
Yes!

1160
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,040
The sons must be proud.

1161
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,720
- It's so meaningful and worthwhile. - Yes.

1162
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,980
Families ran together.

1163
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,550
It's impressive that they finished the marathon.

1164
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,020
- Nice. - Yes.

1165
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,020
Well done.

1166
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,230
Ella, well done.

1167
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,690
"Ella, well done."

1168
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,400
Nice.

1169
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:58,870
Si Woo, you're cool.

1170
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,100
We finished the marathon!

1171
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,340
We finished the marathon without giving up.

1172
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,640
- Congratulations. - It'll be a good memory.

1173
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,680
Of course.

1174
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,780
Congratulations.

1175
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,090
They give a medal as well.

1176
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,890
Do they give it to everyone who finishes the marathon?

1177
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,820
You should put it around a child's neck.

1178
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,590
- Kim Jun Ho. - Kim Jun Woo?

1179
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,500
- Ho. - Ho? Okay.

1180
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,730
Gosh, he said it clearly.

1181
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,930
- Kim Jung Woo. - Yes.

1182
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,800
- Kim Eun Woo. - Kim Eun Woo.

1183
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,040
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1184
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,340
How polite.

1185
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,580
Please engrave "Choi Ella."

1186
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,910
- They're getting their names... - They offer that service.

1187
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,450
engraved on the medals.

1188
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,680
It's so fascinating.

1189
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,920
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1190
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,060
It's my name, Woo Hye Rim.

1191
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,790
They got their names engraved.

1192
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,390
I can't believe that such a marathon exists.

1193
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,800
Realising that there were...

1194
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,540
so many cool supermen and supermoms...

1195
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,370
gave me a lot of strength.

1196
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:13,140
When we raise children, there are times...

1197
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,740
we feel lonely.

1198
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,050
Today, I ran toward one direction...

1199
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,620
with so many moms, dads, and children.

1200
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,790
"We aren't the only ones who are raising children."

1201
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:27,890
"These people are raising children as well."

1202
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,590
I had that thought.

1203
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:32,890
I felt like I was running with my colleagues.

1204
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,600
- Let's go. - Let's go. Thank you.

1205
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,100
When I was walking with the kids, many people cheered me on.

1206
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,140
- Let's go. - Let's go. Thank you. Let's go.

1207
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,110
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1208
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,740
- Everyone cheered them on. - Yes.

1209
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,050
- The world is such a warm place. - Yes.

1210
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1211
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,560
- Dad, cheer up. - Let's go.

1212
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,300
Thanks to their cheers,

1213
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,730
we could finish the marathon.

1214
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,940
Why is there a crowd?

1215
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:19,980
- What? - Is there a performance as well?

1216
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,310
Who is he?

1217
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,220
Isn't he Hye Rim's husband?

1218
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,490
What's Min Cheol doing there?

1219
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,990
- Really? - Of course.

1220
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,030
- How cool. - He did so many turns.

1221
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,870
How many turns did he do?

1222
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,040
Boys will love watching that.

1223
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,710
They'll ask to take taekwondo lessons.

1224
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,980
Si Woo's dad is incredible.

1225
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,680
- He's flying. - What a kick.

1226
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,390
- He looks cool. - Yes.

1227
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,490
Min Cheol is no joke.

1228
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,560
What?

1229
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,760
- Who is it? - Who has his hands behind his back?

1230
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,060
Is that Si Woo?

1231
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,830
- He's good. - You do this...

1232
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,140
- and break it. - Will Si Woo take the stage?

1233
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:27,040
It was his first time performing on the stage.

1234
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,610
"Will my baby be able to do that?" I worried about that a lot.

1235
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,150
He can get nervous...

1236
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,980
- since there's a big audience. - That's right.

1237
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,250
- He isn't used to that. - No.

1238
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,150
It's different from doing a demonstration at home.

1239
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,890
Here it comes. Get ready.

1240
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,430
There he goes.

1241
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,090
Si Woo, let's go.

1242
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,000
Of course, it's nerve-racking for his mom.

1243
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,240
Go ahead.

1244
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,870
- There he goes. - There he goes.

1245
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,580
- Si Woo. - Show them, Si Woo.

1246
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,080
- It's insane. - Si Woo.

1247
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,010
His movements are controlled.

1248
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,750
- He's very good. - Yes.

1249
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,090
- Seriously. - He has a talent.

1250
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:11,320
There are so many people, though.

1251
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,230
Let's go.

1252
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,260
You're free.

1253
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,960
- Use your fist. - Break it.

1254
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,670
He's incredible.

1255
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,780
All right.

1256
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,590
Attention.

1257
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,650
Bow.

1258
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,290
- Well done. - Well done.

1259
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,990
- Si Woo, well done. - It was the best.

1260
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:50,860
His mom is Wonder Girls.

1261
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,660
- He has a talent. - He has a talent.

1262
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,130
- It's in his blood. - That must be it.

1263
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,070
- It's in his blood. - How fascinating.

1264
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,370
For your first child, do you want a daughter or a son?

1265
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,100
I want a son.

1266
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,400
Do you want a son? Why?

1267
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,440
He'll take good care of his younger sister.

1268
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,770
- Is that the reason? - Yes.

1269
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,680
Shall we go and eat?

1270
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,780
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1271
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,450
Please give me the menu.

1272
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,250
- "Please." - Why did he do this with his hands?

1273
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,490
Chinese food is nice.

1274
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,020
Do children eat Chinese food well?

1275
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,120
They love it.

1276
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,390
It looks like it's moving.

1277
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,500
Does it look like the fish is moving?

1278
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,370
They look tasty.

1279
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,540
Thank you for the food!

1280
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,570
Thank you for the food!

1281
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,510
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1282
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,550
Enjoy the food.

1283
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,380
- Thank you. - All right.

1284
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,820
While watching The Return of Superman, I was surprised...

1285
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,450
- by Jung Woo's eating show. - Jung Woo's eating show.

1286
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,390
- He eats with so much gusto. - That's right.

1287
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,190
He picked the tastiest dish.

1288
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,260
Jung Woo sure is different.

1289
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,400
It's crunchy.

1290
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,740
It's crunchy, right?

1291
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,910
He eats well on his own.

1292
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,580
- He savours the taste. - Right. He savours it.

1293
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:16,950
I finished it.

1294
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,710
- Did you finish it? - Yes.

1295
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:23,790
How do you do it?

1296
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,860
He's stealing Dad's food.

1297
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,860
Dad's food.

1298
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,500
- He eats with gusto. - It's nice that he eats well.

1299
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,500
Dad, I want jjajangmyeon.

1300
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,170
Why is he sticking out his tongue?

1301
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:50,980
He's so cute.

1302
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,350
- Most kids cut the noodles. - Yes.

1303
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,350
He slurped the noodles at once. He filled his mouth.

1304
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,790
- It's tasty to eat that way. - Yes.

1305
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,620
Watching him makes her want to eat.

1306
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,630
Why are you staring at Jung Woo?

1307
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,930
Excuse me.

1308
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,630
Please look at...

1309
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,900
Try it.

1310
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,500
It's too big.

1311
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:19,310
- Try it. - It's too big.

1312
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:22,540
- Try it. - It's Ella's first tangsuyuk.

1313
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,380
It's too big.

1314
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,050
- Try it. - It's too big.

1315
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,690
Why?

1316
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,290
Why isn't she eating it?

1317
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:35,560
Why isn't she eating it? Did he get rejected?

1318
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:39,560
Tangsuyuk from Jung Woo is a big gesture.

1319
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,300
That's right. Food from someone who loves to eat...

1320
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,000
- is everything. - That's right.

1321
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,600
Do you want an egg?

1322
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,740
It's just that Hui Seo has never had this dish before.

1323
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,340
If she doesn't accept this, let's stop.

1324
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,710
You have pride.

1325
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,270
You have pride.

1326
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,440
Here.

1327
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,780
Here.

1328
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,390
Here.

1329
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:06,420
Try a piece of egg.

1330
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,030
Will she eat it?

1331
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,760
She accepted it.

1332
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:15,560
Gosh, Jung Woo is nice.

1333
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:18,770
Ella too.

1334
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,670
She's so nice.

1335
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:22,970
He eats it.

1336
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,810
What?

1337
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,980
Thank you.

1338
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,250
Children swing their legs when they're happy.

1339
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,690
- We do that too. - Yes. We're the same.

1340
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,890
Ella, look outside.

1341
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,260
When it's windy,

1342
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,060
it's very cold.

1343
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,330
- Ella. - Do you like Jung Woo?

1344
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,540
They'll become close.

1345
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,670
Your daughter is so cute.

1346
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,440
I'm so jealous.

1347
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,720
Oh, my pork cutlet!

1348
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,350
Oh, my...

1349
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,290
pork cutlet!

1350
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,930
Oh, my pork cutlet!

1351
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,030
That came out of nowhere.

1352
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,600
Let's meet again next time.

1353
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,970
They're so cute.

1354
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,910
- Let's meet again. - Let's meet again.

1355
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,910
Seo Bang will join next time.

1356
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:39,410
I'll definitely try rice snacks.

1357
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,050
- Just how tasty are they? - For goodness' sake.

1358
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,320
Children like them, right?

1359
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,700
It doesn't taste like anything.

1360
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,930
- Why do children like it? - It's savoury.

1361
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,670
It doesn't taste like anything.

1362
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,700
- Children like rice snacks. - Rice snacks.

1363
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,170
Thank you for your love and support.

1364
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,340
There's special news for the viewers...

1365
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,910
who love The Return of Superman.

1366
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:09,940
Heart.

1367
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:13,310
Be careful not to catch a cold.

1368
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,990
Aunts and uncles, please come.

1369
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,220
Bye.

1370
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,790
- Bye. - Bye.

1371
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,260
Stragglers will be left behind!

1372
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:39,040
Oh, my pork cutlet!
