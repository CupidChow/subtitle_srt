1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,940
(From the forest of fancy skyscrapers...)

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,950
Seriously. They made the coolest
first appearance on our show.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,950
- That's Ella's family. Yes.
- It was like we were in Hollywood.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,090
- This was like Hollywood.
- She's so cool.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,950
(She turns her morning walk
into a photo shoot.)

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,460
How beautiful.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,160
They've gone viral
after appearing on our show.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,330
She's the hot girl of our show.

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,030
Ella's mother,
Yun Jee, is joining us today.

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,730
- Nice to see you.
- My gosh.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,770
I heard that
our show was also popular in Hollywood.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,200
- I heard. Yes.
- Yes.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,900
- Very. Super. It's going crazy.
- Yes.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,410
Everyone wants to watch it. Yes.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,610
- You're playing...
- Really?

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,810
an excellent role on our show.

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,680
(Laughing)

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,810
(Please support our show,)

19
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,510
(destined to be a global hit one day.)

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,250
The Return of Superman. Episode 590.

21
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,990
Clinging to the Final Days of Summer

22
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,050
Four families live under the same roof.

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,960
I wonder what's going to happen
with Ella's family today.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,160
(Episode 3: Under the Sky Without Mom)

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,030
(Beeping)

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,360
All right.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
- That's after your morning walk.
- We're here.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,060
(Ella is back from her morning walk.)

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,600
I take her out for a walk every morning...

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,230
before it gets too hot.

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,240
- Early in the morning?
- It's been so hot these days.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,140
(But the house seems a bit different.)

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,610
But the foyer seems a bit different
from the one we saw before.

34
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,940
We're back.

35
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,250
(Where is this place
that makes her feel at home?)

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,680
- We're back.
- Guess which floor we're on.

37
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,050
This is the ninth floor.

38
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,750
- Is it you, Hui Seo?
- Who is it?

39
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,290
- Is it you, Hui Seo?
- Our little puppy is here.

40
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,820
- We're back from the morning walk.
- You must be so hot.

41
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,920
- You must be hot.
- She punched in the passcode...

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,030
- as if this were her home.
- Right.

43
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,230
She knows the code to her in-laws' house.

44
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,590
What if her father-in-law...

45
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,200
was dressed only in underwear?

46
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,770
She just punched in the code
without a heads-up.

47
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,130
Sharing the passcodes is
a normal thing...

48
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,770
- for our family.
- I see.

49
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,970
That's how it is with us.

50
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,470
(Her parents-in-law live
on the 9th floor.)

51
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,540
(Ella's family lives on the 3rd floor.)

52
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,740
(When they come down
to see their granddaughter...)

53
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,980
(Beeping)

54
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,610
(they put in the passcode themselves.)

55
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,120
(Her grandparents from 9th floor
come to visit.)

56
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,650
(Beeping)

57
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,320
(Ella's maternal grandma
from the 1st floor)

58
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,990
(Beeping)

59
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,390
(Her nieces from the 10th floor
also put in the code.)

60
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,430
(Beeping)

61
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,590
(She does the same
when visiting their house.)

62
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,500
All right. We're here.

63
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,000
(The 4 families under the same roof
have no secrets.)

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,400
(As they visit each other's house
so frequently...)

65
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
- Yes.
- Everyone's always decent.

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,570
(That's the etiquette
of having a big family.)

67
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,970
Everyone is always dressed.

68
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,540
That's right.
No matter how hot it gets.

69
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,910
(Today, Ella is visiting
her grandparents' house.)

70
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,140
(9th floor:
Yun Jee's parents-in-law's house)

71
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,680
What a lovely family.

72
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,750
My gosh.

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,850
(The warm sunlight bathes
the cozy living room.)

74
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,190
Gosh, it looks so neat.

75
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,120
There's an unobstructed view,
so the house feels very open.

76
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,430
(A panoramic view of the Han River)

77
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,300
Since it's on the ninth floor,
the view does look much better.

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,500
(The sitting room and kitchen,
big enough for the big family)

79
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,770
(Ella's items are seen
all over the house.)

80
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,010
My gosh. By the way,

81
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,610
- even at her in-laws' house...
- Right.

82
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,740
Yes. They also have
a lot of Ella's baby items.

83
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,950
You can see how often she's there.

84
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,250
They must have the basics.

85
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,280
- The house is fully equipped.
- Right.

86
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,090
(A variety of fruit is ready
for Ella, the fruit lover.)

87
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,620
- Because Ella loves fruit?
- Yes.

88
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
(A variety of fruit is ready
for Ella, the fruit lover.)

89
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,520
Hey, my little puppy.
Why don't we play here together?

90
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,990
(Ella, just feel free to come by.)

91
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,290
- Yes.
- Oh, yes. That?

92
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,230
Mother, this is a new shirt
I bought. What do you think?

93
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,300
What?

94
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,300
Are you showing off
your new shirt...

95
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,570
- Yes.
- to your mother-in-law?

96
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,770
This gives it extra style.

97
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,910
This gives it extra style.

98
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,270
Gosh, that looks so cute.

99
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,470
- Right?
- Yes.

100
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,640
When you buy shirts like that,
buy one for me too.

101
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,680
Mother,
I have this shirt in black too.

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,980
- Really?
- I bought two.

103
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,550
(My daughter-in-law
is indeed considerate.)

104
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,650
- That...
- Oh, my.

105
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,050
sounds like a talk...

106
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,420
- between a daughter and a mom.
- That's right.

107
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,060
My mother-in-law and I share
a lot of clothes.

108
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,660
(Her mother-in-law's blouse)

109
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,930
- It's your mother-in-law's blouse?
- Really?

110
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,160
Yes. That's her blouse.

111
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,500
She wore my padded jacket
to appear on TV.

112
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,670
(She borrowed the jacket
from her daughter-in-law.)

113
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,440
I love that we can share clothes.

114
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,210
Sharing means I have more clothes.

115
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,340
- Gosh, you share clothes too?
- Really?

116
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,110
There's a height difference
between you two.

117
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,050
I bet it's not easy for her...

118
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,380
- to pull off your clothes.
- Right.

119
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,620
- She wears shoes with high heels.
- I see. She does.

120
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,520
- So when I wear them,
- That's her style?

121
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,720
they go perfectly with flats.

122
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,250
She's so hip.

123
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,360
And she loves oversized clothes.

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,530
That's why...

125
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,490
- she and I share clothes.
- That's lovely.

126
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,600
It's great that
you guys can share clothes.

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,070
(They have no problem
sharing clothes.)

128
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,230
Hui Seo. Say, "Grandma."

129
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,300
(Ella is playing with her grandma.)

130
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,340
My dear Hui Seo.

131
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,570
Are you dancing?

132
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,340
You're so good.

133
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,680
My gosh.

134
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,610
Did she make barley tea?

135
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,910
My gosh. Oh, my.

136
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,020
(She opens the fridge as if
she had done it a million times.)

137
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,520
When did she prepare all this?

138
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,950
This looks so good.

139
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,690
You opened it
without any inhibitions.

140
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,960
"Did she make barley tea?"

141
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,420
You opened the fridge
just like that.

142
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,160
I love barley tea.

143
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,830
She always brews it
and keeps it in the fridge.

144
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,970
She looks so relaxed
at her in-laws' house.

145
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,070
She's enjoying the view outside too.

146
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,700
The view looks amazing there.

147
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,170
- It's like you're at a fancy hotel.
- My gosh.

148
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,600
- I'm admiring the view.
- Yes.

149
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,870
She's taking her sweet time
to drink that.

150
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,380
It's a relaxing day
at your in-laws' house.

151
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,540
A relaxing day
at your in-laws' house?

152
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,610
You're like their daughter.

153
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,750
- Right.
- Totally.

154
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,880
With my marriage,
they've legally become my family.

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,090
But even before that,
I felt like we were already a family.

156
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,150
I used to call my mother-in-law Aunt...

157
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,790
and my father-in-law Uncle all my life.

158
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,530
- So...
- Right. Then they are...

159
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,760
- like your biological family.
- Right.

160
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,900
You now understand why I'm living
in the same building, right?

161
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,570
See if you can walk, Ella.

162
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,500
- Come on, walk.
- Between...

163
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,340
(It was 1 day
before her 1st birthday party.)

164
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,480
(Toddling)

165
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,680
(Ella took a few steps
all on her own.)

166
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,920
(Dozing off)

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
(Ella is walking!)

168
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,890
(As he was busy dozing off,)

169
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,490
(he missed seeing
Ella take her first steps.)

170
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,660
(I'll finally get
to see that today!)

171
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,630
- My gosh.
- There you go.

172
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,800
- Look at her go.
- She's good.

173
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,640
- You're so good at walking now.
- Gosh.

174
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
(Her grandma is happy.)

175
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,270
There you go.

176
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,910
- My gosh.
- Yes, that's it.

177
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,310
- There you go.
- She grew more in the meantime.

178
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,380
(She walks into her grandma's arms.)

179
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,280
My gosh.

180
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,650
(She walks into her grandma's arms.)

181
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,950
She started to move around
and take a few steps on her own.

182
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,920
- How beautiful.
- She took a lot of steps.

183
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,150
How beautiful.

184
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,920
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

185
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,090
He must be so happy to see
his little granddaughter walking.

186
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,890
Mother, you know the pose
for forward rolls, right?

187
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,690
- Yes.
- She keeps putting her head...

188
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,700
between her legs like the pose.

189
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
- Really?
- Yes.

190
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,300
- I... My gosh.
- Gosh, look at her.

191
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,870
This is the pose. Hui Seo.

192
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,900
- Peekaboo.
- What's she doing?

193
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,340
- She keeps doing that.
- My gosh.

194
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
(This pose is...)

195
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,470
- It means she'll have a sibling.
- Really?

196
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,040
- Yes. She...
- If she does this pose?

197
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,980
But she's been doing this
all the time lately.

198
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,750
Gosh. Then she'll have a brother.

199
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,750
- Peekaboo.
- This pose...

200
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,080
People say that means
the couple will have a son.

201
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,850
- Really?
- Hui Seo, you'll have a sibling.

202
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,890
- That's the pose.
- Don't do that so often.

203
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,120
Hui Seo, you'll have a sibling.

204
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,290
Don't do that so often.

205
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,890
- Grandma is here.
- Peekaboo.

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,160
- Why are you so funny?
- Look. Try it.

207
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
Hui Seo, what will I do with you?

208
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,800
Peekaboo.

209
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,360
(I'm doing this
because I find this funny.)

210
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,530
- Hold on.
- I see.

211
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,570
Are you keeping
your second pregnancy a secret again?

212
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,170
Who knows? I kept my pregnancy
a secret until the eighth month...

213
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,240
when I was carrying Ella.

214
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,470
(2 months and 3 months into pregnancy)

215
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,110
- You were pregnant then?
- You were pregnant?

216
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,110
Yes.

217
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,010
- Did they Photoshop... What's this?
- What?

218
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,010
You were six months pregnant
in the picture?

219
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,180
Six months?

220
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,220
- Gosh, she looks beautiful.
- You were six months pregnant?

221
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,320
What if she reveals it
in her last month of pregnancy?

222
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,790
(Promise that you'll break the news
on our show!)

223
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,630
Father, can I ask you for a favor?

224
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes, go ahead.

225
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,300
Could you feed Hui Seo?

226
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,700
- Feed her? We got it.
- Yes.

227
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,530
- Actually, feeding babies...
- I brought...

228
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,240
- everything.
- is the hardest job.

229
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,640
The thing is, I take Ella out...

230
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,740
for our morning walk on an empty stomach.

231
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,270
- I get hungry.
- Of course, you get hungry.

232
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,810
That's why I went up to the ninth floor,
not my house.

233
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,110
I still envy you.

234
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,780
- Right.
- I'm dying out of envy.

235
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,420
You'll drink it on your own again?

236
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,050
- From that?
- She can drink it all on her own.

237
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,090
Ella loves barley tea too.

238
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,320
(While Ella feeds herself...)

239
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,330
(Is this a fridge?
Or a treasure chest, perhaps?)

240
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,490
It's a treasure chest.

241
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,200
- Gosh.
- There's a lot of food inside.

242
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
There's so much food.

243
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,800
- She's known to be a great cook.
- And she cooks big portions too.

244
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,900
- My gosh.
- Yes.

245
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,400
There's kimchi too.

246
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,840
(Thanks to her parents-in-law,
she can prepare her meal at ease.)

247
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,610
(Braised ribs)

248
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,750
This looks so good.

249
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,380
- Yun Jee.
- Yes.

250
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,290
Make sure to have
the seasoned pickled cucumbers...

251
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,720
and mulkimchi.

252
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,360
- Okay, Mother.
- Okay.

253
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,290
When did you have the time
to cook the seaweed soup?

254
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,330
I cooked it last night.

255
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,790
It has beef in it.

256
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,060
This is the breakfast service.
That's how I would describe this.

257
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,970
- It looks like a bed and breakfast.
- Right.

258
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,400
(Is this also how it's done
in Hollywood?)

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,940
(A meal cooked with the love
from her mother-in-law)

260
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,010
This is so good.

261
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,170
- My gosh.
- There are braised ribs too.

262
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,380
Oh, my.

263
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,510
- Isn't that a birthday meal?
- Thank you for the food, Mother.

264
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,350
- Enjoy your breakfast. Eat a lot.
- My gosh.

265
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,850
I haven't had a peaceful breakfast
in a while.

266
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,320
(The mom enjoys her meal at peace.)

267
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,390
It was so good.

268
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm so envious.

269
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,190
(The mom enjoys her meal at peace.)

270
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,530
(But Ella seems fussy
during her meal.)

271
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
See if you can eat it on your own.

272
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,400
- She can eat on her own?
- Gosh, look at you eat.

273
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
- She's grown a bit.
- Good girl.

274
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,740
She's trying to feed herself
with the spoon.

275
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,610
You wanted to eat that on your own,
Hui Seo.

276
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,110
Here.

277
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,310
Look at you eat.

278
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,180
(Ella can have her meal
all on her own.)

279
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,650
Good girl.

280
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,250
(I'll give you moral support.)

281
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,820
My gosh.

282
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,250
Have one more spoonful.

283
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,290
(Will that be enough
to fill you up?)

284
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,120
- Okay.
- Food.

285
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,330
Okay. We should give this to her.

286
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,490
No.

287
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,730
- Blueberries.
- Oh, my. Grandpa.

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,130
No, not yet.

289
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,270
- She just started having her food.
- Right.

290
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,170
- Not yet.
- She won't eat her food now.

291
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,000
- Right.
- Blueberries.

292
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
No.

293
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,470
Put them back down.

294
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,010
She'll have them
after she finishes her meal.

295
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,280
- Hui Seo, here's your food.
- Oh, no.

296
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,610
- She can have some.
- Come on.

297
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,650
Here's your food.

298
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,950
- She can have some.
- Come on.

299
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,780
- You can't show them to her now.
- Okay.

300
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,980
I know. But she always says no
when I want to give you something.

301
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,620
No. She won't eat her food...

302
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,350
- if she sees them.
- He's getting scolded again.

303
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,020
She must finish her meal first.

304
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,120
No. Look at me.

305
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,860
- The moment she sees them...
- Here's your food.

306
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,590
Hui Seo doesn't eat her food.

307
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,460
My goodness. How can you bring them
when she hasn't finished her food?

308
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,860
(He's never helpful.)

309
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,600
I can neither
feed you blueberries...

310
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,540
- nor spoil you.
- My gosh. Good girl.

311
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,040
There's nothing I can do
even when I'm with you.

312
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,770
What a good girl you are.

313
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:43,050
(Ella has a big, happy family
which is a rarity these days.)

314
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,520
(As Ella has a big family,
she always has company.)

315
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,750
(Ella's cousins)

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,490
(All 4 families are experts
at taking care of babies.)

317
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,630
(Experienced and loving babysitters
are always with Ella.)

318
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,300
Ella's eyes are gleaming.

319
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,670
It looks like
he's on an isolated island.

320
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,070
Oh, no.
Why does he look so sad again?

321
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,570
(I desperately want to play
with my granddaughter too.)

322
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,740
(Lee Sang Hae,
a solitary man in a big family)

323
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,550
(Is something going on?)

324
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,750
- You heard them talk.
- Yes. I got curious.

325
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,590
How much of your meal
did you finish?

326
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,890
She ate quite a lot for her meal.

327
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,120
- She did eat a lot.
- Yes.

328
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,260
- Not yet.
- Food.

329
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,960
- Yes. Give me some food.
- Give it to her.

330
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,760
- I'm having my food over there,
- How sweet.

331
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,830
my princess.

332
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,600
Come here, honey.

333
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,870
There's nothing he can do.

334
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,130
- I think he's sulking a bit.
- Yes.

335
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,370
Father, could you give
some fruit to Hui Seo?

336
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,740
(You can give her some fruit now,
Father.)

337
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,810
Hui Seo loves her food.

338
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,150
(At last)

339
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,850
- Clap, Hui Seo.
- There you go.

340
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,250
(Grandpa,
let's have fruit together.)

341
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,420
You're the best.

342
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,690
- What's this?
- What is this?

343
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,390
- What is that?
- What is this?

344
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
- He has bananas.
- What's this?

345
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,590
- There are bananas, your favorite.
- Bananas.

346
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,730
Her favorite fruits are
bananas and blueberries.

347
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,730
(I love bananas.)

348
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,770
She looks so funny.

349
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,930
- Hey.
- Bananas are the best.

350
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,470
- They are nice and sweet.
- She's so funny.

351
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,700
- Look at her.
- Gosh.

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,170
(When she eats her food...)

353
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,170
- That's how she looks?
- Good girl.

354
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,340
Do you like bananas that much?

355
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,710
(But when she eats bananas...)

356
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,010
Her facial expression changes.

357
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,720
She's so happy to be eating bananas.

358
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
- She got a taste of the sweetness.
- Do you like bananas that much?

359
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,890
- She lights up whenever she sees...
- How cute.

360
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,190
- bananas from afar.
- I see.

361
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,060
- You're so happy with the bananas.
- She's in a good mood now.

362
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,830
My gosh. Look at my beautiful girl.

363
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,300
(Ella's smile makes
her grandpa happy.)

364
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,870
How cute.

365
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
Father.

366
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,110
She looks just like you.

367
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,740
Gosh, I...

368
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,380
- Gosh. I can't believe this.
- My gosh.

369
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,610
(Whichever you look at her,
she's the spitting image of him.)

370
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,320
My gosh. But still.
I can't be as beautiful as her.

371
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,750
(But I'm happy about that.)

372
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,220
- She looks just like her grandpa.
- How cute.

373
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,660
Whenever she makes this funny face,

374
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,830
- she resembles him even more.
- Right.

375
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,430
(Clearly, she has his genes.)

376
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,530
My gosh

377
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,440
- Three generations of Lee Sang Hae.
- Yes.

378
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,410
That's a funny way of putting it.

379
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,840
(3 generations of Lee Sang Hae)

380
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,940
Hui Seo, when will you put this on
and go to school?

381
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,150
Right.

382
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,310
(But something is off.)

383
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,420
Come here.

384
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,390
But where did your grandpa go,
Hui Seo?

385
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,390
- Yes. He's not in the living room.
- Where did he go?

386
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,720
He disappeared without a word.

387
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,100
(Oh, no. Where on earth did he go?)

388
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,470
- Why don't we call him?
- Let's call him.

389
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,470
He must've gone down again.

390
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,610
- Go down where?
- He disappears without a word.

391
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,110
But it looks like
they all know where he went.

392
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,080
(His family must be used to this
and know where he went.)

393
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,480
Right. That's...

394
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,610
Hui Seo.
Say, "Where did you go, Grandpa?"

395
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,780
(She's calling her father-in-law
who's left the house.)

396
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,880
He's not answering his phone.

397
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,520
- Hello.
- Father.

398
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,820
Am I dead or something?

399
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,160
Why are you yelling?

400
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,330
Well,

401
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,330
you're having coffee
on the first floor, right?

402
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,460
Right.

403
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,030
On the first floor?

404
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,100
Give me one too.

405
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,640
Don't put your hands on his mouth.
It's nasty.

406
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,210
- "Nasty?"
- "Nasty?"

407
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,110
- He doesn't wash often. So no.
- What?

408
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,680
(You say no
to everything related to me.)

409
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,410
- Come on.
- Oh, no. Poor Sang Hae.

410
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,750
- How did this happen?
- Gosh.

411
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,920
How did you end up
with a nasty mouth?

412
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,090
He's treated like a walking germ.

413
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,490
(I don't even want to see
the back of his head sometimes.)

414
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,890
(The same goes for me.)

415
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,800
(The reality of a couple
who's been married for 47 years)

416
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,540
(When he gets a piece of fruit
from his granddaughter...)

417
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,610
(Let's wash your hands.
He's dirty. This isn't good.)

418
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,940
(She scolds him for being dirty.)

419
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,410
She must associate him
with the word, nasty.

420
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,750
(You can't hold her like that.)

421
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,590
(Polite)

422
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,560
(Getting scolded
is a part of his daily life.)

423
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,990
- Gosh, right.
- What's going on?

424
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,590
Look at you eat.

425
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,860
(On the other hand, there's so much love
between Ella and her.)

426
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,570
- He'll give this to you.
- I should give it to you too.

427
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,370
- Food.
- I should feed you too.

428
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,740
Why did you tell me
to come over then?

429
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,380
Seriously. When my wife's there,
there's nothing I can do.

430
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,910
She does everything.

431
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,580
Her hands are tied, though.

432
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,980
- That's how it is with babies. Yes.
- He's a bit disappointed.

433
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Had I known, I would have...

434
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,950
(Grandpa Goes Out)

435
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,460
Did he go to a place
where he might find some comfort?

436
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,530
He had to leave his grand house.

437
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,760
(There's a sad story about
the 1st-floor security office.)

438
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,430
- Gosh.
- Where is this place?

439
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,300
- Oh, no.
- That's the security office.

440
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,270
Is he having instant coffee...

441
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,530
- in the security office?
- That's right.

442
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,400
That's like the reception room
for our building.

443
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,010
(A security office
that works as a reception room)

444
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,610
We always say hello
to the security guard...

445
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,210
when we go in
and out of the building.

446
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,910
I'd say, "Hello, sir."

447
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,010
Then often times,
he turns out to be my father-in-law.

448
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,380
I'd say then,
"Father, you're here again."

449
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,450
(The security office is
my father-in-law's hideout.)

450
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,820
Come on up now.

451
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,290
- Please come on up.
- Come up.

452
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,260
Living together is the toughest thing.
Okay.

453
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,290
Okay.

454
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,390
(Ella's grandpa comes back home.)

455
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,960
- He's back. We got it, sir.
- Okay.

456
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

457
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,440
Yun Jee. Why were you looking for me?

458
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,700
Why were you looking for me?

459
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,310
- Father.
- Why?

460
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,540
Actually,

461
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,040
- I have work today.
- Yes.

462
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,350
Could you look after Ella for a bit?

463
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,380
Can I go out for work?

464
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,410
- I'll try to hurry back.
- Hey.

465
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,250
I might be in the middle of something.

466
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,290
But I'll drop everything and come
if it concerns Ella. Okay?

467
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,820
I'll drop everything and come. Okay?

468
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,290
- You must be so happy.
- Got it?

469
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,420
Ongheya

470
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,690
- It's been a while.
- Ongheya

471
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,360
(Grandpa is feeling awesome.)

472
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,030
(Let's not forget that
he was a legendary comedian.)

473
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,910
(His legendary catchphrase, ongheya)

474
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,670
(Laughing)

475
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,510
(He shows off his special act
at the thought of being with Ella.)

476
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,850
- He's that happy?
- There it is

477
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,210
- Don't go anywhere now.
- Grandpa.

478
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,950
- Ongheya
- Okay.

479
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,020
- Where does he want to go?
- There it is

480
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,790
(He's got to be kidding me.)

481
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,290
(Let me escort Princess Ella
in the stroller.)

482
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,490
My gosh. He's bringing
the stroller into the house.

483
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,560
- Father, that stroller...
- Why...

484
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,160
- has been outside.
- That's for outdoor use.

485
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,070
Why did he bring that inside?

486
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
- My gosh.
- It's Hui Seo's stroller.

487
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
So we can take it everywhere we go.

488
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,970
But we have to clean the wheels.

489
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,610
- Come here.
- But Grandpa...

490
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,880
will do anything for you
as long as it makes you happy.

491
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,950
Then go to the third floor
in the stroller, my princess.

492
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,750
- Okay.
- Bye.

493
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,380
Ella, I'll be back. Bye.

494
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,150
Good girl. Wave at your mom.

495
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,220
- Ongheya
- Bye.

496
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,890
(We can play together, Ella.)

497
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,390
- Bye.
- He's feeling better now.

498
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,430
- She put her feet up again.
- Bye.

499
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,430
Bye, Ella.

500
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,600
(Bye, Mom!)

501
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,870
That's it.

502
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,100
- She can blow air kisses too?
- The air kisses.

503
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,570
(Ella is in a good mood already.)

504
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,170
When Ella seems to like something,

505
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,340
he does it for her no matter what.

506
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,610
Lately, Ella has been brimming
with energy .

507
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,280
Sometimes,
it gets difficult even for me.

508
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,420
I wonder how my father-in-law
will take care of Ella.

509
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,320
(How will her father-in-law
look after Ella?)

510

(The challenge for Lee Sang Hae,)

511
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,220
(the comedian
with 62 years of experience)

512
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,560
(Make Ella laugh.)

513
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,330
(The grandpa has gone mad
for his granddaughter.)

514
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,760
(Sang Hae spices up
the comedy scene...)

515
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,300
(that's lost some of its edge.)

516
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,870
- This is news to you too, right?
- Right.

517
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,000
(The father of comedy
does things differently indeed.)

518
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,140
That's the sneak peek
to how he took care of Ella.

519
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,910
(What do you know
about slapstick comedy?)

520
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,580
(He doesn't spare his body.)

521
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,610
Sang Hae.

522
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,080
(The class of the original comedian)

523
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,650
(Ella Choi, 13 months old,
the granddaughter with no laughter)

524
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,550
(It's not easy
to make my granddaughter laugh.)

525
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,220
(Making people laugh is my job,
though.)

526
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,520
I can't wait to check it out.

527
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,260
(Will Sang Hae manage to look
after her in his golden years?)

528
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,660
(Heading down to Ella's house
on the 3rd floor from the 9th floor)

529
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,330
There are more toys and baby items
in my house.

530
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,530
- So they looked after her...
- Hui Seo.

531
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,970
- in my house.
- Could you make food for me?

532
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,070
(Ella is playing
with her toy kitchen.)

533
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,100
She's playing with her toy kitchen.

534
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,470
- Food.
- Yes, food.

535
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,470
- Gosh.
- Food.

536
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,170
- Food.
- Yes, food.

537
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,540
- That's her favorite toy now.
- Make food. Okay.

538
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,980
- Hui Seo.
- Thank you.

539
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,420
(Why are you playing
only with your grandma?)

540
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,980
Please make it fast.

541
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,850
(Ella is glued to her grandma
thanks to the play kitchen.)

542
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,120
Thank you.

543
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
(Ella is glued to her grandma
thanks to the play kitchen.)

544
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,800
(I desperately want
to play with her.)

545
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,170
There isn't an opening
for him to join them.

546
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,400
- He really wants to play with her.
- Right.

547
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
But there's no opening.

548
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,710
Hui Seo.

549
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,380
(He made everyone laugh
with his slapstick comedy act.)

550

I'm Lee Sang Hae,)

(the comedian
with 62 years of experience.)

552

Hui Seo.

553
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,250
(Today,
I'll hunt down Hui Seo's laughter.)

554
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,650
(Ella)

555
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,390
(Why are you calling me?)

556
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,090
- I did everything you like.
- Hui Seo.

557
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,220
Look at me.

558
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,190
(Pulling his shirt)

559
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,990
- Why is he suddenly taking it off?
- Why is he doing that?

560
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,330
(What's Grandpa doing?)

561
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,800
What's he preparing for?

562
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,300
- What's that? Gosh.
- Ta-da.

563
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,970
- What's that?
- What's that?

564
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,870
(His secret weapon, a cute T-shirt)

565
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,210
What is that?

566
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,410
(Laughing)

567
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,410
- What does it say?
- Look at your grandpa.

568
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,810
- "Who's the cutest mouse?"
- My gosh.

569
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,180
- "You-mouse."
- "You-mouse."

570
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,910
- "You-mouse."
- My gosh.

571
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,380
Can she read?

572
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,880
No.

573
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,090
But she does like shirts with
cartoon characters and drawings.

574
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,460
And I'll put this on.

575
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,130
He's also putting on a colorful hat.

576
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,230
Look at your grandpa.

577
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,400
- Gosh.
- That was random.

578
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
(All of a sudden,
he starts dancing.)

579
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,240
(His signature act has made
its way back after 30 years.)

580
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,940
What's he doing?

581
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Hui Seo.

582
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,640
(Ella freezes out of shock.)

583
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,110
- Gosh. Why...
- What's he doing?

584
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,680
- Ella, show him some reaction.
- My gosh, why...

585
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,580
- She even dropped her toy.
- What's he doing? Hui Seo.

586
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,380
She's watching him in a daze.

587
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,820
- I'm going crazy.
- "I'm going crazy."

588
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,820
(The 81-year-old grandpa desperately
tries to make her laugh.)

589
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,020
You know what?
He's not the type to act silly like that.

590
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,960
- Oh, no.
- All of a sudden...

591
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,500
- Gosh.
- What?

592
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,460
- Oh, no.
- He was trying to do something...

593
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,130
- for Ella.
- Right.

594
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,170
Give me some food.

595
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,500
(But Ella and her grandma
still seem so affectionate.)

596
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,700
Thank you.

597
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,110
My dear granddaughter,
cook something for me.

598
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,980
There's a sense of disconnection.

599
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,780
All right.

600
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,920
She was about to play with me.
But you just won't let her.

601
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,450
- Right.
- He's disappointed right now.

602
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,820
- She's the one...
- Yes.

603
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,220
- mostly taking care of Ella.
- Yes.

604
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Right.

605
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,790
(Sang Hae starts hunting down the toys
again.)

606
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,190
(I'll go with this!)

607
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,600
My gosh.

608
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,060
- What's that?
- Let's see.

609
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,930
- He's going for a ride this time.
- Look at him.

610
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,070
He's playing with your toy.

611
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,230
(Displeased)

612
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,870
- He's playing with your toy.
- It seems she's worried...

613
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,210
- that he might break the toy.
- Look.

614
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,310
(Hop on this ride and play with me.)

615
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,010
Say no. Say, "No, Grandpa."

616

(Staring)

617
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,880
Tell him not to play with it
because it's yours.

618
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,750
(I'll come and pick you up, Ella.)

619
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,320
- Gosh.
- Oh, no. Sang Hae.

620
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,550
(Bumping)

621
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,620
Oh, no. Sang Hae.

622
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,220
That's funny.

623

(The living history
of the comedy industry)

624

(The master
of the first slapstick comedy acts)

625
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,730
Seriously. He's the master
of slapstick comedy.

626
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,400
My gosh.

627
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,000
There are clips of his performances.

628
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,140
(Lee Sang Hae, the comedian
with 62 years of experience)

629
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,410
(How Sang Hae Does Slapstick Comedy
for His Granddaughter)

630
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,180
- Ella, please laugh this time.
- Gosh.

631
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,750
- Please.
- Will she laugh?

632
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,220
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

633
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,250
Oh, no.

634
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,020
(Ella, am I not funny?)

635
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,850
- What's he going to do?
- Oh, no.

636
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,260
Look at me climbing up.

637
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,460
It's a different act.

638
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Oh, no.

639
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,530
- My gosh.
- No!

640
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,330
(Showing no reaction)

641
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,130
(How about now?)

642
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,740
He'll do it until Ella laughs.

643
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,200
(Still showing no reaction)

644
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,740
What's he wearing this time?

645
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,840
Is he going for a hip-hop look
this time?

646
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,740
(No, Grandpa.)

647
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,350
How do you do this hip-hop thing
young kids are doing these days?

648
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,850
He must've changed his approach...

649
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,180
- to be more hip.
- Right.

650
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,350
(Is this how you do it?)

651
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,450
That's the hip-hop dance?

652
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,590
(Ella, are you ready to have fun?)

653
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,690
All right.

654
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,230
(Let's go!)

655
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,200
(I'm Sang Hae with no brakes.)

656
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,030
- Oh, no.
- This is hip-hop.

657
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,630
What are you doing?

658
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,570
- That's pretty close.
- What's your grandpa doing?

659
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,340
What's wrong with him?

660
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,840
(What is that?)

661
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,940
- What?
- She doesn't like it.

662
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,340
- It's so hard to make her laugh.
- I've tried so many things.

663
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,740
- But she doesn't like anything.
- Yes, it's hard.

664
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
I've done many similar things
in front of my son too.

665
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,450
- Yes.
- But kids...

666
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,610
- don't react.
- Why is she scared?

667
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,950
- Right.
- Gosh.

668
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,980
(This is making me sad.)

669
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,250
(Here's a little bit about me
from the old days.)

670
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,590
(The master of slapstick comedy)

671
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,820
(The ratings for his TV show
were well over 50 percent.)

672
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,730
Right. He could make
everyone in the country laugh.

673
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,630
(I could make everyone in Korea
laugh with one act.)

674
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,430
Seriously. His act
used to make everyone burst into laughter.

675
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,870
- Totally.
- Yes.

676
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
(The more he tries,
the more distant he feels from her.)

677
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,340
They feel more distant
from each other now.

678
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,340
(Will her grandpa give up like this?)

679
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,640
(Looking around)

680
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,310
(He paces back and forth
in the kitchen.)

681
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,910
(Lee Sang Hae is back!)
My gosh. What's he doing?

682
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,050
- He's trying something new.
- My gosh. What's he doing?

683
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,120
What's he doing?

684
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
(He's not drunk.)

685
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,920
His wife is loving that.

686
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,320
(Completely lost in his act)

687
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,860
(Respecting his senior comedian)

688
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,630
Oh, no.

689
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,660
(Completely lost in his act)

690
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,670
(Staggering)

691
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,070
(Please give me some attention.)

692
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,770
(The 81-year-old grandpa's love...)

693
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,110
(for his granddaughter bring tears.)

694
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,810
Only his wife is loving that.

695
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,110
Oh, no. Only my mother-in-law
is loving his act. My goodness.

696
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,750
My gosh. Seriously.

697
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
(He climbs over the fence
and approaches the audience.)

698
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,250
(Lee Sang Hae's show must go on
for Ella.)

699
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,720
Wait.

700
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,660
My mother-in-law
must've fallen for his funny side...

701
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,060
- and married him.
- What should I do?

702
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,730
You know what? He's still funny.

703
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,730
But Ella isn't laughing. Oh, no.

704
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,970
Look at your grandpa.

705
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,000
Hui Seo, look at your grandpa.

706
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,500
- Hui Seo, your grandpa is sleeping.
- Oh, my.

707
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
(Dozing off)

708
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,140
(The laughter hunter's energy
is drained.)

709
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,740
I saw this coming.

710
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,910
He did a lot of things.

711
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,210
- He's dozing off now.
- Right.

712
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,950
- Her grandpa is sleeping.
- He's sleeping.

713
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,880
Yes, her grandpa is dozing off.

714
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,820
He's in a deep sleep.

715
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,090
(I knew he was overdoing it.)

716
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,920
Let's wake him up.

717
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,290
What?

718
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,760
(Here's a little bit
about Ella's grandma.)

719
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,430
(She started singing gugak
at the age of 19.)

720
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,670
(Kim Young Im,
the gifted singer of Korea)

721
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,710
(Janggu has always been
a part of her performances.)

722
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,510
(I'm the queen of janggu!)

723
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,320
- What a lovely sound.
- Yes.

724
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,190
(Grandpa, wake up already!)

725
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,890
This is like his sleeping music.

726
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,960
(Startled)

727
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,220
- That was sudden.
- That was sudden.

728
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,660
- That was sudden?
- In the middle of his nap?

729
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
(He starts clapping to the rhythm
and pretends he's been awake.)

730
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,200
He always feels embarrassed
when that happens.

731
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,770
So when he wakes up,
he pretends he didn't fall asleep.

732
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,540
Hi.

733
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,540
- Long time.
- How are you?

734
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,340
Is everything okay?

735
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,440
Last time I saw you,

736
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,180
- Just...
- she was only...

737
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,580
- She was 3 months old.
- Yes, she was like 3 months old.

738
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,820
And now, she's over one year old.

739
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,050
Can she speak now?

740
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,620
She goes, "Mama."

741
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,420
- "Mama."
- "Papa."

742
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,650
- "Papa."
- "Papa."

743
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,060
Just a few words.

744
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,730
But being able to communicate
with her...

745
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,830
- is very nice. Yes.
- So cute.

746
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,160
(He's conversing in English
with Yun Jee.)

747
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,630
(Yamazaki Daisuke,
President of Michael Kors Korea)

748
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,900
You brought us
a lot of new customer data.

749
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,040
Thank you so much.

750
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,240
I'm really happy to do this again...

751
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,110
- Thank you.
- with another success...

752
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,340
for Michael Kors.

753
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,750
It's my pleasure.

754
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,850
She turned into an actress.
Now she acts too.

755
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,520
- That's right. She acts too.
- She's a versatile super mom.

756
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,490
(Actress Kim Yun Jee is
a world star!)

757
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,920
She really is world-famous.

758
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,960
- Indeed. She has everything.
- My, she looks gorgeous.

759
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,330
(Actress Kim Yun Jee is
a world star!)

760
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,060
(As if it were to prove her class
as a world star...)

761
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,830
Oh, there's Mom Yun Jee.

762
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,030
- You're working your main job now.
- Yes.

763
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,510
(The world star super mom's main job
will be revealed!)

764
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,740
Seriously, she never rests.

765
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,380
- Exactly.
- She never rests.

766
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,210
Oh, my. She looks amazing.

767
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,020
(Shining)

768
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,950
It's not easy to keep your figure...

769
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,390
while raising a child.

770
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,490
My point, exactly.

771
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,390
She looks so amazing
when she works her main job.

772
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,760
- Of course.
- Yes.

773
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,800
(Is she really a mom?)

774

(She looks gorgeous
from all angles.)

- She looks great as always.
- She's totally...

776
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
Is she in New York?

777
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,370
She looks so stylish.

778
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,540
She doesn't look like a mom.

779
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,540
She's so pretty.

780
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,740
(Thanks to her parents-in-law,
she's giving it her all.)

781
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,050
She's so cool.

782
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,610
My goodness. She has everything.

783
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,420
She's fluent in English
and has a great body.

784
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,720
She also has a pretty face.

785
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,350
(It's still hot in Korea.)

786
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:42,130
(But the super mom lives in autumn.)

787
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,560
(Now she's even posing
in winter clothes!)

788
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,930
(Ella, Mommy will finish the work
and go back home shortly.)

789
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,330
Food...

790
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,400
Did you say "food" or "Mom?"

791
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,040
Oh, goodness.

792
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,110
My baby, I'll give you some snacks.

793
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,580
Do you want to have some snacks
with your grandpa?

794
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,480
I'll put it here, okay?

795
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
(Wait. I know what this is.)

796
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,080
(It's yogurt
which Ella is deeply into!)

797
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,220
- Babies like yogurt.
- Oh, yogurt. Kids like it.

798
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,350
She's so excited
that she's trying to get up.

799
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,890
She stood up
when she saw the yogurt.

800
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,760
There you go. Good girl.

801
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,900
(This is what I wanted.)

802
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,000
You enjoy
eating a lot of different foods.

803
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,930
Here you go.

804
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,970
Good girl.

805
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,070
She's enjoying it.

806
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
(This time, Ella picks up a spoon.)

807
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,570
- Oh, my.
- She wants to eat by herself.

808
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,040
Yes. Lately, she insists...

809
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,510
- on doing everything herself.
- Oh, my.

810
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,610
She spilled some on her clothes.

811
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,550
What? That's not good.
I'll be right back.

812
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,680
Wait here, honey.

813
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,790
She's not wearing her bib.

814
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,990
(Ella's grandma, who's tidy,
looks for a baby bib.)

815
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,590
What should I do? She needs her bib.

816
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,060
Don't worry about it.
We can wash her clothes.

817
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,260
Here you go.

818
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,460
(Eat without wearing a bib.)

819
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,930
(It tastes just good, right?)

820
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,100
My goodness. What's wrong with me?

821
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,900
I should've put this on her first.

822
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,040
Hui Seo, stop eating for a moment.

823
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
(Ella's grandpa keeps feeding her.)

824
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,140
What are you doing? Stop it.

825
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,250
- How else should I feed her?
- That's not what I meant.

826
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,750
No. You should put this on first.

827
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,050
Put on your bib first.

828
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,220
I should've put this on her
before giving her the food.

829
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,890
It slipped my mind.

830
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,160
(Unhappy)

831
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,230
Good girl.
Give it to me. I'll help you.

832
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,300
You want to do it yourself?

833
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,800
Oh, no. Goodness,
she's spilling it everywhere.

834
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,830
(The situation is
already uncontrollable.)

835
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,900
Right.
You have to wash her clothes anyway.

836
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,270
- Right.
- You have to wash it anyway.

837
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,370
Hui Seo, let me help you...

838
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,570
Hey, stop. Don't touch it.

839
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,940
(Don't worry about spilling
and do whatever you want.)

840
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,210
Don't touch it.

841
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,950
Try to feed her
so that she won't spill it.

842
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,450
I'll go to the bathroom.

843
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,620
Feed her.
Oh, she spilled it everywhere.

844
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,720
(Peculiar Sang Hae and Curious Ella,
will they be okay alone together?)

845
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,420
She loves it.

846
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,190
Your grandma is even worse
at looking after a baby than me.

847
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,490
Pardon?

848
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,260
(Grandpa, let's eat together!)

849
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,060
(Ella's grandpa enjoys
the yogurt too.)

850
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,400
(Grandpa eats with his hands too.)

851
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,270
- She's finally laughing.
- She's laughing.

852
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,800
Well, we have no choice now.

853
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,900
- She laughed.
- I'll just pour it all.

854
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,510
- What?
- Oh, I see.

855
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,240
Oh, like that? I see.

856
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,450
(Grandpa,
you know how to enjoy food.)

857
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,880
Good. You seem excited.

858
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
You can do whatever you want.

859
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,620
- Oh, dear.
- You can spill it or anything.

860
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,490
That will be a disaster.

861
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,990
Like tactile play.

862
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,460
She seems so excited.

863
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,790
No one else lets her eat food
like that.

864
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,160
(Her grandma's gone.
I'm the king of the world now!)

865
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,460
That's good.

866
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,460
I'll take the responsibility.
Do whatever you want.

867
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,630
(Can I put it all over my face
like this?)

868
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,670
It's okay.

869
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,570
Nice. It's okay. You can keep going.

870
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,040
Good. Great. Keep going.

871
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,640
(I'll yield some to my skin.)

872
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,650
(She's starting
to play with the yogurt.)

873
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,520
(Ella moves her hands
faster and more intensely.)

874
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,790
(Ella, it splatters everywhere.)

875
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,160
(Grandpa, this is so much fun!)

876
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,420
It splattered everywhere.

877
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,190
Great. It's good. Keep going.

878
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,300
(This is so exciting.)

879
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,040
(Grandpa, I'll just trust you.)

880
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,700
- She seems most excited so far.
- That's true.

881
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,640
- It got on her hair too.
- She's so excited.

882
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,070
(She doesn't forget to eat some
while doing it.)

883
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,840
As long as you eat it,
how you eat it doesn't matter.

884
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,710
(Elated)

885
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,280
(My bib fell down.)

886
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,080
Her bib...

887
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,590
- He won't...
- He'll put it back on her...

888
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,720
Oh, no.

889
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,990
He set Ella completely free.

890
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,730
(The unstoppable train,
the excitement level)

891
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,130
(She might smash the bowl
at this rate.)

892
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,330
She can't be stopped now.

893
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,240
(Making a noise with her arm
over her mouth)

894
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,010
(The tactile play is reaching
its climax.)

895
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,010
(By the way... Grandpa?)

896
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,880
Her grandpa is moving backward
because it splatters.

897
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,280
(He starts looking worried.)

898
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,920
My father-in-law is a very tidy man.

899
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Sir, you should take
the responsibility.

900
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,090
He just realized it.

901
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,460
(Should I take the responsibility
of this?)

902
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,860
(The house is awfully messy.)

903
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,130
Gosh, I'm not going to watch it.

904
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,030
(The house is awfully messy.)

905
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,160
Even the sofa got dirty.

906
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,430
Hey, isn't this too much?

907
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,140
(Ella pleads the Fifth.)

908
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,840
I'll take the responsibility.
Do whatever you want.

909
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,540
(He runs away in the end.)

910
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,680
He can't just run away like that
after causing all the mess.

911
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,180
(He's never seen her granddaughter
this excited before.)

912
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,050
What's wrong with her?

913
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,720
He said, "What's wrong with her?"

914
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,520
(Oh, no. Ella, please.)

915
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,260
(What's wrong with her?)

916
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,330
- What's wrong with her?
- My mother-in-law didn't see this.

917
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,030
Ella got so excited. She's elated.

918
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,170
Honey.

919
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,740
(He calls Ella's grandma
who went to the bathroom.)

920
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,710
What should I do with her?

921
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,740
What's wrong with her?

922
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,250
(Carried away)

923
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,380
My gosh. What happened?

924
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,720
Goodness. It's a disaster.

925
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,580
- My goodness. What a mess.
- Oh, no.

926
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,820
What should we do?

927
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,550
- It's a disaster.
- My gosh.

928
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,720
Ella seems to be tiptoeing
around her grandma.

929
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,960
- Right? She keeps looking at her.
- Doesn't she? Yes.

930
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,490
What should we do about this?

931
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,260
Goodness gracious.

932
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,930
Why didn't you stop her?
Look at all this mess.

933
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,630
(Sang Hae was confident that
he could have it under control.)

934
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,900
She kept putting the yogurt
on her body.

935
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,200
My goodness. What should we do?

936
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,570
Hui Seo, what have you done?

937
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,810
(Grandpa?)

938
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,680
I guess I can't leave you
with your grandpa.

939
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,080
(I mean... You crossed the line.)

940
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,050
I trusted you with her.

941
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,780
Then how could you let her
make herself messy?

942
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,320
(My gosh. You're unbelievable.)

943
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,820
- Oh, no.
- There will be a lot to do.

944
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,220
They have to bathe Ella now.

945
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,490
Dear me. Oh, goodness.

946
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,630
Why did she splatter the yogurt
all over the floor?

947
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,460
I'll take the responsibility.
Do whatever you want.

948
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,530
He's taking the responsibility
as he promised.

949
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,600
(He's taking the responsibility
as he promised.)

950
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,400
(Being an 81-year-old
granddaughter fool is hard.)

951
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,600
Oh, gosh.

952
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,570
But she had so much fun.

953
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,170
- Ella really enjoyed herself.
- She seemed most excited...

954
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,840
among all the scenes
we've seen today.

955
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,980
Oh, yes!

956
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,740
Oh, my goodness.

957
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,880
(The excitement still lingers.)

958
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,520
What's wrong with her?

959
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,650
(Laughing)

960
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,360
- He got a bit older.
- That's right.

961
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,490
In such a short period of time.

962
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,590
Oh, no. I feel so sorry for him.

963
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,990
(Father, thank you for your effort.)

964
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,560
That's so hilarious.

965
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,730
(Ella is still excited.)

966
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,130
You're that excited?

967
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,130
She seems so excited.

968
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,240
(Ella approaches her grandpa.)

969
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,440
(Grandpa)

970
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
- You're having fun... Oh, no.
- What's wrong with her?

971
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,180
What?

972
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,210
What's wrong with her?

973
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
You're enjoying yourself.

974
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,750
- What's wrong with you, Ella?
- He seems slightly...

975
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,490
(In fact, all day long today...)

976
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,420
(He fell down.)

977
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
(He fell off the toy car.)

978
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,890
Did Ella copy her grandpa?

979
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,030
I think she did.

980
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,130
Babies around her age
tend to copy other people's movements.

981
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,870
(The sense of humor runs in the family.)

982
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,440
(Lee Sang Hae Number 3 has
even Sang Hae's peculiarity.)

983
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,840
- You're enjoying yourself.
- What's wrong with you, Ella?

984
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,010
She's a prodigy.

985
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,470
- She's a comedy prodigy.
- Oh, my.

986
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,780
(Is a sense of humor genetic?)

987
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,750
Why does her mood change so frequently?

988
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,050
Whose granddaughter is she?
She's your blood.

989
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,380
- She takes after you, Father.
- What's with you, young lady?

990
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,820
You seem so excited.

991
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,950
(The 4 families under 1 roof!
She's the youngest comedienne.)

992
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,220
- I wonder...
- She's here.

993
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,490
if Ella had a good time with them.

994
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,560
Did she?

995
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,530
- I'm exhausted.
- I know.

996
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,430
- I'm back.
- Oh, my.

997
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,500
Your mom is here.

998
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,240
(They're smiling now.)

999
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
They're smiling.

1000
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,140
- As they heard Yun Jee's voice,
- I'm back, Ella.

1001
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,040
they smiled so happily.

1002
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,510
- Mommy is back.
- She seems happy.

1003
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,440
(Finally, they're done
looking after the baby.)

1004
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,210
- It must've been exhausting.
- I'm tired.

1005
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,810
- Oh, no.
- Dear me.

1006
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,350
(We can't say it wasn't.)

1007
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,420
- They seem so happy.
- Father.

1008
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,420
- Are you okay?
- "Are you okay?"

1009
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,720
Rather than thanking him formally,

1010
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,630
- I wanted to make it casual.
- You expressed it in a cute way.

1011
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,490
- Right.
- That's why I said that.

1012
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,930
He's not okay.

1013
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,900
Am I okay? Do I look okay?

1014
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,440
(I'll say no more.)

1015
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,770
I had no idea he would do so much...

1016
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,680
- He used his body.
- to earn...

1017
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,080
Ella's love.

1018
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,410
Mother and Father, I'll be nicer.

1019
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,480
Goodness.

1020
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,820
Her energy keeps changing.

1021
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,820
(Her energy keeps changing.)

1022
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,890
Really?

1023
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,620
Who does she take after?

1024
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,620
I think she takes after
her grandfather.

1025
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,490
Who else would it be?

1026
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,430
Of course.

1027
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,100
(He suddenly shouted hip-hop.)

1028
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,960
(His energy is down.)

1029
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,400
(Sleeping)

1030
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,700
Ella didn't just take after
her grandfather's looks.

1031
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,270
I guess she took after
his disposition as well.

1032
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,540
(He has very big ups and downs.)

1033
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,070
I think she's the same
as her grandfather.

1034
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,310
Her grandfather...

1035
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,040
can't do one thing for a long time.

1036
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,110
You shouldn't take after that,
Hui Seo.

1037
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,750
(The scary power of DNA)

1038
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,150
- How cute.
- How cute.

1039
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,950
I'll make you a nice dinner.

1040
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,320
- No.
- We'll eat at home.

1041
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,520
(We'll eat at home.)

1042
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,730
They said it at once.

1043
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,190
Goodness.

1044
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,860
- Right.
- Bye.

1045
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,930
I love you.

1046
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,800
- Thank you.
- Goodness. Thank you.

1047
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,330
(Grandma and Grandpa,
I had a great time today.)

1048
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,640
(Shall we do it again, Grandpa?)

1049
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,210
(The Return of Superman)

1050
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,440
(Wonju,
where mountains and valleys coexist)

1051
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,850
(It's a perfect vacation spot!)

1052
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,720
(But since they've only been
gardening so far...)

1053
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,890
(She dug sweet potatoes
at 37 months old.)

1054
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,030
(Be self-reliant. No work, no food!)

1055
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,170
(Summer in Wonju was a season
with so much work to do.)

1056
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,770
(Ji Woo found more work.)

1057
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,740
Who is this?

1058
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,910
(We have one more worker.)

1059
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,810
The boss.

1060
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,580
(Will they be working in the field
again with the New Worker?)

1061
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,780
It's more of doing labor
than enjoying a vacation in Wonju.

1062
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,220
Dong Min makes them work too much.

1063
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,450
(Please stop working in Wonju!)

1064
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,720
I'm thinking of enjoying
a vacation in Wonju.

1065
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,390
(Today, they'll really
be on a vacation in Wonju!)

1066
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,060
(Here we go!)

1067
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,800
- There we go.
- This would work.

1068
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,900
This is Ji Woo and Si Woo's
swimming pool.

1069
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,940
This is a gift
I prepared for Ji Woo and Si Woo!

1070
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,540
It's quite big.

1071
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,880
- You find those in kids' lodges.
- That's right.

1072
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,980
It was set up properly.

1073
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,450
- It looks really nice.
- Yes.

1074
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,080
(The Wonju water park
has quite the vibe.)

1075
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,250
Vacation spot?
You can just go there easily.

1076
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,620
You don't need to get on a plane
and go abroad.

1077
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,660
Visit the nearby DM Town.

1078
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,830
Come here.

1079
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,730
DM Town Water Park is open.

1080
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,970
(The Woo Siblings are ready
to enjoy the vacation.)

1081
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,970
They're cute.

1082
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,170
Come here, Si Woo.

1083
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,070
That's our swimming pool.

1084
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,310
Dad made it.

1085
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,980
(It's a swimming pool!)

1086
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,150
There's not enough water yet.

1087
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,080
Could you help me
fill it with water?

1088
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,950
(Could you fill the swimming pool
with water?)

1089
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,950
- Okay.
- Of course.

1090
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

1091
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,590
- Then let's...
- Let's...

1092
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,430
fill it with water
after counting to four.

1093
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,230
Great. We have to scoop the water
with a bucket and pour it in there.

1094
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,740
- When will they fill all that?
- With that bucket?

1095
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,170
They'll fill that pool
with that bucket?

1096
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,840
When will they fill it all?

1097
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,540
Private First Class Jang Ji Woo.
You're a soldier. Do you understand?

1098
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,780
Yes!

1099
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,650
Private Jang Si Woo.
You're a soldier. Do you understand?

1100
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,480
Yes!

1101
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,620
Okay. Now everyone,

1102
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,880
stand up!

1103
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,090
(Standing up)

1104
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,390
Stand up now!

1105
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,120
He understands everything.

1106
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,890
You have to be quick. Look at me.

1107
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,930
(The demon instructor
will give a demonstration.)

1108
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,130
You will swiftly run.

1109
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,130
Look at me.

1110
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,970
(Turning)

1111
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,200
One, two.

1112
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,170
(Dad Dong Min
kindly demonstrates it himself.)

1113
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,740
(But will he really use
that bucket?)

1114
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,510
This is how you do it, okay?
Jang Si Woo as well.

1115
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,110
(When will they fill this?)

1116
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,940
He makes them work too much.

1117
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:21,850
(Ji Woo has suffered quite a bit.)

1118
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,960
(Crying)

1119
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,560
I feel uneasy
about them being in Wonju.

1120
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,700
Right.

1121
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,030
One, two.

1122
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,730
(This is nothing for Ji Woo,
who is trained by field work.)

1123
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,970
Pour it. That's right.

1124
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,770
(The first bucket of water
gets poured in.)

1125
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,970
You should also do it with this,
Si Woo.

1126
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,500
Take this.

1127
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,940
(Tough Ji Woo)

1128
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,610
(Meanwhile, Si Woo...)

1129
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,540
- Si Woo has his own way.
- Of course.

1130
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,550
(Meanwhile, Si Woo...)

1131
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,550
Aren't you going to work, Tough Guy?

1132
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,020
- Tough Guy.
- You should work.

1133
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,050
(During the first family run,)

1134
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,090
Run quickly!

1135
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,390
(he gave up.)

1136
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,290
(We'll leave the stragglers behind!)

1137
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,260
(What kind of tough guy are you?)

1138
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,930
(Do you still call yourself
a tough guy?)

1139
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,010
(The spell that moves Si Woo:
Tough Guy)

1140
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,940
Aren't you going to work, Tough Guy?

1141
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,510
How is Tough Guy going to work?

1142
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,680
Go and scoop the water. Run!

1143
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,950
(He immediately responds
after hearing the word "Tough Guy.")

1144
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,450
(He listens to his sister well.)

1145
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,420
That's right. Bring the water.

1146
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,520
(The 18-month-old scoops water
without hesitation.)

1147
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,890
(Goodness.)

1148
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:35,890
Goodness. He spills...

1149
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,730
- He's pouring it down.
- He spills half of it.

1150
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,860
One, two.

1151
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,500
Put it in.

1152
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,160
(Pour in the water that's left!)

1153
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,470
(Small amounts add up to nothing.)

1154
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,500
Good.

1155
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,340
That's right. You're doing well,
Jang Ji Woo.

1156
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,010
(Genius at work.
She moves 2 buckets at once!)

1157
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,210
Don't spill it.

1158
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
Okay.

1159
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,080
Success!

1160
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,150
That one as well.

1161
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,550
(She pours it well
without spilling.)

1162
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,550
Success!

1163
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,790
Success! Great.

1164
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,260
- Ji Woo is careful.
- Ji Woo is.

1165
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,420
- She's skilled.
- Yes.

1166
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,730
(I won't spill a single drop!)

1167
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,260
(Heave-ho!)

1168
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,100
If we keep filling water
at this speed,

1169
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,970
we'll be able to play in it
next summer.

1170
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,640
- But why is Dad working...
- I know, right?

1171
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,840
- Why isn't Dad working?
- only with his mouth?

1172
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,010
Of course, I could turn on
the tap and fill the pool.

1173
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,080
But if they fill
the water themselves,

1174
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,310
they would enjoy playing in it
even more.

1175
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,810
- Yes.
- Ji Woo.

1176
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,050
Don't use the bucket.

1177
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,450
Use the hose to fill it.

1178
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,420
- Use a hose.
- No!

1179
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
(No!)

1180
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,360
Why are you saying no?
You should do it quickly.

1181
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,790
No!

1182
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,430
Why are you saying no?

1183
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,930
No!

1184
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,900
(He's getting a mirror therapy
again today.)

1185
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,960
Well said, Ji Woo.

1186
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
He's getting a mirror therapy.

1187
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,530
Mirror therapy.

1188
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,700
(Ji Woo is a level above Dong Min.)

1189
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,340
Okay. We'll use a hose.

1190
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,310
I'll fill it.

1191
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,010
(Dad Dong Min uses a hose
to fill the pool as Ji Woo said.)

1192
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,880
(Let's play while the pool
is being filled!)

1193
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,150
(The water slide is open for
the Woo Siblings who worked hard.)

1194
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,420
There's a fountain!

1195
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,950
It looks pretty.

1196
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,320
Si Woo!

1197
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,950
That's right.

1198
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,320
(Look at this, Si Woo.
It's really fun.)

1199
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,790
Come here as well, Si Woo.

1200
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,030
(Should I try the slide as well?)

1201
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,860
Off, Dad.

1202
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,630
- Off.
- Should I turn it off?

1203
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,330
- Yes.
- Okay. Go down once,

1204
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,430
and I'll turn it off.

1205
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,440
(He gets on it first.)

1206
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Why?
- Okay.
- Is he afraid?

1207
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,640
(The rising water
is a little scary.)

1208
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,170
No, Si Woo.

1209
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,470
What?

1210
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,480
(That moment!)

1211
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,780
- It's okay.
- Goodness.

1212
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,710
(It's okay.)

1213
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,880
You can go.

1214
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,790
(It's okay. You can go.)

1215
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,190
- You can do it.
- Hold Dad's hand.

1216
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,460
(The sister gives courage...)

1217
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,620
(to her scared younger brother.)

1218
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,630
Amazing!

1219
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,760
(Si Woo is excited.)

1220
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,770
Ji Woo is surely an older sister.
She takes care of her brother well.

1221
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,670
Good job.

1222
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:01,500
Goodness.

1223
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,540
(A sudden blast of water)

1224
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,770
- What's happening?
- What?

1225
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,080
(Take the water blast from Dad!)

1226
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,250
(Pretending he didn't do it)

1227
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,550
- Seriously.
- Is it raining?

1228
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,150
- Father.
- It's a dark cloud.

1229
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,820
Don't do that.

1230
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,650
- Right.
- This?

1231
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,360
This is an umbrella.
Do you want to see?

1232
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,130
Open, umbrella!

1233
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,790
It's strange, isn't it?

1234
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,200
(That's an umbrella?)

1235
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,930
Doesn't it feel like something
passed by just now?

1236
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,040
- Okay!
- That's an umbrella.

1237
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,540
- An umbrella but like water guns...
- Yes.

1238
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,670
(Dad said this was an umbrella.)

1239
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,310
Is it like "Kingsman?"
How does it work?

1240
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,540
How does it work?

1241
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,640
(Then Ji Woo
will open the umbrella.)

1242
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,480
Come here, Si Woo.

1243
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,750
(Come here, Si Woo,
so you don't get wet.)

1244
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,790
(No)

1245
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,190
I'll attack Jang Si Woo.

1246
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,990
(It's a Kingsman water gun attack!)

1247
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,930
(Now Dad Dong Min
is openly shooting water.)

1248
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,330
Here you go.

1249
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,630
Si Woo.

1250
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,630
(No!)

1251
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,670
(I'll protect you.)

1252
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,070
His sister is the best.

1253
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,240
- Attack!
- She's protecting him.

1254
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,770
- She's trying to protect Si Woo.
- That's right.

1255
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,910
Goodness.

1256
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:17,980
(She protects her small
and precious brother with her small body.)

1257
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,820
You blocked all of it.

1258
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,450
I'll protect you.

1259
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,460
She keeps protecting him.

1260
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,460
No!

1261
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,630
- Run!
- Take my attack!

1262
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
No!

1263
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,930
(The Woo Siblings charge forward!)

1264
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Take my attack!

1265
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,830
Your umbrella is shielding you.

1266
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,170
(Impenetrable defense)

1267
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,310
Okay.

1268
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,110
- No!
- I'll attack again!

1269
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,640
(Why isn't my water gun shooting?)

1270
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,080
(The Tough Guy's reputation
is getting ruined.)

1271
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,920
(Charming back)

1272
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,490
(Jang Si Woo, the headliner
of the Wonju Waterbomb Festival)

1273
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,820
(I'm the testosterone man!)

1274
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,560
He's the testosterone man,
as people say these days.

1275
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,660
That's right.

1276
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,460
(Cha Eun Woo and Baekho
rocked the Waterbomb Festival.)

1277
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,330
(The men
of the Waterbomb Festival...)

1278
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,270
(with an irresistible charm)

1279
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,910
(I'm the youngest testosterone man!)

1280
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,140
You look like Kang Ho Dong
when he ran as a ssireum champion.

1281
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,710
My goodness.

1282
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,980
(The thick thighs look the same.)

1283
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,220
- He has everything.
- Of course.

1284
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,880
When you watch pro wrestling,

1285
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,650
wrestlers boxer briefs
in such a color.

1286
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,420
(This is the taste
of a ssireum champion!)

1287
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,060
(You got me!)

1288
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,260
I'm under attack!

1289
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,600
That's right.

1290
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,430
- They should attack together.
- That's right.

1291
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,230
- I'm under attack!
- That's so refreshing to watch.

1292
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,740
(Dad,
you should get a taste as well!)

1293
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,300
How could you attack me?

1294
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:50,970
Take this!

1295
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,180
(Ji Woo defends
while Si Woo attacks.)

1296
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,540
Ji Woo defends...

1297
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,350
- while Si Woo attacks.
- Go forward.

1298
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,250
(It's another attack!)

1299
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,820
(We're a fantastic pair.)

1300
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,250
You're shooting a water gun at me.

1301
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:07,690
(I surrender!)

1302
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,700
(I won!
Hurrah for the ssireum champion.)

1303
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,570
(The pool becomes full
during the water gun match.)

1304
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,570
- That's enough water.
- Yes.

1305
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,300
That's the perfect depth
for children.

1306
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,640
- It's fun for children.
- Yes.

1307
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,970
Guys.

1308
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,340
(Groaning)

1309
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:27,840
It's cool.

1310
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,880
(Gosh, it's cool.)

1311
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,350
You eat food at a pool...

1312
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,550
when you're on a dating show.

1313
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,190
A show like "Single's Inferno."

1314
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,250
(They turn around at the same time.)

1315
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,190
Dex!

1316
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,420
Dex?

1317
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,430
(Could it be that Dex came?)

1318
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,230
(Dex!)

1319
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,300
Jang Si Woo. Jang Dex.

1320
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,130
(Jang Dex?)

1321
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,600
Are you Jang Dex?

1322
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,440
Show us the UDT swim. There you go.

1323
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,010
(Si Woo, are you ready?)

1324
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,020
Show us.

1325
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,580
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1326
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,050
(He swims in a cool manner.)

1327
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,690
They look the same.

1328
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,920
They practically look the same.

1329
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,660
He's a tough guy.

1330
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,960
He has a strong upper body.

1331
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,430
(Swimming powerfully)

1332
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,830
Jang Si Woo, faster.

1333
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,400
(This is how
an 18-month-old testosterone man swims!)

1334
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,570
It's okay.

1335
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,210
(I'm Jang Dex of The Return of Superman!)

1336
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,910
Jang Dex of The Return of Superman.

1337
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,080
The Return of Superman.

1338
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,710
Aren't Dex and Kang Ho Dong too different?

1339
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,510
Seriously. We got Dex
right after Kang Ho Dong.

1340
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,980
The UDT swim.

1341
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,680
Yes. The UDT swim.

1342
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,120
Let's see who can go faster.
It's a match.

1343
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,390
Faster.

1344
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,560
(I'll go faster.)

1345
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,590
Faster.

1346
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,520
(I'll go faster than Ji Woo.)

1347
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,590
(I refuse to lose!)

1348
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,100
- Heave-ho.
- You know,

1349
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,400
they like playing with water.

1350
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,240
- It's fun to play in the water.
- That's right.

1351
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,540
The UDT swim.

1352
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,110
Shall we eat watermelon now?

1353
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,880
(Hotel pools have
the floating breakfast.)

1354
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,280
What's this?

1355
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,650
(DM Town has the floating fruits!)

1356
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,950
The silver try is the kick.

1357
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,350
It's the kick of the day.

1358
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,090
Who wants watermelon?

1359
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,760
(Me!)

1360
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,960
Do you want watermelon?

1361
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,830
- Those watermelons are cute.
- Right?

1362
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,290
(They're apple watermelons
Grandma grew.)

1363
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,460
The rind is thin.
It looks ripe and tasty.

1364
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,500
Here.

1365
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,630
Eat it like me.

1366
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,630
Watch. Watch me.

1367
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,010
- My goodness.
- Clowns can't help it.

1368
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,410
They can't even eat watermelon
in an ordinary way.

1369
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,580
I see.

1370
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,620
(Ji Woo, it's really tasty.)

1371
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,720
(Ji Woo, try it.)

1372
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,750
Usually...

1373
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,860
It's so tasty. It's totally sweet.

1374
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,890
Ji Woo is thinking about
how she should eat it.

1375
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,290
(I have a comedian's blood.
I want to be funnier than Dad.)

1376
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,530
My goodness. What?

1377
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,900
It's so tasty, right?

1378
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,300
- She's a comedian's daughter.
- It's cold.

1379
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,300
It's good!

1380
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,700
It's good!

1381
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,970
Right? It's really tasty, right?

1382
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,940
She's eating with gusto.

1383
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,240
She eats so well.

1384
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,320
Dad, I think
this watermelon contains sugar.

1385
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,580
Oh, my.

1386
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,050
Is that how sweet it is?

1387
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,490
Scream if you want to eat more!

1388
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:25,550
(I want to eat more.)

1389
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,460
(Hurry up and give it to me.)

1390
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,090
All he says is...

1391
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,130
He screams all the time.

1392
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,330
(Scream if it's tasty.)

1393
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,400
(It's tasty!)

1394
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,070
(Lie on your stomach
when a helicopter comes, okay?)

1395
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,700
(Okay!)

1396
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,040
- Scream if it's tasty.
- Seriously.

1397
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,470
(It's tasty!)

1398
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,610
(I'm Jang Si Woo, an 18-month-old
testosterone man!)

1399
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,810
(I want to ride it again!)

1400
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,710
(There's a lot!)

1401
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,650
(This is fun!)

1402
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,250
(I want more watermelon!)

1403
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,750
(I communicate in my own way.)

1404
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,690
(Tough)

1405
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,530
(He eats watermelon in one bite.)

1406
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,060
Look at that.

1407
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,500
He's shoving watermelon in there.

1408
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,230
"I'm a tough guy."

1409
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,170
(It tastes nice!)

1410
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,710
A water bomb is falling
from the sky!

1411
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,140
My goodness.

1412
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,110
(A water bomb is falling
from the sky!)

1413
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,110
(It's raining!)

1414
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,780
It's raining a lot.

1415
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,950
(Heavy rain suddenly falls.)

1416
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,690
(What's going on?)

1417
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,690
Right?

1418
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,290
I can't believe it.

1419
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:35,560
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1420
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,390
They should go back into the house.

1421
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:38,660
It's a fountain!

1422
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,500
Someone must've turned on
a faucet in the sky.

1423
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:46,030
Someone must've opened...

1424
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,700
the lid in the sky.

1425
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,800
Really?

1426
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,510
Someone opened the lid.

1427
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,110
(She really is a genius baby!)

1428
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,980
That 38-month-old is so expressive.

1429
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,180
(The top 1 percent)

1430
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,450
(When it comes to language,
she's a top 1-percent prodigy.)

1431
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,050
(26-month-old: I discovered
a marsh snail.)

1432
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,020
(33-month-old: I'm a senior
when it comes to farming.)

1433
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,230
(26-month-old:
The wound made me sad.)

1434
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:16,200
(31-month-old:
Ms. Smelt, I'll be waiting.)

1435
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,200
(I'll be waiting, so come.
Don't go far and come.)

1436
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,570
(I'll take good care of you.
A poem by a 3-year-old Ji Woo)

1437
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,540
(Rockfish is shooting a gun.)

1438
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,740
Flap.

1439
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,810
(A fountain is falling
from the sky!)

1440
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,450
(The bard of The Return of Superman,
the 37-month-old Jang Ji Woo)

1441
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,990
(It's raining heavily.)

1442
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,890
Playing in the water
on a rainy day is the best.

1443
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,720
When else...

1444
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,360
- will we get rained on?
- That's right.

1445
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,360
The water gun from the sky...

1446
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,760
makes the true Waterbomb Festival.

1447
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,270
Swimming is fun...

1448
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,100
- when it's raining.
- It's very fun.

1449
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,640
It's atmospheric in a unique way.

1450
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,370
Get up! It's the Waterbomb Festival.

1451
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,780
- It's the Waterbomb Festival.
- The Waterbomb Festival.

1452
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:09,420
(You get wet and have fun
at the Waterbomb Festival.)

1453
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,450
Let's have a dance party.
This is the Waterbomb Festival.

1454
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,560
(Shall we party harder
since it's raining?)

1455
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,360
They're excited.

1456
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,690
It's the Waterbomb Festival.

1457
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,300
They're excited.

1458
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,460
(Si Woo is going crazy.)

1459
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,130
What kind of a dance is that?

1460
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,740
Oh, my.

1461
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,910
- They're excited.
- Oh, my.

1462
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,310
That's right.
Children become the most excited...

1463
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,350
- when their dad plays with them.
- He plays with them with his body.

1464
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,880
It's so nice to have
the Waterbomb Festival at home.

1465
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,050
It's exciting.

1466
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,450
Making a pool was worthwhile.

1467
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,490
I know.

1468
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,560
Dad.

1469
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,530
It isn't raining a lot now.

1470
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,500
(The Woo Siblings
come out of the pool.)

1471
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,630
Won't they go home?

1472
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,900
Won't they go into the house?

1473
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,270
Go up.

1474
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,440
Go inside.

1475
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,610
I'll go inside too.

1476
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:08,210
(Why did they go to the lookout?)

1477
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,010
All right.

1478
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,280
That's right. Corn is tasty.

1479
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,420
Can I eat it too?

1480
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,650
- Yes.
- Okay.

1481
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:16,950
(Ji Woo)

1482
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,950
(Si Woo)

1483
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:20,790
It must be tasty.

1484
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,090
We'll do facials here.

1485
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,030
It's the watermelon mask.

1486
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,500
Using the watermelon
we ate earlier...

1487
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,300
I remember using
the watermelon I ate...

1488
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,700
as a facial mask
when my skin was red...

1489
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,370
from playing in the water.

1490
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,840
I wanted to do the same
for my children...

1491
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,740
and pass down the know-how...

1492
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,440
of life.

1493
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,950
It's my first time hearing about it.

1494
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,580
- Same here.
- Yes.

1495
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,080
I didn't know that you could use...

1496
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,450
- watermelon.
- You put it on your face.

1497
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,290
- You slice it thinly.
- You slice it thinly.

1498
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,560
(It's a natural facial mask
in the shape of a cotton square.)

1499
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,220
Why don't you lie down?

1500
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,690
It's a beauty salon.

1501
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,160
They haven't done this in a while.

1502
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,760
- A skincare clinic.
- Yes.

1503
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
They're the customers.

1504
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,330
Did I become a cat?

1505
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:07,370
Are you a cat?
You have a cat's whiskers.

1506
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,600
(She turns into a cat
with the watermelon mask.)

1507
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,770
I became a cat.

1508
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,240
She stays still
when her dad does something.

1509
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,410
What is Si Woo doing next to them?

1510
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,050
(Can I put it on my belly?)

1511
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,150
Si Woo, lie down.

1512
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,280
That's right.
Si Woo should do the same.

1513
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,620
Don't you want to do it, tough guy?

1514
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,650
(Falling)

1515
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,290
It fell.

1516
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,960
- Tough guy.
- It fell.

1517
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,890
Really? I'll use thinner pieces.

1518
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,360
He received a complaint.

1519
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,730
(The director fixes it right away.)

1520
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,830
All done.

1521
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,500
With the mask on your face,

1522
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,740
you should take a nap.

1523
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,340
Shall we do it?

1524
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,680
She got the sheep hair.

1525
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,310
He got the sheep hair
with his daughter.

1526
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,280
It must be so much fun.

1527
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,120
(Let's lie down.)

1528
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,720
- This is a Won-cation.
- It looks cool.

1529
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,860
It's a vacation in Wonju.
Won-cation.

1530
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,420
It's cool.

1531
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,830
It's cool at the lookout, right?

1532
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,160
She's eating corn on her back.

1533
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,930
- It's the best.
- Seriously.

1534
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,670
(The gentle breeze blows.)

1535
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,210
(Summer in Wonju
has a relaxing vibe.)

1536
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,240
It's cool.

1537
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,050
(They enjoy a nap
in the paradise on earth.)

1538
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,380
There must be a breeze too.

1539
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,780
It must feel cool after swimming.

1540
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,820
It must be the best.

1541
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,250
(Wriggling)

1542
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,250
It's cool.

1543
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,790
She wasn't sleeping.

1544
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,060
(Ji Woo gets up.)

1545
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,490
Dad, let's go inside to sleep.

1546
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,530
Why?

1547
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:41,900
It's hot.

1548
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,370
That's right.

1549
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,200
(It's hot.)

1550
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,900
It isn't hot at all
if you stay still.

1551
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,810
Grandmas always said that
in the past.

1552
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,810
- That's right.
- "Stay still."

1553
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:53,980
"Stay still."

1554
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,310
"It isn't hot at all
if you stay still."

1555
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,350
Let's sleep
with the air conditioner on.

1556
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,450
(Let's sleep
with the air conditioner on.)

1557
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,290
It isn't hot at all
if you stay still.

1558
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,590
It isn't hot at all
if you stay still.

1559
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,730
Dong Min, get up.
It's too hot for her.

1560
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:12,730
Let me take a 2-hour nap 1st.

1561
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,160
He wants a two-hour nap.

1562
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,830
Let's sleep
with the air conditioner on.

1563
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,330
It isn't hot at all
if you stay still.

1564
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,540
(It isn't hot at all
if you stay still!)

1565
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:22,700
Si Woo.

1566
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,610
I brought a multigrain shake.

1567
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,670
Let's have a cold drink
since it's hot.

1568
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,410
A multigrain shake.

1569
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,380
All right. It's a multigrain shake.

1570
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,380
Grandma, eat with us.

1571
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,680
May I eat with you guys?

1572
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,350
Mom, take a seat.

1573
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
(Please give me some!)

1574
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,820
- Si Woo, will you eat it?
- Do you want it? Okay.

1575
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,460
It's a multigrain shake, right?

1576
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,730
(She pours the multigrain shake
into a bowl.)

1577
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,790
It looks tasty.

1578
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:49,360
(Drinking)

1579
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,700
This is great!

1580
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,900
(What's this taste?)

1581
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,940
How is it?

1582
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,940
This is the taste!

1583
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,870
This is the taste!

1584
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,710
Look at Si Woo.

1585
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,310
(Testosterone man doesn't say much.)

1586
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,280
Ji Woo, wasn't it nice
to enjoy a vacation in Wonju?

1587
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:07,580
Yes.

1588
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,620
When autumn comes,

1589
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,490
let's take a trip to someplace cool
with Grandma, okay?

1590
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,760
Okay.

1591
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,820
Leaving the house costs money.

1592
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,360
Leaving the house brings trouble.

1593
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,660
Since the weather is hot,
we should stay in the house.

1594
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:21,130
You worry too much.

1595
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,730
I have a plan.

1596
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,100
Have you heard of Autumn Travels?

1597
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,600
What's that?

1598
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,110
Since lodging is
too expensive these days,

1599
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,780
people go, "Why sleep here
when staying at home is the best?"

1600
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,410
"Let's not go on a trip."

1601
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,880
So, this is a festival of a discount
on the lodging expenses.

1602
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,250
They'll cover some
of the lodging expenses.

1603
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,480
A festival of a discount
on the lodging expenses?

1604
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,420
Yes. They'll cover some
of the lodging expenses.

1605
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,460
Look.

1606
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,430
Look up,
"A discount on the lodging expenses."

1607
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,460
If you have this coupon,

1608
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,800
you can get some
of the lodging expenses back.

1609
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,770
You can also get a discount.

1610
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,470
Where do you want to go?

1611
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,270
I want to see the autumn foliage.

1612
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,370
- Autumn foliage?
- Yes.

1613
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,770
(Mount Unak, Gapyeong)

1614
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,780
(Korea becomes colorful in autumn.)

1615
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,850
(Lakeside path, Hoengseong)

1616
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,910
(Nami Island, Gapyeong)

1617
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:13,350
(Flower field of Goseokjeong, Cheorwon)

1618
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,880
(The travel destinations show off
their diverse charms.)

1619
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,850
(The weather, humidity,
and view will be perfect.)

1620
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:23,160
(Domestic trips in autumn
will be charming.)

1621
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,030
There are so many places to visit...

1622
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,860
- in Korea.
- Yes.

1623
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,200
You can enjoy these perks
in winter as well.

1624
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,330
(Let's go on a trip together
when the heat subsides.)

1625
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,140
Let's go on many trips
in autumn and winter.

1626
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

1627
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,370
Scream if you want to go on a trip!

1628
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,540
Let's go!

1629
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:42,840
(Where will Si Woo and Ji Woo go
when autumn comes?)

1630
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,350
I'll prepare a tasty meal.

1631
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,420
What will Dong Min cook today?

1632
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,620
What will it be?

1633
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,290
He had a Japanese amberjack
cutting show.

1634
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,890
(He cut a Japanese amberjack
without hesitation.)

1635
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,960
It was incredible.

1636
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,190
(He cut a Japanese amberjack
without hesitation.)

1637
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,430
He doesn't make...

1638
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,560
- an easy dish.
- That's right.

1639
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,560
- He doesn't make an ordinary dish.
- No.

1640
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,670
What will he make today?

1641
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,500
(Jokbal, braised seafood, eel,)

1642
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,500
(sundae)

1643
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,000
- You tried his food.
- Yes.

1644
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,470
- Was it tasty?
- It was tasty.

1645
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:14,540
(He's a cooking genius
who's good at everything.)

1646
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,810
(What will be
the all-around dad's dish of today?)

1647
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,050
I've never seen anyone make
eobok jaengban at home.

1648
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:30,020
(Eobok jaengban is
an invigorating summer dish.)

1649
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,160
What's eobok jaengban?

1650
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,160
When it's hot,

1651
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,300
you eat different cuts of meat
and other ingredients...

1652
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,200
to gain energy on a hot day.

1653
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,340
It's a total health food.

1654
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,040
Do you like it?

1655
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,840
I like it!

1656
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,240
All right.

1657
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,280
Ta-da.

1658
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,610
What's this?

1659
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,580
- What's that?
- For suyuk...

1660
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,850
Is it beef shank?

1661
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,620
(Is it beef shank?)

1662
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,390
Does she know what beef shank is?

1663
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,560
- What's going on?
- Really?

1664
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,760
(Si Woo is here!)

1665
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,900
Si Woo came as well.

1666
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,470
Si Woo, do you want to come up?

1667
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,870
(Yes)

1668
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,370
(I want to help as well.)

1669
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,140
All right. What's this?

1670
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,040
- Who knows the answer?
- Mayo.

1671
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,680
(It's garlic!)

1672
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,710
Correct.

1673
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,510
Garlic.

1674
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,320
- It's garlic.
- Garlic.

1675
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,190
Splash.

1676
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,150
- Splash.
- Splash.

1677
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,190
Let's wait for the meat
to get boiled, okay?

1678
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:41,360
(Dong Min prepares the vegetables
for eobok jaengban!)

1679
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,770
(He cuts vegetables
into even pieces.)

1680
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,030
(Dong Min even puts effort
into a mushroom.)

1681
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,770
He knows how to make it pretty.

1682
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,510
(He even cuts a mushroom
in a special way.)

1683
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,840
He cuts it into a pretty shape
before adding it.

1684
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,480
It's hot.

1685
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:01,220
(The beef shank is cooked
thoroughly.)

1686
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,980
How does he work so easily?

1687
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,250
The tendons of the beef shank
are chewy and tasty.

1688
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,620
(He cuts the meat
into bite-sized pieces.)

1689
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,530
(He puts care into
every ingredient.)

1690
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,130
Will he put an octopus on the top?

1691
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,170
(The finishing touch
for the eobok jaengban)

1692
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,930
How does he cook so easily?

1693
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,900
Grandma!

1694
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:23,270
Come and eat!

1695
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,410
Okay.

1696
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:25,840
It looks tasty.

1697
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,510
(Gosh, it looks tasty.)

1698
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,980
It's the octopus you saw earlier.

1699
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,380
Say hello.

1700
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:36,450
It used to be cold.

1701
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:41,020
That's right. It became this way
after entering the boiling water.

1702
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:45,090
He showed it to the kids
when it was alive.

1703
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,660
(Dong Min showed the octopus
to the Woo Siblings.)

1704
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,160
(Wriggling)

1705
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,570
The octopus is exercising on a bar.

1706
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,600
"The octopus is exercising
on a bar."

1707
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,300
- It's hanging.
- It kept going up.

1708
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,370
- It was hanging.
- Yes.

1709
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,470
- What do you think?
- It was exercising on a bar.

1710
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,810
It's cool.

1711
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,410
(It's cool.)

1712
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:02,440
Really?

1713
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,350
(The octopus is cooked
in a cool way.)

1714
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,350
Shall we give a piece to Grandma?

1715
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,750
Let's take one and dip it
in the sauce.

1716
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,090
(Hurry up and try it!)

1717
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,260
- Shall I eat it first?
- Yes.

1718
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,860
(Grandma gets the first bite.)

1719
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,230
My goodness.

1720
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,390
- Of course.
- They should see him being caring.

1721
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,430
- Is it okay?
- It's tasty.

1722
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,760
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

1723
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,830
Ji Woo and Si Woo,
I'll give you food.

1724
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,670
(The hungry Si Woo eats meat first.)

1725
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,910
Si Woo, here is meat.

1726
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,270
(The hungry Si Woo eats meat first.)

1727
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,240
(Food is tastier after playing
in the water.)

1728
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,440
Si Woo is eating with gusto.

1729
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,310
- Swimming must've made him hungry.
- That's right.

1730
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,910
That's right.
Swimming does that to you.

1731
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,450
He eats with gusto.

1732
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,650
(Testosterone man's secret
to staying fit)

1733
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,520
- Octopus.
- Octopus.

1734
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Okay.

1735
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,190
She ate it with her hands.

1736
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:51,460
(It's chewy.)

1737
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,400
It must be fun to chew it.

1738
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,360
(She loves seafood!)

1739
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,800
It's good.

1740
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,000
- She eats small octopus well.
- I know.

1741
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,100
(It's good.)

1742
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:05,810
(Proud)

1743
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:10,650
(Anything Dad makes is tasty.)

1744
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,150
Ji Woo, do you like going
to the water park...

1745
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,720
or swimming and playing...

1746
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,450
at Grandma's place in Wonju?

1747
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,920
I like playing in Wonju.

1748
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,190
My goodness.

1749
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,260
- Do you prefer playing in Wonju?
- Yes.

1750
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:26,860
(I prefer Wonju too!)

1751
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,330
Scream loudly
if you're in a good mood today!

1752
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,770
(I'm in the best mood!)

1753
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,930
(It was fun today.)

1754
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,600
At the house in Wonju,

1755
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,970
I made a small-sized pool.

1756
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,840
I think this vacation...

1757
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,380
will be more memorable to children.

1758
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,420
(They filled the pool themselves.)

1759
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,420
That's right.

1760
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,820
Of course.
They hung out with their dad.

1761
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:58,090
(They filled the pool
and picked fruits today.)

1762
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,060
(Their vacation in Wonju...)

1763
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,560
(wasn't always comfortable
and easy.)

1764
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,700
(But they enjoyed playing
in the water...)

1765
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,840
(during the do-it-yourself
Wonju vacation.)

1766
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,170
(Despite the clumsiness,
they'll remember it for years.)

1767
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,610
I'll continue to make plans...

1768
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,080
that'll allow them to have fun
with their dad.

1769
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,910
Dong Min, have fun...

1770
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,510
with Ji Woo and Si Woo next time as well.

1771
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,520
Yes.

1772
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,550
(I'll give you guys
unforgettable memories. I love you.)

1773
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,150
(At the age of 216 days,
he skipped the scooting part.)

1774
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,760
(He succeeded in doing
the butterfly stroke on land!)

1775
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,060
(This time, he'll swim for real.)

1776
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,730
(Mr. Shim is even more nervous!)

1777
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,500
(It's Haru's first swim ever.
Will he be able to do well?)

1778
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,300
(The scary police bureau
of the Joseon dynasty)

1779
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,300
(The one in captivity is...)

1780
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,570
(Jung Woo?)

1781
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,170
(You must be aware of your wrongdoing!)

1782
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,340
(This is...)

1783
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,310
(ridiculous!)

1784
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,550
(Feed it to him right this instant!)

1785
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,550
(The Woo Brothers will be back!)
