1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,130
Where is this?

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,329
(Someone is tied up on an operating table.)

3
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:13,560
Let's breathe this in a little.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,269
(Why is Seung Woo here?)

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,869
(Let's stop!)

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,009
(Was it serious enough...)

7
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,270
(for him to take painkillers?)

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,340
(She's holding Seung Woo's hand tight.)

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,110
(She can't do anything but watch.)

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,520
You're doing well.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,619
(His tears won't stop.)

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,519
(What on earth happened to Seung Woo?)

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,940
Eun Woo and Jung Woo...

14
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:44,779
met up with Dong Min's Ji Woo and Si Woo.

15
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,009
- I know. - Right.

16
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,509
Hey, then it's totally...

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,649
- Woo - They're all Woos.

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,149
Yes, all four kids have Woo in their names.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,850
- Eun Woo, Jung Woo, - Eun Woo, Jung Woo,

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,050
- Ji Woo, Si Woo. - Ji Woo, Si Woo.

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:56,889
(Eun Woo, Ji Woo, Jung Woo, Si Woo)

22
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,420
- Really. Eun Woo, Jung Woo, - That's funny.

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,730
Si Woo and Ji Woo.

24
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:05,600
That's a big radish.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,700
- Oh, my. - You're a genius.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,700
- What's that? - Goodness.

27
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Eun Woo, the city baby, is pulling out radishes.

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,940
(The city guy's unexpected charm, Kim Eun Woo, 37 months old)

29
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,509
(Snacks)

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,380
(If you want to eat it, raise your hand.)

31
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,610
(The pro snack hunter, Kim Jung Woo, 19 months old)

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,520
- He's already 19 months old. - He wants those snacks.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,250
(Pulling)

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,449
- What's this? - Oh, my.

35
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:27,250
(Pulling)

36
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:28,919
(Let's work together...)

37
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,220
(to take on this challenge!)

38
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,860
(The youngest farming genius, Jang Ji Woo, 29 months old)

39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,390
She's so smart.

40
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,899
- Oh, my. It's Si Woo. - Si Woo.

41
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:38,929
(The adorable youngest, Jang Si Woo, 10 months old)

42
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,630
(Try winking.)

43
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:46,709
(Enjoying the great chemistry of the 4 Woo Siblings together)

44
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:49,380
(Enjoying the great chemistry of the 4 Woo Siblings together)

45
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:55,850
(You can't watch it without shedding tears.)

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,880
It's a whole chicken.

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,780
(The spicy flavor of living in the countryside)

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,589
(A raw chicken?)

49
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,190
(You have to take out the bloody chunks.)

50
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,720
(I don't want to see this.)

51
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,589
(Uncle, do you only know how to eat it?)

52
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,699
(Like the flavor of dongchimi, it will make you feel refreshed.)

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,299
(About to unfold in Wonju,)

54
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,440
(Eun Woo and Jung Woo's...)

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,109
(country living experience begins now.)

56
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:25,880
(On a winter day where the cold wind was blowing)

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,949
Oh, the countryside.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,919
(This place, where you can smell the countryside...)

59
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:38,590
We saw Dong Min's house in the summer.

60
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,789
It feels different to see it in the winter now.

61
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:41,829
- I know. - Right.

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,600
- You wanted to see this. - Right.

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,930
You said so last time.

64
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:47,799
(Do you have something else besides the Internet cafe?)

65
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,340
(Eyes twinkling)

66
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,069
(It's decked out with an Internet cafe,)

67
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,340
(screen golf, and even a sauna.)

68
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,079
(Oh, my! I have to go there!)

69
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,139
(You're welcome anytime.)

70
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,310
- It's the dads' fantasy. - Right.

71
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,509
- A man's fantasy. - Yes.

72
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:01,509
I'm looking forward to this.

73
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:04,049
Dong Min's family is meeting with the Ho Woo Father and Sons.

74
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:05,650
Let's go!

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,449
Eun Woo, who are we going to meet today?

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,690
I don't know.

77
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,359
Today, we're going to meet Uncle and two younger friends, okay?

78
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,930
(Barking)

79
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,630
There must be a dog. Jung Woo, let's go.

80
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,900
Eun Woo thinks the dog is barking from this direction.

81
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,769
Oh, do you think the dog is barking back there?

82
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,710
Yes. What do you think, Dad?

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,310
What do I think?

84
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,280
I think it's coming from over there.

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He even knows how to ask for your opinion now.

86
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,620
You could have a debate with him now.

87
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,590
The dog must be saying hello because you guys are here.

88
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,989
Let's hurry up and say hi.

89
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,289
- So cute. - Let's go and say hi.

90
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,789
We're here now. Hurry up.

91
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,829
(They've arrived at the Dong Ji Father and Daughter's house.)

92
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,160
Let's go meet the funny uncle.

93
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:52,329
Eun Woo, for the first time, you'll have a younger sister.

94
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,569
(The day 37-month-old Kim Eun Woo meets a younger sister!)

95
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,100
- That's right. - Really?

96
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,299
Hurry up, guys.

97
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,210
- What is this? - What is it?

98
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,609
- Gosh, it's so tacky. - What is that?

99
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:06,609
It's so tacky.

100
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,650
It says "DM Town."

101
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,620
- They're Dong Min's initials. - Oh, DM for Dong Min.

102
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,650
- He wrote "DM Town." - Oh, dear.

103
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:14,720
- It was so tacky. - Seriously.

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,620
I couldn't even tell what it was.

105
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:18,590
He's acting like an attention-seeker even in the countryside.

106
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,259
(The appearance of DM Town in Wonju, the place where angels live?)

107
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,259
Seriously.

108
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,229
This is DM Town, Eun Woo.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,760
It's DM Town.

110
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,600
- Will they finally meet? - Right.

111
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,109
Open up, please.

112
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,510
It's so cold that I might die.

113
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:37,979
- It's so cold that he might die. - It's cold.

114
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,910
(Clearing his throat)

115
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,010
- Is it another skit? - Who's there?

116
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,249
- Of course he should. - He should.

117
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,450
- They do skits all the time here. - They should.

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,850
Who is it? It must be Uncle.

119
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,119
(Opening the door, it's...)

120
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:51,189
- It's Uncle. - Goodness.

121
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,160
- Say hello. - What's that?

122
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,830
- He looks legit. - Eun Woo and Jung Woo...

123
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,299
- are here. - He started a skit...

124
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,330
- as soon as we met. - Hello.

125
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,359
We started off with a skit.

126
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,570
(From a granny...)

127
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,970
(to Gollum,)

128
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,210
(and even a village teacher)

129
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,369
(Welcome, is this your first time at Dong Min Town's skit academy?)

130
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,640
He really prepared a lot.

131
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,379
- He even dressed up. - It's Uncle.

132
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,379
(The skit starts as soon as they meet.)

133
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,049
- The kids might get scared. - Say hello.

134
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,479
Eun Woo and Jung Woo are here.

135
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:20,189
Eun Woo and Jung Woo are here.

136
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,789
- Hello. - His eyes have gotten so round.

137
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,859
- Hello. - Hello.

138
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:27,390
- There you go. - Yes, you should say hello.

139
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,530
Jung Woo, you too. Say hello and bow.

140
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:30,929
- Hello. - There you go.

141
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,700
- Hello. - There you go.

142
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,999
- Let's go inside. Hold hands. - Let's go inside.

143
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,840
- Hold hands. - Go inside.

144
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,809
All right. Come inside. Goodness, your hands are cold.

145
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,109
Dong Min, you even attached a beard.

146
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,479
It looks so real.

147
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,549
Who are you calling, "Dong Min?"

148
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,150
The kids were surprised, of course, but I was also...

149
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,549
I didn't know how to react to that kind of situation.

150
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,460
I mean, it's hard for me too, and I'm a comedienne.

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,299
What's this? He prepared a whole room.

152
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:07,869
Finally, the Woo Brothers and the Woo Siblings...

153
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,739
- are about to meet. - Let's go up.

154
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:10,840
(I hear something.)

155
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,499
- He has gotten bigger since then. - Go upstairs.

156
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,140
- All right. Come this way. Good. - Go up.

157
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,640
Go up. We're going up.

158
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,710
- We're going up. - They're both kind of shy...

159
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,820
- at first. - What?

160
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,950
- Both Eun Woo and Ji Woo. - What?

161
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,320
(Pausing momentarily)

162
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,890
He stopped. His mind is on hold.

163
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,989
- What will he do? - He has to figure this out.

164
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,460
(Eun Woo stopped as soon as he stepped inside.)

165
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,369
(Buffering)

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,770
Jang Ji Woo, you should say hi.

167
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,200
Hi.

168
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,970
Jang Ji Woo, can you say hi?

169
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,239
- Why did he stop too? - Why are they all stopping?

170
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,539
Ji Woo, get up.

171
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:52,640
- What did they see... - Get up.

172
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,850
Get up.

173
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,950
What's this?

174
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,919
What will they do?

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,419
Eun Woo is pushing Jung Woo forward again.

176
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,919
He's pushing his younger brother.

177
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,460
Jung Woo is good at stuff like that.

178
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,359
- Jung Woo just goes straight in. - Yes, he's good at that.

179
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,729
He pushed Jung Woo.

180
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,859
Say hi to Eun Woo.

181
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,530
Ji Woo looks taken aback too.

182
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,629
- They just met. - "Who are these guys?"

183
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,169
(What are the Woo Brothers looking at?)

184
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,710
- Say hi to Eun Woo. - Say hi.

185
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,210
Oh, the rabbit that Ji Woo is holding.

186
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,479
- They were interested in that. - The rabbit doll.

187
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,179
That's how kids grow closer.

188
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,749
- Kids like animals. - Right.

189
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,189
She might feel pressured...

190
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,850
- if they approach too quickly. - Right.

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
Nice to meet you. Hi, Ji Woo.

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,030
(They want to touch the rabbit.)

193
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,729
- Everyone, take your seats. - Go and sit over there.

194
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,830
Hurry up and sit.

195
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,999
Nice to meet you. Hi, Ji Woo.

196
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,640
They're not even looking at him.

197
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,770
(They're still looking at the rabbit doll.)

198
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,809
Oh, our friends here...

199
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,809
don't know their manners.

200
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,150
They don't know their manners.

201
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,950
If you don't sit down, I will say, "Bad boy."

202
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,080
- "Bad boy." - "Bad boy." They understand that.

203
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,590
Until now, Eun Woo and Jung Woo...

204
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,289
have only met nice and gentle uncles and aunties.

205
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,489
That's right.

206
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:15,129
(Uncle Eun Woo who fed him fruit)

207
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,460
Handsome Uncle Eun Woo.

208
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,530
- Jung Woo. - And kind Auntie MINJI.

209
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,299
They were all gentle. Right.

210
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,299
(Even MINJI, who let Jung Woo sit on her lap)

211
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,140
(Jung Woo, life is not always so gentle.)

212
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,739
I thought they should get a taste of spiciness today.

213
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,479
- A taste of spiciness? - If you don't sit down,

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,580
I will say, "Bad boy."

215
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:36,280
Doesn't Dong Min look like a black goat in that costume?

216
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,690
(He definitely looks like a black goat)

217
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,920
"Bad boy."

218
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,759
Dad, you're the assistant teacher. Come here.

219
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,090
Am I sitting here too?

220
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:49,659
- Seriously... - "Am I..."

221
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,529
- "sitting here too?" - How do you react to that?

222
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,100
As an example, I will show you how Dad gets whipped.

223
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,470
I will show you how Dad gets whipped.

224
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,200
- But... - Why would he hit Dad?

225
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,470
Are we starting a skit as soon as we get here?

226
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,040
Assistant teacher, come here.

227
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,639
- This is so funny. - This is what happens today...

228
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,950
if you misbehave. Watch.

229
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,249
- The kids look so confused. - You will get whipped like this.

230
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,180
- How will you do it? - I'll hit you on the shins.

231
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,249
My shins?

232
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:14,920
That's too mean.

233
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,320
- He just wanted to hit Jun Ho. - If you misbehave, I'll whip you.

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,560
You'll get hit like this.

235
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,129
- You'll get hit like this. - The kids will be scared.

236
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,359
- You'll get hit like this. - "Why is he hitting my dad?"

237
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,800
- He could think that. - You should sit properly. Hurry.

238
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,139
You should sit properly. Hurry.

239
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,139
(Sitting up straight)

240
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:33,540
(Teacher, I sat up straight!)

241
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,769
Jang Ji Woo, look at this.

242
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:35,869
Eun Woo sat up straight.

243
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,210
- But what about Jung Woo? - You'll get hit like this.

244
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,139
You'll get hit like this, okay?

245
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,050
- You should sit properly. Hurry. - Jang Ji Woo.

246
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,710
- Jung Woo. - Where is Jung Woo going?

247
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,820
- Look at this. - Where are you going?

248
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,119
Still, Eun Woo knew how to read the room since he's older.

249
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,389
- He knows. - Right.

250
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,290
But Jung Woo doesn't care if Dad is getting hit or not.

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,790
- He went back to the rabbit. - To the rabbit.

252
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,359
He went back to the rabbit.

253
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,999
He's so cute.

254
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,670
"I will touch that rabbit, for sure."

255
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,600
- He doesn't care at all. - Right.

256
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,639
The rabbit must've still been on his mind.

257
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,570
(Could I maybe touch it?)

258
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,479
Jung Woo and Si Woo, leave.

259
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,909
He kicked them out.

260
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,580
(I feel wronged!)

261
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,249
Oh, how cute.

262
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,950
(What a shame. I'll touch the rabbit next time.)

263
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,389
Do you know how to say hello?

264
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,590
- Hello. - There you go.

265
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,119
- Hello. - There you go.

266
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,129
Eun Woo and Ji Woo, you have to say hello to each other.

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,100
The two of you, say hello.

268
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,769
- Hello. - Hello.

269
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,970
- They're so adorable. - Are they on a blind date?

270
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,170
Isn't that so cute?

271
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,269
(So cute)

272
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,639
What? That's so cute.

273
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,979
That's how you say hello when you're on a blind date.

274
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,909
- Hello. - "Hello, it's nice to meet you."

275
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,979
- Hello. - "Yes, I've heard a lot about you."

276
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,320
- Hello. - Hello.

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,489
They're eight months apart.

278
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:56,790
They were so adorable.

279
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,820
- Oh, goodness. - Will you...

280
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,159
That's how you say hello when you're on a blind date.

281
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,330
(In that case...)

282
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,830
Hi, Eun Woo.

283
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,159
Hi, Eun Woo.

284
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,729
Hi, Ji Woo.

285
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,100
- Hi, Ji Woo. - Oh, my.

286
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,970
Oh, goodness.

287
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,040
- Eun Woo. - Oh, my.

288
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,899
Eun Woo.

289
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:14,810
(Grinning)

290
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,310
- She called him by his name. - He likes it.

291
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,779
My name is Jang Ji Woo.

292
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,950
My name is Jang Ji Woo.

293
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,320
(Ji Woo? I'm Eun Woo.)

294
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
What is your name?

295
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,159
What is your name?

296
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm Kim Eun Woo.

297
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,960
"I'm Kim Eun Woo."

298
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,359
- Eun Woo is shy. - Yes.

299
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,769
(Shy)

300
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,440
What? Oh, my.

301
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,369
- No way. - No way!

302
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,369
He approaches her.

303
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,310
Let's shake hands.

304
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,940
- "Let's shake hands." - "Let's shake hands."

305
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,850
- He asked her to shake hands. - Let's shake hands.

306
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,519
- He's a gentleman. - He approached her first...

307
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,920
- as he's older. - Eun Woo is a very cautious child.

308
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,359
But he bravely approached Ji Woo and asked to shake hands.

309
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,629
Let's shake hands.

310
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:08,989
(They shyly hold hands.)

311
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,729
- He sure is older. - Oh, goodness.

312
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:12,499
- He sure is older. - This was...

313
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,430
Eun Woo's first time meeting a younger girl.

314
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,940
I think this is the first time Eun Woo has asked to shake hands.

315
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:21,609
(Achieved through Eun Woo's courage)

316
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,180
Let's shake hands.

317
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,810
Eun Woo is still a baby too.

318
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,979
But seeing him there, he seems to mature.

319
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,450
- Right. He seems like a big boy. - Yes.

320
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,619
(The village teacher had a huge effect on them.)

321
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,420
From now on, I will teach you how to properly greet others.

322
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,159
If you don't listen,

323
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,830
I will change into a scary monster.

324
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,859
- I don't think he has to change. - He's already...

325
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:45,430
(I think you've already changed.)

326
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,229
You will listen to me now, right?

327
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,129
You will listen to me now, right?

328
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,999
Yes.

329
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,909
Answer loudly!

330
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:57,310
- Answer loudly! - The kids will get scared.

331
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,810
- Yes! - There you go.

332
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,350
- Yes! - There you go.

333
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,710
- What about Ji Woo? - Yes!

334
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,519
- Ji Woo does a good job, of course. - There you go.

335
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,350
So, when you greet your elders, you stand like this.

336
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:09,119
You place your hands...

337
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,359
on your belly button like this, and you say, "Hello."

338
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,489
That's how you do it.

339
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,029
There you go. Like this. Copy the teacher.

340
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,070
- That's how you do it. - There you go.

341
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,029
- They're doing well. - They are.

342
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,239
- Hello! - Hello!

343
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,869
- Hello! - Hello!

344
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,009
Gosh, he's behaving so well.

345
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,909
He has a loud voice too.

346
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,779
- Hello! - Hello!

347
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,820
Nice. Ji Woo, you should try too.

348
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,149
Hello!

349
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,320
- Oh, she's doing so well. - Are they having a battle?

350
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,060
Hello!

351
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,859
- There you go. - Good. Jung Woo, say, "Hello."

352
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,200
(Can 19-month-old Jung Woo say "Hello?)

353
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,700
- Say, "Hello." - He...

354
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,869
(Hel...)

355
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,729
- Hello! - There you go.

356
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:56,899
Good.

357
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,109
Hello!

358
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:02,639
(Big brother Eun Woo makes sure Jung Woo learns how to bow.)

359
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,310
He looks dizzy.

360
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,580
- Still, he bowed. - There you go.

361
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,279
There's an adult here.

362
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,580
What should you do when you see an adult?

363
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,019
- Ji Woo too. - Hello!

364
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,820
Hello.

365
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,190
There you go.

366
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,220
There's another adult.

367
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,989
Hello!

368
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,800
- Hello. - Ji Woo is doing...

369
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
- so well. - Just like that,

370
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,129
you should run over and say hello to adults, okay?

371
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,700
- Okay! - Okay!

372
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,440
- Okay. - They're doing really well.

373
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,540
All right. Go back to your seats.

374
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,909
Let's sit down and take a test.

375
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,509
(To my seat!)

376
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,710
(Falling over)

377
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,820
(Ji Woo bumped her head while trying to sit down.)

378
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,159
Are you okay? Get up.

379
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,330
(Sweet)

380
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,170
- He's so sweet. - Goodness, how sweet.

381
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,229
(Dad has never seen Eun Woo act like a big brother to a girl either.)

382
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,970
Are you okay? Get up.

383
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,440
- "Get up." - There you go.

384
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,670
"Get up."

385
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,369
There you go.

386
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,879
Are you okay?

387
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,609
Yes. I'm brave.

388
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,850
Look how he's patting her on the head.

389
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,550
That day, Eun Woo took great care of Ji Woo.

390
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,649
My goodness.

391
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,290
Are you okay?

392
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,259
(Sweet older brother Eun Woo takes good care of Ji Woo.)

393
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:27,129
Watch the teacher.

394
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,229
All right.

395
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,999
- Watch me. - Okay.

396
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,100
"Watch me?"

397
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,830
All right.

398
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,369
Try doing this.

399
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,170
- How? - How?

400
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,040
Try winking.

401
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,269
- So cute. - Like this.

402
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:45,440
Try winking. Like this.

403
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,580
(Wink, like this?)

404
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,509
Wink.

405
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,050
- Oh, my. He winked. - Wink.

406
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:53,850
- Wink. - What are they doing?

407
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,249
(Suddenly, it seems like they're flirting.)

408
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:03,190
(Their first meeting was awkward and felt uncomfortable.)

409
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,759
(Their first meeting was awkward and felt uncomfortable.)

410
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,499
(Starting with a shy handshake...)

411
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:12,899
Yes, you did a good job.

412
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:13,909
Are you okay?

413
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,639
(He lent her a hand when she needed help.)

414
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,379
Now, the awkwardness is gone.

415
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,879
- They don't seem awkward anymore. - Try winking.

416
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,249
- Wink. - They've opened up to each other.

417
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,680
They've opened their hearts to each other.

418
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,790
(Eun Woo and Ji Woo have grown much closer.)

419
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,590
What are you two doing in the middle of the lesson?

420
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,229
- The mood was so nice. - Yes, they were having a good time.

421
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,359
He ruined it.

422
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,129
"What are you doing in the middle of the lesson?"

423
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,830
(Shy)

424
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:45,700
All right. Since you did well with your greetings,

425
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,269
I will give you some snacks.

426
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,070
- Assistant teacher. - Yes?

427
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,210
Go over there and bring the snacks.

428
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,210
Okay.

429
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,609
(Sticking to his role)

430
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:56,310
I was pretty busy that day too.

431
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:57,550
- I was moving the whole time. - Your role was...

432
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,820
There you go. Oh, thank you.

433
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,820
That looks good.

434
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,060
Who wants these snacks? Raise your hand.

435
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,389
Me!

436
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,129
- Eun Woo. - Eun Woo.

437
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,500
- Eun Woo wants one too. - What about Jung Woo?

438
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,730
These snacks have very tasty chocolate...

439
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,169
- and honey inside too. - Snack.

440
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,340
- "Snack." - "Snack."

441
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,899
- "Snack." - They're magic snacks.

442
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,709
If you want to eat this, answer me.

443
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,139
Me!

444
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,580
Eun Woo!

445
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,810
- All right. - What about you, Jung Woo?

446
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,350
- Do you want one too, Jung Woo? - Yes.

447
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,419
Raise your hand, then.

448
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,119
Raise your hand.

449
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,219
Both hands.

450
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,419
- Raise your hand. - Hurray.

451
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,419
He must really want the snack.

452
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,520
Say, "Give me, please."

453
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,990
- All right. - Say, "Give me, please."

454
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,760
He wants it now.

455
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,090
- His hands are so cute. - "Please."

456
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,899
You will carry these and give one to each person, okay?

457
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,800
- Okay. - What a good boy.

458
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,240
Carry that and hand them out.

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,570
- Give one to each person. - Who will you give it to first?

460
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,969
(As soon as he gets the snacks,)

461
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,010
(he gives one to Ji Woo first.)

462
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,179
(Ji Woo, eat this.)

463
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:02,310
- He's taking care of Ji Woo first. - He gave one to Ji Woo first.

464
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,219
Maybe it's because she was a younger sister,

465
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,780
- Right. - but he took care of Ji Woo first.

466
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,689
Eun Woo should really have a younger sister.

467
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,159
- He takes such good care of her. - I know.

468
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,659
He should have a younger sister.

469
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,929
Eun Woo wants one.

470
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,629
- Your third child must be a girl. - Right.

471
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,399
Pardon? Are we deciding that for him?

472
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,570
Since the last time until now, I will remain silent on this matter.

473
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,199
(Will Eun Woo's wish come true?)

474
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,540
(I want another younger sibling!)

475
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,209
(Thank you, Eun Woo.)

476
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:29,740
Sit down and eat.

477
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,510
There you go.

478
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,179
Say thank you, Jung Woo.

479
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,179
There you go. Sit down.

480
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,820
- Say thank you to Eun Woo. - Mine.

481
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,850
- Sit down and eat. - Mine.

482
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,879
No!

483
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,949
Jung Woo always goes for double servings.

484
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,790
- No! - But Eun Woo says he can't have it.

485
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,830
After you eat this.

486
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:50,159
- After you eat this. - He should eat that one first.

487
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,629
Eat your snack first.

488
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,100
Eun Woo has gotten charismatic since becoming the class president.

489
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,699
(An intense fight)

490
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,570
No!

491
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,399
Jung Woo, sit down and eat. You can have another one later.

492
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,010
- No... - You have to sit down and eat.

493
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,169
You'll get another one later.

494
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,679
(We each have to eat one.)

495
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,010
Sit down.

496
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,350
(Now is the time!)

497
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,179
You can't beat Jung Woo.

498
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,619
(He successfully steals it!)

499
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,949
His hands are faster than the speed of light.

500
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,790
Seriously, while Eun Woo was looking somewhere else...

501
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,189
You can't beat Jung Woo.

502
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,560
Eun Woo didn't see that, right?

503
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,030
- He didn't. - He didn't see it.

504
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,629
He's tenacious when it comes to snacks.

505
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,929
- Right. - He's the best.

506
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:27,169
And you need to eat snacks with both hands, you know.

507
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,669
Since you kids did a great job,

508
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,709
I feel very happy.

509
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,409
- Class is over! - Are you sure he's happy?

510
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,740
- Over! - Over!

511
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,609
- But before we move on... - Yes?

512
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,780
Eun Woo has been greeting people a lot more since visiting Dong Min.

513
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,280
- Really? - Is that so?

514
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,379
I didn't ask him to, but when I was leaving,

515
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:46,990
he tells me things like, "Drive safely."

516
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,820
- The manner lesson worked. - Really.

517
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,790
(News flash: Kim Eun Woo becomes the greeting king!)

518
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,060
Since you came to Wonju,

519
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,459
you have to live self-sufficiently.

520
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,490
Right.

521
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,859
Picky eaters? They don't exist here.

522
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,469
They'll eat everything. Don't worry.

523
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,669
Eun Woo, come on out.

524
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's work.

525
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,609
- We have to work. - Ji Woo.

526
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,879
Oh, they have to work.

527
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,409
Let's go. Come on.

528
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,510
They're wearing work clothes.

529
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,419
- By the way, Jung Woo ended up... - Look at Jung Woo.

530
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,080
- with the rabbit in his hand. - He did.

531
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,320
- Oh, that's Ji Woo's rabbit. - Yes, he got it.

532
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
- How did he get that? - Right.

533
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,020
Jung Woo will become a successful man.

534
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,820
(Jung Woo likes rabbits more than dinosaurs.)

535
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,290
Wabbit.

536
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,330
(He means rabbit.)

537
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,730
- With his tenacity... - Jung Woo is...

538
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,629
He was like that with the snack earlier too.

539
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,969
He gets what he wants in the end.

540
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,840
- He has that tenacity. - He wins it over.

541
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,010
(The tenacious boy, Kim Jung Woo)

542
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,109
- He's so cool. - With the rabbit in one hand.

543
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,109
- So cool. - He's so adorable.

544
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,179
(They're overflowing with cuteness.)

545
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,780
You guys look so cute. Come on.

546
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,280
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

547
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,619
- Let's go. - Let's go.

548
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:59,020
(The 37-month-old city boy, Kim Eun Woo)

549
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,290
(The 29-month-old pro-farmer, Jang Ji Woo)

550
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,359
(The 19-month-old village foreman, Kim Jung Woo)

551
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,030
Living self-sufficiently.

552
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,169
They've transformed into cute farmers.

553
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,439
Let's go.

554
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,240
- Where are we going now? - Us? To the garden.

555
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,340
We're going to the garden.

556
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,109
Dong Min said we had to be self-sufficient.

557
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:20,139
He said we were going to the garden to harvest something.

558
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,850
I was worried about what he might make me do.

559
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,320
And I was wondering if the kids would follow along.

560
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,350
I was worried about that too.

561
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,919
(Living self-sufficiently in Wonju...)

562
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,159
(They gather food as they spill blood and sweat.)

563
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,030
We just had lunch.

564
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,100
(It takes them all day long to eat one meal.)

565
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,510
(If they can't gather food, they only get plain rice.)

566
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,909
(Dad Dong Min's spicy self-sufficient life)

567
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:58,449
(Will the Woo Brothers be able to do well?)

568
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,149
Since the Woo Brothers were coming over,

569
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:05,790
Dong Min's mother left a bit of napa cabbages and radishes.

570
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,189
- I see. - So they could have...

571
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:09,189
a self-sufficient living experience.

572
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,959
- That's great. - She left just that much.

573
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,429
This is the garden.

574
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,770
That day, as we harvest those, we broke a sweat.

575
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,300
- Oh, really? - Yes.

576
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,639
So, these are radishes.

577
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,409
- There you go. My goodness. - Ji Woo, did you already get one?

578
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,409
- Gosh, of course. She knows. - It's easy for her.

579
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:30,080
She's a pro.

580
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,480
- She's a farmer. - Ji Woo is good, indeed.

581
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,520
Ji Woo has done this a lot before, so she's good at it.

582
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,790
You pull out the radish that's in the ground.

583
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,260
(You can pull it out like this, just like how Ji Woo did it.)

584
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Okay?

585
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,290
Ji Woo is your senior.

586
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,000
- She knows how it's done. - Yes, that's right.

587
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,399
She's a senior farmer.

588
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,629
I'm a senior in farming.

589
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,770
(I'm a senior in farming.)

590
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,909
- That's right. - Oh, my.

591
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:55,510
Oh, my. She says she's a senior.

592
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,139
- She knows the word, "senior?" - The word "senior..."

593
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,139
A senior?

594
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,609
Yes, put it in here.

595
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:01,949
(The city boy's pride was slightly hurt.)

596
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,179
Should I pull out another one?

597
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,350
- "Should I pull out another one?" - Should I pull it out?

598
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,949
Ji Woo, there's one in the front too.

599
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,590
In the front. Pull out the radish.

600
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,189
- There you go. - All right.

601
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,129
That one must not come out easily.

602
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,959
- It must be in deep. - Right.

603
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,399
- It must be hard. - It's hard for kids.

604
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,169
(Grunting)

605
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:23,100
- Hey. - Eun Woo, you should pull it out.

606
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,070
(The senior farmer is faced with a difficulty.)

607
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,969
That's so adorable.

608
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:31,040
Let's work together to pull this out.

609
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,209
She said, "Let's pull this out."

610
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,609
(Eun Woo steps up to help Ji Woo.)

611
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,109
- She asked Eun Woo. - Is he going to help her?

612
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,350
Oh, yes. Eun Woo.

613
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,649
(But actually, our dear Eun Woo is...)

614
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,219
(He likes standing in front of people...)

615
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,520
- Posing for photo sessions... - How adorable.

616
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,119
- is Eun Woo's specialty. - So cute.

617
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,090
- He's a typical city boy. - That's right.

618
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,629
- He's the Prince of Ilsan. - Yes.

619
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,959
(I'm city boy Kim Eun Woo, the Prince of Ilsan.)

620
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,530
Will he be good at this too?

621
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,639
Will he be able to do it?

622
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:59,070
In front of his younger sister...

623
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,939
Something she couldn't do.

624
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,310
Pull it with both hands.

625
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,540
- With 2 hands. - With 2 hands.

626
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,510
- With two hands. - They should yank it out.

627
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:07,879
Yank it out at once.

628
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:09,750
That's crucial for his image.

629
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,780
(Ji Woo is watching.)

630
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:12,980
It wouldn't budge earlier.

631
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,490
(Will he be able to do it?)

632
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:21,290
(He pulled it out in one go!)

633
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,560
He's a big brother, indeed.

634
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,899
There you go.

635
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,629
(He pulled out the radish swiftly.)

636
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,669
(Radishes? No problem.)

637
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,540
I think he found his hidden superpower.

638
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,939
(Our Eun Woo has changed.)

639
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,939
Eun Woo is so strong.

640
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,780
Put it in here.

641
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,149
He's so strong.

642
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,080
He threw it in.

643
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,179
(Hey, I picked this up on my way here.)

644
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,520
- He threw the radish. - Right.

645
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,750
He has become a tough guy since coming here.

646
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,490
(Eun Woo is so amazing.)

647
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,889
He was better at farming than I thought.

648
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,590
Eun Woo is so strong.

649
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,189
He's a city boy who seems like he wouldn't get his hands dirty.

650
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,459
(A city boy? I'm the youth leader of the village now!)

651
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,100
- He's so strong. - I'll put this here.

652
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,399
- He's a strong boy. - He pulled out another one.

653
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,969
(I picked this up on the way here too.)

654
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,830
(Grunting)

655
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,100
Eun Woo, you're so strong.

656
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,740
Eun Woo, you're so strong.

657
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,840
- Why does this suit him? - I know, right?

658
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,909
(He's overflowing with strength.)

659
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,679
- He seems like a manly man. - That's so cute.

660
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,679
- He looks so manly. - Goodness.

661
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,879
(Sometimes, he can't control his power.)

662
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,219
(Congratulations. It turns out the countryside is perfect for him.)

663
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,350
- Pull it up. - There you go.

664
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,619
(Congratulations. It turns out the countryside is perfect for him.)

665
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,260
- He's doing better than I expected. - Right.

666
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,990
- Why is he so good? - I thought he would struggle.

667
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,090
There you go.

668
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,760
(He can easily lift the radish with one hand.)

669
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,459
Look at him. My gosh.

670
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,070
- Gosh, that's... - Right.

671
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,540
- Radishes are heavy. - Right.

672
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,740
(At least for today, Eun Woo is a manly guy.)

673
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,770
"See that?"

674
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
- "Look." - My gosh.

675
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Ji Woo, grab the leafy top and pull it.

676
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,409
There you go.

677
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,250
- There you go. - Ji Woo, put it here.

678
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,290
It looks like Eun Woo and Ji Woo are battling it out.

679
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,850
- That's possible. - Yes.

680
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,090
Ji Woo, this is heavy. How did you lift this?

681
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,290
- My gosh. - Radishes are heavy.

682
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,590
(Experienced ones are different indeed.)

683
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,659
(A professional farmer)

684
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,889
Well done.

685
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:04,959
Thanks to Eun Woo and Ji Woo,

686
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,600
we'll be able to have tasty food today.

687
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:10,100
All right. If you want to eat, you must work. Got it?

688
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,139
But Dong Min and Jun Ho...

689
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:12,139
- aren't working. - The dads...

690
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:13,800
He's so annoying.

691
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,209
(Jung Woo takes care of the bunny instead of working.)

692
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:17,679
- The bunny. - He's hooked on the bunny.

693
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,080
Jung Woo, pull this. Go ahead. Come on.

694
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,409
- He got attached to the bunny now. - Yes.

695
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,679
- Go ahead. - The bunny...

696
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:27,149
- My gosh. He doesn't want to. - Oh, no.

697
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,919
There's no time to cry.

698
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,520
- Right. There's no time to cry. - Jung Woo and Eun Woo...

699
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,590
- don't have time to cry. - Right.

700
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,619
We must work.

701
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,330
- So we can have tasty food. - Hurry.

702
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,800
All right. Pull this one.

703
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:40,100
- Eun Woo. - Eun Woo, you try it.

704
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,129
Pull it out with Ji Woo.

705
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,600
(The Woo Siblings came to harvest carrots.)

706
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,000
- There you go. Pull hard. - My gosh.

707
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,770
- Keep working. - Their bodies might ache later.

708
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,139
- There you go. - Seriously.

709
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,139
Dong Min. Ji Woo works like a real farmer.

710
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,879
She's taking it so seriously.

711
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,379
- She's good. - When she works on the field...

712
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:57,449
(I'm serious right now.)

713
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,179
- My gosh, did you hear her? - There you go.

714
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,020
My gosh, there's a dinosaur.

715
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,159
That's it. All right. Keep pulling.

716
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,189
(You show us too, Eun Woo.)

717
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,060
- Go ahead. Show us. - There you go.

718
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,159
- There you go. - Gosh, that's a big carrot.

719
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,169
- That's huge. - My gosh.

720
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:15,869
- What did you just pull out? - The carrot is huge.

721
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,399
- What's this? - Eun Woo, raise it and show us.

722
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,409
(How did he do that?)

723
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:22,669
- What did you just pull out? - It's a carrot.

724
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,209
- A carrot. - It's a carrot.

725
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,949
Dong Min's mother did a great job farming the vegetables.

726
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,550
- There you go. - That's it.

727
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,020
- Put it in here. - My gosh.

728
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,020
- That's it. - Eun Woo is great at this.

729
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,219
- My gosh. - Put it in here.

730
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:36,990
Into the basket. There you go.

731
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,959
He keeps pulling them out.

732
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,530
- Gosh, you got another one. - It's fun to pull it out.

733
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,459
- It comes out smoothly. You know? - My gosh.

734
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,730
(A clean city boy, Eun Woo)

735
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,000
Bring it here.

736
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,570
Eun Woo is doing better than I expected.

737
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,570
I bet this is a great learning experience...

738
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,369
- for the kids. - Right.

739
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,939
Let's see.

740
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,310
A long time ago,

741
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,439
this was enough to be a meal for people.

742
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:00,679
- We have to peel it and eat it. - What?

743
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,310
Come on. Don't do that.

744
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:04,850
You suddenly peeled it with your teeth...

745
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,119
- in front of them? - Right.

746
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,619
Is that absolutely necessary?

747
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,359
- We have to peel it like this. - Dong Min.

748
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,129
- Why is he doing that? - Okay.

749
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:16,959
- He got carried away. - I don't get it.

750
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,699
I saw a knife next to him. But why did he do that?

751
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,929
Dong Min. My gosh.

752
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:26,570
(A culture shock)

753
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:29,510
(Dad...)

754
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,850
(All of a sudden, he turns into a monster.)

755
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,280
You'll ruin your teeth.

756
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
"You'll ruin your teeth."

757
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,520
- Right. We wanted to say that. - Exactly.

758
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,820
Right. She's wise.

759
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,219
(Worried)

760
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:45,959
Ji Woo is wise.

761
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,230
Dong Min, you're throwing out half of that.

762
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:51,300
- All right. We got it. - Aren't you losing half of that?

763
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,830
I'm done peeling it. I can eat this now.

764
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,270
(Crunchy)

765
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,010
- Gosh, did you listen to the sound? - How is it?

766
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,409
- You know what? - How does it taste?

767
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,869
- Winter radishes are tasty. - They're sweet.

768
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,250
- It's really tasty. - It must be sweet then.

769
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,310
People said having freshly harvested radishes...

770
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,419
was like taking medicine as long as we didn't burp.

771
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:13,850
- Right. - Right?

772
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,850
- Snack. - How is it?

773
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,219
Do you want to have some, Jung Woo?

774
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:18,419
Yes.

775
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:19,959
(Foodie Jung Woo was the first one to spot food.)

776
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,689
- Jung Woo thinks it's a snack. - Yes.

777
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:28,969
(When everyone was working, he only held onto the bunny doll.)

778
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:30,570
It's so good.

779
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:34,139
It's so good.

780
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,409
(Hearing that it tasted great, he tossed away his favorite doll.)

781
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,580
(He went straight to the radish as if he were under a spell.)

782
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,409
- Are you going to eat some? - Yes.

783
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,850
You want to eat it?

784
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,719
(Give me the radish, please.)

785
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,820
- That. - How is it?

786
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,790
- Do you want to have some? - Yes.

787
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,159
Dong Min, Jung Woo wants to try it.

788
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,090
I'll give it to you. Raise your hand if you want some.

789
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,189
Me.

790
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,030
- Me. - Me.

791
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,369
- The kids all want to try it. - Sure.

792
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,469
It's sweet and crunchy.

793
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,199
- Let me try it first. - Tell him to try it.

794
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,609
- Dad, try it. - Yes.

795
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:10,840
- Snack. - Snack.

796
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,139
- Snack. - Radishes are super sweet.

797
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:14,480
It's not bitter. It's sweet.

798
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,510
- It's sweet, right? - Yes. It's sweet.

799
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,850
- Fall and winter radishes... - Right.

800
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,879
are sweet like this.

801
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,149
Eun Woo, try it. It's tasty.

802
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,689
(They don't usually eat raw radishes even when their parents beg them.)

803
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,949
- It's good. - It's sweet and refreshing.

804
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,219
- Yes. - Right.

805
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,159
- Kids are so cute. - It's so refreshing.

806
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:31,000
- The radishes are so good. - They're good. Right?

807
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,530
- They harvested the radishes too. - Right.

808
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,100
- There. - If we give raw radishes at home,

809
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,969
- they wouldn't eat the radishes. - They wouldn't eat.

810
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,969
- How is it? Isn't it good? - Yes.

811
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,510
- Say, "Thank you." - Eun Woo.

812
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,740
When you eat something tasty,

813
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,379
you say, "It's good."

814
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,409
- It's good. - It's good.

815
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,719
- She's... - It's good.

816
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,179
It's good.

817
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,050
How good is it?

818
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,919
(This much!)

819
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:57,990
He likes it that much.

820
00:30:58,419 --> 00:30:59,520
- I want more. - Let's try it.

821
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,719
- Let's do it today. - I want more.

822
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,030
Jung Woo keeps asking for more.

823
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
- I want more. - What are you doing?

824
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,230
Since you ate, you must work.

825
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,330
(The radish is so good.)

826
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,629
- Go on and pull it out. - We should help them.

827
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,600
Jung Woo won't stop eating now.

828
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,300
Jung Woo isn't working actually.

829
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,709
He's like the village chief who wants to watch and just eat.

830
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,540
- I want more. - Ji Woo, your dad is calling you.

831
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,480
- I want more. - He wants more.

832
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,149
- I want more. - "I want more snacks."

833
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,219
That's all he did that day. Saying that he wanted more.

834
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,419
(Laughing)

835
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:27,790
That's his catchphrase.

836
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,949
(The radishes in season won over Jung Woo's palate.)

837
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,090
- How can he enjoy it that much? - Gosh, seriously.

838
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,560
- Is it good? - "Is it good?"

839
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,859
- He's looking after his brother. - So cute.

840
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,830
But you know what? When the kids...

841
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,230
come here and eat the produce they harvested personally,

842
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,439
they get competitive,

843
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,439
- so they eat more. - I see.

844
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,000
Then they realize how tasty the vegetables are,

845
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,639
so they'll keep eating vegetables later.

846
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:49,740
They'll become familiar.

847
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,109
Right. This is why it's important...

848
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,439
- for kids to have these activities. - Of course.

849
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,179
Here.

850
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,310
Eun Woo, should we move?

851
00:31:58,419 --> 00:31:59,850
Do you know what kids like for sure?

852
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,020
When I asked her to choose between the countryside...

853
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
- and an apartment... - Okay.

854
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,189
Pick. The countryside or an apartment?

855
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:05,919
(A balance game: The countryside versus apartments)

856
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,560
Okay. Apartment.

857
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,359
(Apartment!)

858
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,500
Apartment.

859
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,530
Eun Woo. Do you like the countryside or the apartment?

860
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,469
Eun Woo. Do you like the countryside or the apartment?

861
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:19,740
(What about Eun Woo then?)

862
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,340
(Curious)

863
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,169
- It's... - Do you want more?

864
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:26,939
(I'll think about it more.)

865
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:29,179
All right. Let's load the radishes,

866
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,280
napa cabbages, and carrots into this cart.

867
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,189
All right. This is a green onion.

868
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,119
- They harvested green onions too. - Should we pull a green onion?

869
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,659
(Afterward, he pulled a green onion in one go.)

870
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,359
- You got it. - That's as tall as Eun Woo.

871
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,760
I'll cut off the napa cabbages for you.

872
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,230
- The napa cabbages. - You carry them. Okay?

873
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,300
- Like that. Gosh, napa cabbages. - Oh, my.

874
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,199
- They're nice and dense. - He's a real man.

875
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,369
- There you go. Clap. - My goodness.

876
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,439
(Jung Woo puts the carrots in the cart too.)

877
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,740
Let's see which one of you can load more vegetables in here.

878
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,980
It's a game. Go!

879
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,909
Put the radishes in the cart too.

880
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,750
The radishes.

881
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,119
- She'll push the cart? - We have to load the radishes too.

882
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,520
(Let me move the cart toward the vegetables.)

883
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,050
You're pushing that, Ji Woo?

884
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,490
The vegetables are far from the cart.

885
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,119
- So you think bringing the cart... - She's pushing it...

886
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,260
- is easier than carrying veggies? - to the vegetables.

887
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,429
- She's smart. - She is so smart.

888
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:22,169
- Ji Woo. - You push it, Eun Woo.

889
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,000
(But the cart won't budge.)

890
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,340
Hurry up.

891
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,369
- Again? - He's stepping up.

892
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,409
Gosh, Eun Woo.

893
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,409
- My gosh, Eun Woo. - He's stepping up again?

894
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,580
Our dear Eun Woo is taking over.

895
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,879
One, two, three.

896
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:37,649
(Forget about the city boy, Kim Eun Woo.)

897
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,020
Gosh, right. I didn't know Eun Woo was so diligent.

898
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,419
He's a professional farmer.

899
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,189
Come here. I think you can push it.

900
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,260
One, two, three. Push it.

901
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:49,030
- There you go. Hey. - My goodness.

902
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,959
- There you go. Keep going. - Eun Woo is strong.

903
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,830
(Amazed)

904
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,030
It's really hard to balance...

905
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,230
- the cart. - It's hard.

906
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,600
Don't cry.

907
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:01,939
- My gosh. - Oh, no.

908
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,679
The cart fell over. Oh, no.

909
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,879
It's okay.

910
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,409
Oh, no.

911
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,780
(Their hard work fell over.)

912
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,050
They put a lot of vegetables in there.

913
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,049
(The dads are shocked.)

914
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:17,319
- What do they do? - The vegetables fell.

915
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:21,290
Oh, no. What will you do, Eun Woo?

916
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:26,159
No. My supermarket...

917
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,969
- Supermarket? - The cart...

918
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,239
Let's make it stand. The cart fell over.

919
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,540
- Hurry. The cart is down. - What do we do?

920
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:36,009
When we were pushing it...

921
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:37,369
When we pushed the cart,

922
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,610
the cart fell over to the ground.

923
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,880
- What do we do? - Oh, no.

924
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,210
- Oh, dear. - Come here.

925
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,920
Let's make it stand.

926
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,080
- Why is he running away? - Make it stand.

927
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,150
- Eun Woo, where are you going? - Eun Woo.

928
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,360
- Eun Woo. Hold on. - Make it stand.

929
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,589
- Eun Woo. - He's walking away.

930
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:56,690
- Oh, no. - Eun Woo. Where are you going?

931
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,299
- Eun Woo. - Where are you going?

932
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,929
(I want to be alone right now.)

933
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,369
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

934
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,469
- You can't run away. - Ji Woo is chasing him.

935
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,199
- Eun Woo. - What are they doing?

936
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,699
- Where are you going? - He's leaving?

937
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,670
Where is he going?

938
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,580
Clean up your mess before you go.

939
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,639
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

940
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,909
- Where? - Where are you going, Eun Woo.

941
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:15,949
He doesn't want to look weak to her.

942
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:16,980
Eun Woo.

943
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,920
Eun Woo is embarrassed.

944
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,889
Ji Woo is going, "Eun Woo, make it stand. Where are you going?"

945
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:25,589
Eun Woo is running away farther since Ji Woo is chasing after him.

946
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,259
(He's embarrassed and excited.)

947
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:28,989
It became a game.

948
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:31,900
Let's hurry up and make it stand.

949
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,799
- They're so cute. - Yes.

950
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,569
What will he do?

951
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:36,900
(How will I make it stand?)

952
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,600
If you don't make it stand,

953
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,469
Uncle will turn into a monster.

954
00:35:41,469 --> 00:35:42,610
Hurry up and do it.

955
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,839
(I'll turn into a monster!)

956
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,210
(City Boy came to clean up the mess.)

957
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,310
Hurry up.

958
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,710
Let's make it stand before Uncle changes.

959
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,520
I'll do it with Dad.

960
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,389
(I'll do it with Dad.)

961
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,860
(He manages to make it stand again thanks to his dad's help.)

962
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,060
Eun Woo, you're cool.

963
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,560
I couldn't make it stand.

964
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,400
- My goodness. - She said that he was cool.

965
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,400
He made it stand again.

966
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,069
Today, it was like a rediscovery of Eun Woo.

967
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,670
- We saw his new sides. - I thought he wouldn't touch dirt.

968
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,670
I thought he would be distant.

969
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,509
So I expected Jung Woo to do better.

970
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,250
The way he pulled out radishes and carrots made me think,

971
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,949
"He's the older brother."

972
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,009
That's right.

973
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,580
Eun Woo does things when he has to.

974
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,589
I saw new sides of Eun Woo.

975
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,049
- How cute. - If you eat right after harvesting,

976
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:32,989
children won't pick their food.

977
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,730
- That's right. They eat the food... - That's right.

978
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,860
- It's so nice. - they harvested.

979
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,130
Let's go.

980
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:41,199
- That's right. Let's go. - It's so much fun.

981
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,270
Let's go home and eat something tasty.

982
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,100
My steps are light since the cart is full.

983
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,139
That's right.

984
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,909
(They'll make a tasty meal with the ingredients they got.)

985
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,179
Napa cabbage jeon.

986
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,880
- It's so tasty. - Napa cabbage jeon is so tasty.

987
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,380
(They'll make a tasty meal with the ingredients they got.)

988
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
- Sujebi. - Sujebi.

989
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Sujebi.

990
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
It looks tasty.

991
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,719
The two of you will sit here.

992
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:05,420
- Ji Woo, you don't need gloves. - No.

993
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,460
All right.

994
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,889
All right. You don't need gloves.

995
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,429
Just use cold water.

996
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,460
- What? - What?

997
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,259
- Cold water? - You don't need warm water, right?

998
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:16,100
It isn't that cold.

999
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,900
- Of course, it was cold. - It isn't that cold.

1000
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,369
- Underground water is freezing. - It's cold.

1001
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:21,610
No.

1002
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,569
It's so cold.

1003
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:28,210
You can't use warm water when you're self-sufficient.

1004
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,150
This is nothing.

1005
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,779
Is that so?

1006
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,790
Jun Ho is a city man.

1007
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,949
Eun Woo, hurry up and rinse it.

1008
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:40,520
This is what you do when you live in the countryside.

1009
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,529
- Look at Ji Woo. - Ji Woo has the right form.

1010
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:43,560
That's right.

1011
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
My goodness.

1012
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,630
(Ji Woo picks up a tool and cleans the vegetables.)

1013
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,339
When I start,

1014
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,299
- hurry up and clean it. - My goodness.

1015
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:56,569
- Let's take first place. - "When I start..."

1016
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,080
Okay, Eun Woo?

1017
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,509
Gosh, Ji Woo.

1018
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,210
- "Okay, Eun Woo?" - Gosh.

1019
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,719
Okay, Eun Woo?

1020
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,449
- She makes Eun Woo work. - Hold on.

1021
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:10,089
My baby.

1022
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:11,520
(My baby)

1023
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,290
(Is it a baby?)

1024
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,529
(My radish baby, come here.)

1025
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,199
- My goodness. - She's using her tiny hands.

1026
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,230
It looks like she's washing a baby's face.

1027
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,270
Seriously.

1028
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,330
I'm done.

1029
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,400
- Are you done? - Yes.

1030
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,139
You're right. You cleaned it well.

1031
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,839
- You cleaned it well. - Give it to me.

1032
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,380
Today, we won't use the anchovy broth.

1033
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,279
Since we harvested vegetables,

1034
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,509
let's make some vegetable broth and cook sujebi.

1035
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,679
- Sujebi? - Yes.

1036
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,119
- Children will like it. - Sujebi in winter.

1037
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,179
It sounds delicious.

1038
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,719
Imagine eating it with kimchi.

1039
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,690
- Seriously. - It's so tasty.

1040
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,819
When can we eat sujebi?

1041
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,460
- Dong Min can cook well. - Yes.

1042
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,589
- Soon. - He can cook well.

1043
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:49,630
That's right.

1044
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,360
(He slices the radish from the field.)

1045
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,199
(He adds a lot of green onions the children pulled out.)

1046
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,330
Dong Min works very fast.

1047
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,339
That's right.

1048
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,569
(Adding various vegetables)

1049
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:01,610
I can't cook without a recipe.

1050
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,110
But Dong Min cooks without a recipe.

1051
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,139
- He makes eyeball measurements. - Yes.

1052
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:06,179
- He just cooks easily. - Expert cooks do that.

1053
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,279
That's right.

1054
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,810
(Did it boil well?)

1055
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,319
(Checking the vegetable broth)

1056
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,350
It's hot.

1057
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,179
(My goodness)

1058
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,690
It smells great.

1059
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:17,949
Now, let's add...

1060
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,089
sujebi.

1061
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
- That part is hard. - I know.

1062
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,489
(He makes sujebi quickly.)

1063
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,100
(He tears and adds the dough repeatedly.)

1064
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,029
What? Why is there so much?

1065
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,770
Can you tear the dough like this?

1066
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,270
I'll try it.

1067
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,509
- Eun Woo will try it. - Children find such things fun.

1068
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,009
Make the pieces big or small depending on how you want them.

1069
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,580
(Eun Woo tears the dough into a bite-sized piece.)

1070
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,150
Put it in here.

1071
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,080
(He can put it in a ladle.)

1072
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,190
Compared to how it was in the field,

1073
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,449
- Eun Woo's energy level fell. - Put it in here.

1074
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,589
(His eyes are unfocused and his fingers are slow.)

1075
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,690
His eyes are a bit...

1076
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,089
I think he's tired.

1077
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,429
Wake up, Eun Woo.

1078
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:58,100
- He worked too hard in the field. - We're almost there.

1079
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,259
- I see. - He pulled out too many vegetables.

1080
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:02,699
- That's why he's in a daze. - His stamina...

1081
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,069
- is gone. - There's no soul.

1082
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,770
That's right. He's tired right now.

1083
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,339
- Of course, he's tired. - He used too much strength.

1084
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:08,909
- "Where am I?" - That's right.

1085
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,739
- "Who am I?" - My goodness.

1086
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,909
(Despite being tired, he works hard for a meal.)

1087
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,380
Nevertheless, he's determined to eat.

1088
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:14,909
He's determined to eat no matter what.

1089
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:16,509
(Eun Woo tears the sujebi dough with diligence.)

1090
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,380
Are you done?

1091
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,690
- Let go. - Give me the pieces Eun Woo tore.

1092
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,650
I'll add the pieces Eun Woo tore.

1093
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,560
That's right. Eun Woo made this.

1094
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,429
Sujebi is all done.

1095
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:31,330
Have you made jeon before?

1096
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,360
Of course. Just tell me what to do. I can make it well.

1097
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:35,299
Eun Woo, I'll give it a go.

1098
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,069
- Sit here. - Okay.

1099
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,699
Watch me do it.

1100
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:39,869
(Dad, good luck!)

1101
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,969
It's my first time eating radish jeon.

1102
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,839
Right? It's your first time eating it, right?

1103
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,239
- My goodness. Radish jeon? - Radish jeon?

1104
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,080
- I see. Radish jeon. - My goodness.

1105
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,980
- It's my first time seeing it. - My goodness.

1106
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,380
It's my first time seeing it.

1107
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,679
- It's tasty. I've had it. - Really?

1108
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,750
Yes. It's tasty.

1109
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,949
It's very sweet. It's a bit like potato jeon.

1110
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:56,049
- That's right. - The texture is similar.

1111
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:57,049
- Really? - I can imagine the taste.

1112
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,790
- It's refreshing. - Eun Woo, doesn't it look tasty?

1113
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,259
It's the radish we harvested earlier.

1114
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,029
(Eun Woo harvested a big radish.)

1115
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,929
He's tired.

1116
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:06,960
(Laughing)

1117
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,730
(Despite being tired, his eyes are on the radish.)

1118
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,730
It looks so tasty.

1119
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,199
I'll fry radish jeon well...

1120
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,699
and make your eyes go wide.

1121
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:15,339
- Flip them over. - Shall I flip them over?

1122
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,770
- The dish looks tasty. - Didn't I fry them well?

1123
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,080
- Yes. - You fried them well.

1124
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,139
- I think children will love it. - It looks so tasty.

1125
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,210
- Try it. - It's the vegetable they harvested.

1126
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,850
- Yes. It must be very tasty. - So it must be very tasty.

1127
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,580
It's the radish he pulled out.

1128
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,589
(He waited for this moment.)

1129
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,560
- Eun Woo, wake up. - Shouldn't Eun Woo go to sleep...

1130
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,159
since he's in that state?

1131
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,190
Oh, no. Eun Woo.

1132
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,630
This is a dream.

1133
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,060
(He's having a fierce fight against himself.)

1134
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,929
How is it?

1135
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,170
(Half asleep)

1136
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,500
- How is it? - How is it?

1137
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:46,969
- How's the radish jeon? - How is it?

1138
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,909
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

1139
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,540
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

1140
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,810
Is it really tasty?

1141
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,850
(Eun Woo, is it tasty?)

1142
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,380
Ji Woo, let's eat it.

1143
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,279
Ji Woo is fully awake.

1144
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,679
(Ji Woo takes a bite.)

1145
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,319
She must find it tasty.

1146
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,690
Is it buchimgae?

1147
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,589
It's radish jeon.

1148
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,589
How is it? I made it.

1149
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,389
Did I do a good job or a bad job?

1150
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:11,730
You did a good job.

1151
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,500
Did I do a good job? Thank you.

1152
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,659
Give me another one.

1153
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,969
- Give me another one. - I'll give you another one.

1154
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,400
I made it.

1155
00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:22,509
She's eating with gusto.

1156
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:23,569
(She takes a big bite.)

1157
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:25,679
- It's good. - Ji Woo, do you like radish jeon?

1158
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,909
She's eating with gusto.

1159
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,810
I also want it dipped in soy sauce.

1160
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,909
- My goodness. - Is that so?

1161
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:32,779
I put water in the soy sauce, so it's good.

1162
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:35,150
- Did you sip it in sauce? - Yes.

1163
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,520
- He asked if he dipped it in sauce. - I did.

1164
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,889
He knows how to eat it. What? My goodness.

1165
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,389
Eun Woo, doesn't it make your eyes go wide?

1166
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,460
- He loves it. - It's tasty.

1167
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:49,369
- Really? - It's tasty.

1168
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:51,000
- "It's tasty." - He finds it very tasty.

1169
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,199
It was so tasty that it chased away the drowsiness.

1170
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,699
She's so...

1171
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,909
It's incredible.

1172
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:59,040
(Jun Ho takes a bite after working hard.)

1173
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,279
(What do you think? Isn't it tasty?)

1174
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,850
- Isn't it really sweet? - Yes.

1175
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,679
- Is there no makgeolli? - What?

1176
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,179
- That's right. - I want to eat it.

1177
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,949
You should eat it. It's so tasty.

1178
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:09,989
- Really? - It's so tasty.

1179
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,290
Now comes the sujebi.

1180
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,360
- My goodness. - Try it.

1181
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,330
- Let's try it. - Finally, sujebi.

1182
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,659
- The broth was made... - What do you think?

1183
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,600
with the vegetables from the field. It must be good.

1184
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,960
- It's tasty. - Is it tasty?

1185
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,600
- It must be refreshing. - I want more.

1186
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,900
- Do you want more? - All right.

1187
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,900
I'll drink a lot of soup.

1188
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:27,239
Really?

1189
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,210
- Is the soup tasty? - It must be tasty.

1190
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,869
- The soup is tasty. - It's very tasty.

1191
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,880
- Really? - "It's very tasty."

1192
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,210
(The meal became tastier thanks to the harvested vegetables.)

1193
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,679
(Starting with the village teacher's lesson on manners,)

1194
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,920
(Eun Woo became forward.)

1195
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:43,190
Hello.

1196
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,920
(He said hello loudly.)

1197
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,360
(Let's shake hands.)

1198
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,830
(Despite being shy, he asked for a handshake first.)

1199
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,770
(He worked in the field for the very first time.)

1200
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,969
He received a lesson on manners in the morning...

1201
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,900
and harvested vegetables in the field.

1202
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,440
- Then he helped with cooking. - There you go.

1203
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,869
(He pulled out green onions as well.)

1204
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:04,469
- He was exceptional. - That's right.

1205
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:06,540
Eun Woo was different from his usual self.

1206
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,009
Eun Woo, which one do you prefer, the countryside or an apartment?

1207
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:13,179
- The countryside. - Seriously. Eun Woo...

1208
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:14,650
Is that so?

1209
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,219
Thanks to Uncle Dong Min, he came to love the countryside.

1210
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:20,219
(He became absorbed in the charms of the countryside.)

1211
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,889

(They thought that the party would continue to be happy.)

1217
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,650
(Monster Santa suddenly appears.)

1218
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,920
(Ji Woo joins in because she's used to the skits.)

1219
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,719
Hello, children.

1220
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,389
(His voice is a bit scary.)

1221
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,290
(Even the straightforward baby, Jung Woo freezes.)

1222
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,000
(I'm Santa. I won't do any harm.)

1223
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:04,170

(Will Eun Woo go back to being a city boy?)

1227

One, two, three.

1228
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:17,909
Dad, I love you.

1229
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:20,949
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1230
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,250
Merry Christmas.

00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:31,799
(He looks nervous.)

1235
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,230
You're nervous.

1236
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,699
Seung Woo, you're nervous.

1237
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,600
That's right. It's nerve-racking to come to a dental clinic.

1238
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,900
Even adults hate dental clinics.

1239
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,400
I still get scared at a dental clinic.

1240
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,110
- It was hurting. - It was hurting.

1241
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:48,139
Why didn't you brush your teeth at Grandpa's place?

1242
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,480
I brushed my teeth, but it still hurts.

1243
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,580
Come here.

1244
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,880
Even when I take medicine, it hurts.

1245
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,949
Oh, no. He should get treated right away.

1246
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:58,690
- That's right. - He's in pain.

1247
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,960
Let's see where your cavity is.

1248
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:04,159
Open wide. A bug ate your tooth here.

1249
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,400
(She can only console him.)

1250
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,060
Taking a child to a dental clinic...

1251
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,900
It's so scary. Seriously.

1252
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,869
- It isn't just a regular clinic. - I know how he'll react.

1253
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,739
I've taken children to dental clinics...

1254
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,110
- from the first child to Seung Woo. - You've seen everything.

1255
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,440
Those experiences were traumatic for me too.

1256
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,610
Seriously.

1257
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,110
The decay reached the nerve.

1258
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,920
- That's why it hurts. Oh, no. - It aches and hurts.

1259
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,690
Let's go and catch the germ.

1260
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,759
You have to get a shot to treat the nerve.

1261
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,589
- I remember that from childhood. - It's the biggest emergency.

1262
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:36,529
You promised to do well in the car, right?

1263
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:38,429
- What? - Your teeth.

1264
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,000
You promised to receive the dental treatment well.

1265
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:42,529
You promised to do it courageously.

1266
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,469
That feeling is the worst.

1267
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,000
It's better to get the treatment right away.

1268
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,739
(She gets nervous as well.)

1269
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,980
It must hurt a lot.

1270
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,040
Let's go and put the germ to sleep.

1271
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,409
It'll hurt a bit.

1272
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,219
- Seung Woo, she got it. - It hurts for adults too.

1273

It's done.

1274
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,389
Seung Woo, you did well.

1275
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,889
- Of course, it hurts. - The area will feel numb.

1276
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:06,060
- Every time I do that... - No.

1277
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,319
- You don't like this either. - No.

1278
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,759
It's hard to comfort them.

1279
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,469
Seung Woo, it's almost done.

1280
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,369
The treatment is done. Let's wait for the glue to harden.

1281
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,739
Thank you.

1282
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,139
- He said, "Thank you." - He did well.

1283
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:27,139
- Seung Woo, don't eat chocolate. - "Thank you."

1284
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,179
He thanked her.

1285
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,480
Seung Woo, you're done.

1286
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,179
You're done.

1287
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,020
He did so well.

1288
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,290
Seung Woo, it won't hurt when you eat from now on.

1289
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:38,989
Good for you.

1290
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,920
Aren't you happy that we caught the tooth bug?

1291
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,360
- He won't eat chocolate again. - You're supposed to feel numb.

1292
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,330
- He received local anesthesia, - You'll feel your mouth soon.

1293
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:46,960
so he felt very strange.

1294
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:50,230
- Let's go. - He did well.

1295
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,900
- He did so well. - Mom.

1296
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:56,540
It's okay. You did well. Seung Woo, you did well.

1297
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,339
It was my day off,

1298
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:00,980
so I looked after the children all day long.

1299
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:03,009
She doesn't get to rest on her day off.

1300
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:04,210
She doesn't get to rest.

1301
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,989
(Jung Mi Ae's schedule: Fourth child's dental appointment)

1302
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:12,159
- Was it that day? - It snowed so much that day.

1303
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,860
- The day it snowed heavily? - Yes.

1304
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,429
(- My hands are cold - Freezing!)

1305
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:19,600
(- My feet are cold - Freezing!)

1306
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,360
It's because of the winter wind

1307
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,969
(In Sung and Mi Ae sing a duet.)

1308
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:29,409
(He finds peace once more.)

1309
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,369
Gosh, it's snowing so much.

1310
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:33,179
- It's the 1st snow, right? - It's the 1st snow.

1311
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,549
It was pretty.

1312
00:48:37,009 --> 00:48:38,310
- Jae Woon? - Yes.

1313
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:39,920
We're here.

1314
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,989
- Okay. - You're meeting your friend.

1315
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,150
- Yes. - All right.

1316
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,690
- Be careful. It's snowing a lot. - Okay.

1317
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,360
Have fun, Jae Woon.

1318
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,759
- Bye. See you tomorrow. - Bye.

1319
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,759
- He was meeting his friend. - You dropped him off...

1320
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,029
- at the place. - You gave him a ride.

1321
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,170
(Where's the next destination she's quickly driving to?)

1322
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,069
- In Sung. It's A Young's... - Yes?

1323
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,339
- first day of taekwondo. - Yes.

1324
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:03,810
- I'll teach her. - You have to help her a lot.

1325
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,409
I taught her some techniques when you weren't around.

1326
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,250
I taught her these things.

1327
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,480
Did you teach her some techniques? Did A Young copy them?

1328
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,549
- Yes, she did. - How cute.

1329
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,020
- Don't make it scary. - Okay.

1330
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,690
We arrived at the place where A Young will taekwondo!

1331
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,989
(They arrive at the taekwondo gym!)

1332
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,460
(Forget about the cute In Sung!)

1333
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:26,259
Gosh, look at In Sung.

1334
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:29,400
- He isn't the boy who cried. - No.

1335
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:31,730
A Young looks so cute.

1336
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,100
Was it A Young's first day?

1337
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,040
Yes, it was A Young's first day.

1338
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,110
(The visiting class begins.)

1339
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,210
Raise the back foot.

1340
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,710
In that position, use the elbow.

1341
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,319
- The elbow. Here. - Lower it.

1342
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,420
There you go.

1343
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,520
- Open your hand. - There you go.

1344
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,750
There you go. That's so nice.

1345
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,920
- Her brother is teaching her. - The back foot.

1346
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,819
- A Young, it's the other hand. - In that position...

1347
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,960
- He's teaching her everything. - Yes.

1348
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,500
(When he's done, he checks his sister's form.)

1349
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,440
(She adjusts to the taekwondo class thanks to her brother.)

1350
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,270
A Young is absorbing the techniques.

1351
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,739
(In Sung's mom and younger siblings are here.)

1352
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,040
- While In Sung has... - He's nervous.

1353
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,880
a comical image,

1354
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,839
- That's right. - he's serious about taekwondo.

1355
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,250
- That's right. - Look at his eyes.

1356
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,350
- In Sung! - Let's go!

1357
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,619
Break the board.

1358
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,020
One, two. Shout.

1359
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,159
(He breaks the board!)

1360
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,489
(He breaks it in one go!)

1361
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,159
He became surprised after breaking it.

1362
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,389
My goodness.

1363
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,900
- He broke the board. - How cool.

1364
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:36,900
(In Sung is the best.)

1365
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,199
- In Sung, get ready! - Now, there are two boards.

1366
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,600
Break the boards!

1367
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,770
One, two, three.

1368
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,580
(He does it easily!)

1369
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,810
(It was a piece of cake.)

1370
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,139
A Young, clap.

1371
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:49,250
(He shows his cool side before his younger siblings.)

1372
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,409
That was incredible.

1373
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,779
When there's an audience, you can end up becoming...

1374
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:56,250
- overly ambitious. - That's right.

1375
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,089
He should stop there.

1376
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,659
In Sung, get ready!

1377
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:02,130
(He'll attempt to break 3 wooden boards!)

1378
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,230
- Three? Oh, no. - Three.

1379
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,529
I heard that it was very hard.

1380
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,330
Break the boards!

1381
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,040
(Good luck, In Sung!)

1382
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,600
- Break the boards! - One,

1383
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,469
two, three.

1384
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,080
Two, three.

1385
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:26,020
(Her eyes go wide.)

1386
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020
He's good.

1387
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,020
That's incredible. It's hard to break three boards.

1388
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,650
(Respect)

1389
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,889
He saved his face before his younger siblings.

1390
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:37,560
- You're incredible. - In Sung.

1391
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:40,159
- You're so cool. - Do his hands hurt?

1392
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,670
- Wait. - Do his hands hurt?

1393
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,900
- That can't be it. - I think...

1394
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,639
I heard his bone break.

1395
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,239
You shouldn't step forward when there are a lot of people.

1396
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,810
That's right. You shouldn't do that.

1397
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,480
(The Taekwon Boy, Cho In Sung...)

1398
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,179
(showed off successfully.)

1399
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,179
He's good at taekwondo.

1400
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,080
- Taekwon! - Taekwon!

1401
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,119
With the taekwondo class, Mi Ae cleared...

1402
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,350
the third mission.

1403
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,889
- It snowed so much that day. - Seriously.

1404
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,690
(The 4 siblings are in the living room.)

1405
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,659
(Teary-eyed)

1406
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:16,170
(The second child begins to cry.)

1407
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,969
(The third child, A Young cries as well.)

1408
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:22,869
(Why are you crying?)

1409
00:52:22,969 --> 00:52:25,679
(Just what happened?)

1410
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,279
Let's go.

1411
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:29,480
- Let's go inside. - Let's go inside.

1412
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,219
- Let's go inside. - I'm exhausted.

1413
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,949
- I'm exhausted. - Due to the pipe construction,

1414
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,989
we can't enter our house. We're staying...

1415
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:39,719
- at my in-laws' place. - All right.

1416
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,819
(She unpacks as soon as she comes home.)

1417
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,889
I thought that her work would be concluded at home.

1418
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,429
- It's the beginning. - She has a lot of work.

1419
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:47,100
- That's right. - It's the beginning.

1420
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,600
- I have dark circles. - What?

1421
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,100
I have dark circles.

1422
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Did you know about your dark circles?

1423
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,239
- No, I didn't. - That wasn't makeup, was it?

1424
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,339
No.

1425
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,239
Don't look at me. Look at this for a second.

1426
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,210
Stand here.

1427
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,679
Let's try it. What's this?

1428
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,210
- Ga. - That's right. How about this?

1429
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,279
(That's right.)

1430
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,250
It's a difficult one. What is it?

1431
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,650
- Look at the shape of my mouth. - Ya.

1432
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,119
(Ya)

1433
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,420
- Ya? - Ya.

1434
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,790
She added a question mark since she was uncertain.

1435
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,529
- She's so cute. - Eo?

1436
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:18,529
"Eo?"

1437
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,100
- Mom. - Yi. Good job. How about this?

1438
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:23,699
- Ah. Ya. - Teaching takes energy.

1439
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,000
- Yes. - That's right.

1440
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:26,969
Make sure you remember the alphabet, okay?

1441
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,699
- We'll practice again. - Okay.

1442
00:53:28,699 --> 00:53:29,710
(Does the third child still not know the Korean alphabet?)

1443
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,940
She hasn't finished learning the Korean alphabet.

1444
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,049
But that's my stance on education.

1445
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,380
- They'll get to it eventually. - That's right.

1446
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:40,819
Did you finish learning the Korean alphabet...

1447
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:41,949
before entering elementary school?

1448
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,089
- No. - We learned it in school.

1449
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:45,089
- That's right. - Yes.

1450
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:46,719
I really don't remember.

1451
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:48,020
(Was it the late period of Joseon? It was so many years ago.)

1452
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,830
I bet it was called "Sohakgyo" back then.

1453
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,929
It wasn't called "Sohakgyo."

1454
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,330
- Sohakgyo. So funny. - Don't make me sound...

1455
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,569
- so old. - Sohakgyo.

1456
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,029
Write down...

1457
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,670
the names of your parents and siblings.

1458
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,040
A Young, can you write down...

1459
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:05,210
the names of your parents and siblings?

1460
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,810
Can you do that?

1461
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,009
A Young, tell me when you're done.

1462
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:12,110
(She studies with her big brother, not dad.)

1463
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,150
Where's her dad? Why is Jae Woon doing his dad's work?

1464
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:15,989
- You know, - Her dad is missing.

1465
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:17,119
her dad went to a meeting.

1466
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,190
She didn't even look for him.

1467
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,360
- It didn't seem out of place. - I know.

1468
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,429
(She fills the notebook with the family members' names.)

1469
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:23,560
My goodness.

1470
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,429
(She fills the notebook with the family members' names.)

1471
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,029
Cho Seung Woo.

1472
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,560
(How will she do this time?)

1473
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,369
Cho Seung Woo.

1474
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,469
- Jieut. - Jieut?

1475
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,770
- Jieut. - At that age, it isn't writing.

1476
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,839
- It's drawing. - It's drawing.

1477
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:40,139
- It's drawing. - Yes.

1478
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:42,110
How do I write it?

1479
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:45,880
Woo is here somewhere. Find Woo.

1480
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,350
Yes. Cho Seung Woo.

1481
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,920
(Glancing over)

1482
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,119
She's cute.

1483
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,460
- That's right. - She writes well.

1484
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,630
- Remember them. - Okay.

1485
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,290
Cho Seung Woo, Cho Jae Woon, Cho In Sung,

1486
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,659
Cho Sung Hwan, and Jung Mi Ae.

1487
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,469
I taught Jae Woon for a month at the age of seven...

1488
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,630
before he entered elementary school.

1489
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,330
- He learned it right away. - That's right.

1490
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,940
I taught Jae Woon that way.

1491
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,540
As for In Sung, I didn't teach him.

1492
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,210
- Did he still do well? - He taught himself.

1493
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,110
- In Sung did that. - If a child has many interests,

1494
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,409
he or she can learn from books.

1495
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:14,880
No. He learned from YouTube.

1496
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,250
(Laughing)

1497
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,480
- Many children learn through it. - That's right.

1498
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,880
All right. Here comes the first one.

1499
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,619
"I taught him..."

1500
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,150
(Writing carefully)

1501
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:26,819
"soccer."

1502
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:29,060
It's okay to mess up the spelling.

1503
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,759
I put a lot of emphasis on having pretty handwriting.

1504
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:33,429
I don't care if the score is ten points.

1505
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,130
I praise them of their handwriting is pretty.

1506
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,469
"In Sung, what did you get on your dictation test?"

1507
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,100
"Twenty points."

1508
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,299
- "Is that so?" - My goodness.

1509
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:42,770
- "Really?" - When you said, "Is that so?"

1510
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,839
- you seemed a bit angry. - Your face was blank.

1511
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:45,909
I felt her anger.

1512
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,040
Hold on. Just now...

1513
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,110
"Is that so?"

1514
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,110
She hit her child with her glare.

1515
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,880
- "Is that so?" - "Is that so?"

1516
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,949
"Let's look forward to the future days."

1517
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:56,150
(How did he do on the dictation test?)

1518
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,989
He received a bit of help from his mom.

1519
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:00,089
- You got 90 points. - He got 90 points.

1520
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,960
He did well.

1521
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,130
- There you go. - He did well.

1522
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,560
- How cute. - I was close to 100 points.

1523
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,589
I know.

1524
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,429
One wrong question makes him human.

1525
00:56:07,429 --> 00:56:08,529
- It's very nice. - You did well.

1526
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,699
What's this?

1527
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,130
(The youngest one who's five years old, Seung Woo)

1528
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,699
- Jae Woon, hold on. - What is it?

1529
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:14,500
This is... Bear.

1530
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:17,610
- Incorrect. - Again.

1531
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,710
- Again. - What's this?

1532
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:21,779
- Seung Woo is too young. - Duck.

1533
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:23,080
- He doesn't know anything. - Giraffe.

1534
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,750
- Again. - He works hard.

1535
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,319
- Yes. - I want to ask something.

1536
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,250
When Jae Yi looks at Chinese characters,

1537
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:33,360
she smiles continuously.

1538
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,730
She keeps staring at them. Why is that?

1539
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,029
She finds Chinese characters funny.

1540
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:39,799
She thinks they look funny.

1541
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:41,460
Perhaps she should study abroad in China.

1542
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,270
- I wondered why... - No.

1543
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,029
- she was smiling at them. - No.

1544
00:56:45,029 --> 00:56:46,940
- Seriously. - I think you're getting worse.

1545
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,710
(She feels so refreshed.)

1546
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,210
You'll see when she says "Big brother" in Chinese.

1547
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:53,239
- I'll teach her. - Let's get back to this topic...

1548
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,639
when she's six.

1549
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:55,949
Yes. Let's get back to this topic.

1550
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:57,250
It's In Sung's.

1551
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,279
Okay.

1552
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,319
Put Seung Woo's first.

1553
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,580
Okay.

1554
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,750
(It's time to show the grape points.)

1555
00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:05,449
- Did you do that well? - Five. The end.

1556
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,790
- A Young. - You did well.

1557
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,360
- How about A Young? - I want more.

1558
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,690
- One. - I think A Young will beat In Sung.

1559
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:11,730
Two.

1560
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,759
- Five. - All right.

1561
00:57:12,759 --> 00:57:14,659
- I lost. - Six.

1562
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:15,799
She has 13.

1563
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,569
- Seven. - Please.

1564
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:18,799
You never know.

1565
00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:20,400
First place.

1566
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,139
- Turn around. - A Young won.

1567
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:25,779
A Young has 13 points.

1568
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:26,940
(A Young takes 1st place with a difference of 1 point.)

1569
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,710
- A Young takes 1st place. - They're 1 point apart.

1570
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,179
In Sung.

1571
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:31,250
(I did well on the dictation test.)

1572
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,920
In Sung has 12 points.

1573
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,980
He's crying.

1574
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,520
At the taekwondo class, he broke the boards in a manly way.

1575
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,949
- Why is he crying? - Seriously.

1576
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:39,290
- He's so... - In Sung,

1577
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,819
where's your manliness?

1578
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:42,290
He's so cute.

1579
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,429
I'll give you more stickers.

1580
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:45,960
Hold on.

1581
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,230
- In my opinion... - One child shouldn't lead.

1582
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,929
- That's right. - Yes.

1583
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:51,670
- A tie? - Yes.

1584
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,540
(Staring)

1585
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,139
(What will the veteran mom with many kids do?)

1586
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:59,110
(For 30 minutes, she sat in a single spot.)

1587
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,279
(A Young studied Korean diligently.)

1588
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:01,710
That's right. A Young studied diligently.

1589
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,549
But In Sung did well too.

1590
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:05,449
(In Sung spoke with a good result.)

1591
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,650
Ta-da.

1592
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,619
Here's what I think. Who won?

1593
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,020
Me.

1594
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,989
This is In Sung's board with 18 stickers.

1595
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,130
This is Seung Woo's board with nine stickers.

1596
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,529
This is A Young's board with 16 stickers.

1597
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:19,659
Who won?

1598
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:21,529
- It's In Sung. - In Sung won.

1599
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:23,600
He's happy.

1600
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:26,170
(Glancing over)

1601
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,400
A Young.

1602
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,409
She's crying.

1603
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:31,909
(Her sadness explodes.)

1604
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,110
She trusted her mom.

1605
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,009
- A Young is crying. - That was just wrong.

1606
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:37,210
- It was Mi Ae's fault. - Seriously.

1607
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:40,380
Seung Woo is crying too.

1608
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,279
I'm sorry.

1609
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,150
I was in the wrong.

1610
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:45,920
Yes. I was in the wrong.

1611
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,290
(That's right. Mom was in the wrong.)

1612
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,389
Seung Woo.

1613
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:51,130
- He's watching the result. - The number is just right.

1614
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,759
- The scores are the same. - Seung Woo, you won.

1615
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:54,900
- It's the highest score. - Everyone worked hard today.

1616
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,199
- They look unsure. - A round of applause.

1617
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:58,869
- Right now, - They're angry.

1618
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,270
they don't feel refreshed.

1619
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,540
- They feel bad despite winning. - Gosh.

1620
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,810
- For goodness' sake. - Seriously.

1621
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,509
- I sorted things out. - Really?

1622
00:59:07,279 --> 00:59:09,909
(Will she comfort them with food?)

1623
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:12,250
- Their mom... - I thought Mi Ae would rest.

1624
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,520
- But she's cooking. - It looks delicious.

1625
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,619
(It's hairtail, children's favorite food item.)

1626
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:16,250
- Is that hairtail? - That's hairtail.

1627
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,089
There's a big pile of hairtail.

1628
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:19,719
(It's hairtail, children's favorite food item.)

1629
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:22,290
- She's frying so many hairtails. - What?

1630
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,690
Why is she frying so many hairtails?

1631
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,790
(The meal of the day is extraordinary!)

1632
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,830
- Is there a party? - There will be a party.

1633
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:32,739
The family members' birthdays are close together.

1634
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,170
November 14 is A Young's birthday.

1635
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,009
November 21 is my husband's birthday.

1636
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:39,110
November 28 is...

1637
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,139
- Jae Woon's birthday. - Jae Woon.

1638
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:41,580
December four is Seung Woo's birthday.

1639
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,210
- My goodness. - They're close together...

1640
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,210
and only apart by 7, 7, 7, and 6 days.

1641
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,920
- They can have a joint party. - Yes.

1642
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,949
That's why I'm preparing for a party.

1643
00:59:48,949 --> 00:59:50,619
- You celebrate it in one day. - It's better.

1644
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:51,790
Yes, it's a joint party.

1645
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,089
(It's a method you can see in a family with many children.)

1646
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,020
- It's better to do it that way. - That's right.

1647
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:58,889
I cook bulk food quickly.

1648
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,360
Those are the dishes that take a long time to make.

1649
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,670
- Japchae. - You're right.

1650
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,400
Are there ten kimchi jeons?

1651
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,199
I saw that in "Reply 1988."

1652
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,299
That's right.

1653
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,770
- That's right. - She's like Deok Sun's mom.

1654
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,409
- Deok Sun's mom. - Deok Sun's mom.

1655
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,009
(There's enough food for a village feast.)

1656
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:16,210
(There's sorghum and red bean rice cake as well.)

1657
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:18,679
- Rice cake. - Sorghum and red bean rice cake.

1658
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:22,989
Ever since my children were born, I didn't miss it a single time.

1659
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,819
They say that if you make sorghum and red bean rice cake...

1660
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:26,860
- for children until the age of ten, - Yes.

1661
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,960
they'll grow up healthy.

1662
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,020
- Really? - It's for birthdays.

1663
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,389
- I see. - It's for birthdays.

1664
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:33,960
(Children decorated the balloons themselves.)

1665
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,170
That's... My goodness.

1666
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,529
Seung Woo is wearing a dress.

1667
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:39,699
(Is the youngest child in a dress?)

1668
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:41,270
- Is that A Young's dress? - That's right.

1669
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,339
He copies everything his sister does.

1670
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:44,469
(He copies his sister and wears a white dress on his birthday.)

1671
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:46,279
Why isn't Dad coming?

1672
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:47,940
- Your dad? He'll come. - Yes.

1673
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,409
Call him and find out where he's at.

1674
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,110
- He said he was almost home. - I mean...

1675
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,549
Dad is a liar.

1676
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:55,580
Dad, you said that you'd come soon.

1677
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,920
I'm near the house.

1678
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,989
(Angry)

1679
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,489
- "I'm near the house." - Didn't he say that earlier?

1680
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,560
- He has the best timing. - The meal is ready.

1681
01:01:02,089 --> 01:01:04,159
You should've left some tasks for me.

1682
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,389
(Excuse me?)

1683
01:01:05,389 --> 01:01:06,560
(For goodness' sake!)

1684
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,699
He always has excuses.

1685
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:09,259
(When will Dad come?)

1686
01:01:09,259 --> 01:01:10,429
Dad is here.

1687
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,839
- It's a cake. - A cake.

1688
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:14,369
There should be a cake.

1689
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:16,040
- Dad. - Dad.

1690
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,940
Why did you come so late?

1691
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:19,679
It's a cake.

1692
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,310
- What's all this? - Take out the cake quickly.

1693
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,980
(He sits down very naturally.)

1694
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,119
After handing over the cake,

1695
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:28,219
he sat at the table right away.

1696
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:29,520
- He didn't do anything. - People will think...

1697
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,219
- that he's a guest. - The children...

1698
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:32,520
I prepared the balloons.

1699
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:33,989
- Did you prepare the balloons? - Yes.

1700
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,360
You made them so prettily.

1701
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,630
(Happy)

1702
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:37,730
Happy birthday.

1703
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,500
Let's begin the birthday party.

1704
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,529
(The cake is full of candles.)

1705
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:43,869
Look at the numbers.

1706
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,299
This is five. This is Seung Woo's.

1707
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:49,000
- Five. - Seven is for A Young.

1708
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,310
Seventeen is for Jae Woon.

1709
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,670
Forty-three is for Dad.

1710
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,839
There's no space in the cake.

1711
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:54,610
That's right. All the candles had to be there.

1712
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,679
- There's no space. - All the candles had to be there.

1713
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,779
- I see more candles than the cake. - Seriously.

1714
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:00,020
(Laughing)

1715
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,650
Blow out your candles.

1716
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:02,949
Do it well.

1717
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,150
- Let's sing. - Okay.

1718
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,719
- Set, go. - How will they sing?

1719
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:09,489
(Happy birthday to you)

1720
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:12,659
(Happy)

1721
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:15,500
(Happy birthday, dear family)

1722
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,869
"Dear family."

1723
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:19,199
(All 4 members, happy birthday.)

1724
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:20,469
- That's right. You can't call... - Together.

1725
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:21,540
one person's name.

1726
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,969
Then they'll cry again.

1727
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:25,069
(Happy birthday!)

1728
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:26,110
Let's eat.

1729
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,509
A Young, did you make a wish?

1730
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:29,080
What was it?

1731
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,949
I said that I liked you.

1732
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:33,580
Was your wish that you liked me?

1733
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,520
- My goodness. - What?

1734
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:37,589
Seung Woo, what was your wish?

1735
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:39,860
I said that I loved you.

1736
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,290
Was your wish that you loved me?

1737
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,460
- Mi Ae did all the work. - Seriously.

1738
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,529
- Seriously. - What happened?

1739
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,100
He's Superman who has it easy.

1740
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,429
- Seriously. - That always happens.

1741
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:50,929
Mom does all the work.

1742
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:52,969
- But children love Dad more... - That's right.

1743
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,400
- since he brings fried chicken. - Yes.

1744
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,369
- He brought a cake. - That's right.

1745
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:01,139
(One person's hands move busily.)

1746
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:03,650
Isn't it like a weekend drama?

1747
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,310
For me?

1748
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,049
Mi Ae isn't eating.

1749
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,850
- A Young, do you want hairtail? - Mom.

1750
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,190
Go ahead and eat.

1751
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,589
(Meanwhile)

1752
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,589
Here.

1753
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:16,060
(He eats the deboned hairtail...)

1754
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,330
(faster than anyone.)

1755
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:19,330
- A Young, do you want hairtail? - Mom.

1756
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,060
- He's enjoying the meal so much. - Seriously.

1757
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:25,100
I can't say anything about him.

1758
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:27,400
- Dad eats... - He's at a popular restaurant.
