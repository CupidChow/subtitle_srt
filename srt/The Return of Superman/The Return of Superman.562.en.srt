1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,260
(A winter day with dried radish leaf)

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,460
They hung dried radish leaf like that.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,229
The scenery looks affectionate.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,899
This song is a perfect match for the view.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,329
Look at this. Look at Eun Woo.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,499
(The Woo Brothers are playing as if they own this house.)

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:21,769
Eun Woo, Jung Woo.

8
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,210
- What are they doing? - Ji Woo is taking a nap.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,679
What is that? I'm going to play with it a bit.

10
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,479
Give me that.

11
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,379
They're playing together like good brothers.

12
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,749
- What's this? - What's the name of this doll?

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,190
- What's the name of this doll? - Boy.

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,250
(Jun Ho shows up with a doll.)

15
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,720
Which character is your favorite?

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,190
- I like Boy. - How cute.

17
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:43,290
- What about this one? - Kendel.

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,729
- Yes. What about this one? - Jambo.

19
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,229
That's it.

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,699
Eun Woo is into those characters from the animation these days.

21
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:51,769
- I see. - He is.

22
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:55,739
The cartoon gives good moral lessons to kids.

23
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:56,739
So it's a nice cartoon.

24
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,040
(The characters were created for socially isolated people.)

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,739
- Look at them. - Look at them.

26
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,379
They all fell.

27
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,680
Jambo fell down.

28
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:05,820
They all fell down. What should we do then?

29
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,750
I'll hold their hands tightly, so they don't fall down.

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,220
- That's right. Hold their hands... - Are you all right?

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,789
to make sure they don't fall down.

32
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:16,860
Eun Woo. The cartoon was heartwarming.

33
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:17,929
Look at this.

34
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:22,170
You will meet many friends in your lifetime.

35
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,340
Like Jambo, there will be people who fall down.

36
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,470
- There will be people like Kenzi... - I see.

37
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,869
- who will help people like Jambo. - Jambo fell.

38
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,340
Will there be people who won't fall down?

39
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,739
Yes, there will be.

40
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,849
You don't fall easily, Eun Woo. But Jung Woo does.

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,780
Everyone is different.

42
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,580
But when you accept others and are considerate of them,

43
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,519
our world will be more beautiful.

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,489
When you see friends who are in need of help,

45
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,920
- you'll help them. Right? - Yes.

46
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,560
Then how will our world become?

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,030
- A beautiful place. - That's it.

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
- My goodness. - Don't you want to live...

49
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,599
- in a beautiful place, Eun Woo? - Yes.

50
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,560
Jun Ho explained it so well.

51
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,970
(The Woo Siblings all fell asleep.)

52
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,039
(Amazed)

53
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,670
This is nice.

54
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,239
(What's this sound?)

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,660
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

56
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,789
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

57
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,100
Merry, Happy Christmas for Jae Yi.

58
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,130
(Merry, Happy Christmas for Jae Yi.)

59
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,270
Look at her.

60
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,430
She opened her eyes the most widely in front of the Christmas tree.

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,569
How beautiful.

62
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,199
- Seriously. Her eyes opened wide. - It's like she was Photoshopped.

63
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,370
She has big eyes, doesn't she?

64
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,579
- Yes. My goodness. - I took one in front of the tree.

65
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,440
Imagine me dressing up as Santa...

66
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,750
- and showing up in front of Jae Yi. - Yes.

67
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:29,650
- Just the thought of that... - But...

68
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,280
All right. Since this is her first Christmas,

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,819
- Yes. - leave a video message...

70
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,150
- for her. - For Jae Yi?

71
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,090
- She'll watch it when she grows up. - Yes.

72
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,690
- I've never done this before. - It will be so meaningful.

73
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,930
- Gosh, I've never done this... - Don't cry.

74
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,530
- in my life before. - Yes.

75
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:43,859
(Choking up)

76
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,229
- Don't cry. - Jae Yi. It's Daddy.

77
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,699
The best thing I ever did in my life...

78
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:51,799
was meeting you.

79
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,139
Your mother and I talked about it just two days ago.

80
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,579
I will never forget how you came into my life.

81
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,049
I started working so diligently. I'm like a madman.

82
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,750
- It's all for you. - That's so emotional.

83
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,220
- My goodness. - Don't worry about a thing.

84
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,280
Live your life doing everything you want, Jae Yi.

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,850
I love you so much, Jae Yi.

86
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,289
Thank you for coming to me.

87
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:12,729
You are my Christmas present.

88
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,590
The Return of Superman, Episode 554.

89
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,829
Merry Christmas.

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,530
(While the Woo Siblings are asleep...)

91
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,739
(Amazed)

92
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,199
This is nice.

93
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,600
(What's this sound?)

94
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,410
(Are they having a golf date?)

95
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,380
- Good shot. - Good shot.

96
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,910
- You have time to do that? - That's nice.

97
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,079
- Good shot? - Yes.

98
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,650
Good shot.

99
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,419
(In the basement of Dong Min's house in Wonju,)

100
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,919
(there's a unique space.)

101
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,489
(There's an Internet cafe in his house?)

102
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,489
(What else do you have other than the Internet cafe?)

103
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,729
(A karaoke room and an indoor golf simulator)

104
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,630
(An indoor golf simulator?)

105
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,359
(I'd love to check it out.)

106
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,299
(I want to visit his house to play golf.)

107
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,940
(Could you invite me to Wonju?)

108
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,840
- I actually want there for that. - I see.

109
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,840
- In the basement. - It's like having a bunker.

110
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,109
- Given how good you are, - Gosh.

111
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,780
- you could model for a golf brand. - There's a dry sauna room too.

112
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,750
- A dry sauna room too? - We were so impressed.

113
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,620
My gosh. Eyes on the ball.

114
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,650
Yes.

115
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,650
(I came to Wonju...)

116
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,220
(to play golf.)

117
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,019
(Everyone is quiet.)

118
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,829
- Good shot. - They look like golf clothes.

119
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,960
(Get rid of the stress!)

120
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:25,530
That's nice.

121
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,100
Was it good? Then I do this pose.

122
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,470
(Striking up a pose like a model)

123
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,939
- He looks cool. - Like this.

124
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,939
(But in reality, he's golfing in floral pants.)

125
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,970
Like this.

126
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,280
(A sense of true joy is evident in his facial expression.)

127
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,539
- He looks the happiest right now. - Gosh.

128
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,609
It's amazing that you have this in your house.

129
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,080
People could have an orientation trip in your house.

130
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:47,119
The golfer, Park In Bee, is on our show too.

131
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,119
- You're right. - Yes.

132
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:53,530
(The queen of golf, Park In Bee)

133
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:56,400
(Coach Nam Gi Hyeob, the 23.7 million dollars' kingmaker)

134
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,700
(In Seo got a private lesson from 2 legendary players.)

135
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,470
(The miraculous coaching turned her into a swing genius.)

136
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,309
You're right.

137
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,140
- My gosh. You know what? - Yes.

138
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,239
We can use our show as an excuse and get a lesson from her.

139
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,879
- Yes. I love it. Let's do it here. - Yes.

140
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,650
- Let's set a date. - Yes.

141
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,119
- You'll invite her? - We should.

142
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,179
- My gosh. - We could plan an orientation trip.

143
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,249
We should do it when she has some time.

144
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:22,789
- Gosh, that's nice. - All of us can go.

145
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,260
- That sounds amazing. - Yes.

146
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,359
- A private lesson? - When will we get this chance?

147
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,789
Are we really going to have an orientation trip?

148
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,160
I would love to join.

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
- I mean it. - We can be there for three days.

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,830
- Really? - His house is amazing.

151
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,229
My goodness. You have a bunker in your house.

152
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,970
- This place is just amazing. - Where are you going next?

153
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,499
There are beds too.

154
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,369
Why are beds in the room?

155
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,939
When you're tired, you can take a nap.

156
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,070
I see. After playing computer games?

157
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,379
- But his house is upstairs. - There's a dry sauna room too.

158
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:47,710
(The Internet cafe)

159
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,109
That's the dry sauna.

160
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:51,119
- I see. It's in there. - That's a dry sauna booth?

161
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,020
Gosh, let's play a game together.

162
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,689
That sounds good.

163
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,559
This is what I'm talking about.

164
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,119
Dong Min, this is like going on a vacation.

165
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,260
I want to spend my vacation here.

166
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,330
Sure.

167
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,129
- Gosh, you got everything here. - You seem way too happy.

168
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
(My house is the best, isn't it?)

169
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,369
The highlight of going to the Internet cafe is the food.

170
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,739
- You also have food? - No way. That can't be possible.

171
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,539
- This is your house. - Everything is ready.

172
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,309
I can order food here like in the Internet cafe?

173
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,109
Of course. But you don't order food on your computer.

174
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,309
It will be hard to get food delivered to his house.

175
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,410
(Our country is famous for food delivery services.)

176
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,220
Wait, I can really order food like in the Internet cafe?

177
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,450
(I can get food delivered in the countryside?)

178
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,189
Of course. But you don't order food on your computer.

179
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,619
Mom!

180
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,020
(Laughing)

181
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,359
Mom!

182
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,989
(Calling his mom loudly)

183
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,559
- Seriously? - Mom!

184
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,460
- He's like a little kid. - For real?

185
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
- Mom! - Come on.

186
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,299
He will soon turn 50.

187
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,840
He's reaching 50. Why is he calling his mom there?

188
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,900
What did his mom do to deserve this?

189
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,840
- Mom! - Seriously?

190
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,809
- Really? - Mom!

191
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,910
(Jun Ho, the 31-year-old guy, is getting a culture shock.)

192
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,809
- Mom. - I wasn't sure if it'd be possible.

193
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:53,850
(His mother shows up.)

194
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,150
- Ma'am. - She really came with food.

195
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,479
- So we did get our food. - Mom.

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,749
(Hurrying)

197
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,650
- I'm here. - Ma'am.

198
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,549
- No way. She really came. - Mom.

199
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:02,960
- My goodness. - What?

200
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,359
- My gosh. - His mother...

201
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,760
Seriously? Come on.

202
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
- My gosh. - Okay.

203
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,229
I thought my son was the only guy who liked computer games.

204
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,030
- Right. - You must like computer games too.

205
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,100
Yes. I like computer games.

206
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
(Computer games are always fun to play.)

207
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,669
- Enjoy the food and have fun. - Nice.

208
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,869
- Thank you. - Thank you.

209
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:21,039
His mother said, "Enjoy your food and have fun."

210
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,879
Even his mother is doing a skit.

211
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,950
(Enjoy the food and have fun.)

212
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:29,919
- My gosh. - While playing games...

213
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,419
- What's that? - She gave us ramyeon and kimchi.

214
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,189
- That looks so good. - That does look tasty.

215
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,330
(Slurping)

216
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,229
(Hitting the spot)

217
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,999
I'm on vacation for real.

218
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,869
While the kids were taking a nap...

219
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:51,340
(I hope the Woo Brothers' nap lasts a long time.)

220
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,070
(They begin playing a game while having ramyeon.)

221
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,369
I played this a lot when I was in middle and high school.

222
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,369
Pass it.

223
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,109
Dong Min, this is a bet.

224
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,739
- Of course. - It's a bet.

225
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,280
When I win, give me Dong Min Town.

226
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:02,979
We're playing for real.

227
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,320
(They play a game, and Dong Min Town is at stake.)

228
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,419
That's it.

229
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,119
Let's go. Come on. Go.

230
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,320
Not yet. All right.

231
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:10,859
Son Heung Min.

232
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,590
(Screaming)

233
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
They're playing a game.

234
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,100
Let's go, Jun Ho.

235
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,530
- Go. - Where do you think you're going?

236
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,169
He's offside.

237
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,270
- He's offside. - Seriously. I can't believe them.

238
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,739
Let's go.

239
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,700
- What? - Let's go.

240
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,340
- My gosh. - Goodness.

241
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,780
- Let's go. Come on. Yes. Go. - I'm embarrassed for them.

242
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,539
Jung Woo, don't look at them.

243
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,809
Seriously. I had no idea he had come down.

244
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,749
- I'm serious. - Dong Min scolded the kids...

245
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
- as the village teacher. - Right. He did that last week.

246
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,550
(He disciplined the kids as the village teacher.)

247
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,850
Wait. My gosh.

248
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,259
- Gosh. - Come on.

249
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,619
(But look what he's doing in front of them.)

250
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:45,859
Darn it. What if our kids wake up?

251
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,960
My kid came in at a critical moment before.

252
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,629
Oh, no. Jung Woo already knows what's going on here.

253
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,629
That's it. Yes.

254
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,769
(Clueless of Jung Woo's presence, they're engrossed in the game.)

255
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,200
- Come on. No. - Yes!

256
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,999
It went in!

257
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,340
- It went in. - Hold on. Look at him.

258
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,670
You must spot your kid there.

259
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,180
Jung Woo got startled. His eyes got big.

260
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,009
- Come here, Jung Woo. - It's Jung Woo. Hey.

261
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,710
- I won. - My gosh.

262
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,050
He bragged about winning.

263
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,350
He's having so much fun.

264
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,479
Give me a high-five.

265
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,050
(Meowing)

266
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,420
- Do you like that? - "Meow."

267
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,420
- "Meow." - There's a cat.

268
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,659
- A cat. - Jung Woo, make yourself at home.

269
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,759
I own this place now.

270
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,989
- Meow. - Jung Woo. This place...

271
00:09:21,989 --> 00:09:23,229
(This place is nice.)

272
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,859
Let's turn this off and go upstairs.

273
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,670
Let's dress up and have a Christmas party.

274
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,029
- Let's get in the festive mood. - Yes.

275
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,040
- Okay. - Gosh.

276
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,100
- It's Christmas. - A Christmas party?

277
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,310
You don't have to go to Myeong-dong to feel the festive mood.

278
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,279
(You don't have to be in the city to feel the festive mood.)

279
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,609
We can feel the festive mood in the countryside too.

280
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:42,249
I prepared the countryside's version of the Christmas party.

281
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,249
I can't wait to see it.

282
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,820
- What's the countryside's version? - Right.

283
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,749
- I'm curious. - I'm looking forward to it.

284
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,820
(The empty living room is now filled with the Christmas spirit.)

285
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,460
- My gosh. Oh, my. - You decorated it nicely.

286
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,029
Dong Min and I tried our best to decorate the living room.

287
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,430
(Hello!)

288
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,430
How beautiful.

289
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,899
(Full of props for Christmas)

290
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,899
It's beautiful.

291
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,239
- They did a great job... - Right.

292
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,340
decorating the place. It looks cozy and beautiful.

293
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,639
(- We're having visitors. - Who?)

294
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,440
"Hello."

295
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,739
"I am Rudolph."

296
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,009
I like balls.

297
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,979
I'm a snowman.

298
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,249
Is that so?

299
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,350
"Hello. I'm a tree."

300
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:22,220
- Let's do it. - One, two, three.

301
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,019
Bye. I love you.

302
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,790
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

303
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,100
Merry Christmas.

304
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,430
(The 4-times-more-fun Christmas will begin for the 4 Woos.)

305
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,800
The kids look great in their costumes.

306
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,100
- Right. - "Hello."

307
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,440
"I am Rudolph."

308
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,139
- He looks like a brave Rudolph. - He's so cute.

309
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,970
He is indeed Rudolph. His legs are sturdy.

310
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,710
(A sturdy lower body)

311
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,749
- "I'm Rudolph Jung Woo." - He looks so cute.

312
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:48,350
- How strong. - Yes.

313
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,550
Since it's Christmas, I prepared big presents.

314
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,220
(A present?)

315
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
Yes! Let's clap.

316
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,290
- I prepared presents. - Clap.

317
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,690
Let's all clap.

318
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,930
(Screaming)

319
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,700
- Hold on. - Si Woo is happy too.

320
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
(I like presents too!)

321
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,499
- My gosh. - I've never seen him this excited.

322
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,830
(The mention of presents brightens the mood.)

323
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,869
I'll bring the presents.

324
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Everyone, close your eyes.

325
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,840
- He will give them presents. - Yes, close your eyes.

326
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,340
I wonder what kind of present...

327
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,409
- he prepared for the Woo Siblings. - Right.

328
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,810
It seems he prepared a lot for them.

329
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,950
- Close your eyes. - Yes.

330
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,080
There you go.

331
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,879
(What kind of present will it be?)

332
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,649
You can't open your eyes.

333
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
What is it?

334
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,489
(What is the present Dong Min prepared?)

335
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,119
- What? - All right. Open your eyes.

336
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,359
What's that?

337
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,729
- Guess what it is. - A house made of snacks?

338
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,229
- A house made of snacks. - A house made of snacks.

339
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,290
Oh, my.

340
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,600
- Snacks? - Yes.

341
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:41,600
- Snacks? - Yes.

342
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,070
(Snacks?)

343
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,239
- Snacks? - Yes.

344
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,509
Jung Woo loves snacks.

345
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,940
- Look at that. Go, Eun Woo. - But don't touch it.

346
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,479
Just look at it.

347
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,909
(Jung Woo heads for the house.)

348
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,080
Eun Woo. If Jung Woo tries to touch it, tell him not to do it.

349
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,479
It's made of snacks.

350
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,379
- But don't touch it. - Don't touch it.

351
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,790
Jung Woo will do more than just touch it.

352
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,790
You bet.

353
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,690
- Jung Woo... - I was worried about him the most.

354
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,060
- Nothing... - Santa is...

355
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,029
- can stop Jung Woo. - living in the house.

356
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,359
- Jung Woo walked over there. - If you eat it,

357
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,529
the house will collapse. He will lose his house.

358
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,970
- No! - Jung Woo, don't touch it.

359
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,129
- I will scold you. - Right. He will scold you.

360
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:17,340
- A big scolding. - I will scold you.

361
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,170
(Laughing)

362
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,639
You have to see it with your eyes.

363
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,810
- You see it with your eyes. - You have to see it with your eyes.

364
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,840
- My gosh. - Yes.

365
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,550
(But why can't I touch it?)

366
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,149
- This is painful for him. - Yes.

367
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,580
If you touch or eat this house,

368
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,420
- Santa will disappear. - My gosh.

369
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,519
- What? - What?

370
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,859
- Then we won't get presents? - Right.

371
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,320
You won't get presents.

372
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,830
- Then Santa will disappear. - My gosh.

373
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,300
(Then with whom will I travel?)

374
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,560
- What? - Look at his face. Goodness.

375
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,700
The dads will go and cook something tasty.

376
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,139
Guard the house here. Okay?

377
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,369
Yes.

378
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:54,409
(Ji Woo has no problem with that.)

379
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,269
- Don't eat that. - Okay.

380
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,249
Jung Woo might eat it even if he doesn't get to see Santa.

381
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,050
Jung Woo isn't interested in Santa.

382
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,050
- Right. - Exactly.

383
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,820
- He's only interested in snacks. - He doesn't know who Santa is.

384
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,850
- Right. - Yes.

385
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,889
(Ever since Eun Woo was little...)

386
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,290
- Right. Eun Woo was... - Yes.

387
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,389
(when his dad told him to look after his brother,)

388
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,720
(he did look.)

389
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,190
Eun Woo literally looked at Jung Woo.

390
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,200
He didn't do anything else. He only looked at Jung Woo.

391
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:20,100
(Until his dad told him to eat,)

392
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,139
(Obedient Eun Woo could wait.)

393
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,139
Right.

394
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:32,779
(She eats well just like her dad tells her to.)

395
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,550
(When he tells her to stand behind the line...)

396
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,420
Stepping on the line is breaking the rule. Okay?

397
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,519
(Ji Woo did exactly what her dad told her to do.)

398
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,759
(But our Jung Woo is...)

399
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,989
- But Jung Woo... - This became one. Hold on.

400
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,759
- Right. - My gosh.

401
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,229
- He goes for it. - You dropped it.

402
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,830
- You can eat. - He doesn't stop when there's food.

403
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,330
Can they keep the house intact...

404
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,940
without touching it?

405
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,170
(As expected, Jung Woo goes after the snacks.)

406
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,639
That won't be easy.

407
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,909
(Eun Woo stops Jung Woo when he tries to touch it.)

408
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,680
You can't touch it.

409
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,050
You can't touch it. You can only look at it.

410
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,019
(Eun Woo really just looks at it.)

411
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,090
Just look.

412
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,320
We can't touch it.

413
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,129
We can't touch it.

414
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,330
My gosh. Did I hear it crack?

415
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,200
What was that sound?

416
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,670
(Is Jung Woo holding a snack?)

417
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,600
- He's holding it. - What happened?

418
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,970
My gosh, this is shocking.

419
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,800
Goodness. When did he take it apart?

420
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,570
- He's already holding it. - He's holding it.

421
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,109
- You can't eat that. - Oh, my.

422
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,109
- Eun Woo is shocked. - Dad told us...

423
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,979
not to eat it.

424
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,810
- Will he eat it? - But...

425
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,180
(Scoring a fallen piece of the snack)

426
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,450
- Come on. - He didn't even hesitate.

427
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,290
How could he not eat that? He's already holding it.

428
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,389
He doesn't care about anything.

429
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,389
- Right. - He doesn't.

430
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,790
- "What are you talking about?" - He was going to eat that.

431
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,060
(Did you eat that?)

432
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,659
You can't eat that.

433
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,629
- You can't eat that. - My gosh.

434
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,399
- Okay. - He kept eating after saying okay.

435
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,899
Jung Woo, you ate that.

436
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,470
- Gosh. Oh, no. - What?

437
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,540
He's taking the snacks so naturally now.

438
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,609
- He already... - He must have them in both hands.

439
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,109
- Right. He always had two. - I see. That's how he rolls.

440
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,109
Yes.

441
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,350
(What do I do?)

442
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,649
I'll take them.

443
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,879
- Oh, my. - I'll take them.

444
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,019
- He'll cry then. - No.

445
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,320
(He takes away Jung Woo's snacks.)

446
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,590
I'll take them.

447
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,859
(Did you just take my snacks?)

448
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:25,859
(Then I'll take another one.)

449
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,229
Goodness.

450
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,859
(Jung Woo will not lose.)

451
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,999
(Oh, no...)

452
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,930
- What are they going to do? - What will they do?

453
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,999
I can see it in her eyes that Ji Woo is flustered.

454
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,440
(Jung Woo, Santa will disappear.)

455
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,940
This isn't what she had in mind.

456
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,269
My dad said Santa...

457
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,210
would disappear.

458
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,350
Ji Woo must have thought Santa would disappear for real.

459
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,409
- Right. - Yes.

460
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,249
Ji Woo was going to do exactly what her dad told her to do.

461
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:53,489
(Gosh, I can't put it back on.)

462
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,050
Oh, no. He can't put the roof back together. What will they do?

463
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,190
Eun Woo is trying to fix this. But...

464
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,859
My snack.

465
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,159
(It's my snack. Don't take it.)

466
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,200
Mamma mia.

467
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,999
Jung Woo is already in a bad mood.

468
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,570
He's like, "Why do you keep taking it from me?"

469
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,769
(When Eun Woo puts it back, Jung Woo takes it.)

470
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,769
(I'm the unstoppable kid. Here I come.)

471
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,479
(Will there be a good way to resolve this?)

472
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,950
Guys, do not touch the house now.

473
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,350
That's my house.

474
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,950
(Laughing)

475
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,149
She did a skit.

476
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,220
Did she just impersonate Santa?

477
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,519
- Was that Santa's expression? - Yes.

478
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,220
Ji Woo wants Jung Woo to stop by doing a skit.

479
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,830
Okay?

480
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,759
- Gosh. - My goodness.

481
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,200
Her father does skits all the time, so she learned it from him.

482
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
(She grew up watching Dong Min, an expert of skits.)

483
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:46,269
(She does a skit even when she's alone.)

484
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,040
- She's so cute. - Okay?

485
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,810
"Santa. Who's that?"

486
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,850
Jung Woo is eating the snacks.

487
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,019
He ate all of them.

488
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,519
(In the end, a side of the roof is destroyed.)

489
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,619
Jung Woo is eating the snacks.

490
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:04,460
- What? - Eun Woo told them what happened.

491
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,820
- Yes. - He ate them?

492
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,530
- Oh, no. - Who ate the snacks?

493
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:11,929
- Look at that. Who ate them? - What do we do?

494
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:12,929
(Studying his dad's face)

495
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,629
- Who ate them? - He realized he shouldn't have.

496
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:15,800
The house is broken.

497
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,369
Jung Woo.

498
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,439
He's sensing that he's done something wrong.

499
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,909
- What do we do? - So he wasn't clueless.

500
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:23,040
- He knew it was wrong. - Yes.

501
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,439
- Jung Woo can sense the mood. - Will he put it down?

502
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,010
He can sense that something is off with the mood.

503
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,580
(He senses that something has gone wrong.)

504
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,310
Dad, you scold him.

505
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:30,980
You!

506
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,389
I told you not to eat that.

507
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,550
- He ate a lot. - Yes.

508
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,919
- He ate up one side of the roof. - He ate a lot.

509
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,090
- He ate a lot? - He ate a lot?

510
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,790
Santa...

511
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,500
(Because he ate the house...)

512
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,629
He's gone.

513
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:47,730
He will disappear.

514
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,399
(Oh, right. Santa.)

515
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,139
Hold on. Jung Woo...

516
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,369
- What about Si Woo? - He didn't eat it.

517
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,510
(I lost my appetite.)

518
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,340
Jung Woo, did you eat the snacks or not?

519
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,250
- Did you eat them? - Yes.

520
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,010
(He admits his wrongdoing.)

521
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,480
- You ate them? - Yes.

522
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,550
- He's honest. - Yes, he answered me at least.

523
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,590
(Jung Woo answered honestly.)

524
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,020
- You ate them? - Yes.

525
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
He's honest.

526
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,490
- So you can't say anything. - Right.

527
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,530
- Were they tasty? - Yes.

528
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:16,959
(Laughing)

529
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,359
Yes. He said they were tasty.

530
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,300
Are you done eating, Jung Woo?

531
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Yes.

532
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,199
(I did eat enough.)

533
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,969
- It's okay. He was honest. - Yes.

534
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,740
We're in trouble.

535
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:28,939
- They're in trouble. - They're in trouble.

536
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,709
This is bad. What do we do?

537
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,139
Is there a good way to fix this?

538
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,980
(I don't know.)

539
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,149
- Should we try it? - I put it back earlier.

540
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,990
It didn't stick.

541
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
Eun Woo, I'll give you tapes. Use them to put the snacks back.

542
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,689
Let's put them back with tapes.

543
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,129
Fix the house, please.

544
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,699
- Here. You too, Eun Woo. - Fix the house.

545
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,629
Use the tapes to fix the broken part.

546
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,699
(Pressing)

547
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,669
- House, don't get hurt. - Oh, my.

548
00:18:58,669 --> 00:18:59,800
- My goodness. - Gosh.

549
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,969
- She's so sweet when she talks. - It's okay.

550
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,040
- Right. - It's okay.

551
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,179
(Eun Woo is fixing the house too.)

552
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,540
- It's back on. - It's back on.

553
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,850
Santa, don't be sad.

554
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,119
(Thanks to the Woo Siblings, the house is repaired.)

555
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,090
They put back the snack Jung Woo didn't finish.

556
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,919
- Look at that. - That looks like a shoddy job.

557
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,359
All right. We finished fixing the house.

558
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,500
Shall we go and eat a tasty dinner?

559
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,800
- Go. - Go.

560
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Let's go.

561
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,869
- Let's go. - Let's go.

562
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,500
- That's right. - All right.

563
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,939
Food is a must for the Christmas party.

564
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,010
That's right.

565
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,510
- Who knows what this is? - A whole chicken.

566
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,679
- What? - A whole chicken?

567
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,209
Yes. A whole chicken. Eun Woo, do you know?

568
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,719
Gosh, it's a raw chicken.

569
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,619
- It's his first time seeing it. - Do you want to see it?

570
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,250
What's this?

571
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,050
- What's that? - Chicken.

572
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:53,020
I'll make sticky rice-filled chicken with oriental herbs.

573
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:54,790
Sticky rice-filled chicken with oriental herbs.

574
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,290
(Juicy roasted chicken)

575
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,500
You can make it in Wonju.

576
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,500
Will there be chestnut and rice inside?

577
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,869
- Yes. - Sticky rice.

578
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,369
- It'll be delicious. - It'll be delicious.

579
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,669
- It'll be delicious. - Yes.

580
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,570
(Dong Min has seen the way Eun Woo gets easily scared.)

581
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,409
(Dong Min has seen the way Eun Woo gets easily scared.)

582
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:16,649
I want to make him strong.

583
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,379
You need to be strong in order to live in the countryside.

584
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:23,020
It's like "Iron Squad" in Wonju.

585
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,619
Dong Min chose the menu...

586
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,689
- with a motive. - It's refreshing, right?

587
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:28,760
(She can clean trotters!)

588
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,730
She washed her face with the water from rinsing the trotters.

589
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,270
- She washed her face. - Yes.

590
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,369
Nothing is impossible.

591
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,000
(The 29-month-old natural person, Jang Ji Woo)

592
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
She's good with her hands.

593
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,439
Watch Ji Woo's demonstration.

594
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,639
Yes.

595
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,179
Ji Woo will do it.

596
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,179
Ji Woo, it's a demonstration.

597
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,449
- Okay. - Firstly, grab the chicken.

598
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,550
- Go. - Go.

599
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,590
- Gosh, Ji Woo. - My goodness.

600
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,619
Look at her.

601
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,189
Make it clean. Yes.

602
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:01,490
(How will I touch that?)

603
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,459
With her bare hands...

604
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,459
(It's nothing!)

605
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,429
(She's good with her hands.)

606
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,899
Eun Woo, it'll be good if you marry Ji Woo in the future.

607
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,939
Ji Woo will cook courageously.

608
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,169
Seriously.

609
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,340
Among the 29-month-old girls I've seen so far,

610
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,510
Ji Woo is the smartest, the most skilled, and the bravest.

611
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,679
- That's right. - Yes.

612
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,980
What's this?

613
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,389
- A lump of blood. - You're right.

614
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:29,550
(He can only marvel at them.)

615
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,290
He learned what a lump of blood looked like.

616
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,590
Dad, you're cool. You're brave.

617
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,389
- Am I brave? - She says such sweet things.

618
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:38,330
- This is a lump of fat. - Seriously.

619
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,629
- A lump of fat? - Touch it.

620
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:41,770
- It's fat, right? - Yes.

621
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,830
Touch it.

622
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:45,399
So it's best to cut it off.

623
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,070
Do you want to touch the fat at the tail?

624
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,709
Touch it. It's okay.

625
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:52,780
Can you touch it?

626
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,780
- This is... - Won't it move?

627
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,909
- No. - It won't move.

628
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:56,980
It won't move.

629
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Will he do it?

630
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:02,719
Ji Woo, Eun Woo will do it.

631
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,629
- Ji Woo, Eun Woo will do it. - He's moving backward.

632
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:09,159
(When he gets closer, he moves backward.)

633
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,359
Eun Woo.

634
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:11,859
Hey.

635
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,600
- Oh, no. - Eun Woo.

636
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,399
(I need to run away.)

637
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,240
- He's using his butt. - He can't do it.

638
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
Hey, you're fast.

639
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
(Laughing)

640
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,070
You're fast.

641
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,840
(While experiencing the countryside life,)

642
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,879
(Eun Woo flipped over a handcart by mistake.)

643
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,080
(He needed to hurry up and make it stand.)

644
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:37,560
(But Eun Woo ran away more quickly than anyone.)

645
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,530
(So Eun Woo is the fastest when he runs away.)

646
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,830
You're good at reverse movement. I'm good at defense.

647
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:46,300
- My goodness. - That's right.

648
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,030
- He takes after his dad. - Yes.

649
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,000
I was good at stepping backward when I played professionally.

650
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,869
Yes.

651
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:56,639
(Like father, like son)

652
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,939
That's incredible speed.

653
00:22:58,139 --> 00:22:59,679
(Dad's reverse movement and Eun Woo's escape)

654
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,750
He's fast.

655
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,250
Eun Woo, you're my son.

656
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,679
He has that DNA.

657
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,550
(The two of them are different.)

658
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,090
Shall I do it?

659
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,419
- Go ahead. - Shall I try it?

660
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,030
- No. - No?

661
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,030
No.

662
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,230
I need to do it so that you can eat.

663
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,459
No, that one will do it.

664
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,869
(He points to that one.)

665
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,270
- "That one." - "That one will do it."

666
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,270
"That one."

667
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:26,169
(The monster mode comes on.)

668
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:28,740
He suddenly turned into a monster.

669
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,439
(That one becomes angry.)

670
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:33,409
He pressed the monster button.

671
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:36,750
Dad, you should do it.

672
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,280
Dad, you should do it.

673
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,649
(Laughing)

674
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
(He quickly changed his mind.)

675
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,919
- See? - He changed his mind.

676
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:44,790
Dad, you should do it.

677
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,830
He can do it, right?

678
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,830
My goodness.

679
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,929
How could you hand me over right away...

680
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,500
just because Uncle changed?

681
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,129
He changed his mind right away.

682
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,169
Because Uncle turned into a monster.

683
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:00,199
Eun woo, look at this. You know this rabbit, right?

684
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,510
- Eun Woo. - A rabbit.

685
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,609
(A rabbit?)

686
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,109
(Jung Woo is attached to his rabbit plushie.)

687
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,449
A rabbit looks like this when it's skinned.

688
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,609
- Seriously. - It looks the same.

689
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,250
- How cruel. - Jang Dong Min.

690
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,119
- I want to throw water at his face. - Ji Woo is strong...

691
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,850
because he's like that.

692
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,090
- Ji Woo grew up strong. - Yes.

693
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,260
- Ji Woo grew up strong. - She had to be strong.

694
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,790
A rabbit looks like this when it's skinned.

695
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,399
He'll be traumatized for life.

696
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,730
He'll be traumatized for life.

697
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,330
What are you saying?

698
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,369
- He's already shocked. - I mean...

699
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,300
Please protect his childhood innocence.

700
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:35,070
Why would you talk about skinning a rabbit?

701
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,139
Ji Woo, can you teach me?

702
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:38,209
What should I do?

703
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,040
What should I do?

704
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:42,850
You need to remove the lumps of blood.

705
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:45,919
(Her gesture is perfect.)

706
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,889
- That way, - Ji Woo is so thorough.

707
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:53,020
chickens won't have any unpleasant smell.

708
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,090
(Jang Ji Woo, expert in cleaning chickens)

709
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,929
Yes. Removing the blood eliminates the odor.

710
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,000
- Yes. - She's smart.

711
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,100
- She's so smart. - Yes.

712
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,899
(Will Jun Ho be able to touch a raw chicken?)

713
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,100
(The cowardly man of The Return of Superman...)

714
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,169
(struggles from the start.)

715
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,869
- What is he doing? - Who is that?

716
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,280
Ji Woo, how did you touch it?

717
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,980
(Hesitant)

718
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,179
Uncle, do you only know how to eat?

719
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:19,949
She criticized him.

720
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,189
- Children know everything. - Seriously.

721
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,490
- She's smart. - I lost.

722
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,330
(Uncle, do you only know how to eat?)

723
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,429
How does she speak so well?

724
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:30,389
It isn't like that. I just don't like chicken.

725
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,730
(Laughing)

726
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,199
What should I do?

727
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,270
Put your fingers inside and remove the lumps of blood.

728
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,639
- With bare hands? - Yes.

729
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,369
I didn't do it with skinned hands, did I?

730
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:45,010
(I don't want to touch it.)

731
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,010
Uncle, good luck.

732
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:50,480
My goodness.

733
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,980
A baboon.

734
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,889
Where did she learn it?

735
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,459
She's cute.

736
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:00,159
(Laughing)

737
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,189
She's thorough.

738
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,659
(He succeeds in removing the innards!)

739
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,330
- Like this? - Yes. There you go.

740
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,330
You're cool.

741
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,369
I'll do it for you later.

742
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,070
Now, shall we add rice inside?

743
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,169
You need to do it thoroughly.

744
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,709
These are soaked rice and beans.

745
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,240
Jung Woo, do you want to do it?

746
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,480
Touch it.

747
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,149
Can you put it inside?

748
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:22,879
Touch it. My goodness.

749
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,119
Touch it.

750
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,350
(A daring touch)

751
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,419
He doesn't disappoint.

752
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,419
Jung Woo doesn't disappoint.

753
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,219
(He ate his 1st chicken soup at the age of 12 months.)

754
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,659
(Full cheeks)

755
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:37,800
(He showed an eating show that befit Foodie Baby.)

756
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,100
(Shouting)

757
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,100
(The taste made him babble.)

758
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,740
(The meeting with the chicken soup was electrifying.)

759
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:46,969
Touch it.

760
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,439
(Perhaps that's why he doesn't hesitate to touch it.)

761
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,010
Say, "Bye."

762
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,080
Bye. Shall we put it inside?

763
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,310
(My mouth is watering.)

764
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:56,409
Put it in using a spoon.

765
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,879
- His mouth is watering. - Go.

766
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,250
This one too. Grab the other leg.

767
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,550
- He's thinking about eating it. - That's right.

768
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,290
He became happy after touching the chicken.

769
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,290
- He's drooling. - But it's a raw chicken.

770
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,730
Look at this.

771
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,159
(Here comes Jung Woo.)

772
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,730
- Jung Woo, do you want to try it? - Yes.

773
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,800
- Okay. - Yes.

774
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,899
- Okay. - What?

775
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,830
Jung Woo, do you want to try it? Try it with Uncle.

776
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,369
- All right. - I'll do it with Ji Woo.

777
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,600
(Jung Woo will try cooking for the first time.)

778
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,570
- Put your hand inside. - Firstly...

779
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,609
- How much rice should I add? - It's...

780
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,240
I think...

781
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,939
- How much rice should I add? - Watch me.

782
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,649
- Looking at the raw chickens... - There you go.

783
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,679
(Ji Woo adds the mixture well with the spoon.)

784
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,919
You're really good at this.

785
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,949
The chicken is eating the rice well.

786
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,389
Rice grows in size when it's cooked.

787
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:40,590
- Likewise, - Rice.

788
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,929
it grows inside the chicken. It can make a chicken explode.

789
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,429
No way. He wants to try it.

790
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,429
Jung Woo, put it in here.

791
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,240
- Is he trying it? - There you go.

792
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,699
- There you go. - You're good.

793
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,669
(You're good.)

794
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,169
- Go ahead. - It's full.

795
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:58,639
There you go.

796
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,679
- It's full. There you go. - There you go.

797
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,209
- When it comes to food... - A round of applause.

798
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,209
I know.

799
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,649
- He's knowledgeable. - A round of applause.

800
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,780
He learns fast.

801
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,419
- Yes. - You can't eat raw meat.

802
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,550
He's extraordinary.

803
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,619
(The stuffed chickens gets wrapped in aluminum foil.)

804
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,619
Now, we'll cook them and eat them, okay?

805
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,689
Make some noise if you think they'll be tasty.

806
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,260
- Yes! - Yes!

807
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,100
There you go.

808
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,560
Jung Woo, do you think it'll be tasty?

809
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,129
I know!

810
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,669
- I know! - There you go.

811
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,040
"I know!"

812
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,439
- "I know!" - "I know!"

813
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,240
Now...

814
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,810
(They get cooked over charcoal fire.)

815
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,109
- That's... - He's using charcoal fire.

816
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:34,609
- I can't wait. - They're bound to be tasty.

817
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,679
- There are sweet potatoes too. - Get cooked well.

818
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,580
Gosh, I bet it felt like a camping trip.

819
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,790
- Let's hurry up and eat. - Okay.

820
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,060
- What? - There's a lot of tasty food.

821
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
My goodness.

822
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,560
Watch.

823
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,459
- It looks tasty. - It has been cooked well.

824
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:50,830
There's rice inside.

825
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,330
(Glossy)

826
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,300
It's a proper feast.

827
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,669
(Woo Siblings blow out the candles together.)

828
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,439
- How cute. - There you go. Together.

829
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,770
- Go ahead. - Yes. Again.

830
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,439
- Okay. - He did well.

831
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:03,709
He did well.

832
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,939
(Let's hurry up and eat!)

833
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,639
Enjoy the food.

834
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:07,750
- Okay. - Okay.

835
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:09,280
Let's eat.

836
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,649
(Her eyes are fixed.)

837
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:13,679
What is it?

838
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,719
(Gulping)

839
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,719
What is it?

840
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,490
(What captivated Ji Woo's attention?)

841
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,020
Spaghetti.

842
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,389
(The foodie from the city)

843
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,760
(Pulling)

844
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,199
(He inhales the food.)

845
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,230
- He eats with gusto. - Look at Eun Woo.

846
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,199
He must find it tasty.

847
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,300
(A bite of the chicken)

848
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,699
- Gosh. - He's eating it like a side dish.

849
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,869
- What's that? - What? When did he eat like that?

850
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,770
- Chicken? - What?

851
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,340
He eats with gusto.

852
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,810
(Is this Food Goblin we only heard about?)

853
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,510
(He experienced the countryside life for the first time.)

854
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,709
He worked a lot today.

855
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,179
(He became absorbed and forgot about it for a while.)

856
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,980
(He missed the taste of the city.)

857
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,520
It's bound to be tasty.

858
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,689
- Seeing him eat like that... - He worked hard.

859
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,520
- He's eating with gusto. - He's giving us an eating show.

860
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,389
He worked very hard.

861
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:56,459
(His red beard grows.)

862
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:58,100
Eun Woo is eating with gusto.

863
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,129
(The chubby Eun Woo comes back.)

864
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:01,399
That's right. He was like that.

865
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,800
I want to eat it with French fries.

866
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,939
He knows how to eat.

867
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,709
After a bite...

868
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,010
French fries are a must.

869
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,409
(Younger ones, are you watching me?)

870
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,209
(Watching Eun Woo's eating show makes her appetite grow.)

871
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,179
Me too. Noodles.

872
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,080
(Me too)

873
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Noodles?

874
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,449
Do you want spaghetti?

875
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:21,820
Eun Woo made it look...

876
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,889
very tasty.

877
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:25,090
Is this spaghetti?

878
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,590
Yes, it's spaghetti.

879
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,189
It was Ji Woo's first time...

880
00:30:28,189 --> 00:30:30,659
- eating spaghetti. - Eun Woo is enjoying it very much.

881
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,060
(Slurping)

882
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,030
(Ji Woo, what do you think?)

883
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,100
Now, it's good.

884
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,310
(The senior farmer, Ji Woo taught him...)

885
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,909
(the phrase, "It's good!")

886
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:48,379
(Why aren't you saying it?)

887
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,609
"Now, it's good."

888
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,820
- "It's good." - He wants to hear it.

889
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,050
It's good.

890
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,889
Is it tasty?

891
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,260
He's the Food Goblin.

892
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,129
Me too.

893
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,399
- Me too. - "Me too."

894
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,469
(You can't leave me out when there's food.)

895
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:09,500
That's right.

896
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,040
Jung Woo has been quiet.

897
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,310
- Come on. - Jun Ho.

898
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:17,409
- Jun Ho, are you kidding me? - He doesn't want a blueberry.

899
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,780
- This one? - Yes.

900
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
Wink.

901
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,810
Jung Woo is hungry.

902
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,149
(Today as well, he winks for survival.)

903
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,119
- He winks for survival. - My goodness.

904
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,119
He's cute.

905
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,149
Here.

906
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,790
He's frustrated. He wants to do it himself.

907
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,790
(Kim Jung Woo, not Ha Jung Woo)

908
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,189
Jung Woo likes all kinds of meat dishes.

909
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,060
He's so cute.

910
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,699
He eats chicken with gusto.

911
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:41,330
How does he eat so well?

912
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,929
Gosh, Jung Woo eats with gusto.

913
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,139
Here.

914
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:46,740
- Here. - My goodness.

915
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,969
Will he eat a whole drumstick?

916
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,240
- No way. - Here.

917
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,439
(He's given a drumstick.)

918
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,840
(Look at his eyes.)

919
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
(Are you a drumstick?)

920
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,850
My goodness.

921
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,850
(It goes straight to his mouth.)

922
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,480
(Ripping)

923
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
You know how to gnaw on meat.

924
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,250
- He's good. - You know how to gnaw on meat.

925
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:03,020
You only have a few teeth.

926
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,389
(Chewing)

927
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,290
(He chews the meat with his few teeth.)

928
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:09,560
Jung Woo, don't eat the bone.

929
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,300
(You're my brother.)

930
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,500
It's tasty.

931
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,899
My goodness.

932
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,240
- Did he say, "It's tasty?" - It's tasty.

933
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,800
(His pronunciation was perfect.)

934
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,010
- His pronunciation was perfect. - My goodness.

935
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,840
(It's tasty!)

936
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,310
- His pronunciation was perfect. - My goodness.

937
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,879
Eun Woo also began speaking...

938
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:30,949
with "It's tasty."

939
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,919
(Eun Woo said "It's tasty" at the age of 22 months.)

940
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,189
(Jung Woo said "It's tasty" at the age of 19 months.)

941
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,090
- It's tasty. - You know,

942
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,929
Jun Ho's children speak better when they eat.

943
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,359
I love that children are eating well.

944
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,030
- My goodness. - My goodness.

945
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,429
Ji Woo, you're eating so well.

946
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,800
(Ji Woo, eat a drumstick.)

947
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,899
(Okay! Let's go.)

948
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:55,869
Why is she eating the end?

949
00:32:55,869 --> 00:32:57,040
Why is she eating the end?

950
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,639
- She knows how to eat. - She eats the cartilage first.

951
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:00,740
Look at Ji Woo.

952
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,050
When I give her chicken,

953
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,320
she eats the cartilage first.

954
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
- How strange. - Ji Woo is the same as me.

955
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,919
- Really? - Yes.

956
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,320
I prefer the cartilage.

957
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,990
Apparently, Dong Min eats like that too.

958
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,389
- Really? - She takes after his dad.

959
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,330
Jang Ji Woo's deboning show.

960
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,429
(A 29-month-old's deboning show)

961
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:18,330
- Does she eat the cartilage? - Yes.

962
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,399
It's so fascinating.

963
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,629
(Crunchy)

964
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:23,869
How is it?

965
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,300
(The ASMR is a bit scary.)

966
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,770
You aren't eating the bone, are you?

967
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,570
Look at her. She takes out the bone.

968
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,010
- Like that. - Don't eat the bone.

969
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,340
(She spits out the hard bone.)

970
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,879
My goodness. She takes out the bone.

971
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:36,879
(After removing all the bones)

972
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,550
- My goodness. - I can't believe it.

973
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,879
- My goodness. - She takes out the bone.

974
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,290
She eats with gusto.

975
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,619
She knows how to debone the chicken.

976
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,859
She eats as much as Jung Woo.

977
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,330
She knows how to eat.

978
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,030
(Ji Woo...)

979
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,659
(eats very well.)

980
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,669
It's Eun Woo's first time seeing something like that.

981
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,030
(Eun Woo's eyes are fixed on her.)

982
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,429
It's his first time having a younger sister.

983
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:58,840
My goodness.

984
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,909
- Have a bite. - My goodness.

985
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,540
Have a bite.

986
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,679
- Gosh, he's the older brother. - He takes care of the others.

987
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:07,750
- I'll give it to you. - Seriously.

988
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,810
- It wasn't just Jung Woo. - Say, "Thank you, Eun Woo."

989
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,419
- He's like that with everyone. - I'll give it to you.

990
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,949
Say, "Thank you, Eun Woo."

991
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,219
Eun Woo loves French fries so much...

992
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,520
that he rarely gives me one.

993
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,219
- Then... - Was he flirting?

994
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,960
- What? - French fries.

995
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,290
- Seriously. - Since Eun Woo gave it to me,

996
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,199
it was tasty.

997
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,630
Really?

998
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,330
Since Eun Woo gave it to her, it was tasty.

999
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,029
(You're making me blush.)

1000
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,139
Eun Woo, what do you like?

1001
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,670
- What? What are they doing? - French fries.

1002
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,869
- What? - Here you go.

1003
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:38,110
My goodness.

1004
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,739
They're so cute.

1005
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,250
(They share love through French fries.)

1006
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,279
Thank you.

1007
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,580
(Thank you, Ji Woo.)

1008
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,549
The atmosphere is nice between the two.

1009
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,719
Dong Min, shall we do that?

1010
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,420
Yes.

1011
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,989
The dads are excited.

1012
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,420
- Right? - Okay.

1013
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,860
- Open wide. - Shall we do it?

1014
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,190
Ji Woo, come here.

1015
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,799
- That's a bone. - Wait.

1016
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,100
- What is it? - Ji Woo.

1017
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,230
There you go.

1018
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,969
- My goodness. - There you go.

1019
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:03,969
Ji Woo, here.

1020
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,400
- Oh, no. - There you go.

1021
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,069
- There you go. - Go. Get closer.

1022
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,810
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1023
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,480
(Screaming)

1024
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,009
It's the first kiss.

1025
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,679
(Their hearts flutter.)

1026
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,179
- There you go. - Go. Get closer.

1027
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,409
Get closer.

1028
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,580
(They're suddenly close.)

1029
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,750
(Eating)

1030
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:26,259
(They close the distance.)

1031
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,759
(They get a dopamine rush.)

1032
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:32,900
(Everyone, close your eyes.)

1033
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,159
- Jung Woo. - Get closer.

1034
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,069
- Seriously. - Get closer.

1035
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,670
(The spaghetti breaks.)

1036
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,440
Oh, no. It broke.

1037
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,239
How embarrassing.

1038
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,880
(Eun Woo eats the remaining pasta.)

1039
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,949
Look at Ji Woo.

1040
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:50,949
Was it embarrassing?

1041
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,549
How embarrassing.

1042
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:55,449
- All right. - "How embarrassing."

1043
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,060
- My goodness. - When they blew out the candles.

1044
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,560
it was like an engagement ceremony.

1045
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,529
- That was what it looked like. - He's right.

1046
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,960
Say, "Father-in-law."

1047
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
Father-in-law.

1048
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,400
- Say, "Thank you." - Thank you.

1049
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,469
All right, my son-in-law. Eat up.

1050
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,699
(Who is your son-in-law?)

1051
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:15,469
I don't have anything else to give.

1052
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:18,779
This house and all are yours.

1053
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,810
Say, "Thank you."

1054
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,380
- Thank you. - Of course.

1055
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,480
- "Thank you." - Thank you.

1056
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,980
(I'll accept them.)

1057
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,980
Say, "Father, please eat this."

1058
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,119
Say, "Father, please eat this."

1059
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,219
Father, please eat this.

1060
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,190
- "Father, please eat this." - Thank you,

1061
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,989
- my future daughter-in-law. - My goodness.

1062
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:34,989
(Don't mention it.)

1063
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,190
Thank you.

1064
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:38,199
I'll love it if she becomes my daughter-in-law.

1065
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,659
Eun Woo is timid, right?

1066
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:42,000
But Ji Woo is so skilled.

1067
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,199
- She's forward. - They'll make a good pair.

1068
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,739
They already have Jun Ho's permission.

1069
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:48,040
Are you okay with your in-law being a monster?

1070
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,210
I'll have to think about it.

1071
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,310
(The in-law who's a monster gives him a pause.)

1072
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,310
(After playing around, they resume eating!)

1073
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,310
You know...

1074
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,020
Yes?

1075
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,650
(Jun Ho, shall we do it now?)

1076
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,420
What is it?

1077
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,389
(The two of them exchange looks.)

1078
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,460
What is it this time?

1079
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:07,259
It's Christmas, so someone needs to come.

1080
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,460
- That's right. - Yes.

1081
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,330
(Could it be him?)

1082
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:12,830
- That man. - I see.

1083
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,569
(Laughing)

1084
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:15,929
(Santa Dong Min appears.)

1085
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,199
Like that?

1086
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,799
I'm Santa Claus, children.

1087
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,509
Isn't he Kim Gye Ran?

1088
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,080
He does look like Kim Gye Ran.

1089
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:26,779
(Laughing)

1090
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,480
You're good at spotting the characteristics.

1091
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,750
(Last Christmas,)

1092
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,619
(Jun Ho dressed up as Santa Claus.)

1093
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,290
(Jung Woo bawled.)

1094
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,420
(He made the mistake of glaring.)

1095
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,529
- Anyone would be scared. - He does look scary.

1096
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,060
(Refusing Santa Claus)

1097
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:48,469
(The event failed and only left fear.)

1098
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,869
I did it last year.

1099
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:52,540
Since I failed, I asked Dong Min to show me how it was done.

1100
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:53,940
I wanted to learn.

1101
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,670
- You wanted to see a reference. - Yes.

1102
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,869
How will they react?

1103
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,380
(Unknowing of the approaching fate, they play happily.)

1104
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,080
(Who are you?)

1105
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
It's a strange man.

1106
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:09,949
Hello, children.

1107
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,819
Hello, children.

1108
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,489
My goodness.

1109
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:16,060
He waved.

1110
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:19,429
- They're a bit surprised. - I'm Santa Claus.

1111
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,299
(Meanwhile, Ji Woo...)

1112
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,670
(approaches him.)

1113
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,739
Ji Woo knows his voice.

1114
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:31,540
It's because Dong Min often does comedy skits.

1115
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,009
I'm Santa Claus.

1116
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,549
(She just finds it funny.)

1117
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:36,610
All right.

1118
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:38,880
(These two are the problem.)

1119
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,779
Why isn't Dad coming?

1120
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,250
(Eun Woo plucks up his courage and talks to him.)

1121
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:46,259
Your dad went to the restroom.

1122
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,389
I'm Santa Claus.

1123
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:52,500
(Santa Claus?)

1124
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,170
Your voice is a bit scary.

1125
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,170
(Your voice is a bit scary.)

1126
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,600
- He's scared. - He's scared.

1127
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,369
I'm a good man.

1128
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:03,540
(Keeping his distance)

1129
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,509
- Hello. - He does look scary.

1130
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,839
Hello.

1131
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,150
(He says hello.)

1132
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,279
- Santa Claus isn't a bad man. - He's scared. His dad is gone too.

1133
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:15,690
Did my dad...

1134
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,589
Did my dad go to the restroom?

1135
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,690
He went to the restroom. He went to the restroom to pee.

1136
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,900

1299
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,400
Hold on.

1300
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,469
He doesn't stay still.

1301
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,710
He's like the combination...

1302
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,110
of our strengths.

1303
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,480
- Seriously. - Si Woo.

1304
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,210
He has his mom's looks.

1305
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,310
Dad's physical abilities and Mom's mental abilities...

1306
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,080
came together. It's the best.

1307
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,420
- How impressive. - Seriously.

1308
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,520
(The talented Si Woo's family)

1309
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,089
And here is...

1310
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:00,089
our second son...

1311
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,330
- who'll be born soon, Ttaengkong. - The second son.

1312
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,759
- We're a family of four. - Ttaengkong.

1313
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:06,600
- She's pregnant. - I'm in the tenth month...

1314
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,069
of pregnancy. I'm heavily pregnant.

1315
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,330
He'll come out soon.

1316
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,799
I won't be able to believe it...

1317
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,270
- even after he's born. - He looks like his dad.

1318
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,600
Ttaengkong, hello.

1319
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,139
My second child is a son too.

1320
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:19,380
(I'll be a mom of two sons.)

1321
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:20,980
He's Jae Yi's age.

1322
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,210
- You're right. - The year of the blue dragon.

1323
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,049
(She's worried and excited to be the mom of two sons.)

1324
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,150
(The new Superman family has cheerful energy.)

1325
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,319
Take this.

1326
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,860
Who's the champion?

1327
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,759
- Me. - Me.

1328
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,330
I'm the champion.

1329
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,389
No.

1330
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,199
(Don't be like that to your dad, the champion.)

1331
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,259
"No."

1332
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:43,500
How cool.

1333
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,600
(He has the best kick in the world.)

1334
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,040
- He's so cool. - How is his body like that?

1335
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,610
- Oh, no. He's so cool. - My gosh.

1336
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,880
- It's 540 degrees. - My goodness.

1337
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,779
He flew and kicked multiple times.

1338
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,650
He has the best performances. He's good.

1339
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,520
It was my first time seeing such intense kicks.

1340
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,850
He's so cool.

1341
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,549
(Come on!)

1342
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:06,060
(Si Woo has no fear.)

1343
00:47:06,389 --> 00:47:09,190
- Come on. - Oh, no.

1344
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,529
(Taekwon Si Woo doesn't stop even when he's in the air!)

1345
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,060
(Flapping)

1346
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,130
Kick.

1347
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
(He's my son, but I'm impressed.)

1348
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,529
(Si Woo brings something over.)

1349
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:19,000
- Kick. - Here.

1350
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,600
A real pine board?

1351
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,110
Aim.

1352
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,969
(A real pine board)

1353
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,739
I can do it!

1354
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,179
- Can you do well? - Yes.

1355
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:29,080
- Really? - Yes.

1356
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
- Really? - Yes.

1357
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,679
In that case, shout.

1358
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,980
(Shouting)

1359
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:36,250
It was weak.

1360
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,420
Louder.

1361
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,159
How nice.

1362
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,420
Go.

1363
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,529
(How will be Si Woo's board-breaking skills?)

1364
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,360
It'll be hard.

1365
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,500
(Show me, my son!)

1366
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:52,100
(The Return of Superman seniors struggled to break the boards.)

1367
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,400
(Will Si Woo be able to break it?)

1368
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:59,210
(A real taekwon prodigy is born.)

1369
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,610
My goodness.

1370
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,779
He did it in one go.

1371
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,350
(This is how a 33-month-old breaks a wooden board!)

1372
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,179
(Truly surprised)

1373
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,489
High-five.

1374
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,690
- He's the champion. - Even Min Cheol was surprised.

1375
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,659
(Am I the champion now?)

1376
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,790
The field I'm in...

1377
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,900
isn't ordinary taekwondo for training the body and mind.

1378
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:22,869
It's extreme taekwondo.

1379
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:25,799
It focuses on the performance.

1380
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:28,569
- It's about extreme challenges. - It's so cool.

1381
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:30,440
(Extreme taekwondo focuses on the performative aspects.)

1382
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,139
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1383
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,380
He's incredible.

1384
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,009
My goodness.

1385
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:38,679
(You need the sense of rhythm and physical abilities!)

1386
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,049
- It's a work of art. - He makes the country proud.

1387
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,989
- I know. - He needs a sense of rhythm.

1388
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:46,319
- Foreigners will be shocked. - They'll be surprised.

1389
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,790
To be honest, Si Woo hasn't learned taekwondo.

1390
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,389
He's too young to learn it.

1391
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,500
He's a baby.

1392
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,900
But it was so fascinating.

1393
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:56,569
He studied people diligently when he was younger.

1394
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,369
- He learned it naturally. - He's so fast.

1395
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,839
- Seriously. - Look at his kicks.

1396
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,969
He's so fast.

1397
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:04,639
- He's a prodigy. - It's in his blood.

1398
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:05,779
- Of course. - He's a prodigy.

1399
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:06,779
How strange.

1400
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:08,949
Attention. Bow.

1401
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,279
(How are Si Woo's skills in the taekwondo performance?)

1402
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:11,710
(Bowing)

1403
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:12,819
Get ready.

1404
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:14,420
- Yes! - Yes!

1405
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,449
Are you ready?

1406
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:16,549
(Being a taekwondo athlete, his dad is already excited.)

1407
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:17,719
Okay. Here we go.

1408
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,319
(Let's go, Si Woo!)

1409
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,319
What?

1410
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:22,560
- What? - He began performing...

1411
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,029
to the music.

1412
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,630
(He rolls forward energetically.)

1413
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,659
He has watched his dad.

1414
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:28,259
He's doing the moves...

1415
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:29,869
to the music.

1416
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:30,869
(Solemn)

1417
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,799
(The ready position is the same as his dad's.)

1418
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:35,909
(Punching)

1419
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:36,909
(A strong kick)

1420
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:38,110
(Son, you can do it pretty well.)

1421
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,409
His skills are extraordinary.

1422
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:42,710
(A real performance begins now!)

1423
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,949
- There you go. - His facial expression is great.

1424
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:48,580
- He has a nice memory. - Go!

1425
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,690
Go!

1426
00:49:50,889 --> 00:49:53,089
(He lets out a loud shout like his dad!)

1427
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,460
- Go! - Go!

1428
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,259
He's good.

1429
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,259
(Show us, Si Woo!)

1430
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,699
(He runs over energetically and does a flying kick!)

1431
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,000
(Just like his dad's cool flying kick)

1432
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He'll be like his dad in no time.

1433
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,029
That's right.

1434
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,100
(Si Woo shows a cool flying kick.)

1435
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,569
- You know... - It's no joke.

1436
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:10,810
How does that young boy have such a facial expression?

1437
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,710
(My goodness)

1438
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:16,279
- Every time this part comes... - He's waiting for the right timing.

1439
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,279
I know.

1440
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,619
- It's the ready position. - What?

1441
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,389
- The ready position. - I think he'll do something.

1442
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,089
Here we go. It's coming.

1443
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,619
It's coming.

1444
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:27,889
Is he waiting for the right time?

1445
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,460
He'll move to the music.

1446
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,130
- Now is the time. - Now is the time.

1447
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,600
(The timing was perfect!)

1448
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,259
He waited for the right time.

1449
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:37,699
He has a sense of rhythm like his mom.

1450
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:39,270
He has a sense of rhythm.

1451
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,339
- He takes after both parents. - Yes.

1452
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,469
I can't believe it.

1453
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,710
Look at the way his leg goes up.

1454
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,610
It nearly touched his head.

1455
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,610
- So high. - His kick went up so high.

1456
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,250
He's only 33 months old.

1457
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,610
(His foot goes up as much as his height.)

1458
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,250
He'll become someone great.

1459
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,279
That's right.

1460
00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:55,690
(His athletic DNA explodes! He's taekwon Si Woo.)

1461
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,719
He's good.

1462
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:57,850
(Si Woo, you're so cool.)

1463
00:50:58,290 --> 00:50:59,460
Si Woo, wrap it up. Shout.

1464
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,589
(Shouting)

1465
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:05,799
(He wraps it up perfectly!)

1466
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,699
In Sung wraps up well.

1467
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,299
He's good at breaking the boards.

1468
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,299
He does this after breaking the boards.

1469
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:14,469
(He stretches his fingers.)

1470
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,710
(In my eyes, my son is the best.)

1471
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:19,409
(He's like a martial arts master at the age of 33 months.)

1472
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,310
- Amazing. - Amazing.

1473
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,909
(Wasn't I pretty cool?)

1474
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:25,679
- It was really good. - Si Woo.

1475
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,420
High-five.

1476
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,389
Yes.

1477
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:31,589
Very good.

1478
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:33,290
To whom did you show a cool pose?

1479
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,460
Over there.

1480
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,860
A camera?

1481
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,290
He even has showmanship.

1482
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,130
(Laughing)

1483
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,299
- Be cool. - He even looked at the camera.

1484
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:42,400
(His ending pose is perfect!)

1485
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,130
Show me your power!

1486
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,330
Let's go!

1487
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:49,810
Dad, do this for me.

1488
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,210
Dad, do this for me.

1489
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,009
- Will you do it? - Yes.

1490
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,179
- Can you really do it? - Yes.

1491
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,710
Dad, you kicked the bottle cap.

1492
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,779
That's right.

1493
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,219
I watched that video.

1494
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,549
(Min Cheol's bottle cap challenge was the talk of the town.)

1495
00:52:02,549 --> 00:52:03,690
- What? - No way.

1496
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,560
(He only opened the bottle cap!)

1497
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,719
He opened it with his foot.

1498
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,560
- His eyes are covered. - Gosh.

1499
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,060
No way.

1500
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:17,699
Can you do it if I hold the bottle?

1501
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:18,900
- Yes. - Really? Hold on.

1502
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,839
- How will he... - Will Si Woo do it?

1503
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,569
- Let's see. - Collect the energy.

1504
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:23,839
Will he be able to succeed in it?

1505
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,610
(Collect the energy!)

1506
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,710
(How will be Si Woo's bottle cap challenge?)

1507
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,610
He's so flexible.

1508
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,650
Even adults will find it hard.

1509
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,980
(Show me, Taekwon Si Woo!)

1510
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:38,790
(Perfect!)

1511
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,759
(Perfect!)

1512
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:44,960
He's good.

1513
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,830
He's a prodigy.

1514
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,469
He's good at using his body.

1515
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,400
He has the athletic DNA.

1516
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,799
- He's focused too. - Well Done.

1517
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,540
You're a genius.

1518
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:00,310
The fact that he raised his foot and touched...

1519
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,080
- the tiny bottle cap... - Seriously.

1520
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,179
- It's quite a feat. - It requires concentration.

1521
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,150
He was born with athletic skills.

1522
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,150
He was born with them.

1523
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,350
I was surprised by his incredible skills.

1524
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:12,719
He has the stamina and kicking skills.

1525
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:14,159
He also has star quality...

1526
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,420
- from his mom. - That's right.

1527
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,460
- That's right. - He can be an action movie actor.

1528
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,659
- An action movie star. - That's what I think.

1529
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:21,159
- Yes. - That's the only way.

1530
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,270
Dad decided on his path.

1531
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,170
I want to raise Si Woo...

1532
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,170
into a gentleman.

1533
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,710
When I see him play with Min Cheol,

1534
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,810
they're like monkeys in the jungle.

1535
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,009
My goodness.

1536
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:36,409
His expression is so funny.

1537
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:38,810
(Is Si Woo Mowgli?)

1538
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,549
How will we deal with his energy?

1539
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:46,389
(Si Woo runs around as if the house is the jungle.)

1540
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,759
I want him...

1541
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:50,830
- to grow into a gentleman. - That's right.

1542
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,960
"The Great Gatsby." You get the idea.

1543
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,069
That's what comes to mind when we think of a gentleman.

1544
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,630
It's completely different from what his dad wants.

1545
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,369
On top of that,

1546
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:04,569
I want him to have the language skills.

1547
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,409
Si Woo.

1548
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,779
You're hungry, so Mommy is going to make breakfast, okay?

1549
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:13,480
You're hungry, so Mommy is going to make breakfast, okay?

1550
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,279
- What? - I want you to listen...

1551
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:17,250
- to the radio with Daddy, okay? - Yes.

1552
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,159
- I'll turn on the radio - What did she say?

1553
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:20,560
- I don't know. - Okay.

1554
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,290
You saw how quiet we became.

1555
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,259
Why do my shoulders hurt?

1556
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:28,360
- We were so focused. - We put our heads forward.

1557
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,529
- Right? - Yes.

1558
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:31,230
It was like a listening comprehension test.

1559
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,170
(When she spoke English)

1560
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,969
You're hungry, so Mommy is going to make breakfast, okay?

1561
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,440
(The entire group fell silent.)

1562
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,279
(A smile got wiped from his face.)

1563
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,509
We focused on the subtitles.

1564
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,719
She spoke so fast...

1565
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,719
that the subtitles passed quickly.

1566
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:50,119
- So we didn't understand. - We missed the last part.

1567
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:52,819
I want you to listen...

1568
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,819
- to the radio with Daddy, okay? - Yes.

1569
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:56,429
I'll turn on the radio.

1570
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:57,830
- Listen to it with Si Woo. - Okay.

1571
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,759
(Is there a reason why you speak English at home?)

1572
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,170
I spent my childhood...

1573
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,040
- in Hong Kong. - That's right.

1574
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,540
The environment was easy and advantageous...

1575
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,339
for learning English.

1576
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:13,839
But in Korea,

1577
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,850
it isn't easy to learn English.

1578
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:20,150
I thought about sending him to an English kindergarten.

1579
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,980
Moms talked about it a lot.

1580
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,920
We gave it a lot of thought.

1581
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:28,089
- But I can speak English. - That's right.

1582
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,489
I want to show people that children can do well...

1583
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:32,500
without going to an English kindergarten.

1584
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,929
That's why I speak English diligently.

1585
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:38,100
It really isn't easy...

1586
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,469
to teach children at home. It's hard.

1587
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,139
Hye Rim even went to a graduate school for translation.

1588
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:47,480
She's incredibly talented.

1589
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,610
That's right.

1590
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:49,909
- E. - E.

1591
00:55:49,909 --> 00:55:51,310
- E. - E.

1592
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,179
(Follow me.)

1593
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:54,549
She's a translator.

1594
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:56,190
- Banana. - Banana.

1595
00:55:57,819 --> 00:55:58,889
B.

1596
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,290
Butterfly.

1597
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,920
- Butterfly. - Butterfly.

1598
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:05,429
(Read English books whenever you can.)

1599
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,199
- English books. - Whenever you can.

1600
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:12,100
Grandpa Noah and the sheep.

1601
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,000
- There's a snake too. - Si Woo.

1602
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,810
It's a sneaky, sneaky...

1603
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,339
snake.

1604
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,409
You can not eat the apple from this tree.

1605
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:22,650
- What's this? - Yes.

1606
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,819
It's a sneaky, sneaky snake.

1607
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:26,980
(She adds fun to the English children's book.)

1608
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,719
Books are the best for learning.

1609
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,659
(Speak English in daily life.)

1610
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:34,089
- Do you want one? - Yes.

1611
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,219
- Do you want one? - Yes.

1612
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,259
They speak English daily.

1613
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,429
Give me a pinky promise.

1614
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:40,159
Pinky promise.

1615
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:41,159
Pinky.

1616
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:42,770
- Pinky. - That's how you make a promise.

1617
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,799
Promise.

1618
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,500
This isn't an English show.

1619
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:48,799
- Are you ready? - Are you ready?

1620
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:49,969
Are you ready?

1621
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,339
Say, "I'm ready."

1622
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:53,179
- How nice. - I'm ready.

1623
00:56:54,339 --> 00:56:56,250
Are you going to eat the apple, Si Woo?

1624
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,080
- No. - I'm jealous.

1625
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,279
I want to help him improve his listening and speaking skills...

1626
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:03,690
in English in a natural way.

1627
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:07,060
I think it'll be effective.

1628
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,389
Since Si Woo has been doing well,

1629
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:10,489
I'm becoming more ambitious.

1630
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:12,799
If she uses English in the daily life,

1631
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,860
it won't stress out the child.

1632
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,000
- Yes. It's just a conversation. - In a natural way,

1633
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,500
he can learn two languages.

1634
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,040
- Yes. It's natural. - Seriously,

1635
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,040
it's the best environment for learning English.

1636
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,170
- Seriously. - Yes.

1637
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,839
Let's see. Let's play a game with Daddy.

1638
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,810
I'm going to ask you about the animals.

1639
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,750
- Okay. - Let's see who can answer faster.

1640
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,980
- Okay. - All right?

1641
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,690
(It's an English animal quiz.)

1642
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,989
It's impressive.

1643
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:41,060
Those aren't the common animals...

1644
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,960
- we know. - Seriously.

1645
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,290
- Not dog and cat. - That's right.

1646
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:46,960
Dog and cat.

1647
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:52,000
(Walrus? Woodpecker? Flamingo?)

1648
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:56,639
(1986, the year of the tiger. versus 2022, the year of the tiger)

1649
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:58,040
- Are you ready? - I'm ready.

1650
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,509
- I'm ready. - Are you ready, Daddy?

1651
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,580
Are you ready, Baby?

1652
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,009
- Yes! - Okay.

1653
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,909
Which animal has a long trunk?

1654
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:07,350
Which animal has a long trunk?

1655
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,250
- Elephant. - Elephant. Yes.

1656
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,420
I won.

1657
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,819
I won.

1658
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:16,429
Si Woo got the first question.

1659
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:18,830
Judging by his facial expression, Min Cheol really didn't understand.

1660
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,960
I don't think he understood.

1661
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,730
Min Cheol looks very tired.

1662
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,569
I'm tired too.

1663
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,440
High-five.

1664
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,699
- Yes. - That was really good.

1665
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
Okay.

1666
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,270
(Si Woo can answer harder questions as well!)

1667
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,279
Okay. Which animal has a long tusk?

1668
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:36,779
And they can be found in the arctic.

1669
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,310
- Walrus. - Walrus.

1670
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,819
- Walrus. - Walrus.

1671
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,350
(What's a walrus?)

1672
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,319
- He doesn't know. - You answered correctly.

1673
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,190
What was the word?

1674
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,190
What did they say?

1675
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,690
- What was the word? - What did they say just now?

1676
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,089
(Min Cheol made the same facial expression as me.)

1677
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:52,759
- Okay. Now... - Gosh.

1678
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:53,929
Let me ask you this.

1679
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,270
Which animal lives in the desert...

1680
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,799
and has a humpback?

1681
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,400
Kangaroo.

1682
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,400
No.

1683
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,040
(Min Cheol doesn't seem to know.)

1684
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,239
Look at the dad.

1685
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,839
Nice try, but try again.

1686
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:09,679
- Ca... - Camel.

1687
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,150
Camel. That's right.

1688
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,150
(Dad, don't you think that I'm good?)

1689
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:14,350
Si Woo answered all the questions.

1690
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,920
- I'm losing to a two-year-old. - Camel.

1691
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,089
It's fun.

1692
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:19,319
- Okay. - This animal...

1693
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:20,759
- is living in the desert too. - Yes.

1694
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:22,089
A fox. That's right.

1695
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:23,489
They live in the desert too.

1696
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:26,130
That's correct. A fox is living in the desert too.

1697
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,759
- The desert fox. - That's right. The desert fox.

1698
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:29,369
- Look at him. - That's right.

1699
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:31,270
He keeps admiring.

1700
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,000
Cheetah.

1701
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,400
- Joy. - Joy!

1702
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,670
What are you saying?

1703
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,009
"What are you saying?"

1704
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:39,139
Last one.

1705
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:40,779
- Listen carefully. - He's so different now.

1706
00:59:40,779 --> 00:59:41,779
Okay.

1707
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,920
Which animal has...

1708
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,650
colorful, bright, large feathers?

1709
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:53,460
Colorful, bright, and large feathers.

1710
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,989
Colorful, bright, and large feathers.

1711
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,360
Feather?

1712
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,159
- Like a fan. - Is it a peacock?

1713
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,799
What do you call it in English?

1714
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,170
- A peacock. - He got it!

1715
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,670
But he thought of it in Korean,

1716
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,940
- and he's not sure about English. - Right. A peacock.

1717
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:08,670
(What do you call it in English?)

1718
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,110
What do you call it in English?

1719
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:12,270
- Peacock. - Peacock.

1720
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,040
- Peacock. - Peacock.

1721
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,009
Yes. That's right.

1722
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:17,949
- What are you? - It's a peacock.

1723
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,279
How come he's so good? This is amazing.

1724
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,889
Good job.

1725
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,650
Sin Si Woo, how come you're so good?

1726
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,819
Si Woo, you win!

1727
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,630
Sin Si Woo wins!

1728
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,529
Si Woo, you won. You're the champion.

1729
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,730
- Hello. - Yes.

1730
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:37,699
Si Woo, I love you.

1731
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:40,500
Goodness.

1732
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:43,739
He understood the English explanations and answered it.

1733
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,139
- His dad is surprised. - Isn't he his own son?

1734
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:47,310
(How come my son's English is so good?)

1735
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,040
I want him to be gifted with language.

1736
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,179
I don't want many things from him,

1737
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,380
but I'd like to pass...

1738
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,350
my language ability on Si Woo.

1739
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,889
I want him to be a gifted athletic boy.

1740
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:02,259
- I can't stand getting lost. - Right.

1741
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,730
I've lived my whole life in competition...

1742
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,029
playing in matches.

1743
01:01:07,029 --> 01:01:09,770
Without a desire for winning,

1744
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,270
you can't get on the top in a field.

1745
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,139
Si Woo inherited it naturally,

1746
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:17,670
- so I'm amazed. - I won!

1747
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:19,440
An action star.

1748
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,909
About having that career, no matter what,

1749
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,850
I plan to talk to Si Woo.

1750
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,179
(It's getting dark.)

1751
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,319
Si Woo, do you want to play with me?

1752
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:32,659
Yes.

1753
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:33,659
(Si Woo in taekwondo uniform?)

1754
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,429
(Where's this place?)

1755
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,699
You need to catch me.

1756
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:42,400
(It's Min Chol's taekwondo studio.)

1757
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,799
The best playground for Si Woo...

1758
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,429
- is the taekwondo studio. - It is.

1759
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:47,540
- Okay. - Dad!

1760
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,639
Oh, my goodness.

1761
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,369
(Si Woo has energy too much to release at home.)

1762
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:53,810
Si Woo has too much strength and energy...

1763
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,179
to be released enough at home, I think.

1764
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,380
This studio has a much larger space than home.

1765
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,650
So I can release him here to run around.

1766
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,219
(I release him here to run around as much as he likes.)

1767
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:03,790
People say they raise boys releasing outside the home.

1768
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,319
He looks the happiest when he's doing physical activity.

1769
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,089
That's right.

1770
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,429
(Shouting)

1771
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:16,730
(Shouts of concentration resound in the studio.)

1772
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,929
That's it.

1773
01:02:18,929 --> 01:02:20,100
It's Min Cheol.

1774
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,199
(Players started training.)

1775
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,110
They're doing it here.

1776
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,540
(Min Cheol is instructing with dignity.)

1777
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,139
He's instructing.

1778
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,580
(Charismatic)

1779
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,110
His eyes look different.

1780
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,679
Okay. Good.

1781
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,380
- He looks different. - Goodness.

1782
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,580
It's his dad with a different look.

1783
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,190
It's Uncle Sang Hoon.

1784
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,460
(Si Woo is watching it with his mom right in front of them.)

1785
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,360
(Min Cheol will break 5 pine boards in a row.)

1786
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Here we go!

1787
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,159
(The kick champion shows high-level kicks in a row.)

1788
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,469
Oh, my.

1789
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,739
He's literally flying.

1790
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,270
That's a five-step kick.

1791
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:57,739
(The dignity of a world kick champion)

1792
01:02:57,739 --> 01:02:59,170
He's spinning in the air.

1793
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,750
(A perfect finish)

1794
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,560
(So charismatic)

1795
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,819
He's really awesome.

1796
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:21,929
(A performance in the part 2)

1797
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:26,000
(Hye Rim bursts into laughter all of a sudden.)

1798
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,369
What is it?

1799
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,909
(Why is Si Woo there?)

1800
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,739
Is Si Woo participating in the performance too?

1801
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:35,279
Ttaengkong will come to this world soon.

1802
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:38,679
To celebrate Ttaengkong's birth coming soon,

1803
01:03:38,679 --> 01:03:39,850
I prepared for this performance.

1804
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,420
Min Cheol, with Si Woo,

1805
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,949
prepared a surprise event.

1806
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:47,020
Hye Rim is going to deliver a second child soon. That's why.

1807
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,589
He's doing his best.

1808
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:50,630
Si Woo!

1809
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,330
(My son is the best.)

1810
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,730
Hold this up!

1811
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:03,869
It's such a special event for her.

1812
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,040
Are you ready to go again?

1813
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,179
Okay!

1814
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,310
(The performance isn't over yet.)

1815
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,949
A kick!

1816
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:15,679
(Curious)

1817
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:20,219
(A surprise event prepared for Hye Rim's safe delivery)

1818
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:22,759
"Ttaengkong, thank you for coming to us."

1819
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:24,159
Oh, my goodness.

1820
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,199
Min Cheol prepared for it, and Si Woo gave it a finale.

1821
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:27,900
That's what I'm saying.

1822
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,130
Oh, my goodness!

1823
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,699
(Touched by the unexpected gift)

1824
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,940
(Mom, did I do a good job?)

1825
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,040
(I love you, Mom.)

1826
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,380
(Let's meet safely with Ttaengkong.)

1827
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,739
- He's so lovely. - He must be reliable for her.

1828
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:43,810
He's so cute.

1829
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,449
A day spent with Si Woo...

1830
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,020
always feels special,

1831
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,989
but we don't have much time left for just the three of us.

1832
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:54,360
Since they prepared such a special event today,

1833
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:57,130
it will remain in my memory for a long time.

1834
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,330
(The moment she will remember for a long time)

1835
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,400
- They were a family of three, - Yes.

1836
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,100
and I'll look forward to seeing a family of four.

1837
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,199
Ttaengkong, have a nice and safe trip coming to this world.

1838
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:07,770
Pinky promise.

1839
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,270
I'm doing it right, I guess.

1840
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,469
You're doing it right.

1841
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,739
(2025, the Year of the Snake has dawned.)

1842
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,909
(To develop great spirit,)

1843
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:22,420
(the Woo Brothers go climbing for the new year!)

1844
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,920
(Why did you want to climb a mountain?)

1845
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,319
(Because it is there.)

1846
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:34,230
(And Ji Woo has a visitor.)

1847
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,429
(Big Ji Woo visits Ji Woo for the new year!)

1848
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,000
(Princess Ji Woo is no exception in Dong Min Town either!)

1849
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
(Shouting)

1850
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:44,869
(Shouting)

1851
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:47,509
(Flopping down in surprise)

1852
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,040
(In the henhouse too,)

1853
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,610
(her suffering continues.)

1854
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:53,310
(Welcome to Dong Min Town!)

1855
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:56,619
(We guarantee a good laugh next year as well.)

1856
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,350
(The Return of Superman will come back.)

1857
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,860
(Please send your unchanging love and support for us again.)
