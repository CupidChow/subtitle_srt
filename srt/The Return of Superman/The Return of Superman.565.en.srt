1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:01,352
Kim Jung Woo.

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:03,562
Kim Jung Woo.

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:06,392
Kim Jung Woo.

4
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:10,162
Kim Jung Woo.

5
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:11,902
What color do you like? End of Task Block 1

6
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:13,972
- Pick one. - That one.

7
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,532
Should I buy one for you too, Jung Woo?

8
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:17,602
This.

9
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,112
This.

10
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:20,942
You put it like this.

11
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,542
Meat!

12
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,182
It's a T-Rex.

13
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:35,292
Kim Jung Woo!

14
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,791
Whose house is this?

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,501
Let's decorate.

16
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,701
Si Woo. We have a very special guest...

17
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,001
- coming over to our house today. - Yes.

18
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,272
- Okay? - Surprise!

19
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:51,071
- Surprise. - We'll have a special guest.

20
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,572
Surprise.

21
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:53,841
I thought I was watching...

22
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:54,842
- a foreign drama. - Right.

23
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,381
- Like watching an American series. - We always get that feeling.

24
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,882
This person is a VIP to me for many reasons.

25
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,251
A very important person.

26
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:04,951
- Yes. - So we're going to decorate...

27
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:06,521
- Yes. - to welcome her.

28
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:07,691
- Yes. - Okay?

29
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,262
- Yes. - Yes.

30
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,192
Goodness.

31
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:15,162
Goodness.

32
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,061
She says "goodness" even in that situation.

33
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,561
She didn't say it in Korean.

34
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,101
I use swear words first...

35
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:21,272
- in that situation. - Right.

36
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,702
Darn it. Like this.

37
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,712
Goodness.

38
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:28,072
Goodness.

39
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,282
- He was shocked. - Goodness.

40
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:34,411
I'm so sorry.

41
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:36,821
- Are you okay? - "I'm so sorry."

42
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,781
You must have been surprised. I'm so sorry.

43
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:40,491
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

44
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,052
That startled me.

45
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,591
Who is coming as the guest?

46
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,462
They're decorating the house to welcome the guest.

47
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:52,031
Who would it be? The guest is here.

48
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,232
My role model.

49
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:54,872
- Role model? - Role model?

50
00:01:55,102 --> 00:01:56,641
- Who is it? - She's here.

51
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:57,871
Who is it?

52
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,771
- Hold this. - They prepared flowers too.

53
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:01,772
- Gosh. - Who is it?

54
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,581
- The guest is tall. - Yes.

55
00:02:07,582 --> 00:02:09,651
- The person looks graceful. - You can see the back.

56
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,651
- Hi, June. - She's wearing a shawl.

57
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,891
- Goodness. - My gosh.

58
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:16,461
- Goodness. - My goodness.

59
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:19,062
- Come in. - Welcome.

60
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,862
- Your hands are full. - Goodness.

61
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,062
Hi.

62
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,871
- You look fantastic. - Thank you. You too.

63
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,171
- You look gorgeous. - Thank you.

64
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:29,471
It's like I'm watching...

65
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,472
- "Gossip Girls." - Go inside.

66
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:33,942
Hello. I'm June Kang.

67
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,782
The winner of Miss Korea Canada.

68
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:43,081
- The wedding of the beautiful... - It's really...

69
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:44,281
and loving couple...

70
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:47,622
- I don't open my heart so easily. - Goodness.

71
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:49,362
Stop the crazy talk.

72
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,292
Stop the crazy talk.

73
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:53,062
That's amazing.

74
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,761
- They're so funny. - An elegant charisma.

75
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,631
- An elegant charisma. Right. - I love it.

76
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:58,631
- She's the true girl crush. - That's right.

77
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:00,231
But she's also cute.

78
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:01,232
That's right.

79
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,472
- Whose money is it? - Mine.

80
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:04,802
- What? - My money.

81
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,471
Yours is mine,

82
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:08,512
and mine is mine. That's it.

83
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:12,082
Yours is mine, and mine is mine. That's it.

84
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,822
Their two sons are grown up now.

85
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:22,591
- Right. - They've grown up.

86
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:23,592
That's right.

87
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,632
Hye Rim is like...

88
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:30,302
a daughter I never had.

89
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,031
Years before,

90
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,931
when I published a book,

91
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,472
Hye Rim waited...

92
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:39,171
more than an hour...

93
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:41,511
to get the book signed.

94
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,842
- She can't help but like you. - That's right.

95
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:47,852
That was the first time we met.

96
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:52,792
There was a baby who left in between Yoo Seung and Yoo Jin.

97
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,551
We had even named her.

98
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:55,821
- She was Yoo In. - I know.

99
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,422
I've always wanted a daughter.

100
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,162
- That... - Some years ago.

101
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,701
- I... - They only have two sons.

102
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,062
- They don't have a daughter. - Yes.

103
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:08,002
You even signed a family certificate.

104
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,371
Goodness.

105
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:10,872
That was when I got pregnant with Si Woo.

106
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:12,302
Yes.

107
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,211
My family...

108
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,841
- is in Hong Kong. - Yes.

109
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,142
My mother can't visit Korea so often.

110
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,211
June was like my mother...

111
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,521
- A mother. - in Korea.

112
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,251
She took care of me really well.

113
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,292
Goodness.

114
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,721
- Say it. - Hi. Goodness.

115
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:30,521
Say "welcome."

116
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:32,022
Goodness.

117
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,661
Si An too.

118
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:34,861
- Si Woo... - Goodness.

119
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:36,331
- Welcome. - was waiting for you.

120
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,831
- Goodness. - Welcome.

121
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:39,532
Thank you.

122
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,432
Give it to her.

123
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,171
He knelt down. That's so cute.

124
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:45,141
It's the same "thank you," but it sounds different.

125
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,942
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

126
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,211
Goodness.

127
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:50,442
Oh, my gosh.

128
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,882
How cute.

129
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:55,181
- Mom, first... - It's your grandson.

130
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:56,182
- Come in. - I mean...

131
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,922
- When he was a newborn. - That was the last time we met.

132
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:00,552
Grandma.

133
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,921
The last time she saw Si Woo was when he was about Si An's size.

134
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:06,461
It's her first time seeing Si Woo this grown.

135
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:08,632
- Right. - She only saw him on social media.

136
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,002
You're welcome.

137
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:12,901
Goodness.

138
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,131
She would be so glad to see him.

139
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,831
How cute.

140
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,041
Ttaengkong.

141
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,101
Ttaengkong?

142
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,611
She felt like crying.

143
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,842
- She would feel so. - Si An.

144
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,441
How are you so cute?

145
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,111
- This is fancy. - I got them...

146
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,412
- from the dessert shop you like. - Goodness.

147
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:31,482
- It's sour. - Si Woo is also...

148
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,252
Dad goes to the taekwondo studio.

149
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:38,691
Look at your hands. How cute.

150
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,262
So cute.

151
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:43,661
You might like...

152
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,901
- this lemon cake. - What's this?

153
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,001
- Do you want to try? - Yes.

154
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:48,331
Lemon cake.

155
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,572
- Do you want to try? - Yes.

156
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,102
Lemon cake.

157
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,172
Dad is being left out.

158
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,412
You should have sent him on an errand.

159
00:05:57,882 --> 00:05:59,041
- Do you want to try? - Yes.

160
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:00,551
Lemon cake.

161
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:01,651
Grandma...

162
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,582
Okay. Try it. Lemon cake.

163
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:05,922
- Try it. - How does it taste?

164
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:08,921
- It tastes good. - It tastes good?

165
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,122
- "It tastes good." - Tasty?

166
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,621
How cute.

167
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,661
Is it cute?

168
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:15,162
What kind of cake is this?

169
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,901
- Chocolate. - Chocolate.

170
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,801
What kind of drink is this?

171
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:21,301
- Strawberry. - Right.

172
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,702
- Strawberry. - Right.

173
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,942
So cute. "Strawberry."

174
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,111
- Strawberry? - She adored him.

175
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:28,212
What is this?

176
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,081
- Coffee. - Coffee.

177
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,181
How is his pronunciation so good?

178
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,152
I want to teach him English,

179
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,451
so when I'm with Si Woo...

180
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,481
at home,

181
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,921
- I talk to him in English. - You talk to him in English.

182
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:41,352
I think that's right.

183
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,622
When one parent speaks one language...

184
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,361
and the other parent speaks another language...

185
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:48,392
when children are young,

186
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,832
they say they get...

187
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,831
- Right. - less confused about language.

188
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:52,901
- It's rather like that. - Really?

189
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:56,502
She's agreeing with your way of education more than anyone.

190
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:59,401
So Min Cheol can speak only in Korean,

191
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:02,841
and Hye Rim can speak only in English. If you focus on that...

192
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:05,381
But Min Cheol can't speak English anyway.

193
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:07,481
He can't speak both languages.

194
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,521
One person, one language.

195
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,281
- Yes. - We decided to use...

196
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:13,092
- That's nice. - the language we're good at.

197
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,251
- This. - "The Brown Bear?"

198
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:15,721
- Si Woo is reading a book. - Really? You're going to read...

199
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,091
"The Brown Bear" for your brother?

200
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:19,692
Red bird, red bird,

201
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,261
what do you see?

202
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,461
I see a wild dog...

203
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:27,602
looking at us.

204
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,902
- Ms. Woo. - Yes.

205
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,442
If I could get a chance,

206
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,371
I'd like to get some classes...

207
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,781
- at your house. - I know.

208
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,011
Did you buy this, Grandma?

209
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:40,351
- Shin Si Woo. - Grandma.

210
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:43,281
Did you buy this, Grandma?

211
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,481
She's too young to be a grandma.

212
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:46,491
- Hold on. - Right.

213
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,452
- She's not yet a grandma. - This is shocking for us as well.

214
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,822
Grandma.

215
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,262
Thank you, Grandma.

216
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:54,892
It's the first time someone called me like that.

217
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:57,501
I felt very awkward.

218
00:07:57,502 --> 00:08:00,072
When he first called me "Grandma," I thought,

219
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,101
"There are no other grandmas in this room."

220
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:04,572
- "It must be me." - My goodness.

221
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:07,272
She is very flustered.

222
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:11,081
It was the first time I ever heard someone call me...

223
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,141
"Grandma."

224
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,252
So I felt very awkward at first.

225
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,951
Did you buy this, Grandma?

226
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,021
- Gosh. - Right.

227
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:20,422
- Did you bring them? - He knows they're his.

228
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,051
- Right. - Did you bring them?

229
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,762
- He knows they're his. - Right.

230
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:26,891
- It's your birthday, Si Woo. - It's your birthday, Si Woo.

231
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:28,332
Bring them, Si Woo.

232
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:31,002
I can lift this.

233
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,361
Gifts for him.

234
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:34,532
- Isn't it heavy? - She brought Si Woo gifts?

235
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,302
- It's heavy. - It's heavy.

236
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:37,572
It's heavy.

237
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,011
- Let's see. - What would it be?

238
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,741
- The gift is really big. - It's big.

239
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,842
- What's that? - It's so big.

240
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,411
- Tyrannosaurus. - Robot tyrannosaurus.

241
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:48,612
Robot.

242
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:50,652
Shall we get it out, Dad?

243
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,281
- Shall we get it out? - Shall we get it out?

244
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,322
Here.

245
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,152
"Shall we get it out, Dad?"

246
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,762
How are you feeling, Si Woo?

247
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:59,122
- Happy. - Happy.

248
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,432
- Happy. - Happy. Goodness.

249
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:02,761
- Thank you. - Thank you, June.

250
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:04,962
- You're welcome. - Go and give her a hug.

251
00:09:05,062 --> 00:09:06,162
Thank you.

252
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,602
- Kisses. - Goodness.

253
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,341
- Kisses. - Goodness.

254
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,841
How cute.

255
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,441
- He's so cute. - Look at her reactions.

256
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:14,911
- She looks touched. - She adores him.

257
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:15,912
Right.

258
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,681
She's looking at him like her own grandson.

259
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,712
That's right.

260
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,311
- She... - Goodness.

261
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:21,852
- even brought Si An's clothes. - Goodness.

262
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,822
- What is that? - I heard...

263
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,051
- you gave birth to Si An... - What is it?

264
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:28,091
in December.

265
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,291
I bought this, and I wanted...

266
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,362
- to give it to you right away. - What is it?

267
00:09:31,592 --> 00:09:33,891
- But the day kept being pushed, - Right.

268
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:36,302
so I couldn't give it to you because we couldn't meet.

269
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:39,002
She always knows what I need very well.

270
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:42,632
She gives me what I need as a gift.

271
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:45,201
This cloth...

272
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,811
- He's so cute. - is the one you bought...

273
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,741
when Si Woo was a baby.

274
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:49,842
That's right.

275
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:51,781
Si An is wearing the clothes...

276
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,181
- that she bought for Si Woo. - How cute.

277
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,381
You use these clothes very well...

278
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:58,282
when you have a baby.

279
00:09:58,382 --> 00:09:59,521
That's right.

280
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,622
It's the most convenient.

281
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,591
- She bought this as well. - This too...

282
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,462
The clothes Si Woo is wearing now...

283
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,261
- was given by June. - You can still wear it.

284
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,091
- Really? - That's so nice.

285
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,402
You're stylish.

286
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,101
Thank you, Grandma.

287
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,731
- Right. - Good.

288
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:15,832
You're welcome.

289
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:18,502
- Goodness. - Hello.

290
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,671
You do this like this.

291
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:23,312
- So it doesn't get wet. - Okay.

292
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,482
He's not taking his eyes off of Mom.

293
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:32,021
Mom is here.

294
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,452
Why is Mom there?

295
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,921
It's only recent...

296
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,162
that he started looking into the eyes.

297
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,261
He recently started focusing on people.

298
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:40,292
Look at this, Hye Rim.

299
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,532
- He's drinking so fast. - He was hungry.

300
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:45,532
While feeding Si An now,

301
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:50,002
I realize it's the first time I'm feeding a baby...

302
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,741
- in a long while. - Wasn't Si Woo the last one?

303
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:53,871
The time I fed Si Woo was the last time.

304
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,341
- That's right. - Si Woo was the last.

305
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,541
Her children are all grown.

306
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,211
- She bathed him too. - Bathing as well.

307
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,542
She bathed Si Woo.

308
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:01,611
- That time. - Right.

309
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,011
That also feels like not so long ago.

310
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,352
It really is a special connection.

311
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:06,652
Can you believe that?

312
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,152
How did time pass like this?

313
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:13,991
This is so... What's unfortunate...

314
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:16,131
is that Min Soo should have been here too.

315
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:17,461
I think...

316
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:21,201
he would have wanted to see the babies more.

317
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,772
Since we've become old,

318
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,902
we've gotten more interested in babies.

319
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,541
- Goodness. - I think we'd be able...

320
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,072
to raise them better now.

321
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,481
I want to see Min Soo take care of children.

322
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:33,511
- Really. - That's right.

323
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:34,611
How would he take care of them?

324
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,282
He would come on a motorcycle.

325
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:43,091
Goodness. They're comfortable.

326
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,192
- Goodness. - She's different.

327
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,691
- It was the same with Si Woo. - The baby smell.

328
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:49,032
The baby smell is really...

329
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,461
This moment passes by so quickly.

330
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,561
- That's right. - It just goes by quickly.

331
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,901
- Right. It goes by so quickly. - That's right.

332
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:54,902
Right.

333
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,102
So...

334
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,372
- Something came. - He burped.

335
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,411
- Hold on. - Did he?

336
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:03,441
It came out a bit.

337
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,241
- He vomited. - He vomited.

338
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:06,751
- He burped earlier. - The milk came out.

339
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,782
- It's okay. - They vomit sometimes.

340
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:10,221
He usually doesn't vomit so much,

341
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,422
but that day...

342
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:13,792
So sweet.

343
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,061
- Goodness. - How cute.

344
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,092
It's okay.

345
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:20,832
Si Woo...

346
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,201
prepared a special performance...

347
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,461
- for Grandma June. - My.

348
00:12:25,462 --> 00:12:27,431
I really want to see it.

349
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:28,971
- Si Woo prepared it, right? - Si Woo?

350
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,001
- I'll be back. - Okay.

351
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,741
- Let's go. - Let's go.

352
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:33,742
- Goodness. - Let's go.

353
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:37,181
- At home? - Amazing.

354
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:38,481
- Can you show how you break it... - Goodness.

355
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:39,682
to Grandma June?

356
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:42,851
- Look at his eyes. - The glare.

357
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:44,582
- How... - Gather your energy.

358
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:47,892
- Shout. - I love you, Ttaengkong.

359
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,192
I love you, Ttaengkong.

360
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,732
I love you, Ttaengkong.

361
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,702
Welcome, Grandma June.

362
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:00,172
Goodness.

363
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:01,602
Here!

364
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:12,312
Si Woo.

365
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:13,881
- Can you do it? - Yes!

366
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,011
- Can you do it? - Yes.

367
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:16,052
Go.

368
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:17,782
- No way. - Can you do it?

369
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,652
I found that really amazing.

370
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,591
That looks really difficult.

371
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:24,762
Look at that.

372
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,002
It's the last one.

373
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,532
- He put it in his mouth. - It's on his mouth.

374
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:47,382
Let's do it one more time.

375
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,252
He has showmanship.

376
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:53,852
Salute to Grandma June!

377
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:01,161
That's so cool.

378
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:05,262
Since you presented a great performance for me,

379
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:09,731
I will make delicious food for you. Would you like that?

380
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,741
Yes.

381
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:11,941
- A bit... - She cooks well.

382
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:13,942
- She cooks really well. - That's interesting.

383
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,072
- I know. - She's so awesome.

384
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,511
That's really interesting.

385
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:17,941
- She made all that at home? - That's right.

386
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:19,042
She made gnocchi too.

387
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:21,952
It was like an Italian restaurant.

388
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,752
There's meat between the bones.

389
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:28,592
- That's so delicious. - Is that a turkey?

390
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,192
What? That was made at home?

391
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:31,721
It's like...

392
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,761
- a Michelin-starred restaurant. - Right.

393
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,591
They're dishes you see from such restaurants.

394
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,132
That's right.

395
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:45,901
- What? - What?

396
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,741
In the soup. Just a little bit.

397
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:48,842
Cooking...

398
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,912
I don't really...

399
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:52,411
I'm bad at cooking.

400
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:53,711
I can't cook.

401
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,652
- You seem like a human now. - Seriously.

402
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:58,381
You seem like a human now.

403
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,421
There are three men in the house now.

404
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:02,251
- That's right. - So I have to cook.

405
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,491
- Right. - It would be on your mind.

406
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,021
Right. I need to cook meat too.

407
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:06,392
- Yes. - They're children...

408
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,491
- who are growing. - Right.

409
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,131
I wanted to learn how to cook using this great chance.

410
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,961
- You can get the recipes. - I can get the recipes.

411
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:13,972
Right.

412
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:19,272
You're not going to learn how to make all those, right?

413
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,111
I've never liked cooking,

414
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,441
and I've never cooked.

415
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:24,841
I've always had food that was cooked by others.

416
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,751
These are easy to eat.

417
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:28,652
Even if there are leftovers,

418
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:31,181
you can eat them again...

419
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,581
tomorrow or the day after.

420
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,251
They've all become big now.

421
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,792
I go grocery shopping every week.

422
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:39,262
- Every week. - Every week.

423
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,461
- So... - Do you go out...

424
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:41,591
to do the grocery shopping...

425
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,891
- I go out myself. - or do you do it online?

426
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,431
- I do it myself. - My family...

427
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:45,901
- also has three men. - That's right.

428
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,071
That was a great tip for me.

429
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,072
Right.

430
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,602
Minced beef.

431
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:53,642
You will use this a lot.

432
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:55,071
She brought a lot.

433
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,142
It's cheaper...

434
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:58,681
- She buys a lot. - when you buy a lot.

435
00:15:58,682 --> 00:15:59,712
She bought 2kg.

436
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:03,451
You can put...

437
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:05,782
this much minced beef,

438
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,791
- and it would be reasonable. - She's dividing them.

439
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:13,592
Press it a bit like this to shape it.

440
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:14,891
It would be great...

441
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,902
if you could store it in the freezer.

442
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,102
I bought these last time,

443
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,541
but I didn't know what to make.

444
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,571
That's right.

445
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:27,211
You can add a bit of soy sauce,

446
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:30,082
crushed garlic, and sesame oil...

447
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,312
to make Hamburg steak.

448
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,812
You can make the patty.

449
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,951
- Hamburg... - She's teaching you well...

450
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,482
- like a mother. - Right.

451
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:43,291
You don't need to buy meat for soup.

452
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,391
You can use it when making doenjang jjigae...

453
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,591
or soft tofu jjigae.

454
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:51,062
You can add a bit of this in the spicy soup.

455
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:52,501
In seaweed soup.

456
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:53,901
I can put it in soups.

457
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:56,501
You can put meat in all kinds of dishes,

458
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,741
and it will add flavor.

459
00:16:58,742 --> 00:16:59,742
Yes.
Steak.

460
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,212
- But the steak... - Steak.

461
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,582
You definitely need this.

462
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:06,851
- You will love this seasoning. - What is it?

463
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:08,912
This is very famous.

464
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,591
I knew this since I was in high school.

465
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,122
You barbecue a lot in Canada.

466
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:19,392
You can use it on chicken, fish,

467
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:21,432
but particularly on steak.

468
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:24,032
The steak becomes really delicious.

469
00:17:24,562 --> 00:17:26,531
- So this is really... - I'm so curious.

470
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,772
So you can...

471
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,072
season it like this.

472
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,642
If you don't eat the whole steak,

473
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,041
- you can... - You cover it 1 by 1.

474
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,881
- One by one. - She divides it...

475
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,011
- after seasoning the steak. - We can put two here.

476
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,882
Like this. Two here.

477
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:46,221
- Then... - You stick it.

478
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:49,792
Do it like this, and when you peel it,

479
00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:53,491
you can cut this part with scissors and use it.

480
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:54,492
Do you put this in the freezer?

481
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:55,761
- In the freezer. - She's a master...

482
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,431
- in dividing food. - If I don't use it.

483
00:17:57,432 --> 00:17:59,461
How did you learn how to make Korean food?

484
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,372
I lived and learned.

485
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,501
- I lived and learned. - She was an overseas Korean.

486
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:04,601
Honestly speaking...

487
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:08,641
it felt like what I had always dreamed of.

488
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:10,582
- The married life of your dreams. - The married life.

489
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:13,551
When I heard the story of his life,

490
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:17,022
it wasn't all that happy.

491
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,091
But even though his life wasn't all that happy,

492
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:24,622
he treated me so warmly.

493
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:27,032
He was really warm to me.

494
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,092
I only suffered because of food.

495
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:31,262
When he rests at home,

496
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:33,062
he eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

497
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:37,041
- All day long. - Three meals.

498
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,601
It wouldn't have been easy to cook three meals a day.

499
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:40,842
- Of course. - I met...

500
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,542
someone who wanted to eat all the three meals.

501
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:47,151
I thought I was someone who sinned.

502
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:48,882
I thought...

503
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:52,251
I was living this life...

504
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:53,751
- My goodness. - to pay for my sins.

505
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:55,251
Does the menu have to be different?

506
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:59,492
You have to get out the side dishes again.

507
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,031
- He doesn't eat them. - The side dishes he ate earlier.

508
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,231
He doesn't eat what he ate before.

509
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:06,261
I lived 30 years...

510
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,831
- in such pain. - In pain.

511
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,402
- That's what happened. - It's still happening.

512
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:10,742
She's been living in pain.

513
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,072
It seems you can relate to that.

514
00:19:12,742 --> 00:19:14,341
I guess you have to cook three meals a day too.

515
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,112
- Actually, my husband cooks for me. - I see.

516
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:19,341
He's good at cooking pasta and so on.

517
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,511
- Your husband can cook? - Yes.

518
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:22,051
My husband and my child love noodles.

519
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,312
- But personally, - I see.

520
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:26,021
- I don't love noodles. - Okay.

521
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:28,791
But as he's the one cooking for us, he has the upper hand.

522
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,222
I tell him it tastes great.

523
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:34,292
First off, you can add that to this plate little by little.

524
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:37,032
- Yes. - She's going to make a salad first.

525
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:41,501
- Yes. - Like this?

526
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:42,531
Yes.

527
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,642
Like this?

528
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:45,772
What happened?

529
00:19:45,872 --> 00:19:46,872
Like this?

530
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:50,311
- Yes. And make it look pretty. - Yes, make it look pretty.

531
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:51,882
You're not throwing them out.

532
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:53,412
"You're not throwing them out."

533
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,811
- She's so witty. - I see.

534
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:59,882
I wanted to be quick. I wanted to help her fast.

535
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:02,691
- We need to slice the bread too. - Yes.

536
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:03,692
Okay.

537
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,392
- The baguette. - Yes.

538
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:08,291
There's no trick to slicing the baguette. You just slice it.

539
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,732
- With the bread knife, right? - Yes.

540
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,001
- It was harder than I thought. - Yes.

541
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,002
With the bread knife.

542
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,141
You can't use it like a regular knife.

543
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:19,602
- You use it like a saw. - It's like sawing.

544
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:23,571
It's harder than it looks. It looked easy. But when I tried...

545
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:24,681
Right? It's not...

546
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,112
- Maybe, it's because it's hard. - It's not easy.

547
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:30,952
- Anyway, you did slice it. - Well done. Yes.

548
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,321
Now, we're going to season it.

549
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,321
So we have garlic.

550
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,522
- Add minced garlic to the bowl. - Okay.

551
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:42,632
So generously sprinkle oregano like this.

552
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,401
- My gosh. - Gosh, that's...

553
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:45,601
It's like the cherry on top.

554
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,772
- It's bound to be tasty. - She added it halfway through.

555
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:50,872
I see. You add water to your rice.

556
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,771
- This is... - If it's too hot...

557
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:55,812
- Ice cubes? What is this? - Yes.

558
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:59,442
He's having rice with ice?

559
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,721
- Si Woo, could you mix this for me? - Yes.

560
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,021
Use this spoon.

561
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:08,022
Yes.

562
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:09,821
Having that by itself must taste good too.

563
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:11,091
- Mix them. - That by itself must taste good.

564
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:14,291
Si Woo, would you like to taste the marinated tomatoes?

565
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,292
- Yes. - Okay.

566
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:17,331
- Si Woo is the assistant. - I should make it too.

567
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:18,332
How is it?

568
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,062
- I bet Si Woo loves that. - Is it good?

569
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:21,472
- Do you like it? - Yes.

570
00:21:33,852 --> 00:21:36,782
We're going to make pasta bake.

571
00:21:37,052 --> 00:21:38,421
- Pasta bake. - And then you just...

572
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,622
fry the onions.

573
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:41,152
I'm going to put this...

574
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,322
- All of it. - Yes. I'm going to put it in.

575
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,121
Then grab the tomato sauce. Okay?

576
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:47,392
Add the whole jar of it to the pan.

577
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:50,661
- Gosh, that looks so good. - Now, the sauce is ready. Right?

578
00:21:50,662 --> 00:21:54,401
This is just the basic tomato sauce.

579
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:57,202
- That must be tasty by itself. - This looks so good. So hungry.

580
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:00,071
- We'll add the pasta to the sauce. - Yes.

581
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:03,171
Make sure the pasta is thoroughly coated in the sauce.

582
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,281
That's the important part. Right?

583
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,411
- Now, put it in the oven. - So it absorbs the sauce.

584
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,951
We can just eat it as it is.

585
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,012
- But we baked it in the oven. - Put it in the oven.

586
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,051
- Ta-da. It's ready. - My gosh.

587
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:14,751
- That will improve the texture. - Oh, my.

588
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:16,422
- Yes. - People say it melts in your mouth.

589
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:18,721
Here's what you do.

590
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:20,221
- How do I store it? - So here it is.

591
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,461
Portion how much you want to eat for a meal.

592
00:22:22,462 --> 00:22:24,902
- I see. Put it in small containers. - Cut it like this.

593
00:22:25,032 --> 00:22:27,902
You can store it in containers and freeze it.

594
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:30,501
When you want to eat it, thaw it.

595
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:33,201
- I see. - Then microwave it briefly.

596
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:34,241
- So... - I'll try that out right away.

597
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:36,011
- I see. We can freeze it. - The pasta noodles...

598
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:37,812
- won't get soggy. - She's a great cook.

599
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:41,481
So this seasoning has some salt.

600
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:43,452
It will be slightly salty.

601
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,322
Now,

602
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:48,652
place the steak in the pan.

603
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,692
It's thoroughly seasoned.

604
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:55,332
It looks tasty.

605
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:57,402
It was so good.

606
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,632
- Here's how you grill steak. - Okay.

607
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:03,702
So the steak...

608
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:04,901
It would be burned on the surface,

609
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:08,012
- but it'd be cold in the middle. - That's not good. That's why...

610
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,711
you must thaw the meat...

611
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:12,811
with ample time at room temperature.

612
00:23:12,812 --> 00:23:15,712
So the heat can reach the inside of the meat.

613
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:18,681
Quickly sear the surface.

614
00:23:18,682 --> 00:23:21,822
Press on the meat gently like this.

615
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:24,562
It'd be great if you can get these grill marks.

616
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:27,961
She taught you the basic technique of grilling steak.

617
00:23:27,962 --> 00:23:29,831
Yes. She was very thorough...

618
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:30,862
- when she showed me how to do it. - She was thorough.

619
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:33,601
- So here's the thing about butter. - Yes.

620
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:36,071
You add the butter halfway through when cooking steak.

621
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,241
Not from the start?

622
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:38,671
- No, not from the start. - My gosh.

623
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,711
- You know, that's... - That's the icing on the cake.

624
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,011
- It's bound to taste good. - She added it halfway through.

625
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:46,242
The melted butter and the meat juice...

626
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,651
create a tasty sauce.

627
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,051
- My gosh, she's so good. - Oh, my.

628
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,822
- That's such a useful tip. - Yes.

629
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:54,251
- I was quite surprised just now. - Yes.

630
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:56,091
- I've been swallowing saliva. - My gosh.

631
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:57,891
- Really? So you like meat. - Yes.

632
00:23:57,892 --> 00:23:59,962
- I'm quite flustered by this. - Oh, my.

633
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:02,031
- I kept salivating. - You wanted to have some too.

634
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,362
You loved having only rice.

635
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:06,061
But while watching this clip,

636
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,971
- You really wanted to try some. - it made me want to try cooking it.

637
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:10,001
- Right. - Yes.

638
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:12,301
It's interesting how I ended up thinking that.

639
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:13,841
I really want to have one bite. Seriously.

640
00:24:13,842 --> 00:24:15,012
I bet it's really good.

641
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:19,012
Right here. I'll put the steak on the cutting board.

642
00:24:19,142 --> 00:24:21,411
- Use the silver foil. - My gosh.

643
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:23,181
- With that, - Gently cover it.

644
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:25,281
- I want to eat it now. - the steak will melt in your mouth.

645
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:26,651
- Seriously. It was so good. - Yes.

646
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,522
- The steak will still be so juicy. - Yes.

647
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:32,991
- The inside will be cooked nicely. - It looks like restaurant food.

648
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,392
- It will taste good. - Right.

649
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:42,471
Is basil good?

650
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:43,472
- Is it good? - Yes.

651
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,241
- He's eating basil. - Is it very good?

652
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,771
Like this. I can put it in the bread.

653
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:50,011
He put it in the bread.

654
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:51,181
He's cooking right now.

655
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,281
- Oh, my. - Really?

656
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,341
- See? - Oh, my.

657
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:54,481
- Inside the baguette? - Yes.

658
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:56,612
- He made it himself and ate it. - My gosh.

659
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:59,382
Like this. I can put it in the bread.

660
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:01,492
He put it in the bread.

661
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:05,592
Hye Rim, he wants to try having new food.

662
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,791
He's trying out a new dish.

663
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,861
- Look. - My gosh.

664
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:11,102
He's having the baguette with basil.

665
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,501
- My gosh. - Seriously.

666
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:16,071
I can tell just by looking at it that it's juicy.

667
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:17,572
Look at the color.

668
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,211
- How is this possible? - Seriously.

669
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:25,312
- That came out of the oven. - Is that her recipe?

670
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:30,921
Unbelievable. She put together a meal...

671
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:31,951
- so fast. - This is impressive.

672
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:34,221
Come and eat.

673
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:35,222
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

674
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:38,791
I couldn't believe my kitchen could cook such fancy dishes.

675
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:39,821
They look like they came...

676
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,262
- from a fine dining restaurant. - Right.

677
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,002
- My gosh. - It made me reflect on my cooking.

678
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,171
- My gosh. - It was like an Italian restaurant.

679
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:53,302
Your dining table is full of tasty dishes with June's help.

680
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:55,471
- Min Cheol. - What's this?

681
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,071
- Ta-da. - We cooked it together.

682
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:59,212
We cooked this meal together, didn't we?

683
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:00,811
- Gosh, look at this. - Already...

684
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:01,812
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

685
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,751
- Look at his reaction. - He's genuinely impressed.

686
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:05,182
"My gosh."

687
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:07,492
- We cooked it. - Gosh, unbelievable. This is...

688
00:26:08,392 --> 00:26:09,821
I've never seen him react like this.

689
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:11,421
Really?

690
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:12,992
He's genuinely happy.

691
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,931
He still talks about how great the meal was.

692
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,091
- Right. - I bet it's good.

693
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:17,462
Did you learn how to make all of these dishes?

694
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:20,361
- Well, sure. - Oh, my.

695
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:22,102
- She's a perfect wife. - This too.

696
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:24,572
If she were to cook like this every day,

697
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,202
she couldn't be more perfect.

698
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:27,871
- She couldn't be more perfect. - Do you agree or not, Si Woo?

699
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:29,041
- Right. - Right?

700
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,641
The reaction from her son and her husband...

701
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:32,942
is very different from the time she cooked for them.

702
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,352
I think it's really different.

703
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,511
- Gosh. Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

704
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,221
- Yes. I hope you enjoy it. - Si Woo.

705
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,421
Enjoy your meal.

706
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,752
My gosh. You're just so cute!

707
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:44,161
Oh, my gosh.

708
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:46,562
I'm going to gobble him up.

709
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,561
- Oh, my gosh. - He's the sweetest.

710
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:51,662
So cute.

711
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,632
Can I have this with my hands?

712
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:55,501
- He's having garlic bread. - Yes, you can have it.

713
00:26:55,502 --> 00:26:56,572
- Look at Si Woo. - Yes.

714
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,072
He loved it.

715
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:03,112
He's definitely enjoying it.

716
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:07,681
My gosh.

717
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:08,852
He's enjoying his meal a lot.

718
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:14,292
Hye Rim is enjoying it too.

719
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,521
- My gosh. - This is amazing.

720
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:21,161
- It's so good. - It was really good.

721
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:22,662
I'm already enjoying this.

722
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:26,531
- When you really like the food... - Gosh, he's being so real.

723
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:28,372
- You're speechless. - you stop talking.

724
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:30,532
- Right. - You just focus on eating.

725
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:31,702
It's like having a meal...

726
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:33,071
at a restaurant with five Michelin stars.

727
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:34,471
- My gosh. - That's true.

728
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:36,212
- My gosh. - It's called June's Restaurant.

729
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:39,541
- How did she grill this steak? - Yes.

730
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,951
She just grilled it on the frying pan.

731
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,352
Really? The pan?

732
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:45,251
But how could it be so perfect?

733
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:46,252
Right?

734
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,791
- You must learn a lot from her. - Yes.

735
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,632
I cooked the same meal the next day.

736
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,731
- He liked it. - She had bought the ingredients.

737
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:00,772
With the leftover ingredients. And he liked it.

738
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:04,572
I'm very curious how your husband is doing.

739
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:07,641
- Actually, after all these years, - Yes.

740
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:10,012
I finally feel like we've become one now.

741
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:13,282
But here's the truth.

742
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:16,581
A lot of people ask me if I would marry my husband...

743
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,051
in my next life...

744
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,752
- I'm curious about your answer. - when I'm on TV.

745
00:28:19,822 --> 00:28:22,121
- You've been together for 30 years. - Yes.

746
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:25,021
When they ask me if I would marry him again,

747
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,162
I say...

748
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,361
I would marry him again 1,000 percent.

749
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:30,732
- Even in her next life. - My gosh.

750
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:32,431
- Why? - June...

751
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:34,502
- Why would you ask that? - Why?

752
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:38,872
Marrying a different guy in my next life?

753
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,012
That's a nightmare I don't know about.

754
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,011
I'm living with a nightmare now.

755
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,242
But it's a nightmare I know.

756
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,081
Instead of marrying a nightmare you don't know, it's better...

757
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:48,681
- to marry the one you know. - I thought...

758
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:49,912
- I thought it was because... - I see.

759
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:52,621
- That's a great analogy. - Totally.

760
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:54,421
- She'd put up with a nightmare... - Right.

761
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,821
- she knows, not the unknown one. - That'd be better.

762
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,561
What about you three? Would you marry your spouse again?

763
00:28:58,562 --> 00:29:00,491
- Well, my parents-in-law... - What about you, Ji Woo?

764
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:03,091
- are huge fans of our show. Yes. - Yes.

765
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:04,362
Of course, I will marry him again.

766
00:29:04,562 --> 00:29:07,062
- I met my beautiful daughter too. - Yes.

767
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:10,102
My husband and I are eight years apart.

768
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:14,142
In the beginning of our marriage, I struggled so much.

769
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:16,312
"Since we're eight years apart,"

770
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,342
"he'll pass away first."

771
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,611
"Later on,"

772
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:22,051
"when I grow old,"

773
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,781
"I'll be able to lead a fun life."

774
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:24,922
"I'll be able to do that as an old woman."

775
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,692
I thought I heard her wrong at first.

776
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,752
My wife and I are five years apart.

777
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,322
The age gap is greater between me and my wife.

778
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:34,761
Seriously.

779
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:36,591
- That's right. - Don't complain in front of me.

780
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:38,402
- It's sad. - Even as I laughed, I thought,

781
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:40,972
"Hold on a second. Should I be laughing about this?"

782
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:43,401
She can say such things...

783
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:44,871
because they're a loving couple.

784
00:29:44,872 --> 00:29:45,972
- That's right. - Yes.

785
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,471
Married life in Korea...

786
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:50,411
- couldn't have been easy. - That's right.

787
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,711
Nevertheless, the entire nation knows...

788
00:29:52,712 --> 00:29:53,781
- that the two of them... - That's right.

789
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,011
- are lovebirds. - You know,

790
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:56,882
it's an old story.

791
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:00,151
Yu Seong asked me this...

792
00:30:00,152 --> 00:30:02,522
when he was in fifth grade.

793
00:30:02,892 --> 00:30:05,021
"Mom, what's depression?"

794
00:30:05,022 --> 00:30:06,262
He asked me that.

795
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:08,831
I answered, "Why would you ask me that?"

796
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:11,732
"It has nothing to do with you. Don't ask me."

797
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:14,372
I said that, but I was wrong.

798
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,132
He asked me that question...

799
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,541
- since he had felt something. - That's right.

800
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:23,211
But I missed that moment as a parent.

801
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:24,912
I feel so bad about it.

802
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:31,222
Her heart must've ached a lot.

803
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:35,822
Living as a celebrity...

804
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:39,192
must've put him under a lot of pressure.

805
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,771
He struggled with depression,

806
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:50,771
panic disorder,

807
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:52,372
and anxiety.

808
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:55,242
They didn't come with labels.

809
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:59,142
They were a part of his psyche.

810
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:00,682
But we didn't know that.

811
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:03,782
When I look back on it now...

812
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:06,821
You'll experience everything you worry about...

813
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,421
as a parent in the future.

814
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:10,621
You'll see once your children enter the school.

815
00:31:10,622 --> 00:31:13,122
She always gives us...

816
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,331
- words of advice. - That's right.

817
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,891
We weren't even aware of the passing time.

818
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,862
- She's a respectable elder. - Yes.

819
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,001
Today,

820
00:31:21,002 --> 00:31:25,672
I visited Hye Rim for the first time...

821
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:29,241
after the birth of the second child.

822
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:33,342
The moment I entered the house,

823
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:37,011
I had to fight back the tears.

824
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:39,752
I saw Hye Rim when she was a college student.

825
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:42,552
She already became a mother of two children.

826
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:48,062
Si Woo has so much energy.

827
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,232
He's so happy.

828
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:54,702
Spending time with him made me very cheerful.

829
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:56,901
Please visit again.

830
00:31:56,902 --> 00:31:57,902
- Yes. - Yes.

831
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,841
- Please visit with Choi Min Soo. - Yes.

832
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,272
Please make it happen.

833
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:02,942
Please cook.

834
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,382
I'm hungry.

835
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:11,252
- Look. There's food everywhere. - Where are they?

836
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:14,422
There are so many vegetables.

837
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,131
Shabu shabu is nice.

838
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:24,232
It's nice.

839
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:30,031
- You can add rice at the end. - Yes.

840
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,242
- It's hearty. - You can eat a lot of vegetables.

841
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:35,472
Chef Jung Ji Sun told me...

842
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:37,672
that his son ate...

843
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,311
- malatang... - That's right. Malatang.

844
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,511
- at the age of five. - That's right.

845
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:43,352
My son ate malatang at the age of five.

846
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,152
- The dish with the red soup? - Yes.

847
00:32:47,622 --> 00:32:49,352
He's 167cm tall.

848
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:52,821
His shoe size is 270mm.

849
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:54,832
- My shoe size is 270mm. - Mine is 275mm.

850
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:57,332
Listening to her words changed my mind.

851
00:32:57,662 --> 00:32:58,861
I should let them eat anything well.

852
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,832
That's right. It's important.

853
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:04,072
I won't feed them malatang, But I decided to feed them...

854
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:06,371
a similar dish, shabu shabu.

855
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:07,742
Shabu shabu is a good choice.

856
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:15,681
- Gosh. - Look at Jung Woo.

857
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:16,751
Look at his eyes.

858
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:18,851
- There's a pile of meat. - No.

859
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:20,582
Don't get excited.

860
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:26,692
Does it look okay?

861
00:33:27,892 --> 00:33:28,962
Will you eat it?

862
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:31,962
Of course. He's smiling.

863
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:33,202
Will you eat it?

864
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:35,872
- How much meat will you eat? - A lot.

865
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:38,242
- A lot. - He'll eat a lot.

866
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:40,501
Will you eat it?

867
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:41,741
- Yes. - Okay.

868
00:33:41,742 --> 00:33:43,112
Eun Woo, let's go and check out the vegetables.

869
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:47,182
Dad.

870
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,182
- Dad. - What?

871
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:50,711
- Please wait. - Dad.

872
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:51,782
Dad.

873
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:54,251
- Why does he keep saying "Dad?" - We'll bring vegetables,

874
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:55,322
so please wait.

875
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:56,752
We'll be back soon.

876
00:33:56,852 --> 00:33:58,161
Look at the meat.

877
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,491
Think about how much you'll eat.

878
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:01,192
- My goodness. - Think?

879
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:02,731
This one.

880
00:34:02,732 --> 00:34:03,892
- Sausage? - Yes.

881
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:07,431
- It's like torture. - That's right.

882
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:09,302
- He can't wait to eat. - Meat is in front of him.

883
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,442
He's staring at the meat...

884
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:12,671
- intently. - Seriously.

885
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:15,571
- I mean... - "Why did you leave me behind?"

886
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:17,471
Looking at the meat makes him smile.

887
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,942
He's staring at the meat.

888
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:25,521
- His permed hair looks so cute. - Yes.

889
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,182
It's insane. He looks so cute.

890
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:35,832
- What? - Will the CEO pay?

891
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:38,662
What do you want?

892
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:40,132
Do you want to order something else?

893
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:44,472
- He's using it as a phone. - He's pretending to call someone.

894
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:46,871
- Hello? - A phone.

895
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:49,472
He's playing with it in a variety of ways.

896
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:56,451
"How much is the total?"

897
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:57,682
That's what he's asking.

898
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:00,222
My goodness.

899
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:01,922
He's staring.

900
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,691
- He's waiting endlessly. - He's gulping.

901
00:35:04,692 --> 00:35:06,362
Hurry up and come back.

902
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:07,592
Dad.

903
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,061
- Dad. - Dad.

904
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:10,091
- He can't wait. - Let's hurry up.

905
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:11,862
Jung Woo is waiting. Let's go.

906
00:35:17,832 --> 00:35:19,372
There you go.

907
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,841
- What's this? - It looks tasty.

908
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,181
What's this?

909
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,312
"What's this?"

910
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:28,812
What's this?

911
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:31,382
Carrot.

912
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,722
- Eun Woo, you too. - All right.

913
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,722
He's happy.

914
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,292
Sausage.

915
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:46,262
One.

916
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:48,302
Two.

917
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,002
There's a piece for each person.

918
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:51,572
All right.

919
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,142
He's drooling.

920
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,012
- Stop drooling. - My goodness.

921
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:59,012
You can eat it as soon as it's cooked.

922
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:02,582
Open wide.

923
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,312
Blow on it.

924
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:10,752
Eun Woo is blowing on it.

925
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,762
He should dip it in the sauce.

926
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,392
I'm fascinated that he loves sauces.

927
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,362
Isn't that too much sauce? Is it okay?

928
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,031
It must be tender and tasty.

929
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,202
It's the miso sauce.

930
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:35,152
- Gosh. - He's eating with gusto.

931
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:37,151
He dips it in the sauce well.

932
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:38,422
He loves the sauce.

933
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,392
Come on.

934
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:48,732
Eat.

935
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:50,531
I'm happy that he eats well.

936
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:51,562
- Yes. - I know.

937
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,102
Eun Woo, you like the miso sauce.

938
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:55,931
It's tasty.

939
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:56,932
Is it tasty?

940
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,502
Meat!

941
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,241
"Why are you giving it to Eun Woo only?"

942
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:06,582
- Seriously. - "How about me?"

943
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:08,082
Meat!

944
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,322
Meat!

945
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:18,262
Here it is.

946
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:21,431
It's hot. He should cool it down.

947
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:22,991
It's hot. Blow on it.

948
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,292
It's hot. Blow on it.

949
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,271
Gosh, he's blowing in the air.

950
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:31,202
- He can't wait. - Blow on the meat.

951
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:33,441
He's only thinking...

952
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:34,941
about eating the meat.

953
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:36,172
- That's right. - Yes.

954
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:37,342
There you go.

955
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:42,682
Gosh, he dropped it.

956
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,321
I dropped it.

957
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:47,421
- I dropped it. - It's down there.

958
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:49,451
You dropped it. Gosh, you speak well now.

959
00:37:49,452 --> 00:37:51,292
- He really speaks well now. - Yes.

960
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:56,862
My goodness.

961
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,402
My goodness, he eats with gusto.

962
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,302
He eats so well.

963
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:02,502
How cute.

964
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,302
Dip it in the oyster sauce.

965
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,271
The meat is thin.

966
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:10,371
- Shabu shabu meat is like that. - The meat.

967
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,442
- That's right. - So it's easy for children.

968
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:14,481
Look at him use utensils with both hands.

969
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:16,151
- Both hands. - You're right.

970
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:18,052
Jung Woo always uses both hands.

971
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:25,691
He wants one more bowl.

972
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:27,022
He wants one more bowl.

973
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:29,031
We haven't seen that in a while.

974
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:30,061
Seriously.

975
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:31,192
One more bowl.

976
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:35,171
- That's when... - I wondered what he was doing.

977
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:37,131
Jung Woo becomes the politest.

978
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:38,172
That's right.

979
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:41,071
Meat. I want more meat.

980
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:42,212
Okay.

981
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,842
I was waiting for you to be done.

982
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:46,082
Here.

983
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:48,952
Here.

984
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:51,852
- Gosh, he's so cute. - Seriously.

985
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,652
Jung Woo.

986
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:57,822
My goodness. Here.

987
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:03,332
Jun Ho is busy feeding the children.

988
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:15,842
It has been in there for too long.

989
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,782
Jun Ho is finally eating.

990
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:25,782
Shabu shabu restaurants have spring rolls these days.

991
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:30,651
Please blow on it.

992
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:31,892
What?

993
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,321
It's hot.

994
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:37,231
- Dad, please blow on it. - What?

995
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:40,761
Blow on it without eating it this time.

996
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:43,771
He wants his dad to just blow on it.

997
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:46,772
Blow on it without eating it this time.

998
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:51,482
- It's hot. - Is it hot?

999
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,481
- It was sausage that time as well. - Is it hot?

1000
00:39:53,482 --> 00:39:55,152
He asked me to blow on it, but I ate it.

1001
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:58,752
I didn't know that he still remembered it.

1002
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:04,151
Blow on it without eating it this time.

1003
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,961
He remembers what happened nine months ago.

1004
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:07,922
Don't eat it.

1005
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,862
No. Don't you dare eat it.

1006
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:13,101
- Don't you dare eat it. - It's a tyrannosaurus.

1007
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,232
- A tyrannosaurus. - It's a tyrannosaurus.

1008
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,602
- A tyrannosaurus? - Where?

1009
00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:22,512
I can't believe it.

1010
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,112
Here.

1011
00:40:28,452 --> 00:40:30,082
- All right. Here. - "Give me meat."

1012
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:33,322
- Please blow on it again. - Eat.

1013
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:36,151
Jun Ho is busy due to the both sides.

1014
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:37,391
Meat.

1015
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:39,491
Dad, please blow on it.

1016
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:40,492
Sausage.

1017
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,732
I can't get it.

1018
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,562
- Does he want pineapple? - I can't get it.

1019
00:40:46,962 --> 00:40:48,432
I want more sauce.

1020
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:50,632
- He eats a lot of sauce. - My goodness.

1021
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:52,572
Hold on. One at a time.

1022
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:54,471
What do you want?

1023
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,511
Sauce.

1024
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:56,612
- Sauce? - Yes.

1025
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:58,881
- Jung Woo, do you want pineapple? - Yes.

1026
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:02,111
Now, children speak with more details.

1027
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:03,811
- They ask for more things. - I'm busier.

1028
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:05,752
- They ask for more things. - They ask for specific things.

1029
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:08,122
He needs to take care of both sides.

1030
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:11,391
Someone like me who can't multitask...

1031
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:12,891
- You won't be able to eat. - It'll be hard.

1032
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:14,161
- You won't be able to eat. - No.

1033
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:15,692
You'll be busy feeding the children.

1034
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:18,302
My goodness.

1035
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:27,101
Jun Ho brought a plate of pineapple.

1036
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:29,542
Here. Have your fill.

1037
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:32,882
Here. Have your fill.

1038
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,752
Satisfied?

1039
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,652
My goodness.

1040
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:43,952
Is it tasty?

1041
00:41:52,132 --> 00:41:54,732
- I can't believe it. - Seriously.

1042
00:41:57,502 --> 00:41:58,572
He's so funny.

1043
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:03,771
I can't believe it. He's so funny.

1044
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:04,772
Seriously.

1045
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:08,912
His cheeks make him look like a chipmunk.

1046
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,152
He's so...

1047
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,722
Did you eat all of them?

1048
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:23,961
When you're at a place like this, you should eat meat,

1049
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:26,762
kalguksu, and porridge in a relaxed way.

1050
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,132
You should enjoy the course.

1051
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:31,031
But we couldn't do that.

1052
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,141
Children became full in no time.

1053
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:34,202
That's right.

1054
00:42:34,402 --> 00:42:35,942
They don't wait for you.

1055
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:37,812
I want to go home.

1056
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:41,282
I want to go home too.

1057
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,312
When we go to a buffet or a restaurant like this,

1058
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:46,122
- we need your mom. - That's right.

1059
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:47,822
I can't take care of you guys alone.

1060
00:42:50,492 --> 00:42:51,552
Are you done?

1061
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,062
Do you want to take it off? Are you done?

1062
00:42:54,622 --> 00:42:55,632
All right.

1063
00:42:56,392 --> 00:42:57,592
Raise your hand if you're done.

1064
00:42:57,692 --> 00:42:58,931
Me!

1065
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:00,362
- Jung Woo is done. Eun Woo? - Me too!

1066
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,571
There you go. A round of applause.

1067
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:04,772
Gosh, they had a good meal.

1068
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:06,572
Let's go this way.

1069
00:43:09,472 --> 00:43:11,312
Where are we? Eun Woo, where are we?

1070
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:12,882
A department store.

1071
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,082
They'll buy something.

1072
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:16,252
Take a look around, Eun Woo.

1073
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:19,152
I always feel good at a department store.

1074
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:26,391
- That's right. - That's right.

1075
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:28,492
- Permed hair. - That's right.

1076
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:31,092
They're the F4.

1077
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:36,572
- My goodness. - "Boys Over Flowers."

1078
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,972
Gu Jun Pyo.

1079
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:42,142
Eun Woo, don't touch things as you walk around.

1080
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:45,082
It'll lead to big trouble, okay?

1081
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:48,782
They have that vibe.

1082
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:50,952
Eun Woo,

1083
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:53,651
you'll graduate from a daycare center...

1084
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:54,922
and enter a kindergarten.

1085
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:57,822
Eun Woo will enter a kindergarten.

1086
00:43:57,922 --> 00:43:59,322
He grew up a lot.

1087
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:03,461
Hello. Eun Woo, say, "Hello."

1088
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:06,531
- Say, "Hello." - We came a long way.

1089
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:08,771
- That's right. - It was two years ago.

1090
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:11,202
It feels like yesterday that he went to a daycare center.

1091
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:17,442
Mom is gone.

1092
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:19,342
Mom is here.

1093
00:44:20,012 --> 00:44:21,042
Mom is gone.

1094
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:23,082
Children grow up fast.

1095
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,891
Eun Woo, you'll graduate from a daycare center...

1096
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:30,892
and enter a kindergarten.

1097
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:32,992
So as a gift,

1098
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:34,892
I'll buy you a watch.

1099
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,361
Why did you choose a watch as a gift...

1100
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:40,832
for entering the kindergarten?

1101
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:44,001
Before Eun Woo enters elementary school,

1102
00:44:44,002 --> 00:44:47,241
I want him to learn how to read the clock.

1103
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:50,041
- You want him to learn the concept. - Yes.

1104
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:53,042
When I was little, my father taught me how to read the clock.

1105
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:56,511
I want to teach Eun Woo that...

1106
00:44:56,512 --> 00:44:58,552
before he enters elementary school.

1107
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:00,122
- It's meaningful. - Yes.

1108
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,862
What if he picks an expensive one?

1109
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:11,962
This one, this one, this one,

1110
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:14,061
- this one, - Jung Woo is flexing.

1111
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:16,732
- this one, this one... - I think he'll do that later.

1112
00:45:17,432 --> 00:45:18,871
He's choosing them ahead of time.

1113
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:20,471
This one, this one...

1114
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:21,741
- This one... - Seriously.

1115
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:22,742
This one,

1116
00:45:23,312 --> 00:45:27,482
this one, this one, this one...

1117
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,412
This one...

1118
00:45:30,182 --> 00:45:31,282
Jung Woo, do you want one as well?

1119
00:45:31,952 --> 00:45:33,752
Hold on, Eun Woo.

1120
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:38,121
Peek-a-boo.

1121
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:39,391
Hold on, Eun Woo.

1122
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:40,862
- Gosh. - Peek-a-boo.

1123
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:46,762
What do you think? Take a look.

1124
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:48,332
Which one do you like?

1125
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:50,872
- This one. - This one?

1126
00:45:51,402 --> 00:45:52,802
Do you like this one better?

1127
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:54,441
- Do you want this one? - Yes.

1128
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:55,471
- Okay. - Take it off.

1129
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:56,472
Okay.

1130
00:45:56,473 --> 00:45:58,581
Eun Woo has a good taste.

1131
00:45:58,582 --> 00:46:01,142
You're so cute.

1132
00:46:02,112 --> 00:46:03,851
I can't believe my little one will enter the kindergarten.

1133
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:05,751
Seriously. He's a little one.

1134
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:07,152
I'll teach you how to read the time.

1135
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:10,591
It's 10, right? Then it's 10 o'clock.

1136
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:11,592
Ten o'clock.

1137
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:13,622
The minutes are hard, so think about the hours only.

1138
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:15,832
Just remember the hours.

1139
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:18,802
- Ten o'clock. - There you go.

1140
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:20,362
Use the watch well.

1141
00:46:21,102 --> 00:46:22,632
We bought the watch, so...

1142
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:24,302
Let's go home.

1143
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:25,842
Run.

1144
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,002
We have a lot to do at home.

1145
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:29,942
We need to do the next thing on the schedule.

1146
00:46:31,472 --> 00:46:33,511
- What's my name? - Woof, woof.

1147
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:35,351
- What's my name? - Woof, woof.

1148
00:46:35,352 --> 00:46:37,012
Dad's name is Woof, woof.

1149
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:39,052
Jung Woo, what's your brother's name?

1150
00:46:39,452 --> 00:46:40,452
Big brother.

1151
00:46:40,652 --> 00:46:41,722
Big brother.

1152
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:45,022
What's your name?

1153
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:46,922
Strawberry.

1154
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:49,092
What's your name?

1155
00:46:49,462 --> 00:46:50,691
Blueberry.

1156
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,701
- What? - Blueberry.

1157
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:54,331
- Blueberry? - Blueberry?

1158
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:57,602
No. You guys have a name.

1159
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:04,942
All right.

1160
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:06,842
Eun Woo, listen carefully.

1161
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,952
You'll enter the society.

1162
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:11,581
- It's cutthroat. - It's cutthroat.

1163
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:12,952
The society isn't easy.

1164
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:15,221
You need to come to your senses.

1165
00:47:15,222 --> 00:47:16,252
Okay?

1166
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,022
- Come on. You got this. - Go ahead.

1167
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:21,362
Go ahead.

1168
00:47:21,363 --> 00:47:23,362
- Jun Ho is competitive. - Go ahead.

1169
00:47:23,662 --> 00:47:24,762
It's okay, Eun Woo.

1170
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,201
Just don't give up.

1171
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:27,701
He doesn't cut them slack.

1172
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:29,031
- Don't give up. - Good.

1173
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:30,202
Just don't give up.

1174
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:32,302
Okay?

1175
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:35,042
You need to know your name...

1176
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:36,812
so that you don't lose your items.

1177
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:39,812
Find your name, Eun Woo.

1178
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:41,242
I don't know.

1179
00:47:41,243 --> 00:47:42,812
Find "Eun Woo." Find your name.

1180
00:47:43,052 --> 00:47:47,082
I don't know. I don't know where it is.

1181
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:48,691
- Try it. - Eun Woo is too young...

1182
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,591
- to read Korean. - I don't know.

1183
00:47:50,592 --> 00:47:52,662
It isn't easy.

1184
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:55,831
- Watch. - There was a reason why...

1185
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:58,092
I wanted to teach them the names.

1186
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,831
I don't think Eun Woo will be able to tell his friends...

1187
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:02,301
that the item is his.

1188
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,302
That's right.

1189
00:48:03,303 --> 00:48:05,371
So it'll help if he knows what his name looks like.

1190
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:07,542
- "This item is mine." - Yes.

1191
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:09,941
I'll teach you.

1192
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:11,672
Eun Woo. Kim.

1193
00:48:12,342 --> 00:48:13,881
- Kim. - There you go.

1194
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:15,382
Kim is your last name.

1195
00:48:15,782 --> 00:48:17,952
You, me, and Jung Woo share it.

1196
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:22,792
It's the same as "Dried laver."

1197
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:24,721
That's right. It's the same as "Dried laver."

1198
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:26,092
That's right.

1199
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,862
- That's right. - He's smart.

1200
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:32,032
- It's the same as "Dried laver." - That's right.

1201
00:48:32,432 --> 00:48:33,731
- Yes. - That's right.

1202
00:48:33,732 --> 00:48:34,732
Watch.

1203
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,672
Your name has two circles.

1204
00:48:39,672 --> 00:48:42,412
Your name has two circles.

1205
00:48:44,112 --> 00:48:45,142
Right?

1206
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:50,111
This one also has two circles.

1207
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:51,251
- You're right. - What? He's right.

1208
00:48:51,252 --> 00:48:52,682
- Jung Woo. - He's right.

1209
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:55,321
I wanted to make it easy for him.

1210
00:48:55,322 --> 00:48:56,452
I didn't think about that.

1211
00:48:56,922 --> 00:48:58,152
Jung Woo also has two circles.

1212
00:49:01,592 --> 00:49:02,661
- You're right. - He's observant.

1213
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:04,031
- Seriously. - He's good.

1214
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:06,132
- You're smart. - He's different.

1215
00:49:09,902 --> 00:49:11,231
His mom should've been there.

1216
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:13,972
It's the same as "Dried laver."

1217
00:49:14,142 --> 00:49:15,642
That's right. It's the same as "Dried laver."

1218
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:19,512
This one also has two circles.

1219
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:20,682
You're right.

1220
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:25,082
Who's the teacher?

1221
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:28,221
Let's resume.

1222
00:49:28,222 --> 00:49:29,952
- All right. - He wants you to focus.

1223
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:32,092
Let's resume. All right.

1224
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:35,531
The circles in your name...

1225
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:36,662
are at the top.

1226
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,962
One of the circles in Jung Woo's name...

1227
00:49:41,162 --> 00:49:42,502
is at the bottom.

1228
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:44,672
What's your name?

1229
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,942
- Kim Eun Woo. - That's right.

1230
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:49,872
Now, you know your name.

1231
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,271
Let's say someone asks, "Eun Woo, where's yours?"

1232
00:49:51,272 --> 00:49:54,241
Then say, "It's here."

1233
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,412
- Okay? - Yes.

1234
00:49:55,812 --> 00:49:57,381
I prepared something else.

1235
00:49:57,382 --> 00:49:59,952
What did you prepare?

1236
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:07,592
The two of you will have a match.

1237
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:08,692
A match?

1238
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,202
First, take off your coat.

1239
00:50:14,102 --> 00:50:15,502
Second, take off your shoes.

1240
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:18,732
Then take your toothbrush.

1241
00:50:19,442 --> 00:50:22,271
Then go to the restroom and brush your teeth to win.

1242
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,141
- It's what Eun Woo must do... - Yes.

1243
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,812
at the kindergarten.

1244
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:29,482
Understood? Are you ready?

1245
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:31,012
Yes.

1246
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:33,582
- Okay. - Okay.

1247
00:50:34,352 --> 00:50:36,722
The order might be confusing.

1248
00:50:38,322 --> 00:50:40,991
Set,

1249
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,022
go.

1250
00:50:42,762 --> 00:50:44,032
You took it off fast.

1251
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,962
- You took it off fast. - All right, Eun Woo.

1252
00:50:48,432 --> 00:50:50,371
Jung Woo, take off your coat.

1253
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,502
Jung Woo, take it off quickly.

1254
00:50:52,102 --> 00:50:53,842
- Jung Woo, take it off quickly. - Where is he going?

1255
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:55,402
Jung Woo.

1256
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:57,241
I'm running.

1257
00:50:57,242 --> 00:50:58,312
Jung Woo.

1258
00:50:58,442 --> 00:51:00,181
- I'm running. - Where is Jung Woo going?

1259
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,282
I'm running.

1260
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:03,382
- Jung Woo. - Running?

1261
00:51:03,512 --> 00:51:04,612
Take it off quickly.

1262
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:07,921
The shoes.

1263
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:09,222
- Jung Woo. - I'm running.

1264
00:51:09,552 --> 00:51:11,922
- I'm running. - Take it off quickly.

1265
00:51:12,892 --> 00:51:14,192
Take off your shoes like your brother.

1266
00:51:16,862 --> 00:51:18,291
- He remembered the task... - Yes.

1267
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:19,632
upon seeing his brother take off his shoes.

1268
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:22,202
He decided to do it as well.

1269
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:24,032
He's late.

1270
00:51:25,702 --> 00:51:27,201
Hurry up. There you go.

1271
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:28,502
Next. Jung Woo.

1272
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:32,642
It's time to brush your teeth.

1273
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:35,281
- That's right. - Brush your teeth.

1274
00:51:35,282 --> 00:51:38,111
Tooth brushing is the only mission that remains.

1275
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:39,182
Is it yours?

1276
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:41,352
Is it yours?

1277
00:51:44,622 --> 00:51:46,362
Jung Woo is surprised.

1278
00:51:46,762 --> 00:51:49,462
- His older brother is too fast. - That's right.

1279
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:55,302
- He decided to wait. - Look at him.

1280
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:57,731
This is exactly why I like this family.

1281
00:51:57,732 --> 00:51:58,971
That's good, Jung Woo.

1282
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:00,671
- Look at Eun Woo. - Eun Woo waits for his brother.

1283
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:02,772
- There you go. - Seriously.

1284
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:06,341
Put them next to his shoes.

1285
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:07,742
- Here. - There you go.

1286
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:13,021
- There you go. - How cute.

1287
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:14,952
- They look so neat. - They look so neat.

1288
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:17,051
- He learned from his brother. - Next.

1289
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:18,791
Take off your coat.

1290
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:20,061
- Your coat. - Take off your coat.

1291
00:52:20,062 --> 00:52:21,062
- Take it off. - There you go.

1292
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:22,831
- I can't. - He said, "I can't."

1293
00:52:22,832 --> 00:52:24,191
- Gosh. - Why not?

1294
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:25,561
Try it. Take it off.

1295
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,132
If it's a little bit hard, he says that he can't do it.

1296
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:29,831
- He can't take it off. - He only pretends to do it.

1297
00:52:29,832 --> 00:52:31,401
- He doesn't actually do it. - Gosh.

1298
00:52:31,402 --> 00:52:32,542
Gosh.

1299
00:52:32,702 --> 00:52:34,472
Take off your coat.

1300
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:38,571
- Is Eun Woo helping him? - I can't believe it.

1301
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,182
- It's a difficult task. - Yes.

1302
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:41,881
He's like Prince Charming.

1303
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:43,351
He's Prince Strawberry.

1304
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:44,882
He comes when Jung Woo is struggling.

1305
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:46,222
I can't believe it.

1306
00:52:47,082 --> 00:52:48,382
There you go. Bring it here.

1307
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:51,922
There you go. Next.

1308
00:52:52,592 --> 00:52:54,562
- What do you need to do next? - Brush the teeth.

1309
00:52:56,862 --> 00:52:58,632
Eun Woo takes care of Jung Woo.

1310
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,801
Eun Woo is like...

1311
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,571
- Jung Woo's guardian. - How dependable.

1312
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:03,802
Seriously.

1313
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,672
If you're done brushing your teeth, set off to the restroom.

1314
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:13,282
There you go.

1315
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,912
I'll help you. Open your mouth.

1316
00:53:15,912 --> 00:53:18,082
I can help you at home.

1317
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,552
But you need to do this alone at the kindergarten, okay?

1318
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:25,222
Later on, I won't be able to help you even if I want to.

1319
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:27,292
You got a lot better at it.

1320
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,162
There you go.

1321
00:53:33,362 --> 00:53:34,602
- There you go. - He's good.

1322
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:36,072
- You're good. - Yes.

1323
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:37,831
- All right. - Eun Woo is good.

1324
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:39,701
- Next. - There's no need to worry.

1325
00:53:39,702 --> 00:53:40,942
Kim Jung Woo.

1326
00:53:41,172 --> 00:53:42,611
- Up next is Kim Jung Woo. - Jung Woo.

1327
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:44,672
- Jung Woo brought his toothbrush. - It's Jung Woo's turn.

1328
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,142
Shall we begin?

1329
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:50,482
There you go. Fill the cup with water.

1330
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,151
- Here. - He has learned it...

1331
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,481
- by watching his older brother. - Rinse your mouth.

1332
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:54,521
That's right. Jung Woo is faster.

1333
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,751
- Right? - There you go.

1334
00:53:55,752 --> 00:53:56,792
Spit it out.

1335
00:53:57,222 --> 00:53:58,321
- Okay. - What?

1336
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,492
You shouldn't swallow it.

1337
00:53:59,922 --> 00:54:01,122
There you go. Spit it out.

1338
00:54:02,062 --> 00:54:04,192
- Okay. - What? You shouldn't swallow it.

1339
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:07,261
- My child also enjoys drinking... - Spit it out.

1340
00:54:07,262 --> 00:54:08,962
- the water for rinsing the mouth. - Spit it out.

1341
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:10,371
- Spit it out. - Seriously.

1342
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,771
- Jung Woo rarely spits out... - Spit it out.

1343
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:13,802
- what enters his mouth. - There you go.

1344
00:54:15,772 --> 00:54:17,211
There you go.

1345
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,512
You're good. One more time.

1346
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:20,911
- There you go. Good. - He did well.

1347
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:23,082
All done.

1348
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:24,612
You did well.

1349
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,121
Eun Woo, can you do well at the kindergarten?

1350
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:30,152
Yes.

1351
00:54:30,322 --> 00:54:32,021
Do everything with confidence, okay?

1352
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,562
- Be confident. - Okay.

1353
00:54:43,472 --> 00:54:45,532
Jung Woo, hurry up and speak.

1354
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:47,242
MINJI.

1355
00:54:52,882 --> 00:54:53,912
There you go.

1356
00:54:56,412 --> 00:55:00,151
It's the same as "Dried laver." This one...

1357
00:55:00,152 --> 00:55:03,751
- also has two circles. - You're right.

1358
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:06,891
Hold on. Let's put it here.

1359
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:08,892
If you don't know anything, ask the teacher.

1360
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:10,891
Be good to your friends.

1361
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,501
- Jun Ho must be very worried. - Okay?

1362
00:55:12,502 --> 00:55:13,902
- Okay. - Okay. High-five.

1363
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:15,501
Eun Woo does everything well.

1364
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:16,902
- Okay. - Of course.

1365
00:55:19,672 --> 00:55:21,902
Since you guys succeeded in the missions,

1366
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:23,912
let's now make a tasty snack.

1367
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:26,942
March 14 is the White Day.

1368
00:55:27,182 --> 00:55:28,941
What's the White Day?

1369
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:31,752
On the White Day, you give candies or snacks...

1370
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,752
to someone you love.

1371
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:38,722
I thought it'd be nice to make something with them...

1372
00:55:38,952 --> 00:55:40,692
for my wife.

1373
00:55:40,892 --> 00:55:42,122
I'm the show's official loving husband.

1374
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:44,232
- My goodness. - You said it yourself.

1375
00:55:45,032 --> 00:55:46,302
How sweet.

1376
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:48,061
- What's that? - He has done...

1377
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:50,031
- many events on the show. - Yes.

1378
00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:52,942
- Thank you. I really like it. - Enjoy it.

1379
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:58,372
To Eun Woo's mom, Jung Hyun, who I feel thankful and sorry.

1380
00:55:59,382 --> 00:56:01,682
You did a good job of raising Eun Woo for a year.

1381
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,451
I'll prepare the snack...

1382
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,422
that's very popular these days, the chewy cookie.

1383
00:56:12,692 --> 00:56:13,862
- Chewy cookie? - Chewy cookie?

1384
00:56:14,192 --> 00:56:16,061
- It's popular these days. - It's popular these days.

1385
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,792
What's that?

1386
00:56:17,932 --> 00:56:19,832
You melt marshmallows...

1387
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:21,701
and add colorful snacks...

1388
00:56:21,702 --> 00:56:24,001
- to make it chewy. - Yes.

1389
00:56:24,002 --> 00:56:25,432
The texture is chewy.

1390
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:26,872
It's nice.

1391
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:28,572
Listen carefully.

1392
00:56:30,212 --> 00:56:32,272
- What are those? - Snacks.

1393
00:56:32,782 --> 00:56:34,241
What are those?

1394
00:56:34,242 --> 00:56:36,581
- Snacks. - His eyes are fixed on them.

1395
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:38,181
- What's this? - What's this?

1396
00:56:38,182 --> 00:56:39,182
Melon.
What's this?

1397
00:56:40,183 --> 00:56:41,451
- Orange. - "What's this?"

1398
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:42,651
- What's this? - What's this?

1399
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:43,722
Blueberry.

1400
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:45,422
Eun Woo, who do you love the most?

1401
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,692
- Jung Woo. - Jung Woo.

1402
00:56:47,892 --> 00:56:49,392
- Jung Woo. - Jung Woo.

1403
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:50,962
- My goodness. - There you go.

1404
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:55,162
Who's next?

1405
00:56:56,102 --> 00:56:57,332
- Eun Woo. - Eun Woo.

1406
00:56:57,802 --> 00:56:59,242
- Eun Woo. - Eun Woo.

1407
00:57:00,072 --> 00:57:01,102
Who's next?

1408
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:03,871
- Who's next? - Mom.

1409
00:57:03,872 --> 00:57:05,471
- Who's next? - Grandma.

1410
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:06,781
- Who's next? - Grandpa.

1411
00:57:06,782 --> 00:57:07,782
Grandpa?

1412
00:57:07,783 --> 00:57:09,882
- He forgot to say, "Dad." - How about Dad?

1413
00:57:10,182 --> 00:57:12,011
- If I were in his position, - I can't believe it.

1414
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,381
- What's going on? - I'd feel so lonely.

1415
00:57:14,382 --> 00:57:15,922
- Seriously. - Who's next?

1416
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,892
- Mister. - When will it be my turn?

1417
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:18,992
Mister.

1418
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:20,462
- Mister. - When will it be my turn?

1419
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,162
When will it be my turn?

1420
00:57:23,532 --> 00:57:25,261
- Who's next? - Dad.

1421
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:26,262
There you go.

1422
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:27,702
- Dad. - There you go.

1423
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:30,201
- "There you go." - You forced him to say it.

1424
00:57:30,202 --> 00:57:32,232
I think I did that.

1425
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,141
Jung Woo, who do you love the most?

1426
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:35,171
Grandma.

1427
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:36,211
- Grandma? - Grandma.

1428
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,712
- Grandma. - Grandma?

1429
00:57:38,712 --> 00:57:39,942
Who's next?

1430
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,051
- Who's next? - Mom.

1431
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:46,681
- Who's next? - Mom.

1432
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:48,181
- Who's next? - Mom.

1433
00:57:48,182 --> 00:57:49,252
- Mom. - Who's next?

1434
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:52,962
"Dad" isn't in his vocabulary.

1435
00:57:54,362 --> 00:57:55,692
- Mom. - Who's next?

1436
00:57:55,962 --> 00:57:57,192
- Mom. - Who's next?

1437
00:57:57,462 --> 00:57:58,632
- Mom. - Who's next?

1438
00:57:58,932 --> 00:57:59,932
Mom.

1439
00:58:01,302 --> 00:58:02,332
Mom.

1440
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:05,941
Jun Ho kept asking, but he kept giving the same answer.

1441
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:07,501
Jung Woo, who do you love the most?

1442
00:58:07,502 --> 00:58:08,502
I don't know.

1443
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:11,912
Dad, Mom. Dad, Mom, Dad.

1444
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:15,612
- He gave the answer Jun Ho wanted. - Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom, Dad.

1445
00:58:16,112 --> 00:58:18,082
- Thank you. - Jung Woo was like, "Take this."

1446
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,422
- "Take this." - "Take this."

1447
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:23,321
- Dad, Mom, Dad, Mom. - Jun Ho is lonely.

1448
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:24,452
Are you ready?

1449
00:58:25,222 --> 00:58:27,222
Jung Woo, are you ready?

1450
00:58:27,522 --> 00:58:29,892
- Yes. - There you go. All right.

1451
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:38,602
Butter.

1452
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:41,442
Butter.

1453
00:58:42,912 --> 00:58:44,112
- He knows. - Butter.

1454
00:58:45,442 --> 00:58:46,841
- Butter. - It's his specialty.

1455
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:48,481
- Jung Woo recognized it quickly. - Be honest.

1456
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:49,652
You can speak, right?

1457
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,582
- You can speak, right? - He knows what butter is.

1458
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:54,551
Most children don't know it.

1459
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:55,652
It smells good.

1460
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:57,991
- It smells savory. - It smells good.

1461
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,721
- That's right. - My goodness.

1462
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:00,722
- Seriously. - Butter first.

1463
00:59:00,723 --> 00:59:01,791
Butter.

1464
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:03,192
- Here we go. - Butter.

1465
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,132
Marshmallow is the key ingredient of the chewy cookie.

1466
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,232
- Marshmallows? - I'm going to melt them.

1467
00:59:10,872 --> 00:59:13,872
Marshmallows are tasty as they are.

1468
00:59:15,842 --> 00:59:17,541
It smells tasty.

1469
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,142
Right? It smells tasty, right?

1470
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:25,452
Eun Woo and Jung Woo. Put the snacks in here.

1471
00:59:25,712 --> 00:59:29,392
Use the hammers like this to crush them.

1472
00:59:32,022 --> 00:59:35,962
All right. We're going to give this to the person we love.

1473
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:37,631
We can't skimp on the ingredients.

1474
00:59:37,632 --> 00:59:39,432
There you go. Empty it out.

1475
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:43,472
- Next, add melons. - Eun Woo. You are now...

1476
00:59:43,972 --> 00:59:45,732
Next?

1477
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:48,741
- Next, add melons. - Eun Woo. You are now...

1478
00:59:48,742 --> 00:59:50,641
- There you go. - He's so good at talking now.

1479
00:59:50,642 --> 00:59:53,111
- His speech developed a lot. - Yes.

1480
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,782
Dad. You peel it.

1481
00:59:56,652 --> 00:59:59,182
Dad. You peel it.

1482
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:05,192
- It fell. - "It fell."

1483
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,621
- Next, add melons. - Eun Woo. You are now...

1484
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:09,631
There you go.

1485
01:00:09,632 --> 01:00:10,931
- Next, - What a nice choice of words.

1486
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:12,591
- "Next." - add melons.

1487
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:13,701
- There you go. - How could he speak like that?

1488
01:00:13,702 --> 01:00:16,071
- There you go. Say, "Melon." - Melon.

1489
01:00:16,072 --> 01:00:17,172
There you go.

1490
01:00:17,272 --> 01:00:18,532
Add generously.

1491
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:21,872
All done.

1492
01:00:22,172 --> 01:00:23,242
All done.

1493
01:00:23,712 --> 01:00:24,812
- My gosh. - Are you done?

1494
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:26,312
- He's copying Eun Woo. - Yes.

1495
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:28,282
Eun Woo. You have to hammer them then.

1496
01:00:28,812 --> 01:00:29,882
Crush them.

1497
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:35,622
Eun Woo. You're definitely ready to go to kindergarten.

1498
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:38,322
You know? You can do everything I ask now.

1499
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,721
He's indeed a good worker.

1500
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:42,222
All right, Jung Woo. You do it too.

1501
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,832
Do it hard.

1502
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:46,632
Do it hard.

1503
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:48,032
Do it hard.

1504
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:50,102
Gosh. What a surprise. Today,

1505
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:52,102
Jung Woo is actually helping.

1506
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:55,971
- Gosh, our adorable idler. - Right.

1507
01:00:55,972 --> 01:00:58,472
- Right. - All done.

1508
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:12,621
Crush them finely, so we can add them here.

1509
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:14,062
So crush them as finely as possible.

1510
01:01:21,002 --> 01:01:22,332
You're already assuming your usual position.

1511
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:26,671
- Snacks. - Here.

1512
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:28,442
- He wants snacks. - Snacks.

1513
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:30,412
Snacks.

1514
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:33,442
You'll only eat one.

1515
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:36,252
You can wait until we finish if you eat one, right?

1516
01:01:36,482 --> 01:01:37,512
Yes.

1517
01:01:42,652 --> 01:01:44,052
Take a big bite.

1518
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:47,021
- "Take a big bite." - Gosh, how could he be so sweet?

1519
01:01:47,022 --> 01:01:48,292
- Is it good? - Yes.

1520
01:01:48,862 --> 01:01:50,492
- It's good. - Yes.

1521
01:01:53,432 --> 01:01:54,932
Give me more.

1522
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:56,501
Jung Woo wants more.

1523
01:01:56,502 --> 01:01:57,502
He wants more?

1524
01:01:57,503 --> 01:01:59,471
- Having only one piece... - I'll make it tastier.

1525
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:01,041
- is like teasing his palate. - Just wait.

1526
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:03,371
If you want it to be tastier...

1527
01:02:03,372 --> 01:02:05,912
Give me more.

1528
01:02:05,942 --> 01:02:09,712
- If you want it to be tastier... - Give me more.

1529
01:02:09,952 --> 01:02:11,581
- Give me more. - He won't listen to Eun Woo.

1530
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:13,081
- Give me more. - He wants more.

1531
01:02:13,082 --> 01:02:14,252
Give me more.

1532
01:02:14,882 --> 01:02:16,022
Give me more.

1533
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:17,792
Kim Jung Woo.

1534
01:02:18,552 --> 01:02:19,561
Kim Jung Woo.

1535
01:02:19,562 --> 01:02:21,321
Look at me.

1536
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:22,421
Gosh, Jun Ho sounds scary.

1537
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:24,191
- Kim Jung Woo. Look at me. - He should scold Jung Woo.

1538
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:25,192
Look at me.

1539
01:02:25,562 --> 01:02:28,762
- Kim Jung Woo. - He sensed the mood.

1540
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:31,302
Kim Jung Woo. Look at me.

1541
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:33,841
- When he's being scolded, - Look at me.

1542
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:35,242
- he looks away on purpose. - Kim Jung Woo.

1543
01:02:36,142 --> 01:02:38,111
- Kim Jung Woo. - Look at him. He's spacing out.

1544
01:02:38,112 --> 01:02:39,441
- He's zoning out, looking away. - Right.

1545
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:40,941
- He sensed what was going on. - Yes.

1546
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:42,511
But he couldn't meet my eyes.

1547
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:43,951
- He was talking well. - Right.

1548
01:02:43,952 --> 01:02:45,451
- He was eloquent and smart. - Yes.

1549
01:02:45,452 --> 01:02:47,481
- He suddenly zoned out. - Look at me.

1550
01:02:47,482 --> 01:02:49,251
He keeps looking away on purpose.

1551
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:50,921
- Kim Jung Woo. - He's looking away on purpose.

1552
01:02:50,922 --> 01:02:52,552
- He's so cute. - Jung Woo.

1553
01:02:56,432 --> 01:02:57,632
Kim Jung Woo.

1554
01:02:58,892 --> 01:03:00,701
- Kim Jung Woo. - He pretends not to hear you.

1555
01:03:00,702 --> 01:03:02,232
- What's this? - He's so adorable.

1556
01:03:02,462 --> 01:03:04,731
Don't do that.

1557
01:03:04,732 --> 01:03:05,732
- Okay. - Okay.

1558
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:07,002
How adorable.

1559
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:12,741
- What's wrong? - I didn't give him any snacks.

1560
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:14,011
Then he got scolded instead.

1561
01:03:14,012 --> 01:03:15,181
- He's feeling down now. - Yes.

1562
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:17,081
When Jung Woo doesn't get what he wants...

1563
01:03:17,082 --> 01:03:18,281
He's sulking now.

1564
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:19,851
- He stepped away. - There goes Jung Woo.

1565
01:03:19,852 --> 01:03:21,682
Okay, Jung Woo. I'll give you the snack.

1566
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:23,492
- Come here. - Yes, you must give it to him.

1567
01:03:23,652 --> 01:03:25,452
Okay, Jung Woo. I'll give you the snack.

1568
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:26,862
Come here.

1569
01:03:27,592 --> 01:03:28,722
We'll eat this?

1570
01:03:33,232 --> 01:03:35,131
I'll give you the snack. Come here.

1571
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:36,401
When his dad said he'd give more snacks...

1572
01:03:36,402 --> 01:03:37,602
We'll eat this?

1573
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:39,502
We'll eat this?

1574
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:42,171
- He has no pride. - Come here. I'll give it to you.

1575
01:03:42,172 --> 01:03:43,712
When it comes to food, his stance is clear.

1576
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:46,311
- Come here. I'll give it to you. - Snacks.

1577
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:48,941
- He's got a great personality. - Jung Woo's intention is clear.

1578
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:51,381
- After hearing about the snacks... - He's climbing up the steps.

1579
01:03:51,382 --> 01:03:53,082
Jung Woo, what do you have to do to eat this?

1580
01:03:53,782 --> 01:03:56,151
- Bite. - No, what do you have to say?

1581
01:03:56,152 --> 01:03:57,191
Bite.

1582
01:03:57,192 --> 01:03:58,322
What do you have to say?

1583
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:00,861
- Thank you. - There you go.

1584
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:02,491
- "Thank you." - "Thank you."

1585
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:03,492
Louder.

1586
01:04:03,892 --> 01:04:05,992
- Louder. - I'll say it too.

1587
01:04:06,502 --> 01:04:08,431
- Louder. - I'll say it too.

1588
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:11,071
- I meant to say thank you louder. - He's in a good mood.

1589
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:12,102
Here.

1590
01:04:13,502 --> 01:04:14,842
Try it.

1591
01:04:15,402 --> 01:04:16,842
I'll let you have it.

1592
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,411
I love his laughter.

1593
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:20,082
- We just have to mix them now. - His laughter...

1594
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:21,612
Let's harden the mixed marshmallows now.

1595
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:22,842
I mean, let's mix them first.

1596
01:04:23,882 --> 01:04:26,152
Gosh, this will definitely give her a sugar boost.

1597
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,051
It's raining.

1598
01:04:28,052 --> 01:04:29,722
That's right. It's raining.

1599
01:04:32,322 --> 01:04:36,532
- It's raining. - Rain.

1600
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:42,462
Rain.

1601
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:44,502
My gosh, good job.

1602
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:47,872
Gosh, it looks like a piece of art.

1603
01:04:47,972 --> 01:04:49,371
- Right. You did well. - It was my first time.

1604
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:50,741
- I never made sweets like this... - You did a good job.

1605
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:52,111
- for her. - Look at that.

1606
01:04:52,112 --> 01:04:53,181
- You did a good job. - Nicely done.

1607
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:54,542
- It looks beautiful. - Yes.

1608
01:04:59,282 --> 01:05:00,622
What's this, Eun Woo?

1609
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:01,852
He gave it to his mother?

1610
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,521
- The chewy cookies. - Did he give it to his mother?

1611
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:05,092
- Did you make it? - Yes.

1612
01:05:06,522 --> 01:05:08,021
This is such a lovely sight.

1613
01:05:08,022 --> 01:05:10,091
- Yes. The Woo Brothers spent... - Gosh.

1614
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:11,661
- White Day full of love... - It's really chewy.

1615
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:13,602
- thanks to their father. - Thank you.

1616
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:21,602
Land

1617
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:24,272
And sky

1618
01:05:24,372 --> 01:05:26,541
Hello, viewers of The Return of Superman.

I'm the Sentimental Giant, Hwang Min Ho.

1620
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:35,322
Put it in my heart

1621
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:38,951
It has no meaning

1622
01:05:38,952 --> 01:05:41,862
Have the milk. I'll make it for you later.

1623
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:46,262
Let me massage your legs.

1624
01:05:46,762 --> 01:05:47,802
Don't move.

1625
01:05:49,732 --> 01:05:51,532
Hello
