1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,640
(The terrifying police bureau
from the Joseon Dynasty)

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,680
(Someone has been arrested.)

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,010
(It's Jung Woo?)

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,480
(You have made your crime clear.)

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,680
(That's...)

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,650
(crazy!)

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,920
(Make him drink it
right this instant!)

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,990
(The Woo Brothers are back!)

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,030
The Return of Superman. Episode 591.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,100
I Thank You Every Day.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,600
He's begun his day
by adoring his son as usual.

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,300
You're so adorable. Seriously.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,470
Let me hug you for a bit.

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,140
- My gosh.
- Did you sleep well?

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,880
There's one more new experience
left for you.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,680
(But today, Haru's hair looks...)

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,090
(Haru's hairstyle has changed.)

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,620
He's got a new hairstyle.
His hair got quite long.

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,160
But it's not as voluminous as before.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
- His hair is settling down now.
- Right.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,860
- It's settling down.
- That's considered settling down?

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,330
That's quite the change for Haru.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,760
Right. You must give him a kiss
in the morning.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,870
(What kind of day awaits
the father and the son?)

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,840
All right.
Let's have some fun together, Haru.

26
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,940
I wonder
what they'll do for fun today.

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,740
Let's play with the mirror.

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,110
- I see. With the mirror.
- Right. With the mirror.

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,140
(The mirror game!)

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,910
- The doctor told me that...
- Right.

31
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,050
- that was an important activity.
- Right.

32
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,850
How about this?

33
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,950
All right.

34
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,980
(Oh, my. That's a mirror.)

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,050
It's a mirror.

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
(Laughing)

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,690
- He's fascinated.
- Who's that?

38
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,520
(He looks in the mirror...)

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,690
(and beams.)

40
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,660
- Haru is smiling at himself.
- Yes.

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,430
He's satisfied.

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,330
(I like you.)

43
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,370
Haru.

44
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,840
Do you like your face too?

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,470
(Of course!)

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,740
Look.

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,610
Are you excited
to look in the mirror?

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,880
To be looking at your own face?

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,550
(His eyes are fixed on the mirror.)

50
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,890
Come forward.

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,620
If you want to look at your face
up close, come closer.

52
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,790
(Come closer?)

53
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,300
There you go.

54
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,030
(Crawling)

55
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,900
- He understood that.
- You want to see yourself up close.

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,240
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

57
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,770
(He crawls closer energetically
after understanding his dad.)

58
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,340
(He must want
to look at himself up close.)

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,240
- My gosh.
- There you go.

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,410
(He wriggles his way
through the mirror.)

61
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,480
There you go.

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,820
- Do you want...
- My gosh. Yes.

63
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
(He arrives at the mirror!)

64
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,150
He's happy.

65
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,060
(Staring)

66
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,760
(Who are you? You look beautiful.)

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,670
(Touching)

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,210
(Why can't I grab you?)

69
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,510
(He's about
to dive into the mirror.)

70
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,980
(Why do you look so beautiful?)

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,020
- My gosh.
- He smiles so easily. Oh, my.

72
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,320
Seriously.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,590
- He looks beautiful as always.
- Gosh, how cute.

74
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,650
Right.

75
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,390
- Oh, my.
- Haru.

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,730
I've borrowed a great toy for you.

77
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,730
I wonder what it is.

78
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,300
(A great toy for me?)

79
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,160
Wait.

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,170
We live in a convenient world now.

81
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,010
What? He's bringing out a box?

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Well...

83
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,980
(Mr. Shim brings out a big box.)

84
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,010
I brought it because I heard
it was the trendiest toy these days.

85
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,120
But I'm not sure
if you can play with it.

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,780
(What's all that?)

87
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,850
(Completely focused on it)

88
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,460
Haru, come here.

89
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,460
All right. It's almost ready now.

90
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,790
(He has prepared a toy
to help Haru walk.)

91
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,160
He started jumping.

92
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,500
With the baby jumper,
he can just hop up and down.

93
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,000
But this toy can help Haru walk.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,070
(For Haru
who is 223 days old now...)

95
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,140
He can build muscles
that can help him walk with this.

96
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,510
That's why I borrowed it.

97
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,280
Let me assemble it quickly.

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,450
(Haru,
I'll make it in a jiffy for you.)

99
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,050
Okay.

100
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,180
(He even puts on glasses.)

101
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,680
This will be a piece of cake.

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,390
That's it.
They fit into the holes perfectly.

103
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,660
(Struggling)

104
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,830
Okay. When you can't do something
on your own,

105
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,600
you have to use tools then.

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,400
(Dad, is it almost ready?)

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Let me spread out
some of my toys here.

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,300
Wait, they're not my toys.
They're yours.

109
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,800
I forgot.

110
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,510
(I shall give
all of my toys to you.)

111
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,080
(That's the promise
he made to Haru.)

112
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,880
They're all yours.

113
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,620
(I'll go and bring your toys.)

114
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,090
Gosh, you're excited.

115
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,920
This is the music box I like.

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,490
As for the music it's playing,

117
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,860
it's included in the movie version
of the series.

118
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,000
As for this, I got it
from the toy vending machine.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,270
Haru, are you watching?

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,300
I can turn it into Doraemon
like this.

121
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
This is Mini-Dora.

122
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,070
It does the same thing as Doraemon,

123
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,110
but it's tiny.

124
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,240
And it's red.

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,610
(I can't wait to ride it.)

126
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,350
- Gosh.
- You decorated it very nicely.

127
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,220
Doraemon is so cute.

128
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,250
All right then.

129
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,460
I assembled this for you.

130
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,760
Why don't you get on this fun toy?
Let's get you on the baby walker.

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,230
(The challenge
of the 223-day-old boy, Haru!)

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's so fascinating
when your child stands up like that.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,170
All right. Look.

134
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,140
You can move to the side
with your legs.

135
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,480
(There are so many interesting items
in front of him.)

136
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,410
All right. Try it. Like this.

137
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,680
- He's walking on his toes.
- My gosh.

138
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,650
(Walking? What's that?)

139
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,620
Let's walk to the side. All right.

140
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,450
One, two.

141
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,290
One, two.

142
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,460
(Regardless of his dad's effort,)

143
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,830
(Haru is only interested
in Doraemon.)

144
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,560
My gosh. Haru, you like Doraemon.

145
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,530
I also like Doraemon.

146
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,970
(We both like the same character.)

147
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,240
He picked Doraemon like his dad.

148
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,500
When did you start liking Doraemon?

149
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,240
My gosh. You like him.

150
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,740
(Tightly holding into it)

151
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,110
I should go and drink some water.

152
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,880
Are you in a good mood?

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,520
(I'll be playing with Doraemon.)

154
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,550
You get a bit of free time
to do something else with that.

155
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,590
Right.

156
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,890
(Let me see.)

157
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,230
(Doraemon, play with me.)

158
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,730
He likes Doraemon. Gosh.

159
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
(He looks at his dad.)

160
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,630
- Is he going...
- What?

161
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,200
Haru.

162
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,780
- My gosh.
- What?

163
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,850
(Rushing over)

164
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,480
Are you okay?

165
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,650
You asked if Haru was okay.

166
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,190
(I'm fine.)

167
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,960
You didn't hurt your fingers?

168
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,760
(Haru seems fine.)

169
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,330
(Studying)

170
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,460
"Are you okay, Doraemon?"

171
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,530
You didn't say it,

172
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,200
- but we can feel it.
- Of course.

173
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,870
- We can all feel it.
- Seriously. Did I...

174
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,930
(The sense of anxiety shows
in his gestures.)

175
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,440
I was worried that Haru might be
in danger, so I was in a hurry.

176
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
Seriously.

177
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,670
(Haru, be careful
when you play with the toys.)

178
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,040
(Okay, don't worry about that.)

179
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,610
(Haru is becoming more aggressive.)

180
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,650
Did you see the look on his face?
He seems anxious.

181
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,590
(Mr. Shim keeps on moving Doraemon.)

182
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,820
Should I put it here?

183
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,590
(Leave it there!)

184
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,090
Be careful with that.

185
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,300
(Feeling awkward)

186
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,600
(Excited)

187
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,730
Okay.

188
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,170
(He puts it away
at the speed of light.)

189
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,170
Why did you do that?

190
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,470
- What? He was playing with it.
- Why?

191
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,810
What is that?
Haru can't even look at it.

192
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,640
(You told me
to get to know Doraemon.)

193
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,980
- I didn't want Haru to get hurt.
- My gosh.

194
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,950
- You must treasure it a lot.
- Right.

195
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,450
A bit, I guess.
Well, Haru seems to like it, but...

196
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,450
(Don't tell us
you don't want to give it up for Haru.)

197
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,950
Why don't you walk around?

198
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,790
(At last!)

199
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,360
(Tiptoeing)

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,190
- Gosh, he's standing up.
- He can stand up quite stably.

201
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,860
So is it hard for you
to walk to the side yet?

202
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,530
All right. Let's practice.

203
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,740
You could exercise on this baby walker.

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
To touch the toys,
you must come this way.

205
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,980
- Gosh, how cute.
- He wants to touch them.

206
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,010
(Like this?)

207
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,550
Look. Let's go.

208
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,480
Haru, walk to the side.

209
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
(To the side?)

210
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,980
To the side?

211
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,120
- He tried to move to the side.
- Right.

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
(Haru turns to the side at that moment.)

213
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,090
(He was looking at the toys.)

214
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,090
(He's ready to walk now!)

215
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,960
So he had to face the front.

216
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
(Dad,
is this what you want me to do?)
Right.

217
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,300
Go ahead.

218
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,640
Wait, he's walking.

219
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,140
(Will my Haru...)

220
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,110
(really be able to walk?)

221
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,210
He's walking.

222
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,440
- This is how he'll start walking.
- My gosh.

223
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,780
- Oh, my.
- He's doing a great job.

224
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,550
Haru, come here.

225
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,650
Do you want to try?

226
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,450
Why don't you try, Haru?

227
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,520
There you go.

228
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,090
There you go. Okay.

229
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,660
That's it. Yes.

230
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,760
Gosh, you can do it.

231
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,100
(It's not easy.)

232
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,200
Come here.

233
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,140
You've come so far.
This is how much you walked.

234
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,740
(But he doesn't give up
until he finishes.)

235
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,050
(He takes his first step
toward his dad.)

236
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,450
- Oh, my. He's good.
- My goodness.

237
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,320
Haru. Oh, my!

238
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,690
- Gosh.
- All right. Come to me.

239
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,790
(A little more...)

240
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,690
Come here. I'll give you a hug.

241
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,290
(Pushing himself to the end)

242
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,260
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

243
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,360
(Look how far
Haru walked on his own!)

244
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,200
Haru is quite athletic.

245
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,930
- He's quite strong.
- Yes.

246
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,400
(Haru used to squirm
only in one spot before.)

247
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Right.

248
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,040
(He started to hop up and down...)

249
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,380
(and crawl.)

250
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,440
- Nicely done.
- How cute.

251
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,880
(He can now walk!)

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,250
(As Haru is growing every day,
he's never the same.)

253
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,750
My gosh, I was surprised. I'm sorry.

254
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,150
I keep getting startled.

255
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,860
(As Haru is growing every day,
he's never the same.)

256
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,130
It was his first time trying it out.

257
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,260
But he still managed to take a few steps
on the baby walker.

258
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,230
And watching him walk...

259
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
It was a touching moment.

260
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,900
(It was a touching moment.)

261
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,770
Since you just exercised,
you should drink some baby formula.

262
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,740
We must read the instruction
from your mother.

263
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,880
(I almost forgot.)

264
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,750
(Saya always puts a lot of effort
into her letters.)

265
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,180
- Gosh.
- Seriously, Saya is amazing.

266
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,410
(The most adorable instruction
in the world)

267
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,850
They are the cutest drawings ever.

268
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,890
(Looking at her handwriting
makes him fall in love with her.)

269
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,920
You'll be surprised again
to see the instruction from her.

270
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,630
My gosh. Your mother drew again.
Look at her drawing.

271
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,100
"Cooked by his dad."

272
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,870
- Her drawing melts my heart.
- Gosh.

273
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,470
(Haru is gnawing on the meat.)

274
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,600
"Haru's first meat."

275
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,700
Meat?"

276
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,770
Haru. Do you think you can eat meat?
Yes?

277
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,880
(163 days after his birth)

278
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,540
(He started with the soft rice gruel
at 163 days old.)

279
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,550
(164 days after his birth)

280
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,950
(He graduated from eating
his 1st carrot at 164 days old.)

281
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,250
(223 days after his birth)

282
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,720
(Haru will eat meat now?)

283
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,830
"I already cooked the meat for him."

284
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,030
"It's in the freezer."

285
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,460
"Try feeding him one cube."

286
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,700
Okay.

287
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,470
It's meat. So she was concerned...

288
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,100
- that I might mess it up.
- Right.

289
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,140
- She ground the meat, right?
- Yes.

290
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,200
(Saya prepared the meat for him
in advance.)

291
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,540
since it's his 1st time,
I should only give him 1 cube, right?

292
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,570
Just 1? Yes, just 1.

293
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,080
(Like instructed,
he only takes out one cube of it.)

294
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,280
Saya is amazing.

295
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,180
When did she prepare all this?

296
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,750
(He just has to microwave the food.
And that's it.)

297
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,850
(Meanwhile, Haru...)

298
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,560
(Fully stretching his legs)

299
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,990
Gosh, look at his thick thighs.

300
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,560
Check out his bread-like thighs.

301
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,630
(He's satisfying his hunger
with the baby formula.)

302
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,300
You must be so proud of him.
Look at him drinking it alone.

303
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
- Gosh, how adorable.
- My goodness.

304
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,870
He can already hold the bottle
and drink it himself.

305
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,070
- My gosh.
- Look at his legs.

306
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,710
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

307
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,050
- That's...
- How cute.

308
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,680
(I can smell meat now.)

309
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,090
Joining the show was
the right decision for me.

310
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,720
I could have missed this moment
as I was busy.

311
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,790
- Right.
- But the show captured the moment.

312
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,290
- And I get to watch it.
- Right.

313
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,860
- The footage will last too.
- Yes.

314
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,390
- I'm so happy with this show.
- Yes.

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,300
All right. Haru.

316
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
(Haru's meat prepared by Saya
is ready.)

317
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,030
Gosh, you'll get to taste meat
for the first time today.

318
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,100
- You know? Your mother made this.
- How cute.

319
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,610
I eat imported beef. You know?

320
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,440
(I eat imported beef. You know?)

321
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,380
She only used Korean beef for it?

322
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,350
Right. Dads...

323
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,450
It's the premium cut of Korean beef.

324
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,920
Are you ready for some meat?

325
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,480
Are you?

326
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,320
Haru. Here.

327
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,690
Let's try some of your food.
It's meat.

328
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,830
Haru, are you happy?

329
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,230
This is your first time having meat.
I don't know if you'll like it.

330
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,160
(But this is Shim Haru
we're talking about.)

331
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,860
(When he had carrots
for the first time...)

332
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,730
- He didn't like carrots.
- Right.

333
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,540
(When he had bananas
for the first time...)

334
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,540
Oh, no.

335
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,240
Haru will taste meat
for the first time.

336
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,980
(Please like the meat, Haru!)

337
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,610
Here.

338
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,550
(Did he just grab
the spoon himself?)

339
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,150
- He grabbed it and ate it.
- Yes.

340
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,890
(Haru has a big mouthful of it.)

341
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,090
He grabbed the spoon himself.

342
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,560
(And is he smiling?)

343
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,630
(This is tasty.)

344
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,260
Gosh, I can't believe
Haru is having meat.

345
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,630
Here.

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,170
Let go of it. Come on.

347
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,270
(Dad, hurry!)

348
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,840
Here.

349
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
(Happily swinging his legs)

350
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Here.

351
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,640
(He seems to focus on the spoon.)

352
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
(He grabs it again.)

353
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,450
- Oh, my. He took the spoon.
- Right.

354
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,850
- Yes, he took the spoon.
- You know?

355
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,180
Are you used to the flavor?

356
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,950
(Humming)

357
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,490
He's gnawing on the spoon...

358
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,820
as if he was gnawing on a rib.

359
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,290
He just wanted to have meat
from the beginning.

360
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,290
- Right.
- That's what he wanted at first.

361
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,630
He wasn't happy that
you fed him carrots and bananas.

362
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,900
(Dad, this isn't meat.)

363
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,570
- He's a meat lover.
- Exactly.

364
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,170
"Do you think I'm a vegetarian?"

365
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,200
- "You should've given me meat."
- "Why must I..."

366
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm sorry.
I only fed you vegetables.

367
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,170
Is it tasty?

368
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,910
(I'll give you a big-toe-up.)

369
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,710
- He gave you a big-toe-up.
- Right.

370
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,820
Good boy.

371
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,150
(Haru is enjoying every bite of it.)

372
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,950
There you go.

373
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,090
- The spoon...
- He's loving it.

374
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,490
(Oh, my. This is tasty.)

375
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,960
You finished everything.

376
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,690
This is the last spoonful.

377
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,330
- You're loving it.
- Gosh.

378
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,070
- Gosh, he ate everything up.
- He finished it.

379
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,530
- He really enjoyed it.
- This is nice.

380
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,240
(He's very satisfied
with his meal today.)

381
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,310
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

382
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,980
- You'll have to keep eating...
- Yes?

383
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,410
imported beef.

384
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,180
Let him eat all the Korean beef.

385
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,550
- Yes. He'll get the Korean beef.
- Get the premium cut again.

386
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,880
- You must work hard now.
- Get the premium cut.

387
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,020
- Yes.
- Right.

388
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,790
All right, let's go.

389
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,990
(Where have the Shims arrived at?)

390
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,160
Where are they going?

391
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,990
(It's filled with water.)

392
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,990
Water?

393
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,160
A fountain? What's that?

394
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,700
My wife will be away for a while.

395
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,630
I thought about spending a quiet day
with my son.

396
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,970
I wanted just the two of us
to go on vacation.

397
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,140
So Haru will go to the swimming pool
for the first time today.

398
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,240
The swimming pool?

399
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,310
What's this?

400
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,750
- There's a pool just for babies?
- That's interesting.

401
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes.

402
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,250
Where is this place?

403
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,420
It's a swimming pool
just for babies.

404
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,590
- I want to take...
- What?

405
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,060
my child there too

406
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,690
Ta-da.

407
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,360
Your pants went up.

408
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,290
(A stylish fedora)

409
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,060
He's dressed for the swimming pool.

410
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,130
- Right.
- Seriously.

411
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,730
Oh, my.

412
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,670
(How about taking
Watermelon Haru home today?)

413
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,300
Watermelon is a great summer fruit.

414
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,570
So I'm wearing a watermelon shirt.

415
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,240
He's dressed as a watermelon too.
Then we set out on our vacation.

416
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,040
- The Watermelon Father and Son.
- Yes.

417
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,810
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

418
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,050
Welcome, Haru.

419
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,920
- Okay. We made a reservation.
- Hello, Haru.

420
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,620
- Come this way.
- Okay.

421
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,050
You can change him here.

422
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,020
I see. His name is written there.

423
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Yes.

424
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,230
- There's a designated spot for him.
- Yes.

425
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,060
(He puts Haru down.)

426
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,230
(Unbuttoning)

427
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,930
- You can put that down first.
- You can easily pull the buttons?

428
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,930
Yes.

429
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,500
It's as if
you were splitting open a watermelon.

430
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,900
(It looks as if
he was splitting open a watermelon.)

431
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,210
(When he's having fun
unbuttoning Haru's shirt...)

432
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,040
(Grabbing)

433
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,210
He grabbed his nametag.

434
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,450
He grabbed it just like that.

435
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,550
He got his nametag.

436
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,420
(How did he know that was his nametag?)

437
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,520
Gosh, he won't let go of his nametag.

438
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,290
All right. This diaper is waterproof.

439
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,890
(Chuckling)

440
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,060
This is so cute.

441
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,270
Haru,
these are waterproof swim pants.

442
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,830
- So cute.
- Okay.

443
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,500
The size...

444
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm not sure if they will fit you
since you're a supersized baby.

445
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,440
It was quite tough to put them on him.

446
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,640
It really was tough.

447
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,850
Are they...

448
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,080
- supposed to be this tight?
- Yes, they are.

449
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,750
The waterproof diaper is supposed...

450
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,420
to prevent his poop from leaking out.

451
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,950
- It prevents his poop from leaking?
- Yes.

452
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,020
- His thighs...
- Right, they are quite huge.

453
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,290
Yes. His belly and thighs are big
because he was born a big baby.

454
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,730
His chest frame is already developing.

455
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,730
(His chest frame is forming
at 7 months old?)

456
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,060
- At seven months old?
- Yes.

457
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,600
He was born with such DNA.

458
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,700
(Haru will become a muscular man one day.)

459
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,670
- I see. He must wear...
- Oh, my.

460
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,110
- a swimsuit on top of that.
- My wife got it for him.

461
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,940
One, two. Jump.

462
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,040
My gosh.

463
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,610
- He's a pineapple.
- He's a pineapple.

464
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,740
- So cute.
- How cute.

465
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,710
That's his pineapple hairstyle.

466
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,210
- To match his pineapple hairstyle?
- Yes.

467
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,250
- Is he already warming up his legs?
- That's a warm-up exercise.

468
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,050
Let's get him comfortable
in the water first and continue.

469
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,190
They're all boys.

470
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,660
Hello.

471
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,960
(Haru has never met
babies his age before.)

472
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,030
Are they my fellow dads?

473
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,330
- Yes. They're all boys.
- I see.

474
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,360
They're 7 and 6 months old.

475
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,530
(Kim Do Gyeom: 7 months old,
Han Jo Sung: 6 months old)

476
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,100
They're quite big.

477
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,770
- They're all big.
- Right.

478
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,800
- Wait. Gosh, just like that?
- Yes.

479
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,240
Have you done this before?

480
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,540
- Yes, they're regular members here.
- Yes, we are.

481
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,010
(Welcome, Haru.)

482
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,640
- They're regular members there?
- Let me start slowly with him.

483
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,150
My gosh.

484
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,710
- This is Haru's first time there.
- Yes.

485
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,250
Right. It is.

486
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,750
I wonder if he liked it.

487
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,890
- I couldn't see his face then.
- My gosh.

488
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,390
- Let me start slowly with him.
- All right. Let's do it.

489
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,090
(Carefully putting him down)

490
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,630
(What do you think, Haru?)

491
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,930
You're in the water, Haru.

492
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,960
- You're in.
- Haru.

493
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,560
Haru, these are your friends.

494
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,800
- He's excited.
- He's playing with the water.

495
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,030
- Yes. He's excited.
- Right.

496
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,700
He's excited right now.

497
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
(Splashing)

498
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,070
- He's good in the water.
- Gosh.

499
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,410
Haru doesn't like the process.

500
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,940
- He likes skipping steps.
- "Why..."

501
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,040
- Let's move to the other pool.
- Okay.

502
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,410
Let's go, Haru.

503
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,380
(Let's head over
to the deeper pool.)

504
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,720
Look at you. You're excited.

505
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,020
One, two, three.

506
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,620
(Let's brace ourselves and go.)

507
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,220
- I'm worried about that pool.
- Oh, my.

508
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,660
- It's his first time there.
- The water looks pretty deep.

509
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,790
- Yes.
- Right?

510
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,690
You too, Haru?

511
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,760
(Is he slightly nervous?)

512
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,360
All right, let's go inside.

513
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,130
He's going in first.

514
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,870
(His experienced peers go in first.)

515
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,400
- All right.
- Oh, my.

516
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,340
(Looking natural and comfortable)

517
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,670
- You guys look so comfortable.
- It's gotten big.

518
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,240
You guys look so comfortable
in the water.

519
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,540
(Is this fun?)

520
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,650
All right. Shall we get ready too?

521
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,480
(Why don't I give it a try too?)

522
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,720
Let's go in, Haru.

523
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,590
Here, Haru.

524
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,290
Haru, this is a warm-up exercise.

525
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,520
(He puts on the cute neck float.)

526
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,230
(Swinging his feet
out of excitement)

527
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,330
- His warm-up exercise is great.
- How adorable.

528
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,700
All right. Let's get you inside.

529
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,530
- Haru.
- Go on.

530
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,700
- This is your first time.
- Shall we?

531
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,140
- I wonder how he'll react.
- Dive in.

532
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,270
- His legs...
- Haru is already in the water...

533
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,540
in his head.

534
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,040
- He's already moving his legs.
- Right.

535
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,810
- I bet he'll be great in the water.
- Your friends want you to join.

536
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,710
- My gosh.
- What's going to happen?

537
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,250
- My gosh.
- There you go.

538
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,690
- Gosh, look at him moving his legs.
- My gosh.

539
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,690
(Dad Shim is even more excited
than Haru.)

540
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,330
(Haru dives into the deep water.)

541
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
My gosh.

542
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,230
(Kicking in the water)

543
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,070
- That's so adorable.
- My gosh. So cute.

544
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,070
- He's totally ready.
- He's so cute.

545
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,140
- He's floating on his own.
- How adorable.

546
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,200
He's so cute.

547
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,340
- My gosh.
- He's great at kicking.

548
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,640
- Isn't he great at kicking?
- Yes.

549
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,880
(Looking super stable in the water)

550
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,220
Isn't this his first time?

551
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,080
- Yes. It's his first time.
- But he can kick in the water.

552
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,690
(Haru's first dive to the water
is successful.)

553
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,120
His legs are already straight.

554
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,320
He's so good.

555
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,790
- Usually, babies don't kick...
- Yes.

556
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,030
on the first day.
They just stay still...

557
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,400
- because they're nervous.
- Okay.

558
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
- But Haru...
- Look. He's kicking.

559
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,970
- Yes. He can even kick.
- He's so good.

560
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,330
(Get nervous? What's that?)

561
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,470
(Haru has already gotten used
to the water.)

562
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,210
(Haru seems peaceful
on the outside.)

563
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,350
(But underwater...)

564
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,950
Babies who have been here before
stay still and float around.

565
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,650
- They move with the water.
- Right.

566
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,720
But Haru keeps on kicking like that.

567
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,360
Haru looks so cute
with the neck float.

568
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,460
- Seriously.
- Right.

569
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,360
- Gosh, everyone is great.
- Right?

570
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,760
Haru is so good. Seriously.

571
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,330
He can change directions too.

572
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,400
He can change directions
just like that.

573
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,740
- He spins.
- He can float on his belly.

574
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,570
Then he can float on his back too.

575
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,840
Oh, my.

576
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,070
(His spins look professional.)

577
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,380
This...

578
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
(Haru pulls off
the direction change perfectly.)

579
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,410
- Gosh. What?
- Just like that.

580
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,350
That was his first time in the pool.

581
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,580
(He can make a turn...)

582
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,350
- Gosh.
- He can also make a turn.

583
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,620
(as well as a professional swimmer.)

584
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,190
That's really interesting.
How can he make a turn?

585
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,790
He can do that on his first day?

586
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,130
Haru is quite good at this.

587
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,300
- He's good.
- Yes, he's good at kicking.

588
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,900
- He's having fun.
- Even I'm proud of him.

589
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,340
(But on the surface...)

590
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,040
- He looks so beautiful.
- Yes.

591
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,210
- He has such big eyes.
- Yes.

592
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,680
- He has beautiful double eyelids.
- They complimented my son's looks.

593
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,180
- Well done, Haru.
- Great job.

594
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,450
Gosh, you did it.

595
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,550
Right?

596
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,350
(But why are they watching
only Haru?)

597
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,790
- He's so beautiful.
- Gosh, how cute.

598
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,460
He has my wife's eyes.

599
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,290
He has long eyelashes too.

600
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,760
- His eyelashes are so long.
- He has big eyes.

601
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,130
(Diving into Haru's charm)

602
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,170
- I feel so proud.
- It's not easy to find...

603
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,570
another baby beautiful
when your baby is there too.

604
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,570
Right.

605
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,940
A lot of people tell me that
my wife and I resemble each other.

606
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,440
(Actually, he's been...)

607
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
How much do they weigh?

608
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,050
- About 9.5kg. Yes.
- About 9.5kg?

609
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,910
- What about your son?
- He weighs 8kg.

610
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,050
- He weighs 8kg?
- Yes.

611
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,650
My gosh.

612
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,990
The other babies are big too.

613
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,050
Right.

614
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
(The mothers are surprised.)

615
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,360
- The mothers are surprised.
- They're surprised.

616
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
- Well, Haru...
- They're only seven months old.

617
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,190
(Compared to other babies his age,)

618
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,790
(Haru's thighs are much bigger.)

619
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,300
My gosh, look at his thighs.

620
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,960
- He's in a different weight class.
- They're much bigger.

621
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,030
Right.

622
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,970
- Gosh, look at my son.
- Oh, my.

623
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,240
(Overwhelmingly bigger)

624
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,900
He has a lot of hair.

625
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,910
- Say hello to your friend.
- Who do you resemble?

626
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,570
I've never seen a baby
with such thick hair.

627
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,980
Right?

628
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,410
It's like a college kid is visiting
a middle school.

629
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,780
(Haru is nicknamed
Maned Lion for a reason.)

630
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,980
That's how thick his hair is.

631
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,250
- Right.
- Yes.

632
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm envious.

633
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,850
I'm so envious.

634
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,620
The dads seem to envy him
especially more.

635
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,090
- Right.
- The dads seem to envy him.

636
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,060
- A lot of older guys...
- They're sensitive about hair.

637
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,560
The clip of me...

638
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,960
- drying Haru's hair went viral...
- Yes.

639
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,260
- on many websites.
- Yes.

640
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,630
It was one
of the most liked comments.

641
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,130
A lot of older guys
really envied Haru.

642
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,230
- Of course.
- Yes.

643
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,470
"Give me some of your hair."

644
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,700
- Right.
- That was in the comment.

645
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,640
- This is the dream for many dads.
- That's...

646
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
- Yes.
- Right.

647
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,840
(A dream for dads
all over the world)

648
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,210
All those who have a hair loss problem...

649
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,750
would wish they could be reborn as Haru.

650
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,550
- He's adorable in every way.
- Absolutely.

651
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,720
- Everything about him is precious.
- But especially his hair...

652
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,680
This is Haru's first time
in his life...

653
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,990
meeting other babies around his age.

654
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,250
- Really?
- Yes.

655
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
(He looks as if
he were with friends in the neighborhood.)

656
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,290
It's amazing that he's not shy
around the other babies.

657
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,260
The other babies are having fun too.

658
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,800
They must have a lot to talk about
as they're around the same age.

659
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,900
- Sharing information and all.
- That's right.

660
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,300
I told myself
to take Haru outside more often...

661
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,510
so that he could meet
other babies around his age.

662
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,010
- How adorable.
- He's not afraid of water.

663
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,270
And he's so gentle and meek.

664
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,510
Now let's change the swimming tube
and swim in a larger pool.

665
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,480
- Pose like Superman.
- Here we go.

666
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,680
- Pose like Superman.
- Superman.

667
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,980
- What is that?
- Oh, nice.

668
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,720
- You lie on your belly on it.
- Superman.

669
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,620
- That's Haru's specialty.
- Oh, it's not shaped like a donut.

670
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,960
- Yes, posing like Superman.
- He always poses like Superman.

671
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,090
- That's right.
- Oh, right.

672
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,590
(He seems very comfortable.)

673
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,100
They can kick
with this type of swimming tube.

674
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,370
(Flailing)

675
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,800
Kick. That's good. Keep going.

676
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,440
- He's great at it, as you can see.
- Keep kicking.

677
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,740
That's good. Way to go.

678
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Exactly.

679
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,770
Oh, my. He's kicking.

680
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,840
(He seems to have gotten
the hang of it completely.)

681
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Good job.

682
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,710
Oh, my. Haru is doing well.

683
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,250
Haru did a great job
when he learned soccer,

684
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,050
so I thought
he could become a soccer player.

685
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,220
But today, I found out...

686
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,490
that he was so good at swimming.

687
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,590
- Oh, my.
- Indeed.

688
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,990
He's so good at swimming.

689
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
(Impressed)

690
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,190
You know how plump his legs are,
right?

691
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,460
I didn't think he had strong legs.

692
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,730
But I saw
how he kicked in the water.

693
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,430
- Gosh.
- Indeed.

694
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,240
It seemed so easy for him.

695
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,270
While swimming in one direction,
he turned around.

696
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,510
Then he swam forward
and turned around again.

697
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,510
Did you see my baby swimming?

698
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,610
Yes, we saw it.

699
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,710
- We saw it. Of course.
- Did you see that?

700
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,320
He could swim freestyle
and backstroke.

701
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,050
He was amazing.

702
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,250
- Exactly. He's incredible.
- He also moves his arms...

703
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,460
Oh, that brat.

704
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,190
I think I should encourage him
to become a swimmer.

705
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,000
Haru seems so comfortable.

706
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,930
- Oh, my.
- The way he kicks is so cute.

707
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,000
I know, right? He looks so cute.

708
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,740
(Do I look okay?)

709
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,140
How does he... He seems so relaxed.

710
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
- As if he were in a sauna.
- Exactly.

711
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
That's exactly my point.

712
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,420
Good. That's great. Enjoy yourself
as if you were on vacation.

713
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,050
- He might fall asleep at this rate.
- Like he's on the beach.

714
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,120
Here you go, Haru.

715
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,450
(If he has rice snacks
on top of everything...)

716
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,060
You can eat it. It's a gift for you.

717
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,820
It's like he's in the Maldives.

718
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,390
- Right.
- He's even wearing sunglasses.

719
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,930
- He's in the Maldives.
- He's on vacation.

720
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,060
- He's on vacation.
- Exactly.

721
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,900
Oh, my.
That must be fun and relaxing.

722
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,570
He's in paradise now.

723
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,940
Peekaboo.

724
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,210
One, two. There we go.
You did a great job today.

725
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,040
Good job, Haru.

726
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,040
Yes, you too, Do Gyeom.
You did great as well.

727
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
(My friends,
it was nice meeting you.)

728
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,910
You must've been excited
to meet new friends.

729
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,250
It was great. He enjoyed swimming
as if he were on vacation.

730
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,550
- As if he were in a sauna.
- Haru had so much fun today.

731
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,790
He really enjoyed himself.

732
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,190
Now let's do what we're good at.

733
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,860
Let's go and bathe our babies.

734
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,330
- You can bathe Haru here.
- Got it.

735
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,460
If you hold him,
I'll help him take it off.

736
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,570
- Seat him in this direction.
- Okay.

737
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,100
- So I should seat him here.
- Yes.

738
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,770
There's a bathing place
right beside the swimming pool.

739
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,540
- You can bathe your baby afterward.
- Yes.

740
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,110
Haru, let's wash your body first.

741
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,750
This is an unfamiliar place for you.

742
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,880
But I'll hold you like this...

743
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
- and wash your body.
- My, he's so meek.

744
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,420
Haru, stand up just for a while.

745
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,650
(Stand up
so I can wash your thighs.)

746
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,590
(Looking strong)

747
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,690
- How cute. His legs look strong.
- His plump legs are jiggling.

748
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,960
Way to go, you're doing well

749
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,230
(Stop singing!)

750
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,830
(Did you hate that much
to hear me sing?)

751
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,270
Please don't hit me.

752
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,510
It'll be over in a second.
I need to concentrate.

753
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,510
You may be a bit uncomfortable
as this place is unfamiliar to you.

754
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,080
But Haru, don't worry.

755
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm right by your side.

756
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,080
Good. Hold that.

757
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,280
That's how it's done.

758
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,420
Hyoung Tak is really good
at bathing Haru...

759
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,250
- keeping him relaxed.
- Exactly.

760
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,020
You're feeling good?

761
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,590
Do you need a hand?

762
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,690
- You seem very skillful.
- Yes.

763
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,790
- Thank you.
- You're really good at this.

764
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,000
I've been bathing him
for seven months.

765
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,260
Do you bathe him all by yourself?

766
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,600
Yes, I do it all by myself.

767
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,200
- My wife just prepares a towel.
- Oh, really?

768
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Yes. All she does is
dry him with a towel.

769
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,170
I really made a lot of effort...

770
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,640
to make him like to bathe.

771
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,280
He never misses a chance
to brag about himself.

772
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,010
He bragged...

773
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,580
that he had been bathing Haru
all by himself.

774
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,350
This is the highlight.

775
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Shampoo...

776
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,220
(He washes the top part of his head
with one pump of shampoo.)

777
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Two.

778
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,360
The sides of the head.

779
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,390
(He washes the sides
with another pump of shampoo.)

780
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,290
- Three.
- Of course.

781
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,030
- Three... Four pumps.
- Four pumps.

782
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,460
One pump of shampoo isn't enough
to wash his hair...

783
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,330
- as he has a lot of hair.
- Exactly.

784
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,140
It's not enough.
There would be no bubbles.

785
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,800
(After using four pumps of shampoo,
he rinses Haru's hair.)

786
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,270
- We'll finish up now.
- That must be refreshing.

787
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,440
Let's just rinse your hair,
and that'll be it.

788
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:00,540
(Meanwhile, the other babies...)

789
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,210
(Their parents washed their hair
in an instant.)

790
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,820
(They finished bathing their babies
in only 10 minutes!)

791
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,220
I didn't know
it could be done that quickly.

792
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,650
I turned around,
and no one was left there.

793
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,860
While he was washing Haru's hair,

794
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,660
- Doing deadlifts would be more...
- the other parents...

795
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,890
- left the place.
- It would be less tiring.

796
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,460
(Hyoung Tak barely finished
bathing Haru despite the back pain.)

797
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,130
I had to rinse the soap...

798
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,760
- off his body,
- That's right.

799
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,530
- which took a long time.
- Exactly.

800
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,800
I'll towel dry your hair...

801
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,540
before using a hairdryer.

802
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,540
I'm a little jealous of the parents
with a baby with not so much hair.

803
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,510
It must've been tiring.

804
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,010
(Your friends washed their hair
like they wash their faces.)

805
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,680
- That's right.
- That's it.

806
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:44,720
(The other babies left
a long time ago.)

807
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,390
It's a lot of work
to dry his hair too.

808
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,120
Exactly. Now I have to dry his hair.

809
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,430
The other families had left
a long time before that.

810
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,160
The swimming pool is closed now.

811
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,100
(I feel so refreshed.)

812
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
His skin looks so clean and dry.

813
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,230
- He's in a good mood now.
- He smiles so easily.

814
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,040
- He seems happy.
- He's in a good mood.

815
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,100
How adorable.

816
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,140
- His smile makes tiredness go away.
- Of course.

817
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,210
I really like it
when you make that sound.

818
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,010
He really is a smiling fairy.

819
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,280
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

820
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,380
Do you not have a hairdryer here?

821
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,280
- We have a hairdryer.
- When the others were here,

822
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,080
I didn't hear
the sound of a hairdryer.

823
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,350
Haru has a lot of hair,
much more than other babies.

824
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,020
- Yes.
- So he needs a hairdryer.

825
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,330
But as for the babies
who don't have a lot of hair...

826
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,630
- Right. They just need a towel.
- You can just...

827
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,200
towel dry their hair, and that's it.

828
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,230
Oh, I see.
They don't use a hairdryer?

829
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,470
- No, they don't.
- I was really surprised...

830
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,470
when I heard that other parents
didn't use a hairdryer.

831
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,470
(Culture shock)

832
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,870
(The final step of bathing is always
to dry his hair with a hairdryer.)

833
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,440
(Haru is used to it
and comfortable doing it.)

834
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,950
(He's just used to it.)

835
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,250
- My, he's so cute.
- All right.

836
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,250
(He's just used to it.)

837
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,780
Haru.

838
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,120
(Yes?)

839
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,360
No other babies use a hairdryer,
apparently.

840
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
(So I was the only one
who didn't know that.)

841
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,390
I didn't know that.

842
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,860
That's interesting.

843
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,600
(Hey, guys, why don't you use it?
It feels so good!)

844
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,430
- How cute.
- Now he's babbling.

845
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,640
Gosh, my arm hurts.

846
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,770
My arm hurts so much, Haru.

847
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,870
He has to hold him with one arm...

848
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,340
and dry his hair with the other.

849
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,380
(But Haru likes to have his hair dry
with a hairdryer.)

850
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,580
(Singing)

851
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,820
(Say you like me)

852
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,890
- Isn't that a commercial jingle?
- Yes, it is.

853
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,290
The song comes to my mind
when I see his wet hair.

854
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,790
I hope he'll get cast
for a TV commercial.

855
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,260
(Enjoying the wind)

856
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,200
Look how his hair is blown
by the wind.

857
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,860
He looks incredibly adorable.

858
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,070
His hair is now clean and dry.

859
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,170
(Done. His hair is clean and dry,
and he's feeling refreshed.)

860
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,910
(Let's get dressed and go home.)

861
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,540
- Let's get dressed, Haru.
- The watermelon outfit.

862
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,140
By the way, you did a great job
at swimming earlier.

863
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,110
Tell me
if you want to swim again tomorrow.

864
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,520
I'll book a swimming lesson for you.

865
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,680
You should tell me
with your own voice.

866
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,420
(You should tell me
with your own voice.)

867
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Wait. Hold on.

868
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,920
- "With his own voice?"
- That means he won't book it.

869
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,060
- How cute.
- Hold on.

870
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,960
- Until he speaks with his voice.
- Now that you've enjoyed swimming,

871
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,860
let's go home, Haru. One, two.

872
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,700
Here we go.

873
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,100
You're so adorable.

874
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,670
Haru did a really good job
at swimming.

875
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,740
He did a great job.
He's all grown up now.

876
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,140
I think it was successful.

877
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,840
Also, I decided...

878
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,640
to let him keep learning to swim.

879
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,280
Next time,

880
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,020
I want to take him there with my wife.

881
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,120
She's not with us
whenever Haru does a memorable thing.

882
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,190
(She's not with us
whenever Haru does a memorable thing.)

883
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,720
(Mom, you should come with us next time.)

884
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,930
(The Return of Superman)

885
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,560
(Vivid red)

886
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,030
- Look at those vivid red socks.
- Oh, my. What?

887
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,470
Yes. That suits him well.

888
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,270
Doesn't he look great
in that outfit?

889
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,870
(Kim Jung Woo,
the delinquent student?)

890
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,470
- My, look at him.
- It's like a scene from a movie.

891
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,740
(Give me your hand.)

892
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,770
Isn't that a uniform
for military training in schools?

893
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,110
- Yes, it is.
- That's right.

894
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,110
Eun Woo looks so great
in a school uniform.

895
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,880
This is an amazing way
of making an entrance.

896
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,050
(Kim Eun Woo, the model student)

897
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,420
- He's obviously a model student.
- That's right.

898
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,050
Both of them look great
in their outfits.

899
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,050
(The Woo Brothers are back!)

900
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,460
- He looks so cute.
- Doesn't his frowning face...

901
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,590
suit his turned up collar?

902
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,030
His frowning face looks so cute.

903
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,400
(Kim Jun Ho after the play is over)

904
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,630
- I look the best in that outfit.
- He looks cool.

905
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,630
They remind me
of the movie "Friend."

906
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,970
- Or "The Spirit of Jeet Kune Do."
- Look at Jun Ho's father.

907
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,340
Oh, my. Look at Jun Ho's father.

908
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,800
(Kim Chung Woong, Hwaseong Grandpa,
reminds of the movie "Silmido.")

909
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,910
- He looks great.
- Indeed.

910
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,940
- Hwaseong Grandpa is here too.
- Oh, my.

911
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,910
(The Kim family went on a trip
to celebrate Grandpa's birthday.)

912
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,380
(Thanks to Eun Woo's cute acts,
Grandpa had a happy day.)

913
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,520
My, he's so cute.

914
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,150
(Thanks to Eun Woo's cute acts,
Grandpa had a happy day.)

915
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,450
Eun Woo is so good
at doing cute acts.

916
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,420
(But there was one thing missing.)

917
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,920
(I wish Jung Woo was here too.)

918
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
- Oh, right.
- Jung Woo couldn't join them.

919
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,290
That's right. He couldn't.

920
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,260
Anyone can recognize those ankles.

921
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,230
(Jung Woo is here too.)

922
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,970
- Their outfits are so cute.
- Indeed.

923
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,030
(Where is this place
the Kim family has come to?)

924
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,400
(Ganghwa-gun, Incheon)

925
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,270
- I see.
- Oh, they went to Ganghwa-gun.

926
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,970
(Ganghwa-gun, Incheon)

927
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,180
(In Ganghwa-gun, the northwestern tip
of the Korean Peninsula...)

928
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,080
I visited the northernmost tip
of Ganghwa-gun.

929
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,150
- Really?
- Yes.

930
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,450
I went to Gyodong Island.

931
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,820
There's a place called
Gyodong Island in Ganghwa-gun.

932
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,850
Yes.

933
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,650
(An island in the northwest
of Ganghwa, 2.6km from North Korea)

934
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,260
You can see North Korea from there.

935
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,460
- Really?
- When the weather is good.

936
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,990
- Over there.
- Goodness.

937
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,330
- You can really see that?
- Yes.

938
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,600
- It's true.
- You can see it so clearly?

939
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,430
(Residents from Hwanghae Province
settled there after the Korean War.)

940
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,770
It's where the refugees settled...

941
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,640
after the Korean War.

942
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,700
Is that so?

943
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,770
I've been to many places
to film shows,

944
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,110
- but I've never been there.
- That's right.

945
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,570
- It's my first time hearing it.
- Right.

946
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,180
- You have to cross a bridge.
- Yes.

947
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,610
The first location...

948
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,380
is Daeryong Market
which has a retro mood.

949
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,580
Daeryong?

950
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,250
- Candy.
- When...

951
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,990
Seriously.

952
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,360
(It still has the murals
and signboards from those days.)

953
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,860
- The theater.
- It's totally retro.

954
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,130
- Yes.
- It's so...

955
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,590
The zoomers would like this.

956
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes.

957
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,760
(Gyodong Daeryong Market
is rising in popularity...)

958
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,930
(thanks to the new retro trend.)

959
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,070
You know that retro vibe, right?

960
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,500
- Yes.
- There's a market with that vibe.

961
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,770
That's why we wore these outfits.

962
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,710
- I see.
- I see.

963
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,210
- He looks so good in that.
- There was a reason.

964
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,140
You and Jung Woo
look great in that outfit.

965
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,050
- They really look good.
- Really.

966
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,510
It suits him even better
because he frowns.

967
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,180
(It suits him even better
because he frowns.)

968
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,620
Why is Jung Woo frowning so much?

969
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,250
He's stuck in the character.

970
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,490
(I'm staying true to the concept!)

971
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,560
Eun Woo and I look
like model students.

972
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
(We're like model students.)

973
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,230
- Goodness.
- I know.

974
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,130
- He looks like the church guy.
- Right.

975
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,430
Jung Woo looks so good
in that outfit.

976
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,900
They're brothers,

977
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,240
but how are they so different?

978
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,740
But the two walking in front
look like the type...

979
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,980
who'd get their bus fare taken
by the ones behind.

980
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,210
- Right. They're following us.
- They're following you...

981
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,710
with a frown.

982
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,350
Come here.

983
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,720
- What do you want to eat?
- Come and taste this.

984
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
What do you want to eat?

985
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,790
- Tasting?
- Stop.

986
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,950
Hello.

987
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,990
Grandfathers
would have eaten this a lot.

988
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,620
- Goodness.
- Hello.

989
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,630
- Hello.
- Try this.

990
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,060
Nostalgic snacks.

991
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,960
(I know that.)

992
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,200
That's the old...

993
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,100
- That...
- Those are jellies.

994
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,130
- Seriously.
- Yes.

995
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,370
Yes? I guess you ate those a lot.

996
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,270
Goodness.
Are you talking about that snack?

997
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,470
- That snack.
- That snack.

998
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,210
You don't know what that is, do you?

999
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,410
- I know it.
- You do?

1000
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,210
My grandfather and my grandmother
liked that a lot.

1001
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,110
- Really?
- I remember eating with them.

1002
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,550
- Seriously.
- Here.

1003
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,720
They have that.

1004
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,290
This is good. Try it.

1005
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,620
(Grandpa is enjoying it.)

1006
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,660
It's tasty.

1007
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,790
Goodness.

1008
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,460
(Have some of Jung Woo's snacks
too.)

1009
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,690
Do you want some sikhye, Father?

1010
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,560
- Cold sikhye.
- They should have a sweet drink.

1011
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,700
Sikhye. Hold on.

1012
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,330
- I'll have the strawberry slush.
- Strawberry?

1013
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,600
- Yes.
- Really? He likes strawberry slush.

1014
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,900
(Strawberry)

1015
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,840
(Give me some strawberries.)

1016
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,840
(I ate strawberries and burped.)

1017
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,610
(A love for strawberries passed down
through 3 generations,)

1018
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,120
(starting with the grandfather.)

1019
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,620
Hold on.

1020
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,990
I'll have the strawberry slush.

1021
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,020
What about Eun Woo? Sikhye?

1022
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,220
Do you also want
the strawberry slush, Jung Woo?

1023
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,890
(This is it, Jung Woo!)

1024
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,930
It's really refreshing.

1025
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,600
We'll have a cup of sikhye.

1026
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,200
- Jun Ho drinks sikhye.
- Yes.

1027
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,500
- Isn't it too cold?
- It's sweet and nice.

1028
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,440
Is it okay? Isn't it too cold?

1029
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,710
(It's refreshing and sweet.)

1030
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,710
He's cute.

1031
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,410
- He's getting more handsome.
- Right.

1032
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,440
That's right.

1033
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,080
- There are flowers here too.
- What?

1034
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,250
What's that?

1035
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,080
Let's go after the butterfly.

1036
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,150
- Do you want to take a picture?
- There's a butterfly.

1037
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,220
- There's a butterfly.
- Where's the butterfly?

1038
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,120
- Over there.
- It's over there?

1039
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,420
(The butterfly is there.)

1040
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,960
- Ants.
- They're ants?

1041
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,890
- Where are the ants?
- Guys.

1042
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,430
There are so many pretty
and cool things around.

1043
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,200
We didn't come here to look at ants.

1044
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,530
You would have caught a few ants
if you had known they'd like them.

1045
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,230
- Right.
- They're very observant.

1046
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,540
- Ants.
- Ants?

1047
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,940
- Ants.
- What?

1048
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Ants.

1049
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,140
- There are ants at home too.
- There are ants.

1050
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,640
I chose Hwagae Garden
as the second location.

1051
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,850
Hwagae Garden?

1052
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,050
I heard there's a theme garden
where you can find healing...

1053
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,280
in every season,
each with its own unique charm,

1054
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,320
so we visited it.

1055
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,760
- Where Prince Yeonsan was exiled?
- Yes.

1056
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,790
That's right.

1057
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,190
(A historical and cultural garden
that recreated the past)

1058
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,460
(The garden of peace,
carrying the hope...)

1059
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
(of returning to one's homeland)

1060
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,230
(The garden of peace, featuring
the rural landscapes of homeland)

1061
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,330
The garden was beautifully arranged.

1062
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,430
(The garden of healing,
where you can rest with plants)

1063
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,740
It's so nice.

1064
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,470
- There are monorails too?
- Yes.

1065
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,610
(Hwagae Garden,
featuring 5 themed areas...)

1066
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,610
(that blend history and nature)

1067
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,440
Eun Woo and Jung Woo,
look over there.

1068
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,610
Look up there.

1069
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,650
Look over there.
Do you see what's up there?

1070
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,450
There's an observation deck.

1071
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,080
Are we going to hike?

1072
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,190
- Hike?
- It's so high up. Hike?

1073
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,020
We're not going to hike today.

1074
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,060
- We'll take the monorail.
- Right.

1075
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,430
(They'll go to the observation deck
at the top of the mountain.)

1076
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,360
(You can comfortably
make your way up...)

1077
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,170
(in about 20 minutes
while enjoying the scenery.)

1078
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,130
Let's take the monorail
up to the observation deck.

1079
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,500
I'll sit next to Grandpa.

1080
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,570
- Okay.
- Sit next to Grandpa.

1081
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,980
- There you go.
- It's refreshing.

1082
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,680
- How cute.
- "It's refreshing."

1083
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,450
- Is it refreshing?
- It's Eun Woo and Jung Woo's...

1084
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,780
first time being in a monorail.

1085
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,950
- Right.
- Yes.

1086
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,580
We're taking a ride.

1087
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,920
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1088
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,590
- Let's go, Eun Woo!
- Let's go!

1089
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,660
Right.

1090
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,360
- The monorail looks cool.
- Yes.

1091
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,990
- It's small and cute.
- Yes.

1092
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,600
- Look at that. There's a waterfall.
- Look at the waterfall.

1093
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,230
There's water, right?

1094
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,700
Doesn't it look refreshing?

1095
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,100
- It's refreshing.
- They see waterfalls too.

1096
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,610
(Just looking at it
makes the summer heat go away.)

1097
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,570
There's water coming out
from the flower too.

1098
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,640
Look at that.

1099
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,840
There are so many things
to see while going up.

1100
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,810
You could see it all at a glance.

1101
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,220
That's a dinosaur.

1102
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,920
- They're dinosaur eggs?
- Yes.

1103
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,420
- They're dinosaur eggs?
- There are eggs!

1104
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,320
- They're eggs?
- Where are the eggs?

1105
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,560
- The lights.
- Right.

1106
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,420
Whenever he sees things like that,
he thinks they're dinosaur eggs.

1107
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,830
You gave him an ostrich egg
saying it was a dinosaur egg.

1108
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,860
That's right.

1109
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,700
(He's very observant.)

1110
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,730
They're eggs? Dinosaur eggs?

1111
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,870
Where are the dinosaur eggs?

1112
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,370
- Look below.
- Down there.

1113
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,810
Did you see them?

1114
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,040
- You can see them now.
- They're there.

1115
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,810
- Can you see them?
- I can.

1116
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,850
They would be
totally into dinosaurs.

1117
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,180
Tyrannosaurus.

1118
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,280
(Tyrannosaurus roar!)

1119
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,990
(Pachycephalosaurus roar!)

1120
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,890
(Pachycephalosaurus Jung Woo
charges!)

1121
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,160
(Should I do it again?)

1122
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,160
What is this?

1123
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,360
That?

1124
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,700
- Pine cone.
- What?

1125
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Pine cone.

1126
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
- Pine cone.
- He also knows pine cones?

1127
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,570
Pine cone.

1128
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,370
- There's a spider.
- A spider?

1129
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,400
- There's a spider.
- A spider.

1130
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,540
There are two butterflies.

1131
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Right?

1132
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,280
Jung Woo is very observant.

1133
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,950
I guess butterflies like flowers.

1134
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,950
(I guess butterflies like flowers.)

1135
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,820
(The most innocent line
of poetry in the world)

1136
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,820
Seriously.

1137
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,060
I guess we like Jung Woo.

1138
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
That's right.

1139
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,930
- There's a butterfly.
- There's a butterfly.

1140
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,600
Jung Woo really likes butterflies.

1141
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,630
He speaks so nicely.

1142
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,770
We're here!

1143
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,940
- Say, "We're getting out."
- We're here.

1144
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,300
- We're getting out.
- We're getting out.

1145
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,800
- We're getting out.
- They're getting out.

1146
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,340
We're going to run there first.

1147
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,610
We're going to run there first?

1148
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,510
- Run!
- Run!

1149
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,850
Who's going to go first?

1150
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,650
You're going to go first, Jung Woo?
Are you going to run?

1151
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,820
- Grandpa too.
- You want me to run as well?

1152
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,820
- He wants Grandpa to run too.
- Let's go.

1153
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,850
- Do I have to run as well?
- Faster.

1154
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,450
- Faster.
- Goodness.

1155
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,760
(Where the three generations
of Kim ran to...)

1156
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,220
How much faster?

1157
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,460
(A transparent floor stretches out
right before their eyes.)

1158
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,490
Goodness.

1159
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,900
The floor is transparent.

1160
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,300
- I can't go there.
- It's a difficult course.

1161
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,240
- That...
- I can't go there either.

1162
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,210
I think
he would have been a bit startled.

1163
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,710
- Eun Woo...
- I can handle that much.

1164
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:47,480
- Really?
- You saw it.

1165
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,410
The size was okay.

1166
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,910
On top...

1167
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,180
(He got scared.)

1168
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,580
There's a fly.

1169
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,690
It became weird here.

1170
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,860
- It's weird.
- It's not.

1171
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,060
You could have said so.

1172
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,490
- You just...
- I didn't mean to.

1173
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,330
(He sees the transparent floor.)

1174
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,360
I think he's going to be afraid.

1175
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,530
Fear of heights...

1176
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,970
- It's scary.
- Jung Woo doesn't have...

1177
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,300
- He doesn't have it.
- fear of heights.

1178
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,600
He just walks on it.

1179
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,000
(Tough guy, Jung Woo)

1180
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,040
Goodness.

1181
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,910
(Eun Woo also sees the floor.)

1182
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,410
Eun Woo paused for a bit.

1183
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,880
(Slowly walking)

1184
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,210
He's walking slowly.

1185
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,550
(Estrogen Eun Woo)

1186
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,480
- Eun Woo is careful.
- Carefully.

1187
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,720
And the person in the back...

1188
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,150
(Dad feeling helpless)

1189
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,350
He's still.

1190
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,250
(Feeling embarrassed)

1191
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,190
Let's hold hands, Dad.

1192
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,460
Dad is more afraid.

1193
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,090
- Go first.
- He told him to go first.

1194
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,300
My armpits were drenched
in sweat that day.

1195
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,970
Seriously.

1196
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,340
- Jung Woo is really...
- Right.

1197
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,600
full of spirit.

1198
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,570
The cowards aren't coming.

1199
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,440
I'll be watching over you
from behind.

1200
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,380
Coward Dad!

1201
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,840
Don't call me that!

1202
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,150
(Coward Dad!)

1203
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,550
(Don't call me Coward Dad!)

1204
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,650
Goodness.

1205
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,380
All right. Let's go quickly.

1206
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,690
Go slowly.

1207
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,590
(He can't walk on the glass.)

1208
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,120
He looks extra thin today.

1209
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,760
Seriously.

1210
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,860
(I really hate this.)

1211
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,330
It looks like Eun Woo...

1212
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,800
- That's right.
- is guiding Dad.

1213
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,840
(I'm scared!)

1214
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,140
(Running away in fear)

1215
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,010
(I'm scared!)

1216
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:34,350
(At 30 months,
he was afraid of heights.)

1217
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,850
(He overcame his fear of heights
on his third birthday.)

1218
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,390
(He walks forward
while guiding Dad.)

1219
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,190
(It's not scary. It's nice and fun!)

1220
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,460
Eun Woo isn't scared now.

1221
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,430
You have to hold me, Eun Woo.

1222
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:48,660
(46-month-old Eun Woo
is more dependable.)

1223
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,330
Run!

1224
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,570
- Really? You want to run again?
- Yes.

1225
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,200
- Here?
- Let's run again.

1226
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,840
- Run again?
- Don't run, Jung Woo.

1227
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,440
Don't run. Go slowly.

1228
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,280
Shall we go that way?
Shall we go over there?

1229
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,350
(He finds the safe zone.)

1230
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,650
That's...

1231
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,880
(Eun Woo, hold on.)

1232
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,150
I'll hold your hand.

1233
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,650
- Over there.
- That's right.

1234
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,850
That's right. I'll hold your hand.

1235
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,860
Suddenly...

1236
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,620
- My face lit up, right?
- Yes.

1237
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,890
- He got the color back in his face.
- Yes.

1238
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,660
I didn't know that I had danced.

1239
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,860
(The shuffle dance of relief)

1240
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,300
Coward Dad, hurry up and come.

1241
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,500
My goodness.

1242
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,740
Jung Woo wants us to hurry up.

1243
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,110
- Eun Woo is also...
- He's cautious.

1244
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,870
- Are you going to do it?
- Aren't you scared?

1245
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,110
(Eun Woo arrives,
holding hands with his dad.)

1246
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,810
Jung Woo.

1247
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,610
Since his younger brother
took the lead,

1248
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,850
he plucked up his courage.

1249
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,520
(Shall we enjoy
the observation deck now?)

1250
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,350
(However, the weather is bad.)

1251
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,850
It was a cloudy day.

1252
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,850
It's cloudy.

1253
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,390
Had the weather been nice,
we would've seen a lot.

1254
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,960
Apparently, you can see far ahead
when the weather is nice.

1255
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,160
(On a sunny day, you can even see
people in North Korea.)

1256
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,830
Jun Ho, the weather turns bad
whenever you go somewhere.

1257
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,400
(During the trip to Jeju Island,)

1258
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,970
(they had a record-breaking rain.)

1259
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,540
(Uncle Baekho, it's raining.)

1260
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,570
The same thing happened
during their trip to Japan.

1261
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,880
(The ferry stopped running
due to the bad weather.)

1262
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,950
(Even during their trip
to the valley)

1263
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,880
- Why does that happen?
- That's what I want to ask.

1264
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,520
That's what I want to ask.

1265
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,190
You can see it, right?

1266
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,820
- You can see it.
- I can't see anything.

1267
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,660
- Even when I stand at the edge,
- You can see it.

1268
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,220
I can't make out anything.

1269
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,490
Forget about North Korea.

1270
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,730
What's that on your back?

1271
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,360
"What's important is having
an unbreakable heart?"

1272
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,730
That's my song.

1273
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,530
- His song title is on there.
- Sir.

1274
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,530
I had this shirt made.

1275
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,470
Make me an honorary ambassador.

1276
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,740
An honorary ambassador
for "An unbreakable heart" song.

1277
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,140
Eun Woo and Jung Woo promote
the song well, so I don't need one.

1278
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,170
That's right.

1279
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,080
"An Unbreakable Heart."

1280
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,180
That's right.

1281
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,810
(What's important
is promoting the song.)

1282
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,810
Isn't it pretty?

1283
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,350
"An Unbreakable Heart."

1284
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,880
(He's moved by his father's love.)

1285
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,150
You should hit it.

1286
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,390
Dad,

1287
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,390
the shape of the mountain
we've climbed...

1288
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,990
resembles a cauldron lid.

1289
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,060
As we can climb down,

1290
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,330
we can look for the cauldron lids
for fun.

1291
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,000
(Find 6 out of 8 cauldron lids!)

1292
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,630
If we find six,
we'll receive rice as a prize.

1293
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,940
(They'll receive
Ganghwa rice as a prize.)

1294
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,700
Ganghwa Island is well-known
for its rice.

1295
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,910
That's right.

1296
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:11,240
- It's very well-known.
- Yes.

1297
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,910
Actual cauldron lids?

1298
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,080
Actual cauldron lids.

1299
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,110
Not bottle caps?

1300
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,750
It'll be too hard
to find bottle caps.

1301
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,910
I thought it was funny.

1302
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,220
(He's at the age to love dad jokes.)

1303
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,420
(59 years old, 54 years old)

1304
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,750
- Cauldron lids.
- There he goes again.

1305
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,620
Let's find cauldron lids.

1306
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,620
- That's right. Let's climb down.
- Let's climb down.

1307
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,660
It sounds fun.
It's like a treasure hunt.

1308
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,230
Where are the cauldron lids?

1309
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,860
Hurry up and come out.

1310
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,100
That's right.

1311
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,870
Let's hurry up
and find the cauldron lids.

1312
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,540
(The cauldron lid expedition)

1313
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,940
(The hawk-eyed one)

1314
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,000
Jung Woo.

1315
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,740
Where are the cauldron lids?
Come on out.

1316
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,140
How cute.

1317
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,540
Where are the cauldron lids?
Let's find them.

1318
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,610
Where are the cauldron lids?

1319
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,480
I think they'll be good
at finding them.

1320
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,420
Where are the cauldron lids?

1321
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,280
- There's a waterfall!
- Let's go inside.

1322
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,720
- Who wants to go inside?
- Water.

1323
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,120
Thanks to the waterfall,

1324
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,090
it's cool around here.

1325
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,460
It's a relief
since the weather is hot.

1326
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,890
I bet it's really cool inside.

1327
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,560
- It's cool.
- See?

1328
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,830
The temperature dropped.

1329
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,400
(Jung Woo is startled
by the cool temperature.)

1330
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,700
It was really hot that day.

1331
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,640
When we entered the cave,
the air suddenly turned cold.

1332
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,070
It felt nice.

1333
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,070
It's really cold.

1334
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,840
(The strong waterfall suits...)

1335
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,210
(the straightforward boy's taste.)

1336
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,450
Jung Woo, do you want to go there?

1337
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,980
It's a good place
to take a family photo.

1338
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,650
Isn't it a nice tourist attraction?

1339
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,020
(Leave the photos to someone
who can take them well.)

1340
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,320
I'll go there with Jae Yi.

1341
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,420
That's right.

1342
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,460
- Let's go and see.
- What's that?

1343
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
- What?
- What?

1344
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,590
- What?
- Did Jung Woo find something?

1345
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,660
(The hawk-eyed Jung Woo found)

1346
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,500
What did he find?

1347
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
(A rice bowl?)

1348
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,930
- What?
- What's this?

1349
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,430
Prince Yeonsan was exiled
to this place.

1350
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,170
- Is that poison?
- Yes.

1351
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,170
Hold on.

1352
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,770
Prince Yeonsan.

1353
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:53,010
(Prince Yeonsan was exiled
to Gyodong Island, Ganghwa.)

1354
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,680
(There's an exhibit which portrays
Prince Yeonsan in exile.)

1355
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,410
He was exiled to that place.

1356
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,820
(One-act drama,
Woo Brothers' Exile to Gyodong)

1357
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,920
Jung Woo...

1358
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,160
- We had to try it.
- Will Jung Woo get punished?

1359
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,590
(You must be aware...)

1360
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,230
(of your wrongdoings.)

1361

- The sin of running off during work
- Running off after eating.

1364
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,140
(Making his older brother work)

1365
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,010
The sin of making
his older brother do all the work

1366
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:24,170
(523 times)

1367
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,610
- My goodness.
- Who is the sinner?

1368
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,340
(Give him poison...)

1369
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,750
(right this instant.)

1370
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,780
- No!
- No!

1371
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,550
(No!)

1372
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,220
(I don't deserve this!)

1373
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,790
"I don't deserve this!"

1374
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,320
(Make him drink it right this instant!)

1375
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,360
Drink it.

1376
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,490
It wasn't poison,
but a chocolate concoction.

1377
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,200
- A chocolate concoction?
- Yes, it's chocolate milk.

1378
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,430
- We used that instead.
- That's good.

1379
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,070
(I don't want poison.)

1380
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,170
How cute!

1381
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,430
(Is this chocolate?)

1382
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,900
Oh, no. Don't drink it.

drink the chocolate concoction!)

(Gosh, it tastes good.)

1385
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,640
It's tasty.

1386
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,610
- It's tasty.
- "It's tasty."

1387
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,180
It's tasty.

1388
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,180
Don't drink too much.

1389
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,220
Gosh.

- Your sin...
- Eun Woo.

(Eun Woo's sin is being handsome.)

1393

(Being handsome while showing off
his charms as the older brother)

1402
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,780
He shook up Jae Yi's heart.

1403
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780

drink the chocolate concoction!)

Do you admit it?

1410
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,740
He drank the chocolate concoction
because he admitted it.

1411
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,670
He admitted it.

1412
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,710
How does it taste?

00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,230
It must be really easy to find them.

1424
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,230
Those cauldron lids...

1425
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,660
The garden is big.

1426
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
If they're small,
it'll be impossible to find them.

1427
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,530
It'll take all day long.
It'll take three days.

1428
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,640
- Aren't they huge?
- They're huge.

1429
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,670
Stand here.

1430
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,740
You come up to here.

1431
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,910
Okay.

1432
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,110
These days, you can verify
what you've found through QR codes.

1433
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,750
The second cauldron lid.

1434
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,350
- There it is.
- It's the last cauldron lid.

1435
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,350
We found all of them.

1436
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,720
We checked out the garden
as we looked for the cauldron lids.

1437
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,020
- We killed 2 birds with 1 stone.
- I know. It's nice.

1438
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,520
It was a nice place to visit.

1439
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,220
The garden is very pretty.

1440
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,630
Making them big
was a smart decision.

1441
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,030
(They collected all the stamps
for the cauldron lids!)

1442
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go and get rice.

1443
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,030
Hello, we're here to receive rice.

1444
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,630
Okay.
Please give me your cell phone.

1445
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,440
(He comes back to the ticket office
and shows proof.)

1446
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,870
- Here you go.
- Okay.

1447
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
They give you rice
after you show proof.

1448
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,770
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1449
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,810
Okay.

1450
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,810
Yes. Let's eat this
at the lodging today.

1451
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,210
Let's hurry up. I'm hungry.

1452
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,080
That's enough for a meal.

1453
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,380
- You're right.
- The Ganghwa rice is tasty.

1454
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,920
- That's enough for a family.
- It's tasty.

1455
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,150
(They wrap up the day
at their own place.)

1456
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,650
The resort looks amazing.

1457
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,820
- Yes.
- My goodness.

1458
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,090
(The interior is spacious.)

1459
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,230
(The view of the sunset will become
a memory in the children's hearts.)

1460
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,000
- There's a pool.
- There's a pool.

1461
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,100
It's a must.

1462
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,130
(Night comes to Ganghwa Island.)

1463
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,310
(Jun Ho is preparing dinner
in the yard.)

1464
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,040
What did Jun Ho prepare?

1465
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,010
Today's dinner menu is...

1466
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,710
the local dishes
from Ganghwa Island.

1467
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,110
(Mudflat eels are famous
in Ganghwa Island.)

1468
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,650
It has been grilled to perfection.

1469
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,150
You know that their mudflat eels
are famous.

1470
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,590
They're famous. I went there to work
back in the day.

1471
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,890
- You know that they're famous.
- I know.

1472
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,520
(Seasoned grilled eels
have so much umami.)

1473
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,120
(The second local dish
of Ganghwa Island)

1474
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,560
What's the next dish?

1475
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,400
(What's the secret behind the dish
that looks like galbitang?)

1476
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,430
What's that?

1477
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,870
Ganghwa...

1478
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,700
(It's Ganghwa Island's
salted shrimp made in autumn!)

1479
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,900
(A dish that's made
with Ganghwa Island's salted shrimp)

1480
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,110
It's made of small shrimp.

1481
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,570
That's right.
Adding salted shrimp...

1482
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,340
freshens up the taste
and removes the bad odor.

1483
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,250
- It looks tasty.
- Yes.

1484
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,750
(The sizzling sound is appetizing!)

1485
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,150
How nice.

1486
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,850
My mouth is watering.

1487
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,720
He also prepared grilled fish.

1488
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,790
(Grilled fish that's crispy outside
and moist inside)

1489
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,920
(The ingredient that grew
with the sea wind of the West Sea)

1490
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,060
It's the rice you won earlier.

1491
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,890
Yes. We received them
in Ganghwa Island.

1492
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,190
That's a proper feast.

1493
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,560
(A feast of Ganghwa Island's
local dishes)

1494
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,000
Enjoy the food.

1495
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,230
Enjoy the food.

1496
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,500
Dad, this soup is called...

1497
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
the salted shrimp and rib soup.

1498
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,840
- Rib soup?
- Try it.

1499
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,270
The soup is...

1500
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,440
(When they try the soup first,)

1501
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,810
(the taste makes them exclaim!)

1502
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,310
It must've been tasty.

1503
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,580
(It's so savory!)

1504
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,220
It's tasty.

1505
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,320
How is it different
from regular galbitang?

1506
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,490
Although it's similar,

1507
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,250
the salted shrimp gives it...

1508
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,660
a refreshing taste.

1509
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,360
- There's umami.
- That's right.

1510
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,160
- It has a refreshing taste.
- It contains a lot of vegetables.

1511
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,830
- That's right.
- I bet it's delicious.

1512
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,090
It looks that way.

1513
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,200
Jung Woo, you're eating with gusto.

1514
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,700
Jung Woo is trying the soup too.

1515
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,800
(Jung Woo takes a spoonful of soup.)

1516
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,870
It's tasty, right?

1517
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,340
(It suits Chairman Kim's taste!)

1518
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,870
- I mean...
- Chairman.

1519
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,940
Eun Woo likes rice.

1520
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,210
You must've been hungry.

1521
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,050
That day, even plain rice was tasty.

1522
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,080
(He's a Korean baby
who gets his energy from rice.)

1523
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,880
- It's tasty.
- The Ganghwa rice is tasty.

1524
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,220
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

1525
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,290
Their rice is high-quality.

1526
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,020
It's chewy.

1527
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,190
It's chewy.

1528
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,320
It's glossy.

1529
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,890
It's really glossy.

1530
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,260
Fish.

1531
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,660
(The next dish is grilled fish.)

1532
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,430
That fish looks delicious as well.

1533
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,470
(It's fun to try a variety of fish.)

1534
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,500
Fish.

1535
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,070
(Let's try fish from Ganghwa Island.)

1536
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,240
He scooped it up.

1537
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,680
How does it taste?

1538
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,380
(How is the taste of the West Sea?)

1539
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,310
Please give me more fish.

1540
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,650
Eun Woo, you're eating with gusto.

1541
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,880
Here.

1542
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,050
(One bite)

1543
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,050
Hold on.

1544
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,690
I guess it suits his taste.

1545
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,690
It must be tasty.

1546
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,830
When you try each kind of fish
with rice,

1547
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,860
it tastes amazing.
It makes you eat so much rice.

1548
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,600
(Nodding)

1549
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,200
- That's the taste.
- Yes.

1550
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,130
He approves.

1551
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,970
What's the black thing?

1552
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,370
(Fish skin)

1553
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,540
It's skin.

1554
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,880
Fish skin is tasty.

1555
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,940
Dad, here you go.

1556
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,210
(Fish skin is for Dad.)

1557
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,380
Eun Woo doesn't eat fish skin.

1558
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,850
- Doesn't he eat fish skin?
- No.

1559
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,050
(When he was eating jokbal)

1560
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,620
(Just the pretty meat)

1561
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,960
- When they were eating jokbal...
- "Just the pretty meat."

1562
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,790
"Just the pretty meat."

1563
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:55,160
(Eun Woo only ate the pretty meat.)

1564
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,070
He only likes the pretty parts.

1565
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,600
(Eun Woo only eats the white part
of the fish elegantly.)

1566
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,500
Eun Woo, try the eel. I grilled it.

1567
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,470
I'll dip it in sauce
and give it to you.

1568
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,210
(He dips the seasoned grilled eel
in soy sauce.)

1569
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,240
Here.

1570
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,850
(How is the taste
of the eel dipped in soy sauce?)

1571
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,780
- Isn't it tasty?
- How is it?

1572
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,450
Isn't it tasty?

1573
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,290
(What's that facial expression?)

1574
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,320
What?

1575
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,790
(Jun Ho grilled the eels outside
on a hot day.)

1576
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,860
More eels?

1577
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,660
Yes, eat more eels.

1578
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,960
No, I want fish.

1579
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,970
(I want fish other than eels.)

1580
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,940
I suddenly changed my mind.

1581
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,540
(Eun Woo becomes mischievous
when he teases his dad.)

1582
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,870
Did you suddenly change your mind?

1583
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,380
(Eun Woo,
are you going to be that way?)

1584
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,510
- Stop playing around.
- For goodness' sake.

1585
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,880
- He likes to tease his dad.
- Dad.

1586
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,320
He must've learned it from someone.

1587
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,720
He's so cute.

1588
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,820
I want to eat fish.

1589
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,190
- Do you want to eat fish?
- Fish?

1590
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,030
I want to eat fish with rice.

1591
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,530
- Really?
- Do you want to eat it with rice?

1592
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,530
I'll put it on top of the rice.

1593
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,400
- Fish.
- He wants to eat fish.

1594
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,730
(Which fish does Jung Woo want?)

1595
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,300
Jung Woo,
do you want to try the eels?

1596
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,240
I want to smell it.

1597
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,270
Do you want to smell it?

1598
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:10,310
Smell it.

1599
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,710
- Eel sommelier.
- Yes.

1600
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,180
He'll smell it first.

1601
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,750
- All right.
- He wants to eat it with rice.

1602
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,810
Okay.

1603
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,380
Jung Woo's eating show is the best.

1604
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,020
(Taking a big bite)

1605
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,050
How does he eat with so much gusto?

1606
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,050
(Each grain of rice is precious.)

1607
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,660
He's eating without breathing.

1608
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,260
Hold on.

1609
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,430
Wait. Open wide.

1610
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,030
I saw it in real life, right?

1611
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,930
He's something else.

1612
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,430
I can't describe Jung Woo
any other way.

1613
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,700
- There you go.
- I'll feed you.

1614
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,200
Jung Woo...

1615
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,070
He eats it with the skin.

1616
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,770
- He can even eat...
- Rice.

1617
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,210
the chopsticks and spoon.

1618
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,580
- Of course.
- Yes.

1619
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,980
- He's different.
- Despite being his dad,

1620
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,480
I get surprised at times.

1621
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,910
Seriously.

1622
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,280
Among the rice, soup, and fish,
what's the tastiest?

1623
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,850
(Jung Woo's answer is)

1624
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,890
Yellow corvina.

1625
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,460
(This 27-month-old knows
what a Yellow corvina is.)

1626
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,460
Does he know
what a yellow corvina is?

1627
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,790
- Yellow corvina.
- I see.

1628
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,990
(Jung Woo is smart.)

1629
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,990
Seriously.

1630
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,430
(It's yellow corvina.)

1631
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,730
(It's the longest wait in his life.)

1632
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,200
(Yellow corvinas might go extinct.)

1633
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,470
What do you want?

1634
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,910
Yellow corvina.

1635
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,610
(This 27-month-old is educated
in the taste of yellow corvina.)

1636
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,080
- Yellow corvina.
- Yellow corvina.

1637
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,380
Yellow corvina.

1638
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,950
- The yellow corvina is angry.
- Wait.

1639
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,820
(Dad, the yellow corvina is angry!)

1640
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,160
Why is the yellow corvina angry?

1641
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,960
Is the yellow corvina angry?

1642
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
(It's because...)

1643
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,960
(Jung Woo is eating it!)

1644
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,560
How cute!

1645
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,330
"It's because I'll eat it!"

1646
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,530
Do you want more?

1647
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:48,100
(The Return of Superman
has recently seen...)

1648
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,500
(some rising stars
of the eating show scene.)

1649
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,270
That's right.
There are many food goblin babies...

1650
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:53,470
who threaten to take
Jung Woo's place.

1651
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,480
My goodness.

1652
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,280
- I was so surprised when she ate.
- Seo Bin too. Yes.

1653
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,680
(His thighs are chubbier
than those of the Woo Brothers.)

1654
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,880
- The next one is...
- There's Haru.

1655
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,920
Haru.

1656
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,090
(His chubbiness is
in the top 1 percent.)

1657
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,220
Seriously.

1658
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,890
He's eating with gusto.

1659
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,760
(The rising star
of the eating show scene, Shim Haru)

1660
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,100
- Still, the very best one is...
- It's Jung Woo.

1661
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:16,870
- He's...
- Yes.

1662
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,170
- a frontrunner.
- Open wide.

1663
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,400
- He eats with gusto.
- There you go.

1664
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,170
- Seeing him eat...
- Open wide.

1665
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,570
- makes me feel full.
- Seriously.

1666
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,140
- Fish.
- Seriously.

1667
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,640
Eat some rice as well.

1668
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,140
(His cheeks are full.)

1669
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,110
(Jung Woo, are you sleepy?)

1670
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,850
- No way.
- No way.

1671
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:36,480
(Jung Woo, are you sleepy?)

1672
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,390
He's savoring the taste.

1673
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,750
"What is this taste?"

1674
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,520
- He's savoring the taste.
- Oh, my.

1675
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,130
Just like the way sommeliers...

1676
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,530
swirl wine in their mouths
to savor the taste...

1677
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,800
How does it taste?

1678
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,530
It's tasty.

1679
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,970
(3 stars)

1680
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,070
Seriously.

1681
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,840
(Jung Woo is ridiculous.)

1682
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,540
When Jung Woo opens his eyes
after savoring the tastes,

1683
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,610
his eyes become the largest.

1684
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,840
That's the moment.

1685
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,750
After savoring the tastes.

1686
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,880
(They laugh during the meal
thanks to the children.)

1687
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,050
I promote the song so much.

1688
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,290
I'm like an honorary ambassador.

1689
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,890
When I have to wait
for the traffic signal...

1690
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,590
while driving,

1691
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,860
I open the window a bit on purpose.

1692
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:20,630
Then I blast "An Unbreakable Heart."

1693
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,470
(Gosh, Father)

1694
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,200
When I steal a glance,
people move to the rhythm.

1695
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,440
Dad, you're the same as me.
I do the same.

1696
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,210
- I open the sunroof...
- Dad.

1697
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:34,180
and blast the song
on my way to work.

1698
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,480
(Drivers in Ilsan and Hwaseong)

1699
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,480
For goodness' sake.

1700
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,110
It's a great song.

1701
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,150
(If you hear
"An Unbreakable Heart...")

1702
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:44,690
(while waiting
for the traffic signal)

1703
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,720
- Jun Ho.
- The editing is no joke.

1704
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,990
Jun Ho's dad is riding in the back.

1705
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,190
(Ho Woo Father and Son
are riding in the car.)

1706
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,930
(The happy dinnertime ends.)

1707
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,630
It's fun to come to a place
like this with me, right?

1708
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,870
I showed you dinosaurs.

1709
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,500
Yes.

1710
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,570
(The two of them have
a quality time by themselves.)

1711
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,300
With whom do you want
to come here next time?

1712
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,470
- Dad.
- Dad.

1713
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,510
Who else?

1714
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,510
Grandpa.

1715
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,080
Grandpa. Who else?

1716
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,180
There are two grandpas.

1717
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,590
There are two grandpas.

1718
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,990
There are two grandpas.
From Dad's and Mom's sides.

1719
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,620
Do you want to come here
with both of them?

1720
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,530
- Yes.
- My goodness.

1721
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,700
Gosh, he's so nice.

1722
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,730
I'm proud of him.

1723
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,030
(Playing in the water
with everyone is nice.)

1724
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,300
Jun Ho washes up too.

1725
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,010
(But I also like playing with Dad.)

1726
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,040
How cute.

1727
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,080
(Bath time comes to an end.)

1728
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,110
Eun Woo.

1729
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,420
Your mom and I are always thankful
for you, okay?

1730
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,320
(Mom and Dad are always thankful
for you.)

1731
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,290
My goodness.

1732
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,990
Both at home and outside,

1733
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,590
you take good care of Jung Woo.
Thank you for that.

1734
01:00:58,590 --> 01:00:59,660
Okay?

1735
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,900
- That's right.
- Thank you.

1736
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,630
Even though Eun Woo is young,

1737
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,730
he always...

1738
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,400
shows consideration
and takes good care of Jung Woo.

1739
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,070
When I see him...

1740
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,910
take care of his younger brother
despite being young himself,

1741
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,910
I feel admiration and pride.

1742
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,710
I also feel bad.

1743
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,910
- That's right.
- That's right. Seriously.

1744
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:24,950
(He always cherishes
his younger brother.)

1745
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,950
That's right.
He has always been like that.

1746
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,420
The brotherly love is so beautiful.

1747
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,430
Yes.

1748
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,330
(There's a hole. Be careful.)

1749
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,500
(Jung Woo, you'll get a stomachache
if you eat too fast.)

1750
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,670
(Eat slowly.)

1751
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,540
There's no older brother like him.

1752
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,740
I know. It's a beautiful sight.

1753
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,840
How are the Woo Brothers...

1754
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,980
- so good to each other?
- I know.

1755
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,580
When we go outside,
Eun Woo holds Jung Woo's hand...

1756
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,680
the moment we step out
of the elevator.

1757
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,280
- Like that,
- Yes.

1758
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,880
- he looks after Jung Woo.
- On our way to the parking lot.

1759
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,880
(They hold hands.)

1760
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,290
I'm always thankful for you, okay?

1761
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:01,390
(Dad thanks him
during their time alone.)

1762
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,120
- Okay.
- Okay.

1763
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,560
Give me a kiss.

1764
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,700
The dad and son's bath time is nice.

1765
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,730
Yes.

1766
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,600
(I know that you work hard
for your younger brother.)

1767
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,370
Thank you.
Let's come here to play again.

1768
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,170
- Okay.
- All done.

1769
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:15,600
All done.

1770
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,840
(Thus, the bath time ends.)

1771
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,540
Let's go to bed now.

1772
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,510
(The three generations
lie down together.)

1773
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,880
- It's a beautiful sight.
- It was fun, right?

1774
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,310
- They should sleep together.
- Yes.

1775
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,650
You had fun with Dad
and Grandpa today, right?

1776
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,720
Jung Woo, you had fun, right?

1777
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,390
- It was so much fun.
- Grandpa.

1778
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,360
- Yes?
- I had fun today.

1779
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,990
Yes. I had so much fun.

1780
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,960
I had so much fun
with Eun Woo and Jung Woo.

1781
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:40,090
Let's come again.

1782
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

1783
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,730
Eun Woo, give your grandpa
a massage...

1784
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,770
since he worked hard today.

1785
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,440
Jung Woo, go.

1786
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,100
Climb on his back.

1787
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,770
Give him a massage. There you go.
Give him a massage.

1788
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:54,640
Give him a massage with your feet.

1789
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,820
(Jung Woo's kneading massage)

1790
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,350
(He does it well
with his strong arms and legs.)

1791
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:04,820
- He should step on the back.
- That's right.

1792
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:06,490
Will you be okay?

1793
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,090
- He's actually doing it.
- He's kneading.

1794
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,790
Me too.

1795
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,460
It's game over.

1796
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,230
- They're giving a massage...
- Grandpa.

1797
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,500
to Grandpa who worked hard today.

1798
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,700
End me.

1799
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,200
(At this way, he'll pass away
during the massage session.)

1800
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,700
(He has a present for the brothers
who gave him a massage.)

1801
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,910
It's very heavy.

1802
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,640
Come here. Hurry up.

1803
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:27,940
- Hurry up.
- What is it?

1804
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,040
What is it?

1805
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,450
- It's...
- It's a present.

1806
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,510
A present?

1807
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,050
I have Jung Woo and Eun Woo's photos
from their younger days.

1808
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,420
Shall we go over them?

1809
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,090
From the moment Eun Woo
and Jung Woo were born,

1810
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:43,960
he has made photo albums nonstop.

1811
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,160
He collects them.

1812
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,160
Really?

1813
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,960
(The photo albums of growth...)

1814
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,570
(capture every day and every moment
of the Woo Brothers.)

1815
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,330
- He...
- The photos show their growth.

1816
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,940
Yes. He prints out the photos
and turns them into albums.

1817
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,110
Did you do this one photo at a time?

1818
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,140
That's right.

1819
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,440
Dad, who is this?

1820
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,510
Isn't it Eun Woo?

1821
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,010
When he was young...

1822
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:05,750
This is Jung Woo.

1823
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:08,720
No way. The wide forehead tells me
that this is Eun Woo.

1824
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,590
Dad, look at Jung Woo.

1825
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:12,090
HIs forehead is huge.

1826
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,560
- Why did you reveal it suddenly?
- Seriously.

1827
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,660
Who is this?

1828
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,860
Who is this?

1829
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,060
Jung Woo, who is this person?

1830
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,460
It was when I dressed up as a woman.

1831
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,030
(Does everyone remember?)

1832
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,100
It was when I dressed up as a woman.

1833
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,470
(3 years ago,
when Jung Woo was only a fetus)

1834
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,140
(Eun Woo was a baby
who couldn't speak.)

1835
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,740
(To understand the struggle
of his pregnant wife,)

1836
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,880
(Jun Ho had
the pregnancy experience.)

1837
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,250
- Oh, my.
- Jun Ho.

1838
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,480
He looks so pretty.

1839
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,580
(Why did he look pretty?)

1840
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,050
Why does he look pretty?

1841
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:46,990
- Eun Woo is shocked.
- You look so pretty.

1842
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,020
(Eun Woo was shocked.)

1843
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,360
Who is this?

1844
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,390
- I don't know.
- Who is this?

1845
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,860
- Don't you know?
- No.

1846
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,560
- Look carefully.
- Who is this, Jung Woo?

1847
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,470
- It must be fascinating for them.
- I was...

1848
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,500
in Mom's belly, right?

1849
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,470
That's right.

1850
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,940
Mom's belly.

1851
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:07,780
(I was in Mom's belly, right?)

1852
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,180
That's right.

1853
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,510
You were in your mom's belly.

1854
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:12,710
You're so smart.

1855
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,580
How many photos are there?

1856
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,880
There are 1,400 photos.

1857
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,120
What?

1858
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,490
There are 1,400 photos.

1859
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,690
Did he say 1,400 photos?

1860
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,490
(Jun Ho goes through
the photo albums wordlessly.)

1861
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:24,530
You can't do such a thing
without love.

1862
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,390
- That's right.
- It's a difficult task.

1863
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,730
I was so grateful for Dad.

1864
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,800
Seriously.

1865
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,830
(The album is full
of Grandpa's love and passion.)

1866
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,770
Back in my day,
such things didn't exist.

1867
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:37,140
I thought, "My dad is incredible."

1868
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,040
"He really loves my children."

1869
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,940
I was thankful for Dad.

1870
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,310
(Grandpa's passionate love
makes him feel grateful.)

1871
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,650
My goodness.

1872
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,780
(He was busy making a living,)

1873
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,950
(so there aren't many photos
of his son.)

1874
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,120
I couldn't give such memories
to Jun Ho...

1875
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,690
and Min Sang.

1876
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,290
So, I really want to do that
for Eun Woo and Jung Woo.

1877
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,560
I want to give them good memories.

1878
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,100
When they grow up
and see the photos,

1879
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,540
I want them to think,
"This was how I grew up."

1880
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,610
I want them to have good memories.

1881
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:13,710
(I want them to have good memories.)

1882
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,640
That must be why the kids
always want to see their grandpa.

1883
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,650
That must be it.

1884
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,650
(There are photos
of the whole family.)

1885
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,250
Those photo albums
are very precious.

1886
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,290
- Grandpa, thank you.
- All right.

1887
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:27,290
Here are hearts from Grandpa.
I love you. Hearts.

1888
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:30,790
(The children made
another memory with Grandpa.)

1889
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,890
- Let's go to bed.
- I love you. Hearts.

1890
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,990
Let's go to bed.

1891
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,330
I hope Jun Ho
and the Woo Brothers...

1892
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:41,270
- will make many more good memories.
- Yes.

1893
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,470
(We hope Eun Woo and Jung Woo
will make many more good memories.)

1894
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,310
(Hwang Min Ho's first solo concert)

1895
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,210
(Amidst many people's attention,)

1896
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,910
