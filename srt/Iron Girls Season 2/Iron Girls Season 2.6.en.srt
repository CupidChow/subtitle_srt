1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:03,468
(After last week's supervised sparring)

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:06,207
(At this rate, )

3
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:07,778
(you'll be eliminated.)

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,578
(The Iron Girls realized they were lacking in physical strength.)

5
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,448
(A drastic treatment to improve physical strength)

6
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,858
(Entering a trail race)

7
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:21,658
(Trail running?)

8
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,887
(This time, they'll go to the mountain.)

9
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:25,727
(Dirt road)

10
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,257
(Water road)

11
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,968
(Stairs)

12
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:30,527
(Running on any terrain...)

13
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:34,498
(for a marathon on the unpaved mountain trails)

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:39,078
(Trail running comes with the joy of navigating nature.)

15
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,808
(What's Iron Girls' goal?)

16
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:45,718
(10km trail running on Jeju Island's oreum)

17
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:47,818
(Before the race, preparations are a must!)

18
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,148
(Kim Jin Hee, athlete)

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,589
(With the expert of trail running, )

20
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,017
(Iron Girls learned the basics.)

21
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,098
(In Ah was excluded due to her knee rehabilitation.)

22
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:57,858
(Ma'am, what is this vest for?)

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,727
(Wearing the cool running vest...)

24
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,568
(for water, snacks, and an emergency kit, )

25
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:07,438
(they learned how to use the trekking pole.)

26
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:10,068
(Then came the trail running practice!)

27
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:12,937
(Uphill)

28
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,878
(Downhill)

29
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,518
(It feels different.)

30
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,118
(It feels different from a regular marathon.)

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,118
(The world of trail running was on another level.)

32
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:29,528
(They completed the lesson on the basics of trail running.)

33
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:32,398
(Ten days later)

34
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:36,328
(The day of the trail race)

35
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,868
(Seogwipo-si, Jeju)

36
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,008
(3 hours before the race)

37
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,807
(Everyone wakes up early in the morning.)

38
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,037
(Sae Rok, In Ah)

39
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,108
(Ju Hyun)

40
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:49,348
(Groaning)

41
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:51,247
I'm excited

42
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:53,878
I like running more

43
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,617
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes. Water...

44
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,257
- I heard castella was... - Yes.

45
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,517
A good meal for trail runners.

46
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,157
I guess they need to eat carbs.

47
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:03,227
- Really? - Yes.

48
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:04,797
- In that case... - I washed my hands.

49
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:05,928
Okay. What's this?

50
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,197
Just eat it with your hands.

51
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,597
(Before a high-intensity workout, eating carbs is a must.)

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,327
Will anyone want porridge?

53
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,638
(Impressed)

54
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:13,768
It's tasty.

55
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:16,507
My forearm hurts.

56
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:19,137
(Sae Rok and Ju Hyun join breakfast as well.)

57
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,178
Have another one.

58
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:22,647
- No? Do you just want one? - No.

59
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,007
I'll have another one.

60
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,078
(Her eyes are empty.)

61
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:26,517
(Laughing)

62
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:28,288
How cute.

63
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,248
- Sae Rok, did you pack water? - No.

64
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,057
Did you pack water?

65
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:34,188
Yes, I did.

66
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:37,088
(They're ready to leave for trail running.)

67
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,598
- Let's go. - Let's go.

68
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:41,868
(They head over to the location of the trail run.)

69
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:43,728
You know, it really feels like...

70
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:46,168
I'm doing the off-season training.

71
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:48,418
You didn't forget about being on Jeju Island, right?

72
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,777
Wouldn't we get the taste of Jeju Island today?

73
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:54,137
We'll climb a mountain.

74
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:57,247
I heard that the course was really beautiful.

75
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:58,318
That's right.

76
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:01,118
(To trail runners who run in nature, )

77
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:05,558
(Jeju Island is the best place for trail running.)

78
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,828
(Every year, runners around the nation visit.)

79
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:12,098
(The popular trail running place, Jeju)

80
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:15,498
(However, )

81
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:20,368
(the weather isn't looking good.)

82
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,468
We'll get soaked through, right?

83
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,008
I'm worried.

84
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,407
It would've been really nice...

85
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:27,637
- if it had been sunny. - I know.

86
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:30,148
Compared to a very sunny day...

87
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:31,307
- This is better. - Yes.

88
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,147
Wouldn't it be better for exercising?

89
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,147
- It gets hard if it's too hot. - You're right.

90
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,564
(They put on the mindset of an athlete.)

91
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,788
We must be here.

92
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:38,988
- Really? - Yes.

93
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,217
- Are we? - I'm starting to see more cars.

94
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,027
Shouldn't we wear a raincoat?

95
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:44,058
I know.

96
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,297
Listen to the sound. What's this?

97
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:47,327
(Startled)

98
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,744
(The sound of rain echoes in the car.)

99
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,428
(The rain suddenly turns heavier.)

100
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:55,968
(It shows no sign of letting up.)

101
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,337
- I'm worried. - Rain, fall all you want.

102
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,708
You can't stop us.

103
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,548
- It might be able to stop us. - Yes.

104
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:06,847
It might be able to stop us.

105
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:10,188
(A strong rainstorm hits the location of the trail race.)

106
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:12,057
("The 1st Storm of the year, Wutip Occurs")

107
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,788
("Heavy Rain of Up to 250m and Strong Wind Hit Jeju")

108
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,687
- It's like a disaster movie. - Seriously.

109
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:18,298
Isn't this rain too much?

110
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,898
(Will they be able to have a race in this weather?)

111
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:25,337
- I see people. - An uphill trail...

112
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:28,768
I see people who are running for a different course.

113
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:30,008
Really?

114
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,537
- It began. - How cool.

115
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,237
- How many people are there? - Where?

116
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,147
- Over there. - You see their heads.

117
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,147
- Are you serious? - Those were heads.

118
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:39,417
- They're running in hoodies. - They're running.

119
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:40,647
They're so cool.

120
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,547
- Are they really running? - Yes.

121
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,788
(They can't believe what they're seeing.)

122
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,317
- Shall we get off? - Yes.

123
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:49,158
(It's time for them to enter the rain.)

124
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,327
(The smile on her face...)

125
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,798
(disappears.)

126
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:54,358
Are we sure about this?

127
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:56,297
Are we sure about this?

128
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,338
(They can't believe the intensity of the downpour.)

129
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,897
Be careful of the puddle.

130
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,037
(They need to walk over to the location of the trail race.)

131
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,637
(The location of the trail race)

132
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:03,738
Gosh, this is...

133
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,907
What's this? Do we need to swim there?

134
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,707
I saw people running down this trail earlier.

135
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,354
(Even the path to the location of the trail race is rough.)

136
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,477
Gosh.

137
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,878
- All right, everyone. - This is insane.

138
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,788
Over there,

139
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:18,718
I see some booths.

140
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:20,918
It looks like the booths will fly off.

141
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:22,658
(Screaming)

142
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,298
It feels uncomfortable.

143
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,558
Even walking is hard. How are we supposed to run?

144
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:30,527
My goodness.

145
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,768
What?

146
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,437
My umbrella.

147
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,208
(In tatters)

148
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,378
(Umbrellas are useless in the rainstorm.)

149
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:43,847
(Save us.)

150
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:47,218
- Save us. - Hello.

151
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:48,788
- I mean... - I don't know.

152
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,687
The path to this booth was...

153
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,357
- too rough. - I know. It was rough.

154
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:53,818
This is Iron Girls.

155
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,288
This is Iron Girls.

156
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,857
Yes. This brings back old memories.

157
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,357
- I know. - The beginning.

158
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,597
Why does it rain every time we enter a race?

159
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:03,328
It always happens.

160
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:09,338
(Iron Girls bring rain whenever they run.)

161
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:14,108
(It rained on Jeju Island last year.)

162
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,448
(The location of the race was submerged in water.)

163
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:22,118
(The race got canceled on the day.)

164
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,288
It always happens. Gosh, it makes no sense.

165
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,357
This isn't right.

166
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,057
However, the trail race will proceed.

167
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,488
- That's impressive. - Right.

168
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,297
As soon as we arrived,

169
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:36,468
we saw people start the 32km race.

170
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:38,698
I didn't think that many people would run.

171
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,738
- But they ran in a line. - I know.

172
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,637
- They were impressive. - I know.

173
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:45,637
A total of 700 people participated in the trail race.

174
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:46,708
Seriously.

175
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,878
(Despite the rough weather, )

176
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:55,688
(they want to enjoy trail running.)

177
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,488
(The participants came to the location of the trail race.)

178
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:01,417
(They take photos...)

179
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:04,288
(and warm up.)

180
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,527
(The runners are ready to run.)

181
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,267
Passionate people gathered from around the nation.

182
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,137
You'll enter the 10km race.

183
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:15,714
While it's a trail run, a big part of the course will be flatland.

184
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,168
I heard that there were two oreums.

185
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:20,137
(Starting and finishing point)

186
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,947
At the 4km and 8km points,

187
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,618
there will be oreums. Please remember that.

188
00:07:26,218 --> 00:07:28,194
(The hardest part is the two oreums, Ttarabi Oreum...)

189
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:30,418
(and Keunsaseumi Oreum.)

190
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,017
(Start, Ttarabi Oreum, Keunsaseumi Oreum, Finish)

191
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,128
(The highest elevation is 473.5m.)

192
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,427
(They'll pass various terrains...)

193
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,828
(such as grassland, paved road, forest trail, and more.)

194
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,528
(At the 3km point, they'll face...)

195
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,668
(the first challenge.)

196
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,968
(The never-ending stairs)

197
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:52,937
(There's no end to the uphill road.)

198
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:53,938
(Start, Ttarabi Oreum)

199
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,178
(Elevation, 342m)

200
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,678
(Ttarabi Oreum)

201
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:01,317
A downhill road follows an uphill road.

202
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:03,148
- Be careful when you go downhill. - Okay.

203
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:08,728
(At the 7km point, they'll face...)

204
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,588
(the second challenge.)

205
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,398
(The elevation is higher than that of Ttarabi Oreum.)

206
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:19,038
(Elevation, 473.5m)

207
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,108
(Keunsaseumi Oreum)

208
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:26,277
(Will Iron Girls be able to finish the race safely?)

209
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:27,878
So there will be oreums.

210
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,307
In boxing,

211
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,377
it's like a slugfest.

212
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:31,947
(Oreum is like a slugfest in boxing.)

213
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:34,578
- Right. - You must not take a break.

214
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,287
It's about continuing on with the fight...

215
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,717
without taking a break.

216
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,318
It's very similar to trail running in terms of stamina.

217
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:43,427
So I hope you'll improve your physical strength...

218
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,297
through today's trail run.

219
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,178
If I remember correctly, the cut-off time is...

220
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:48,827
two hours and a half.

221
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,728
- That's right. - Two hours and a half.

222
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,467
- Yes. - We'll do it without a break.

223
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,137
- We'll challenge ourselves. - Since the weather...

224
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,578
- I want to do it. - is like this...

225
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:58,107
To be honest, my heart feels heavy.

226
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,237
Seeing the others do it without me makes my heart heavy.

227
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,977
I'm very disappointed that I can't participate in it.

228
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,677
You'll do personal training with me.

229
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,678
She won't rest,

230
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,777
- but do personal training. - Yes.

231
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,487
I'll run with the members and take care of them...

232
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,887
- in the back. - Please be the pacemaker.

233
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:14,187
Of course. I'll be your pacemaker.

234
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,727
To be honest, trail running is hard in and of itself.

235
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,857
When the weather is rough,

236
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,127
- we need to stay focused. - That's right.

237
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:24,367
So I think it'll be good training for our concentration too.

238
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:26,438
Completing the trail race...

239
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,337
without giving up is my goal.

240
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,438
- Okay. - I'll need to stay focused.

241
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,337
I'm nervous.

242
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:34,408
(I'm nervous.)

243
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:35,778
(Sighing)

244
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,678
It's time.

245
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:39,278
Let's go.

246
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,577
In Ah, root for us. Good luck with your training.

247
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:43,187
- Don't get hurt. - Good luck.

248
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,747
- KO! - Iron...

249
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,557
- Girls! - Girls!

250
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:48,987
- Let's do this! - Let's go!

251
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,087
- Let's go! - Completing the race is our goal!

252
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:52,828
- Don't get hurt. - Bye.

253
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,158
- Let's go! - Let's go!

254
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,067
Iron Girls, you're cool.

255
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,297
Good luck.

256
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,367
(They move to the starting line.)

257
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:01,038
- Let's finish the race safely. - Let's go.

258
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:03,037
(It's nice to meet you.)

259
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,707
The sun is up.

260
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,907
Let's go.

261
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,178
- The weather is improving. - Let's go.

262
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,848
(The rainstorm made it hard to see what was in front of you.)

263
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,587
(But the sky cleared up when it was time to begin.)

264
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:18,757
The weather improved.

265
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,057
How did the sun come up...

266
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:21,557
- at the right time? - I know.

267
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,027
- I'm the weather fairy. - Yes.

268
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:24,388
(I'm the weather fairy.)

269
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:27,758
(1 minute before the start)

270
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:31,568
(It's their first trail run.)

271
00:10:32,168 --> 00:10:35,967
(It's always nerve-racking to start the race.)

272
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,168
It'll start now.

273
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,038
Fight on!

274
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,637
- Fight on! - Eight,

275
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:41,947
- Are we going now? - seven,

276
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,448
- We're going now. - six,

277
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,547
- Here we go. - five,

278
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,977
(It's the 10km trail run.)

279
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,017
four,

280
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,824
(Their goal is to finish in 2 hours and 30 minutes.)

281
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,347
- Let's go. - three,

282
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:52,717
(Will Iron Girls be able to finish the race safely?)

283
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,417
- two, one. - Let's go. Let's do this.

284
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,927
- Let's go. - Let's go.

285
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:56,987
(The trail run starts.)

286
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,828
Let's go!

287
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:01,628
Let's go!

288
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,367
Bye!

289
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,267
- Let's go! - Let's go!

290
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,438
We'll be back.

291
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,337
Let's go!

292
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,408
- Let's go! - Let's go!

293
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:13,808
(They start with a fighting spirit.)

294
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,937
Good luck.

295
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,008
Okay.

296
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,177
Uie, good luck.

297
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,548
Good luck.

298
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,788
A race like this makes us feel the emotions...

299
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,758
we can't usually feel in our lives.

300
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,987
There are so many people behind us.

301
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,434
- Really? - There are so many people.

302
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,687
Still, it's nice.

303
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,127
It's nice.

304
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,697
Yes. Aren't you glad that you came here to run?

305
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:34,898
It's nice.

306
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:36,927
(They feel the touching emotions of a race once more.)

307
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:37,928
Let's go.

308
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,297
I think we'll be able to do it.

309
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,974
(They feel the touching emotions of a race once more.)

310
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,467
The sky is becoming pretty! Look at the sky!

311
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,308
(The sky is becoming pretty! Look at the sky!)

312
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,177
The race has begun.

313
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,978
(What's the first section of the trail race?)

314
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,108
(The 1km straight section)

315
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,878
Let's go.

316
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:54,148
Good.

317
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:56,447
It's long. It's 10km.

318
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:58,247
Since it's 10km, we shouldn't push ourselves...

319
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:59,558
in the beginning.

320
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:01,557
Take good care of your breathing...

321
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:03,358
- when the trail isn't tough. - Okay.

322
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,028
(Breathing)

323
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:07,927
(The member who has tried triathlon passes on her know-how.)

324
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:11,198
Since the ground is hard, your legs might hurt even more.

325
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:12,738
Keep the steps short.

326
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,768
Trot.

327
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,889
(Do that if your legs hurt.)

328
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:16,707
Increase the running cadence.

329
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,844
(Showing off the charms of the senior in the race)

330
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,738
- Move your arms too. - Okay.

331
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:21,478
Swing them like this.

332
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,348
(I think I'm pretty cool.)

333
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,118
(While Ju Hyun shows off her charms as a senior)

334
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,618
I can't see Uie.

335
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,587
I can't see Uie.

336
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,948
(Where did Uie go?)

337
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,818
I'll beat the wind.

338
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,027
Let's beat it. I can beat it.

339
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,388
(She moves forward quickly as she braves the wind of Jeju.)

340
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:40,998
I can do it.

341
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,297
I just need to do it.

342
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:44,468
(Uie passes the 1km point.)

343
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,867
I feel like the race has begun in earnest.

344
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:48,444
(The queen of stamina is in good condition today.)

345
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,638
(She arrives at the next section before anyone.)

346
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,708
(After the paved road of the first section, )

347
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:58,108
(what will she see in the second section?)

348
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:02,588
(This is where the trail run begins in earnest.)

349
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,188
(A dense forest trail)

350
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:09,658
(Uie enters the forest.)

351
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,698
(The course turns green, unlike the first section.)

352
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,328
It's unbelievable.

353
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,868
I'm running in nature.

354
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,008
(It isn't the asphalt road like the regular marathon.)

355
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,638
(You run on the dirt road that's full of forest aroma.)

356
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:28,537
A trail run really is different.

357
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,648
(You can enjoy nature during a trail run.)

358
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:32,248
I can't believe...

359
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,478
this is a race.

360
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:39,118
(She feels the nature of Jeju with her two feet.)

361
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:40,358
Oh, my.

362
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,728
(But the romantic feeling is short-lived.)

363
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,258
Oh, my.

364
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:46,957
(Gosh!)

365
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,068
(The trail is covered in branches.)

366
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,868
It's annoying that the trail continues to be like this.

367
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:56,568
(There are embedded rocks...)

368
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:01,178
(as well as tree roots that stick out from the ground.)

369
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,578
(It isn't easy to run on the bumpy trail.)

370
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:07,618
(There are dangers everywhere.)

371
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:09,518
I think it'll be better...

372
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:11,247
to run 10km on a flatland.

373
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:13,248
(The romantic moment is gone after a few minutes.)

374
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:14,918
Gosh, it's like an ocean over here.

375
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,357
(To make matters worse, )

376
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:24,667
(the overnight rain had created puddles.)

377
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,037
(Another puddle appears.)

378
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:27,438
What's this?

379
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,467
(Splashing)

380
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,538
(Gosh!)

381
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,178
This can't be helped.

382
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,078
(Feeling very uncomfortable)

383
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:40,348
(Her shoes are wet already.)

384
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:44,717
(Another puddle appears soon afterward.)

385
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,957
(Sighing)

386
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,018
(Gosh!)

387
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,618
I don't know.

388
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,028
(Gosh!)

389
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,058
Gosh, my shoes...

390
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:55,508
I won't be able to finish in 2 hours and 30 minutes.

391
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,698
My shoes turned so heavy.

392
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,938
It's so slippery.

393
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,167
(A branch slaps her.)

394
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:05,108
(While Uie is getting beaten up by the trail run)

395
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:08,901
(Ju Hyun enters the second section, the forest trail.)

396
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:11,370
(Showing off her experience, she runs ahead of Sae Rok.)

397
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:12,671
(Sae Rok)

398
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,210
(Slapping)

399
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,270
(A branch slaps her at the start of the forest trail.)

400
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,811
The leaves...

401
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:18,610
(A branch hits her again.)

402
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:19,750
Gosh, this is...

403
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,511
(Laughing)

404
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,121
The leaves...

405
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:24,920
(Even to an experienced member, the forest trail isn't easy.)

406
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,091
This isn't easy.

407
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,851
(Faltering for the 2nd time)

408
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:32,061
(It's very different from the first section.)

409
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,161
Gosh, this is...

410
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,001
(A puddle appears.)

411
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,500
Gosh, my feet are like a water park.

412
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:43,471
(Gosh, my feet are like a water park.)

413
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,501
The terrain keeps changing,

414
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,840
so my legs...

415
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,511
(My legs...)

416
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:49,980
This is hard.

417
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:52,551
(The changing terrain is rough on her legs.)

418
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,181
My feet hurt.

419
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,250
To the left.

420
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,821
(It isn't easy to run on the forest trail.)

421
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:03,361
(How is it going for Sae Rok who is experiencing her first race?)

422
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,161
Oh, my.

423
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:06,630
I'm sorry.

424
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,731
(I'm sorry.)

425
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:12,571
(The rough terrain is wearing down her stamina.)

426
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,831
My goodness.

427
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:18,770
(Sae Rok is also taking a jab from the trail run.)

428
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,810
(Keunsaseumi Oreum, Aid Station, Start and Finish, Ttarabi Oreum)

429
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,511
(30 minutes have passed.)

430
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:24,741
What? There's traffic.

431
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:27,650
There's traffic. What is it? I'm scared.

432
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,881
(Why is there traffic?)

433
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,251
Isn't this the oreum section?

434
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,150
- No? This is driving me crazy. - This isn't the oreum section.

435
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,050
- Something insane remains. - What?

436
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,120
(Something insane remains before the oreum.)

437
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,390
Isn't this the oreum section?

438
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:38,637
(What's the insane thing that lies in front of the traffic?)

439
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:39,861
What's that?

440
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:41,791
What's that?

441
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,801
Is a trail run supposed to be like this?

442
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:46,770
Seriously?

443
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,070
Is a trail run supposed to be like this?

444
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,241
Yes.

445
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,700
What is this?

446
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,211
(It's like a scene from a disaster movie.)

447
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,841
It's like "The Law of Jungle."

448
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:58,880
Isn't this "The Law of Jungle?"

449
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,881
(She suddenly encounters the Amazon vibe.)

450
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:04,421
(Grab the rope and cross a stream to escape!)

451
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:05,950
I'm nervous.

452
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,090
I can do it.

453
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,120
(But I can do it!)

454
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,361
- It's slippery. Be careful. - Okay.

455
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,060
Slowly.

456
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,491
(Feeling nervous, she crosses the stream.)

457
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,031
What's this?

458
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,461
(Feeling strangely excited)

459
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:23,541
(Moving forward without hesitation despite the strong currents)

460
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,841
(With long strides)

461
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,211
Okay.

462
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,981
(Quickly passing through the stream)

463
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,151
(Going up the steep stone steps without difficulty)

464
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,150
(Groaning)

465
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,920
(After overcoming all kinds of obstacles like that)

466
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:41,951
(Exclaiming)

467
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,921
What's this?

468
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,391
(A staggering number of steps unfold before her eyes.)

469
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:51,201
(The first oreum, Ttarabi Oreum)

470
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,000
(342m above sea level)

471
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,731
(Toward the top of the oreum, )

472
00:17:56,601 --> 00:18:01,411
(there are endless stairs.)

473
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,611
This is no joke.

474
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:07,511
Help me.

475
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,380
I can't do this.

476
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,681
(Ttarabi Oreum, the toughest section)

477
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:15,221
(But I'm Stamina Queen!)

478
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,290
(Going up)

479
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,890
(Over and over again)

480
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,491
- Good luck. - Good luck.

481
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,131
(Maintaining the pace, )

482
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:28,331
(she keeps climbing without stopping.)

483
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:31,871
(She is the real Stamina Queen.)

484
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:35,111
(As she continues climbing without stopping, )

485
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:39,981
(she encounters endless stairs.)

486
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,311
(These stairs are strange.)

487
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:43,581
Why doesn't it end?

488
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,491
(While Uie is trapped in the endless stairs.)

489
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:48,120
(What about Ju Hyun, who is following her?)

490
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,491
(Blocking the branches)

491
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,661
(Avoiding vines)

492
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:56,361
(Slowly getting used to trail running)

493
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:59,570
(Passing)

494
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,671
(Passing more people)

495
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,301
Where is Uie?

496
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:07,311
(I'm coming to catch up with Uie.)

497
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,041
This is a jungle.

498
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:11,610
(Going through the jungle-like stream...)

499
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,281
(without hesitation)

500
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,911
All right. It's over.

501
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:21,191
(Going up the stone steps quickly like a squirrel)

502
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:25,190
(Running through the forest)

503
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:28,731
(Nimble Squirrel Ju Hyun)

504
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:30,100
(Panting)

505
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:32,561
(Suddenly, her pace slows down.)

506
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:34,601
(Sighing)

507
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:37,141
The uphill road. It's tough.

508
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,510
How are people running up here?

509
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,157
(Ju Hyun arrives at the entrance of the oreum.)

510
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,311
Now is the time.

511
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:45,841
I should draw my weapon.

512
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,181
My weapon.

513
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,721
I'm equipped with my weapon.

514
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,061
Life is all about gear.

515
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,291
Let's go.

516
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,331
Good. Life is all about gear.

517
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,101
(Ability, 10 points added)

518
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:04,731
(Confidence, 500 points added)

519
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:06,831
Let's go.

520
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:11,140
(Running without hesitation)

521
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:12,200
Help me.

522
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,640
(Is it over already?)

523
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,671
Gosh, sir.

524
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:19,491
There are things I can't do even with the gear.

525
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,751
(Struggling)

526
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,281
My goodness.

527
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,251
(The endless stairs are killing Ju Hyun.)

528
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,121
Where's the end?

529
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,591
(Ttarabi Oreum)

530
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:34,091
(While Ju Hyun crawls over the oreum)

531
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,671
We have already passed one-fifth of the course.

532
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,061
It's over 2km.

533
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:40,870
At this pace, you'll probably be in the upper middle ranks.

534
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,130
- Really? - Yes.

535
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,270
(Intrigued)

536
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:44,341
Let's go.

537
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:46,471
Okay. Go!

538
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,871
Where should I go?

539
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:50,111
Go up.

540
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,280
Go up. Be careful.

541
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,311
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

542
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,361
Let's speed up. There's no one in front of you.

543
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:57,881
Good.

544
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,751
You're running well.

545
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,391
- You learned well. - Yes.

546
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,421
In trail running, you have to watch the ground.

547
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,390
I should watch the terrain.

548
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,430
Right.

549
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,461
(Evading)

550
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,930
- Let's go. - Let's go.

551
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:11,931
(Meanwhile, Uie...)

552
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:13,001
This is unbelievable.

553
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:14,831
- Let's go. - Let's go.

554
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,800
- Let's go. - Thank you.

555
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,371
(Let's go.)

556
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,771
I should stop chanting.

557
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:20,970
I'm too tired.

558
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:22,311
(She's too tired to shout.)

559
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:23,681
(Groaning)

560
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:27,350
(Still, she forces herself to keep running...)

561
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:31,251
(and finally reaches the summit.)

562
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:32,481
This is beautiful.

563
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,150
It's so pretty.

564
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:36,461
(The open landscape welcomed by the vast sky)

565
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,660
I can't believe this.

566
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,760
(Ttarabi Oreum, known as the queen of oreums)

567
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,061
This is really nice.

568
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:48,300
(As if rewarding them for their arduous journey, )

569
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:51,971
(the scenery unfolds like a gift.)

570
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,171
(The Ttarabi Oreum course, which they are running, )

571
00:21:56,111 --> 00:22:00,511
(as three craters at the summit.)

572
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:07,351
(It's a course where you run along the perimeter trail.)

573
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:13,460
(Energized by the cool breeze at the summit...)

574
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:17,561
(and the beautiful scenery, )

575
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:22,101
(she quickly advances along the crater trail.)

576
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,170
Is it 4km now?

577
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:26,571
(Uie passes the 4km point.)

578
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,110
Let's go!

579
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,411
(The end of the summit section)

580
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,051
(Feeling great)

581
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,311
My goodness.

582
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,851
I don't think I can go down.

583
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,281
I don't think...

584
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:40,551
(Uie suddenly stops walking?)

585
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,221
Can people walk on this?

586
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,390
(What catches Uie's eye...)

587
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:50,901
(is a steep downhill slope.)

588
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,970
(Just looking at it makes her dizzy.)

589
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,241
How am I supposed to go down?

590
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:01,341
(The maximum gradient is 45°.)

591
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:05,211
(A downhill slope without steps)

592
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:07,150
I don't think I can go down.

593
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,181
(Actually, Uie is...)

594
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:12,750
(On the day of basic trail running training)

595
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,891
Back in my school days, while training in the mountains,

596
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:18,791
I got seriously injured on the downhill slope.

597
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,891
I felt the same way when I did cycling.

598
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,061
(I'm so scared to go down.)

599
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:29,901
(After the accident, Uie developed a fear of downhill slopes.)

600
00:23:30,771 --> 00:23:32,771
(I can't do this by myself.)

601
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:37,041
(She struggled even on gentle slopes.)

602
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,481
I can't.

603
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,480
This is it for me.

604
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,081
(A steep slope unfolds before her eyes.)

605
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:47,791
(Will Uie be able to go down the slope safely?)

606
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,360
(At that moment, Ju Hyu is still struggling with the stairs.)

607
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,661
Where is the end?

608
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:57,731
(The brutal road with no end in sight)

609
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,101
(Groaning)

610
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,371
I'm a boxer.

611
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,670
(Holding the trekking pole, )

612
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,911
(the boxer with a dogged spirit pulls herself up again.)

613
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:09,241
Don't stop.

614
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:10,840
Just don't stop.

615
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,181
- Good luck. - Good luck.

616
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,680
(With her willpower and determination, )

617
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,781
(she keeps going up.)

618
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,290
Good. It's a flatland.

619
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,237
(Ju Hyun finally sees the end of the brutal uphill road.)

620
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,260
(Ju Hyun passes the 4km point.)

621
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:26,461
This is pretty.

622
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:27,931
This is amazing.

623
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,561
It's really pretty.

624
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:32,230
Unbelievable.

625
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:34,500
(Behind the arduous uphill road, )

626
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:37,801
(the wide open scenery of Jeju unfolds.)

627
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,911
I can't believe I'm here. I should eat some snacks.

628
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,380
Gosh, this view...

629
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,480
(Rustling)

630
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:45,741
This is crazy.

631
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:49,650
(Exclaiming)

632
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:51,381
(This is so delicious.)

633
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:52,721
This is crazy.

634
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:54,150
(Chewing)

635
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,621
(Enjoying the view while eating the snack)

636
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:59,161
(Taking another bite)

637
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,461
(While Ju Hyun enjoys the summit)

638
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:04,860
- Good luck. - Yes.

639
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:07,271
(Sae Rok struggles up the stairs.)

640
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:09,230
(One, two)

641
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,501
(Trying hard)

642
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:15,741
(Leaning on the poles that are as tall as she is)

643
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,281
Does it come in only one size?

644
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:22,051
(She has no energy to answer.)

645
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:23,780
I think the poles are too big for you.

646
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:25,551
What? It's all right.

647
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:27,951
Let's go, Sae Rok.

648
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,221
- You can do this. - I can do this.

649
00:25:31,091 --> 00:25:33,660
- We've climbed 100m. - Okay.

650
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:35,330
- It's about 300m. - Okay.

651
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:36,901
- We have 200m to go. - All right.

652
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:38,601
- Let's keep going. - Okay.

653
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,271
I know it's hard, but we shouldn't just stop.

654
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,201
You're doing well. It's a flatland. Try harder.

655
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:46,987
Even athletes who have been exercising their entire lives...

656
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:48,870
- can't help but find it difficult. - Okay.

657
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,681
- It's just as hard for them too. - Okay.

658
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,180
But even when it's hard,

659
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:55,950
you have to keep taking one more step.

660
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,021
- Okay. - Good luck.

661
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,581
- Let's go. - Captain.

662
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,091
- Help me. - Let's go.

663
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,421
All right. Let's think that this is a boxing match.

664
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:06,491
Okay.

665
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,490
Imagine that you are having a match.

666
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,900
Okay. I'm trying my best.

667
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,130
Like you keep moving your feet...

668
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:12,160
- when you're exhausted. - Okay.

669
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:14,121
(She's being led by the ceaseless encouragement.)

670
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,630
I can't go down here.

671
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,841
(Meanwhile, Uie is stuck on the downhill road.)

672
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:19,811
I should go down, right?

673
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,540
How am I supposed to though?

674
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:23,621
(She's afraid, but she sets off to finish the race.)

675
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:24,740
I should just go.

676
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:25,980
(Carefully, )

677
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:28,681
(she goes down one step at a time.)

678
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:30,350
(Careful)

679
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,421
Keep your eyes open.

680
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:32,951
(Exclaiming)

681
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:38,561
Just relax. Relax your shoulders.

682
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:41,161
You are too stiff at the shoulders.

683
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,461
I'm afraid of going downhill.

684
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,461
Please walk past me.

685
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,171
Is there anyone behind me?

686
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,601
(She's too scared to look back.)

687
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,670
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

688
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:54,671
- Excuse me. Good luck. - Please go ahead.

689
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,211
Thank you.

690
00:26:56,881 --> 00:27:00,080
Gosh, I don't know how to go down.

691
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:01,150
(She is not able to speed up.)

692
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:02,651
Gosh, this is really...

693
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:05,521
This is true hardship and adversity.

694
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,890
- I don't know. - Try going down in zigzags.

695
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,121
- In zigzags? - Yes.

696
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:11,661
(Groaning)

697
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,021
No. I can do this.

698
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:15,430
- You can do this! - I can do this!

699
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:16,761
Okay. Let's give it a try.

700
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,670
(She goes down in zigzags, as advised.)

701
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,791
I'm going to try to be less afraid of going downhill.

702
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:25,040
I can do this.

703
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,710
(Recharged confidence)

704
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,841
Let's go.

705
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:32,581
(The Stamina Queen is slowly getting her pace back.)

706
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,581
I'm in trouble.

707
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,550
(She stops running again.)

708
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:39,621
To the side.

709
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:41,451
- Oh, no. - This way.

710
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,050
- To the side. - No.

711
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,121
(The scary muddy downhill looks very slippery.)

712
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,290
What kind of road is this, seriously?

713
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,637
(The ground is so slippery that you can barely stand on it.)

714
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:52,030
I don't think I can go. This is too slippery.

715
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,061
(It's very steep.)

716
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,000
(There are a lot of runners who slip and fall.)

717
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:57,471
No. It's dangerous.

718
00:27:58,201 --> 00:27:59,540
(It's truly an insane section.)

719
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:00,741
This is insane.

720
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,180
It's too scary.

721
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,587
(Uie, who has a fear of downhills, finds it even more terrifying.)

722
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,240
(Moving hurriedly)

723
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,711
(Taking out her trekking poles in a hurry)

724
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,120
(Her breathing becomes heavy with tension.)

725
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,121
It's dangerous.

726
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,420
- You can go sideways carefully. - Sideways?

727
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,251
- To the side. - To the right.

728
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:17,790
Side.

729
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:20,261
(Careful steps)

730
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:21,561
Okay.

731
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:23,700
Oh, no.

732
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,101
(It's a mess.)

733
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,500
Gosh, please.

734
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,371
(It's a mess here and there.)

735
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:31,970
Are you all right?

736
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,770
(It's absolute chaos.)

737
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:34,840
- Let me hold your arm. - It's very slippery.

738
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,011
- Oh, no. - Oreums are tough.

739
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:37,880
Gosh. I'm so scared.

740
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,711
I hear people screaming.

741
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:41,150
(Screaming)

742
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,251
(What do I do?)

743
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,880
Just focus on myself.

744
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,721
(Just focus on myself. Don't mind the others.)

745
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:49,050
- Oh, dear. - Hold the thick one.

746
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,361
Thank you.

747
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:51,990
I'm slipping down.

748
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,931
(Sliding)

749
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:55,451
I don't like this kind of traffic.

750
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:59,101
(She's about to cry.)

751
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:02,771
(Surprised)

752
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,970
- What? Ju Hyun. - We haven't even done 5km yet.

753
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:07,070
- Uie. - Be careful, Ju Hyun.

754
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:08,670
- Uie. - It's really slippery here.

755
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,281
- Uie. - How is she doing that?

756
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,017
- How is she doing that? - It's really dangerous.

757
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,551
I was told...

758
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:15,450
to trust the poles.

759
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:16,697
(She's pushing her way down with her dogged spirit.)

760
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,250
- Good luck. - Life is all about gear.

761
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,551
(Life is all about gear.)

762
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,291
(An amazing scene)

763
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,661
A gear lover is passing by.

764
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,861
(Actually, Ju Hyun is...)

765
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,331
Be careful on the downhill slope.

766
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,700
Thank you.

767
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,061
(I'm confident in going downhill.)

768
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:35,101
(Groaning)

769
00:29:35,301 --> 00:29:36,641
Life is all about gear.

770
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,801
(She ran down the slope quickly.)

771
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,011
This is not bad.

772
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,310
It's better than a flatland.

773
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:45,481
(Levelled-up Squirrel Ju Hyun)

774
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:50,581
(Running down the steep slope at lightning speed)

775
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,590
Sir. I'll be in trouble if I fail to finish the race.

776
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,991
(She goes down the slippery, muddy road without hesitation.)

777
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,960
I think the poles are useful.

778
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:01,660
(Drawing everyone's attention, )

779
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,731
These poles.

780
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:05,730
(she runs through the crowd.)

781
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:06,971
This is good.

782
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,830
- Go ahead. Be careful. - I'm trusting my gear.

783
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,771
- Be careful not to fall. - Okay.

784
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,001
You're doing a good job.

785
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,671
- Good luck. - Life is all about gear.

786
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:16,271
I believe in my gear.

787
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:19,410
The gear is good, isn't it?

788
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,051
(It's almost like a religious belief.)

789
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,580
- Be careful. - Okay. Don't worry.

790
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:24,751
(Uie sends Ju Hyun ahead.)

791
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,251
Pull yourself together.

792
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,191
I should trust my gear too.

793
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:33,431
(Uie is motivated by Ju Hyun.)

794
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:34,860
Okay.

795
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:35,931
Poke.

796
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:37,901
Poke.

797
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:41,401
(Poking the ground with the poles, she moves one step at a time.)

798
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,740
All right. It's over.

799
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:45,970
I see the end.

800
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,517
(She finally sees the end of the downhill slope.)

801
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:51,281
(She bravely finished the slope section.)

802
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,650
(Uie and Ju Hyun finished the first oreum section.)

803
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:55,680
- Wait. - Keep going.

804
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:56,781
- Wait. - Why?

805
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,081
Wait.

806
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,151
This is amazing.

807
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:02,120
It's so beautiful.

808
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,560
(Exclaiming)

809
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,721
Let's go.

810
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:05,960
Goodness.

811
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:07,161
It's so beautiful.

812
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:09,690
Seriously...

813
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,730
If you're able to notice the scenery,

814
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:12,100
you have enough energy left. You can do it.

815
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:13,330
I feel like crying. It's beautiful.

816
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,501
- Noticing the scenery... - Captain.

817
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:17,031
- Yes? - I can't believe this view.

818
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,300
Seriously. It's so beautiful.

819
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,570
(It captivates Sae Rok's heart.)

820
00:31:20,571 --> 00:31:23,170
This is so cool. Seriously.

821
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,340
(The breathtaking Jeju scenery)

822
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,081
This is amazing. It's unbelievable.

823
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,881
This is really beautiful.

824
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,341
(She's about to burst into tears.)

825
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:32,851
We should take a photo here.

826
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,051
Oh, dear.

827
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

828
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:39,491
(Like the other runners, who are enjoying this moment, )

829
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,561
(Sae Rok stops for a moment and enjoys the view.)

830
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:45,930
(Falling for the charm of trail running)

831
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:47,201
This is beautiful.

832
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,301
I'm tired, but this cheers me up.

833
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:55,471
(Recharged with the beautiful view, she sets off again.)

834
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,611
Watch your steps. In small strides.

835
00:31:57,681 --> 00:31:59,511
Run in small strides. It's steep.

836
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:03,721
(Running down quickly with no fear)

837
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:05,650
Be careful.

838
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,691
(Even on the terrifying, steep muddy slope, )

839
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:11,161
(she turns into Determined Sae Rok.)

840
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,530
We can go on both sides.

841
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,091
(Going down quickly)

842
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:17,631
It's over.

843
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:19,460
The tough part is over.

844
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:21,107
(The end of the first oreum slowly comes into view.)

845
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:22,131
- It's over. - It's over.

846
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:23,571
I almost died.

847
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,301
(It's been 1 hour and 20 minutes.)

848
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:29,411
(All the members of Iron Girls passed the first oreum section.)

849
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:32,181
(Meanwhile, what is In Ah doing?)

850
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:36,010
What did you prepare for me, Coach?

851
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,121
(It's a secret.)

852
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,651
(Half-excited, half-worried)

853
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:42,120
(What is the special training for In Ah?)

854
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,351
- Ta-da. - Goodness.

855
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:45,321
Gosh, seriously...

856
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:46,791
(Furious)

857
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:48,361
I mean...

858
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,460
(Wood-chopping training)

859
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:53,201
How did you prepare all this again?

860
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:59,270
(The previous day, Iron Girls had a wood-chopping training.)

861
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,271
That's it.

862
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:02,371
(It stimulated their forearm muscles.)

863
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:07,751
(A total of 80 logs were sacrificed for their upper-body strength.)

864
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,681
(They thought they had chopped all the logs on Jeju Island.)

865
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,791
- Seriously... - It's harder than you think.

866
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,721
- How many are there? - That's 30.

867
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,571
- Am I chopping them all by myself? - Yes.

868
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,531
I feel like I came to Jeju Island to chop firewood.

869
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:23,531
That's it.

870
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,061
- I'm good. - Well done.

871
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,901
You're doing it with accuracy. Good job.

872
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:30,031
I'll do it with a fighting spirit.

873
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,371
- That's it. - Let's go.

874
00:33:32,941 --> 00:33:35,071
(Preparing the next target without delay)

875
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:37,681
(Shattered)

876
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,641
(Bring it on, logs.)

877
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:41,010
Good.

878
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,480
(Working out her upper body properly)

879
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:44,921
What am I doing with an ax?

880
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:46,780
(Shattered)

881
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:48,191
It's broken into four pieces.

882
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,221
Goodness. We've got good firewood.

883
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,161
Something's wrong with this.

884
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,661
(All right then.)

885
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:58,131
(Taking off her vest)

886
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:00,107
(She takes off everything that is bothering her.)

887
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,231
All right.

888
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:03,031
I'll smash everything.

889
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:05,401
That's it.

890
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,011
(A perfect log hunt with absolute precision)

891
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:16,751
(The upper body training has been going on for 1 hour.)

892
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:17,921
The last one.

893
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,020
(The last prey)

894
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:20,021
(Escaping)

895
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:21,090
You rascal.

896
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,121
You're afraid of me.

897
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:25,591
(Clean)

898
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:27,091
(Happy)

899
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,461
(She has completed chopping 30 logs.)

900
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:31,801
I trained my upper body properly.

901
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,670
I can't flex my forearm muscles.

902
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,671
(She's done strengthening her forearm muscles.)

903
00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:37,741
If you get hit by my punch now, you'll be dead.

904
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,670
How about a final spurt then?

905
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:40,911
I shouldn't have said that.

906
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,170
Practice the one-two 100 times.

907
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,210
Are you serious?

908
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,240
Start.

909
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,581
(Punching hard with her pumped-up upper body)

910
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,450
(The sound shows the power of her punch.)

911
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,451
Bend a little more.

912
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:51,520
Six. Good.

913
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:52,621
(The boxer mode)

914
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,551
Nine. That's strong.

915
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:55,950
Ten. Good.

916
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:57,297
(She rests her sore knees and focuses on her upper body training.)

917
00:34:57,321 --> 00:35:00,391
(While In Ah's upper body training continues)

918
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:03,491
(Where is Ju Hyun in the lead?)

919
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,931
It's 5.3km.

920
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:06,601
I'm almost there.

921
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,171
I don't have much time.

922
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:12,001
My gosh. Be careful.

923
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,511
(She suddenly begins to stagger.)

924
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:19,610
(The ground is in bad condition.)

925
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:21,110
Gosh, what's this?

926
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,431
(The ground is in bad condition.)

927
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:25,821
(The once refreshing birch forest...)

928
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,350
This is a swamp.

929
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:29,567
(has turned into a swamp where her feet sink in.)

930
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:30,720
It's so slippery.

931
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:31,961
(The entire path is flooded.)

932
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,890
(She still has a long way to go.)

933
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:36,831
Gosh, this is really hard.

934
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:39,901
(Her feet feel heavy, covered in mud.)

935
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,801
What's this?

936
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,070
(To make things worse, the mud goes up to her knees.)

937
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:45,770
What is this? Is this a bathhouse or what?

938
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,317
(To make things worse, the mud goes up to her knees.)

939
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:48,440
Gosh, this is...

940
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:49,841
Be careful.

941
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:52,781
(Exhausted)

942
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:56,081
It feels like an anaconda might come out.

943
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:58,621
(Splash)

944
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:01,051
Gosh, it feels so cool.

945
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,051
It feels great.

946
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,821
(Trying to stay positive)

947
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,531
My feet feel so cool.

948
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,260
(It's just my body that's tired. It's all about my mindset.)

949
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:10,501
I want to go in.

950
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:13,800
(Despite the muddy ground, she overcomes the obstacles easily.)

951
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,171
I've done this plenty of times...

952
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:16,900
in sparring.

953
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:18,701
(I've done this plenty of times in sparring!)

954
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,540
It's just like that.

955
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,617
(She only thinks about boxing even during the trail running.)

956
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,611
(After the tough swamp section)

957
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:26,611
It's so pretty.

958
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,281
My gosh, this is...

959
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:31,851
It's like "Howl's Moving Castle."

960
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,920
(At the end of the long forest path, )

961
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,520
(a wide-open flatland appears.)

962
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:39,220
It's a muddy version of "Howl's Moving Castle."

963
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,737
(A landscape that's like a fairy tale)

964
00:36:40,761 --> 00:36:44,061
(She's back in her element as she sees the flatland.)

965
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:45,801
It's flatland.

966
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:47,700
I should run on the flatland.

967
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:48,701
(She runs again.)

968
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:53,810
My gosh. This is amazing. There are horses.

969
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,287
(My gosh. This is amazing. There are horses.)

970
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:56,440
Unbelievable.

971
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:58,181
(Horses resting in an unfenced field)

972
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:00,511
Is it okay to leave the horses here like this?

973
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,681
(It's a truly eco-friendly running course.)

974
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,251
(Trying to interact with them)

975
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:10,021
I'm good at horseback riding.

976
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,321
I really want to go on horseback.

977
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:15,831
(Leaving behind her wish that can't come true)

978
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:17,731
I should put the gear back in.

979
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,100
Put them back in.

980
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,571
(She set aside the equipment for now.)

981
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:26,271
(The real running begins now.)

982
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:29,010
(She runs...)

983
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,011
(and runs.)

984
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:32,380
Hang in there.

985
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,210
(Through her clenched teeth, she runs hard.)

986
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,511
(And before her lies...)

987
00:37:36,611 --> 00:37:39,251
Gosh, aid.

988
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:44,061
(The aid station is located at the 7km point.)

989
00:37:44,421 --> 00:37:46,721
(People stop here to hydrate...)

990
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:52,561
(and refuel with sweet, refreshing watermelon.)

991
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:56,131
(All runners love the aid station.)

992
00:37:56,571 --> 00:38:00,371
(Ju Hyun arrived at the aid station.)

993
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:03,341
(Devouring)

994
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:06,381
(She finished a piece of watermelon in no time.)

995
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,010
(Now on to her second piece)

996
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,081
Good luck.

997
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:10,651
Thank you.

998
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:14,020
- Good luck. - Good luck.

999
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:15,727
(Ju Hyun restored her energy with watermelon.)

1000
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,761
(There's still a long way to go.)

1001
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,361
That watermelon was so good.

1002
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:25,101
(Suddenly, a familiar head comes into view.)

1003
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,371
Run.

1004
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,671
She's terrifying.

1005
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:31,870
Park Ju Hyun, run.

1006
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,277
(Uie, the ace runner, surges ahead.)

1007
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:35,340
(As Ju Hyun was leaving the aid station, )

1008
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,180
(Uie appeared like the wind.)

1009
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,311
(Ju Hyun, Uie)

1010
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:42,611
(She doesn't even stop by the aid station and keeps running.)

1011
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,720
(Uie quickly catches up to Ju Hyun.)

1012
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:45,881
Run.

1013
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,491
Uie, I can't.

1014
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:49,851
We only got 3km left.

1015
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,701
Don't take a break. Keep going.

1016
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:55,461
I’m not good at running uphill.

1017
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:56,761
Run.

1018
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,531
(She eventually runs ahead of her.)

1019
00:38:58,661 --> 00:38:59,831
She's so impressive.

1020
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:01,601
I would totally fall for her.

1021
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,240
How is she running like that?

1022
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,041
(After surpassing Ju Hyun, )

1023
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:07,640
(Uie starts picking up speed.)

1024
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:08,641
(1 person)

1025
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:10,411
(2 people)

1026
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,681
(3 people)

1027
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,581
(4 people)

1028
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,851
(5 people)

1029
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,851
(Uie is definitely a strong runner.)

1030
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:19,321
(She has returned to a 5-minute pace.)

1031
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,321
(Her smile has returned as well.)

1032
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,861
(However)

1033
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:26,381
Gosh, I hate running on mountains.

1034
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:28,490
Gosh, I hate running on mountains.

1035
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,361
(A mountain trail is stretched out in front of Uie.)

1036
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,430
(The summit elevation...)

1037
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:36,201
(is 473.5m.)

1038
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,900
(It's one uphill...)

1039
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:40,971
(after another.)

1040
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,881
(Endless stairs that seem to go on forever.)

1041
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:46,041
(The second challenge: Keunsaseumi Oreum)

1042
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:49,980
(Until they conquer this hill, )

1043
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:52,251
(the race isn't over.)

1044
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:56,791
(It's been 1 hour and 30 minutes since the race began.)

1045
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:01,161
(Will she be able to climb up the never-ending stairs in time?)

1046
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:04,561
(Meanwhile, where is Sae Rok?)

1047
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,431
We’re already closing in on 6km.

1048
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:08,371
We've done 5.8km.

1049
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:11,941
(Stumbling)

1050
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,070
(Exclaiming)

1051
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:14,110
Goodness.

1052
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,111
(Exclaiming)

1053
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,210
(She’s holding on with her signature exclamations while staggering.)

1054
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,281
Come on.

1055
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,010
I keep getting stuck too deep.

1056
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,880
- Be careful. - I want to run.

1057
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:22,881
No, you shouldn't.

1058
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:24,621
Just walk quickly.

1059
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,221
You're keeping up well.

1060
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,791
I'd say you're in the upper-middle ranks.

1061
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:31,121
- Really? - Yes.

1062
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:33,690
(In that case, )

1063
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:35,230
(I should run.)

1064
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,491
Gosh, you're running.

1065
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:38,861
Slow down a little. You're running.

1066
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:40,971
Watch your ankle.

1067
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:42,800
I think you're running too fast.

1068
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,741
(Every step she takes lands in mud, )

1069
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:48,171
(so her legs already look a mess.)

1070
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,741
(But she keeps on running.)

1071
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:53,861
- We'll reach the aid station soon. - Okay.

1072
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,581
We'll be done at the aid station.

1073
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,481
Okay, we're at the aid station.

1074
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:00,251
Nice.

1075
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,721
(She takes a bite of the watermelon.)

1076
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:07,331
(Gosh)

1077
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,961
(Taking a huge bite)

1078
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:13,301
(In a trance)

1079
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,301
(Lost in the moment, she finished a slice of watermelon.)

1080
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:21,441
(She moves on to her second slice right away.)

1081
00:41:21,841 --> 00:41:23,370
(Devouring)

1082
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,341
(Why is this so good?)

1083
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,551
It tastes as sweet as honey.

1084
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:29,210
Why are they so good?

1085
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:30,451
(Their watermelons are great.)

1086
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,081
They're so good.

1087
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:34,851
I'm so exhausted, but they're too good.

1088
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,591
I want to eat five slices before we leave.

1089
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:39,961
(She delivers a rapid-fire review about the watermelon.)

1090
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,031
It's unbelievable how good it is.

1091
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,560
Mom, I miss you.

1092
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:47,307
(It's been a while since she last checked in with her mom.)

1093
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,970
Let's go now.

1094
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:50,701
- This is good. - Okay. We have to go now.

1095
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,040
Let's go.

1096
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:54,817
(At Captain Kim's urging, she sets off again.)

1097
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:57,311
You have to show that you're running with focus.

1098
00:41:57,711 --> 00:41:59,110
What counts is the record.

1099
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:00,211
All right.

1100
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:01,881
This is the second half.

1101
00:42:01,882 --> 00:42:04,581
(Sae Rok is now headed for the second hill.)

1102
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,420
(Current location)

1103
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:09,291
(Keunsaseumi Oreum, the aid station)

1104
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,360
What is this...

1105
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:13,990
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun is battling the uphill path.)

1106
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,061
(Screaming)

1107
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:18,731
Am I seeing that slope correctly?

1108
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:22,630
It looks like people are piled up from the ground.

1109
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:25,071
(It looks like people are stacked all the way up to the sky.)

1110
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:26,271
Good luck.

1111
00:42:26,941 --> 00:42:28,641
(Running past)

1112
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:32,240
(Ju Hyun is struggling with the climb.)

1113
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,780
How are they running here?

1114
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:35,311
(How are they all running here?)

1115
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:38,021
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

1116
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:42,021
(She's now using her shoulders to climb up the hill.)

1117
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:45,921
(She pushes ahead for a while in a quite unique posture.)

1118
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:50,061
Was there such a long uphill path in Korea?

1119
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,101
When is this slope going to end?

1120
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,531
Why is this so long?

1121
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,130
Gosh.

1122
00:42:57,131 --> 00:43:00,471
(Will Ju Hyun, the weakest climber on the hill, make it to the summit?)

1123
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,240
(Uie is at the lead and she reaches the 7.5km point.)

1124
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,571
This is the final section.

1125
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:07,111
It's not over...

1126
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,481
until it's over.

1127
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:12,381
This section is insane. Goodness.

1128
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:20,731
(She keeps on striding forward despite her concerns.)

1129
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:25,401
(She keeps up with her pace while taking sips of water along the way.)

1130
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:29,231
(After climbing nonstop for a while, )

1131
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:35,211
(she finally arrives at the summit of Keunsaseumi Oreum.)

1132
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:40,641
(At last, the endpoint comes into sight.)

1133
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,851
(But there's no time to admire the view.)

1134
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,380
Is this the way down?

1135
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:49,181
(The downhill begins right after the summit.)

1136
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:51,490
It would be serious if I slipped here.

1137
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:52,931
(The only thing left for her now...)

1138
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,661
(is the endless downhill stairs stretch out ahead.)

1139
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:01,301
I'm so grateful for these stairs.

1140
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:05,041
(For Uie, who is afraid of downhill, the stairs are a blessing.)

1141
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:06,640
You've got 1.4km left.

1142
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:08,441
Did you say 1.4km? Nice.

1143
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,971
I really am almost there.

1144
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:11,710
(Once these stairs end, the trail is over.)

1145
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:13,081
I'm almost done.

1146
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,151
Gosh, I kind of feel nauseous.

1147
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:18,851
The ground feels unsteady.

1148
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:21,851
Yu Jin, it'd be serious if you slipped here.

1149
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:23,251
Stay focused until the end.

1150
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,861
I might cry when I get there.

1151
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,690
(She's still terrified of downhill stretches.)

1152
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:28,990
Please.

1153
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:31,261
I'm almost there. I can't slip now.

1154
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:35,171
What?

1155
00:44:35,301 --> 00:44:36,981
I see something that resembles a flatland.

1156
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:39,400
Please be a flatland.

1157
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:41,971
(People running over the flatland are visible from here.)

1158
00:44:42,771 --> 00:44:44,070
(Uie's breathing grew heavy with the joy of reaching the flatland.)

1159
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,081
It's a flatland.

1160
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:46,641
It's a flatland!

1161
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:49,810
It's a flatland!

1162
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:50,820
(Uie)

1163
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,151
I love flatlands.

1164
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm almost there, right?

1165
00:44:54,321 --> 00:44:55,520
(Yes! You're almost there!)

1166
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:57,351
(Screaming in joy)

1167
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:59,290
It's straight ahead.

1168
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,521
- Okay! - You got this!

1169
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:02,890
It's straight ahead!

1170
00:45:02,891 --> 00:45:04,631
(Her voice is an octave higher.)

1171
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:05,761
We got this!

1172
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:07,500
- Kim Uie, you got this! - We're almost there!

1173
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,230
(The flatland gave her a boost of energy.)

1174
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:10,271
We got this!

1175
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:12,641
We got this!

1176
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:14,440
We're almost there!

1177
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:16,241
(The finish line is visible in the distance.)

1178
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,381
Is that Uie? Anyone can tell that's Uie.

1179
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:22,751
(In Ah has been waiting for them after finishing her training.)

1180
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,681
Even from a distance, it's clearly Uie. She's so pretty.

1181
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,450
(She ran across the picturesque scenery, )

1182
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:32,421
(and now the finish line is right in front of her.)

1183
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:38,861
(Running at full speed until the end)

1184
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,600
Kim Uie!

1185
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:42,971
(Uie completed the trail run.)

1186
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:49,871
(Uie's trail running record: 1 hour 59 minutes 5 seconds)

1187
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:54,410
- You did great! - I'm a mess.

1188
00:45:54,411 --> 00:45:56,080
- You're amazing. - Look at this.

1189
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:57,641
- That itself is amazing. - Look at me.

1190
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:00,481
I practically swam at one point.

1191
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:02,090
- I'll take your poles for you. - It was a whole mess.

1192
00:46:02,091 --> 00:46:03,691
- Good job! - Good job.

1193
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:06,790
That was something else.

1194
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,267
(Now that it's over, she feels free to tell them about her struggles.)

1195
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,890
Did you struggle a lot? Was it challenging?

1196
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,701
- Many times. - It was challenging?

1197
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:13,831
The downhill stretch was so scary.

1198
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:16,171
I was going down like this.

1199
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:18,271
There was a congested section too.

1200
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,270
How are the others doing?

1201
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:21,440
They should be doing well.

1202
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:23,281
(They're starting to wonder about the others.)

1203
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,780
My shoulders hurt.

1204
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:28,351
(Ju Hyun reaches the 8km point.)

1205
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:29,950
(Taking a look at her watch)

1206
00:46:29,951 --> 00:46:32,051
It took me 30 minutes to climb 1km.

1207
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:34,991
Is that right?

1208
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:36,451
That doesn't make sense.

1209
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:39,990
I wouldn't be cut off, would I?

1210
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:41,607
(With a 2.5-hour time limit, anxiety about the cutoff creeps in.)

1211
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:44,630
(After climbing up the never-ending uphill stretch, )

1212
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:46,230
(Gosh)

1213
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,931
Finally, it's a flatland.

1214
00:46:48,371 --> 00:46:52,171
(Ju Hyun finally arrives at the summit after the long uphill.)

1215
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:54,141
Is it downhill now?

1216
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:55,841
It's downhill.

1217
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:57,657
(It's followed by a downhill stretch, Ju Hyun's specialty.)

1218
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,181
Gosh. It's downhill.

1219
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:01,881
(I’m a downhill expert.)

1220
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,151
Focus.

1221
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:05,151
Focus.

1222
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:09,221
Gosh, this is so pretty.

1223
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,590
Unbelievable.

1224
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:14,761
(She takes in the final view as she nears the end of the race.)

1225
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:17,330
My calves are burning.

1226
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:19,000
(Despite her burning calves)

1227
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:20,860
- Passing through. - Go ahead.

1228
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:23,231
(While making her way past people one by one, )

1229
00:47:23,871 --> 00:47:25,140
Passing through.

1230
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,371
(Ju Hyun dashes fast like a flying squirrel.)

1231
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,811
Help me.

1232
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:30,611
I can't feel my legs.

1233
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:32,710
It's a flatland.

1234
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:34,081
(Arriving at the flatland safely)

1235
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:35,980
(She's almost there now!)

1236
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,281
It's a flatland.

1237
00:47:39,151 --> 00:47:42,191
(While controlling her breathing carefully, )

1238
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,321
(Ju Hyun maintains her pace until the end.)

1239
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:49,261
She's coming. It's her!

1240
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:51,401
- You're right. It's her. - It's her.

1241
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:53,100
- There's Ju Hyun. - Right. It's Ju Hyun.

1242
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:54,430
That's how she runs.

1243
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:56,031
(She is our Ju Hyun even at a distance.)

1244
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:57,941
- Park Ju Hyun! - Park Ju Hyun!

1245
00:47:58,071 --> 00:47:59,641
Park Ju Hyun!

1246
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:01,671
- Park Ju Hyun! - Park Ju Hyun!

1247
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,971
Gosh. She's doing a great job running.

1248
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:05,880
Gosh. She's good.

1249
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,880
(Ju Hyun finishes strong towards the finish line.)

1250
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,351
Park Ju Hyun!

1251
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,851
- Go, Ju Hyun! - Park Ju Hyun!

1252
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,680
Ju Hyun!

1253
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:15,697
(Giving her last spurt after hearing the members' cheer)

1254
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:18,021
- Ju Hyun! - Ju Hyun!

1255
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:21,191
(Ju Hyun completes the trail race.)

1256
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:24,900
(Ju Hyun's trail running record: 2 hours 14 minutes 27 seconds)

1257
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:25,901
Good job.

1258
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:28,770
- Ju Hyun, come here. - This way.

1259
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:30,000
(She successfully completes it in 2 hours and 30 minutes, )

1260
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,041
(which was her goal.)

1261
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:32,870
- You look like a warrior. - Good job.

1262
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,410
(Hugging the members she finally met)

1263
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,871
I'll get you water.

1264
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:37,981
- Is there watermelon? - No.

1265
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,680
The watermelon was so good.

1266
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:41,121
- Did you eat the watermelon? - Yes.

1267
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:44,010
Was it hard to go up or go down?

1268
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:45,050
- Going up? - Going up?

1269
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,320
Ju Hyun hates going up.

1270
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:47,480
- The stairs... - It doesn't end.

1271
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:48,490
Was it hard to climb up the stairs?

1272
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,821
- The oreum section. - Good job.

1273
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:52,160
What? Why?

1274
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:53,290
(At that moment...)

1275
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,431
Is that Sae Rok?

1276
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,260
- That's Sae Rok! - Really? Where?

1277
00:48:56,261 --> 00:48:58,130
(Is Sae Rok here already?)

1278
00:48:58,131 --> 00:48:59,660
- Really? - What's with them?

1279
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:01,075
- That was so fast. - I got goosebumps.

1280
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:03,129
- The oreum section. - Good job.

1281
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:04,738
What? Why?

1282
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:05,798
(At that moment...)

1283
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:06,999
Is that Sae Rok?

1284
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:08,838
- That's Sae Rok! - Really? Where?

1285
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:10,768
(Is Sae Rok here already?)

1286
00:49:10,769 --> 00:49:12,678
- Really? - What's with them?

1287
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:14,239
- That was so fast. - I got goosebumps.

1288
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,048
She did it within 2 hours.

1289
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:18,249
(Is Sae Rok coming close to the finish line?)

1290
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:20,448
I can't go there.

1291
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:22,988
That's the last uphill. Let's do it.

1292
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:24,118
(A while ago, Sae Rok faced the tough uphill.)

1293
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:25,519
How do I climb up there?

1294
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:26,959
Try it.

1295
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:28,529
Relax your legs.

1296
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:30,589
Shake your legs. Yes.

1297
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,798
You're showing incredible determination in the final stretch.

1298
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:34,805
(Sae Rok showed incredible determination in the final stretch.)

1299
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:35,929
You're doing great.

1300
00:49:36,169 --> 00:49:37,369
We're almost there.

1301
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,039
Goodness.

1302
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:41,408
- Goodness. - Why do you keep groaning?

1303
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:43,938
Goodness.

1304
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,908
That groan automatically comes out when it's tough.

1305
00:49:45,909 --> 00:49:47,809
- Goodness. - We're almost there.

1306
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:49,808
Goodness.

1307
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:51,008
- We're almost there. - We're almost there.

1308
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,379
- Goodness. We're almost finished. - We're here.

1309
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:55,149
We've done it.

1310
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,588
We're almost there.

1311
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:58,495
(She passes the second oreum without a problem.)

1312
00:49:58,519 --> 00:49:59,719
It's Sae Rok.

1313
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,529
Really?

1314
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:03,229
You're almost there.

1315
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,899
(Rocky Keum never gives up.)

1316
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:08,099
Keum Sae Rok!

1317
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:10,168
- We're almost there. - Keum Sae Rok!

1318
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:11,299
You're almost there!

1319
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:13,298
- Keum Sae Rok. - Let's go.

1320
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:14,669
- Run! - Until the end.

1321
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:16,669
- Sae Rok, last spurt! - Let's go.

1322
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:18,108
Give your last spurt!

1323
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:20,409
(She pushes for the final spurt.)

1324
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:23,248
(Sae Rok completes the trail race.)

1325
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:24,348
Good job.

1326
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:26,619
(Sae Rok completes the trail race.)

1327
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:30,388
(Sae Rok's trail running record: 2 hours 17minutes 5 seconds)

1328
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:31,489
Good job.

1329
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,119
(She plops down right away.)

1330
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:36,029
- Are you all right? - Yes.

1331
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,659
Gosh. You're amazing, Sae Rok.

1332
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:40,258
You're amazing, Sae Rok. Seriously.

1333
00:50:40,259 --> 00:50:42,099
It was less than two and a half hours.

1334
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:45,238
- Gosh. That was amazing. - Good job.

1335
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:46,838
- She did it with clenched teeth. - She did a really good job.

1336
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:49,168
Good job, Rocky. You are amazing.

1337
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:50,268
You came in fast.

1338
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:51,339
Gosh.

1339
00:50:51,909 --> 00:50:53,778
- Gosh. - Her hand is shaking.

1340
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:54,908
(Her hand shakes from exhaustion.)

1341
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:55,909
Sae Rok.

1342
00:50:56,379 --> 00:50:57,708
Between boxing and this, which is harder?

1343
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:59,648
- This. - Are you crying?

1344
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:01,688
She ran through the trail for 2 hours and 20 minutes.

1345
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:03,348
- Boxing is a piece of cake now. - Right?

1346
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:05,358
- You won't get exhausted. - Yes. You can do it, right?

1347
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,089
- She did an amazing job. - Are you crying?

1348
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:09,358
You're crying. Why is she crying?

1349
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,929
- Really? - She's crying.

1350
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:13,599
Sae Rok is crying. Don't cry.

1351
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,768
But in the middle,

1352
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,068
she almost gave up...

1353
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:19,268
- as her body was giving out. - She had a hard time.

1354
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:20,298
- Was her body giving out? - Yes.

1355
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:23,469
(Actually, Sae Rok struggled after passing the mid-point.)

1356
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,308
I can't do anything.

1357
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:28,679
(She wanted to give up because it was so tough.)

1358
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,878
(Until the last moment, )

1359
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:33,319
She's running suddenly.

1360
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,488
Gosh. She stopped running, but now she's running again.

1361
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:36,729
(she didn't give up because...)

1362
00:51:37,419 --> 00:51:38,589
I wanted to give it a try.

1363
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:42,428
A battle against myself.

1364
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:44,309
(she wanted to try the battle against herself.)

1365
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:46,628
(Sae Rok won the battle against herself.)

1366
00:51:46,629 --> 00:51:48,328
- You're amazing. - Right now,

1367
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,629
- Sae Rok's legs are shaky. - Right.

1368
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:52,169
I'm so tired.

1369
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:53,968
You pushed through with your mental strength.

1370
00:51:53,969 --> 00:51:55,409
Good job. You really did well.

1371
00:51:55,509 --> 00:51:56,538
- You can cry. - Her legs are shaky.

1372
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:57,978
You can cry, saying you're proud of yourself.

1373
00:51:57,979 --> 00:51:59,379
You're truly amazing.

1374
00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:01,848
- She's shaking badly. - You did a good job.

1375
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:03,278
- What? - You were amazing.

1376
00:52:03,279 --> 00:52:04,508
- Are you crying? - It was so tough.

1377
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:05,719
- No. - Sae Rok was...

1378
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:08,218
Sae Rok is amazing. She finished the race,

1379
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:09,918
everyone.

1380
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,589
- Geum Sae Rok finished the race. - I finished the race.

1381
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:15,558
(They proudly visit the booth for the finished runners.)

1382
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:16,828
(Souvenirs for completing the race)

1383
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,829
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1384
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,859
It's so cute.

1385
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:24,568
(Great work!)

1386
00:52:24,569 --> 00:52:26,068
- I'm really glad... - Yes.

1387
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:27,298
That I got to finish the race.

1388
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:31,038
(The Iron Girls completed the 10km trail race.)

1389
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:32,608
- I'm starving. - I know.

1390
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:33,679
Let's go.

1391
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:35,009
(Amazed)

1392
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:36,949
That looks so good. Gosh.

1393
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,578
- Gosh. - Gosh. What is this?

1394
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,148
- Are those pork noodles? - Oh, dear.

1395
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:43,088
(Pork noodles and boiled pork)

1396
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:45,619
- Was this prepared by the event? - That looks so good.

1397
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:48,388
This is a tradition of the Jeju trail race.

1398
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:50,189
They provide the pork noodles after the race.

1399
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:52,199
- Gosh. They look so good. - Gosh.

1400
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:54,499
- They look so tasty. - Gosh. Help yourselves.

1401
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,668
I get to eat thanks to Captain and the members.

1402
00:52:56,669 --> 00:52:58,098
- Thanks for the food. - Enjoy.

1403
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,198
- Thank you all. - Eat lots.

1404
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:00,298
- I get to eat because of you. - Thank you for the food.

1405
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:02,409
These are Finisher's Noodles. Let's enjoy.

1406
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:04,108
It's precious.

1407
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:05,478
(The Finisher's Noodles are more meaningful...)

1408
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,039
(because they have completed the race.)

1409
00:53:07,939 --> 00:53:09,249
It's so good.

1410
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,348
I like the name too.

1411
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,418
"Finisher's Noodles."

1412
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:14,095
(Uie takes a bite of the Finisher's Noodles too.)

1413
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:15,289
(Satisfied)

1414
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:17,318
(This is true happiness.)

1415
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,489
It's tasty.

1416
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,358
(Eating the boiled pork)

1417
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,659
It's good, isn't it?

1418
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:24,698
(The meal is twice as tasty after finishing a tough race.)

1419
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:25,929
Gosh. It's tasty.

1420
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:29,929
(In Ah takes a bite happily after her special training.)

1421
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:31,798
(Captain who went through everything with them slurps too.)

1422
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:33,139
Gosh. It's so good.

1423
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,598
It tastes really good.

1424
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:36,519
The meat is so much more tender than I expected.

1425
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:39,138
By the way, look at the view.

1426
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:40,279
The meat tastes even better.

1427
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:43,708
(The view makes the Finisher's Noodles even tastier.)

1428
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:46,018
I have breaking news from the organizer of the race.

1429
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:47,378
- The organizer? - Yes. We have...

1430
00:53:47,379 --> 00:53:49,448
- the official records of the race. - That's incredible.

1431
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,488
- We have the ranking now. - What rank did you get?

1432
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:51,718
My goodness.

1433
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:52,858
- First, - Okay.

1434
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,118
- Sae Rok. - Yes.

1435
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:56,128
- Of the 286 female runners, - What?

1436
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:57,828
- what place do you think you got? - Me?

1437
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:59,629
Around 200th place?

1438
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:01,128
Of the 286 female runners,

1439
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:02,198
you were in 121st place.

1440
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:03,628
(She ranked 121st out of 286 female runners.)

1441
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:04,738
I told you.

1442
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:06,468
I told you that you were in the upper middle range.

1443
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:08,609
- Was she in the first half? - Hey.

1444
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:09,768
- I told you that you were... - How did you do that?

1445
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:11,008
- in the upper middle range. - You're in the upper middle range.

1446
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:12,178
- Really? - How did you do that?

1447
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,878
- She did very well. - Does it make sense?

1448
00:54:13,879 --> 00:54:16,108
- You're amazing, Sae Rok. - Amazing.

1449
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:17,325
- Wait. In that case, - Captain.

1450
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,749
I could do it all thanks to Captain.

1451
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:21,318
My knees hurt so bad.

1452
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:22,788
They hurt more when you walk like that.

1453
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:23,848
What do I do, then?

1454
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:25,788
Walk sideways, instead.

1455
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,965
(He taught her how to walk so it wouldn't hurt her knees.)

1456
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:29,158
We're almost there.

1457
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:30,765
(Captain took care of Sae Rok throughout the race.)

1458
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,859
- Thank you, Captain. - No.

1459
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:34,799
- He's the best. - She did a great job.

1460
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:37,568
- That means Ju Hyun is... - Amazing.

1461
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,398
Out of the 286 female runners, Park Ju Hyun came...

1462
00:54:40,399 --> 00:54:41,608
(Out of the 286 female runners, )

1463
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:42,668
in 110th place.

1464
00:54:42,669 --> 00:54:44,308
(she came in 110th place.)

1465
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:45,608
You came in around 100th place.

1466
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:48,008
- Hey. You did such a great job. - Wait. This is...

1467
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:49,049
Seriously.

1468
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:50,848
- Gosh. We're good. - Seriously.

1469
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:52,418
- You did a fabulous job, Ju Hyun. - That is a great record.

1470
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:54,278
You have the strength of the Iron Girl.

1471
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:55,448
- Yes. - That's right.

1472
00:54:55,449 --> 00:54:56,648
Now,

1473
00:54:56,649 --> 00:54:57,718
- Uie. - Uie!

1474
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,159
- Uie was... - I can't wait.

1475
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:02,758
Out of the same 286 runners,

1476
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:03,999
(What place did Uie end up in?)

1477
00:55:04,289 --> 00:55:05,428
she came in 69th place.

1478
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,058
- Gosh. What's with her? - The 69th place means...

1479
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:09,798
you were in the top tier.

1480
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:10,998
(Uie, the Stamina Queen, is an ace without a doubt.)

1481
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:12,498
- How far up is she in? - I...

1482
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:14,168
was never in the top 100 when it came to studying.

1483
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:15,238
Uie.

1484
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:16,538
- But I did it while playing sports. - You're so cool.

1485
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:17,568
By the way,

1486
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:19,908
it was a difficult race because of the rain.

1487
00:55:19,909 --> 00:55:21,749
- You're right. - The path was muddy.

1488
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:23,749
The ground sank out of the blue.

1489
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:28,418
(The trail race's course was tough due to the downpour.)

1490
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:30,149
What is this, a bathhouse?

1491
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:32,649
Gosh, it's like an ocean over here.

1492
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,928
Didn't your feet feel so heavy after that?

1493
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:37,689
After your shoes touched the water.

1494
00:55:37,729 --> 00:55:39,028
This is a mountain.

1495
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:41,128
And there were many experienced runners.

1496
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,329
They gave me tips, which I appreciated so much.

1497
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:45,538
- I see. While they were running? - "Grab the tree."

1498
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:46,539
"Sit."

1499
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,068
"Watch for the pit."

1500
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:49,069
They would say, "Look out ahead."

1501
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,338
And the rest would say, "Okay!"

1502
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:51,479
That was how it went.

1503
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:52,539
(That's right.)

1504
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,078
It felt like a festival in a way.

1505
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,278
Being safe is important in this race.

1506
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,418
They shared tips...

1507
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:01,848
- and the information they had. - That's right.

1508
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:02,949
I really loved that part.

1509
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:05,019
Also, we got reenergized through this section.

1510
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,358
- It was a downhill. And the view... - Gosh.

1511
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,288
- I know where that is. - It was the downhill section.

1512
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:10,289
- Did you see? - Yes.

1513
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:11,658
It was exhausting.

1514
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,698
It was muddy and dark.

1515
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:15,768
When we came out of the downhill, an open space suddenly appeared.

1516
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:17,268
(An incredible view unfolded as a reward for the tough course.)

1517
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:19,599
- Did you see the horses? - Yes.

1518
00:56:19,899 --> 00:56:22,369
The horses were eating grass.

1519
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:23,439
They were so close.

1520
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,439
As much as it was hard to go uphill,

1521
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:28,509
we were compensated, so I was happy.

1522
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:31,408
I love the feeling of the fresh breeze.

1523
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:34,018
- It was so refreshing. - Yes. It was so much fun.

1524
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,148
It was pretty fun.

1525
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:38,518
This competition meant a lot...

1526
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:42,158
because there were three iron guard rails in the center.

1527
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,989
- Yes. - We had to pass them.

1528
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:45,598
- It felt like entering a ring. - It felt like a ring.

1529
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,899
- That's what I said. - So...

1530
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,598
(Uie)

1531
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:51,268
(This is like entering a ring.)

1532
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:52,568
(Imagine this is a ring.)

1533
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:54,869
(This is like a real ring. It's perfect.)

1534
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:57,108
(I've passed many of these.)

1535
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:58,278
- It was like entering a ring. - Yes.

1536
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:00,609
I was like, "This is Round Two."

1537
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:02,778
Did it feel like entering a ring?

1538
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:04,378
Of course.

1539
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:08,418
It rained so much last night.

1540
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:11,188
It rained until this morning, so I wondered if we could do it.

1541
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:12,718
I'm happy that we completed it safely.

1542
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,558
Let's take a rest and move on to the next training.

1543
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:16,858
- Well done. - Thank you.

1544
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:17,929
Good job.

1545
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,758
- Good job. - Well done.

1546
00:57:19,759 --> 00:57:21,829
Goodbye, trail running.

1547
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:25,799
(Next day)

1548
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:28,309
Let's hop off.

1549
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:29,709
Let's go.

1550
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:32,179
What's going on? Where are we?

1551
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,009
This is Seogwipo-si sports association's stadium.

1552
00:57:37,379 --> 00:57:39,879
(Jeju World Cup Stadium)

1553
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:42,449
- Is there a boxing ring? - Is there a boxing ring here?

1554
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:44,148
- Let's go in. - Shall we?

1555
00:57:44,149 --> 00:57:45,388
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1556
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:47,789
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1557
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,558
Gosh. It's all blue.

1558
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,729
It's like a set.

1559
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:57,228
This is the boxing ring for boxers in Seogwipo-si.

1560
00:57:57,229 --> 00:57:58,715
(Seogwipo-si corporate team boxers' training area)

1561
00:57:58,739 --> 00:58:00,569
What are we doing here?

1562
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:02,709
Last time,

1563
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,808
you sparred with a male boxer in middle school.

1564
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:05,809
- Yes. - Yes.

1565
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,948
Today, you'll be going against a female adult.

1566
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:10,478
- Doing what? - Sparring.

1567
00:58:10,479 --> 00:58:12,018
- A supervised sparring? - But we got hit badly...

1568
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:13,478
even by a middle schooler.

1569
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:15,919
- We'll get hit so much. - Are we getting beaten by an adult?

1570
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,419
You'll be sparring with...

1571
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:20,789
a national athlete who trains here.

1572
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,388
(A national athlete?)

1573
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:23,488
"A national athlete?"

1574
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:24,858
This is getting serious.

1575
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:26,359
- "A national athlete?" - Yes.

1576
00:58:26,929 --> 00:58:27,929
(Screaming)

1577
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:29,669
(Gasping)

1578
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:31,738
- Who are you? - Hello.

1579
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:33,379
(Who is the one who surprised the girls?)

1580
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:36,038
(They're glad to meet the guest.)

1581
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,109
Hello.

1582
00:58:37,469 --> 00:58:39,278
- Hello. - Hello.

1583
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:40,608
(Today's sparring opponent)

1584
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:42,449
- Hello. - On the first episode...

1585
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:46,649
(In the demonstration match about a month ago, )

1586
00:58:48,249 --> 00:58:52,619
(she put on a wonderful game with Lim Ae Ji.)

1587
00:58:53,189 --> 00:58:56,829
(The female national boxer for the 2024 Paris Summer Games)

1588
00:58:57,489 --> 00:59:01,699
(Jung Ju Hyeong of Seogwipo-si)

1589
00:59:01,899 --> 00:59:03,798
- Are you from Jeju Island? - She's so cool.

1590
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:05,698
This is my home ground.

1591
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:06,839
That's so cool.

1592
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:08,339
Coach.

1593
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:10,609
You should be here to train us.

1594
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:14,008
How can we spar with you?

1595
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,379
We've seen you play.

1596
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:20,649
So it'll be a supervised sparring.

1597
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:23,118
We did a supervised sparring with Sung Min,

1598
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,949
and we got hit pretty badly.

1599
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:29,128
(They got hit...)

1600
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:31,358
(again...)

1601
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,699
(and again.)

1602
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:36,069
(The intense memories of their first sparring)

1603
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:38,069
What are we going to do?

1604
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:40,068
You first began...

1605
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:41,868
with recreational sports.

1606
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,869
- Yes. - You were the ace...

1607
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,155
of recreational sports, and you became a national athlete.

1608
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:47,679
In the first community sports competition, you won with a KO.

1609
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:50,109
Yes, it was a TKO.

1610
00:59:50,479 --> 00:59:52,319
No game lasted until the end.

1611
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:54,578
No game lasted until the end.

1612
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:55,688
(Amazed)

1613
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,148
Coach. I have a question.

1614
00:59:58,149 --> 00:59:59,618
During our first sparring,

1615
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:02,388
we went, "Jab, jab, one, two."

1616
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,228
And while taking steps,

1617
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,858
I ran away even before I knew it.

1618
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:08,629
I ended up running away.

1619
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:10,999
- I... - Do you know a roe deer?

1620
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:13,269
(I've never heard of that before.)

1621
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,539
(Her feet move endlessly in the ring)

1622
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:19,679
(But something feels off.)

1623
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:21,709
(Hop)

1624
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:25,079
(That's how the roe deer footwork was born.)

1625
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:27,159
- I didn't know. - She keeps jumping like that.

1626
01:00:27,279 --> 01:00:29,088
- It's like she's in a concert. - I'm the only one who does this.

1627
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:30,588
- It's like I'm at a PSY concert. - Jump.

1628
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,618
It's like dancing to "Gangnam Style."

1629
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:36,128
Because I wanted to use what I learned,

1630
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:38,088
I kept jumping.

1631
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:41,098
I can tell that you're nervous.

1632
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,428
You should be able to use what you learned in the ring.

1633
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:46,238
You're nervous at first.

1634
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:47,638
So listen to your coach.

1635
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:49,138
And try that first. That's very important.

1636
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:50,439
Listen to the coach.

1637
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,209
- Yes. What's important is... - Okay.

1638
01:00:52,279 --> 01:00:55,279
Jung Ju Hyeong is a southpaw.

1639
01:00:55,749 --> 01:00:57,108
- Aren't there any southpaws here? - No.

1640
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:58,848
- "Southpaw?" - What's that?

1641
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:00,079
We're from South Korea.

1642
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:02,789
(Chuckling)

1643
01:01:03,689 --> 01:01:06,118
- "Southpaw?" - Yes. She's left-handed.

1644
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,418
- We... - We're flustered.

1645
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:08,928
Never played against a left-handed player before, right?

1646
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:10,059
- Right? - Never.

1647
01:01:10,929 --> 01:01:12,198
It's only the beginning, but I'm already nervous.

1648
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,999
(Sparring with a southpaw, how will they do?)

1649
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:16,799
(Before the sparring, )

1650
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:20,899
(Ju Hyeong is warming up fiercely.)

1651
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,009
While doing this...

1652
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:24,969
There's something you need to remember.

1653
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:28,108
- It's push, slide, hit, and hook. - Push...

1654
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:30,178
- Push, slide, hit, and hook. - Push, slide, hit, and hook.

1655
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:31,208
- Hook. - One more time?

1656
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:32,248
Slide.

1657
01:01:32,249 --> 01:01:34,549
(After avoiding a left straight...)

1658
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:36,588
And you hit, right?

1659
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:38,558
- But she avoided it. - But you got near.

1660
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,789
Yes. If you come close, she'll punch you.

1661
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:42,765
You're definitely going to fall for that.

1662
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:44,058
- Push, slide, hit, and hook. - Right.

1663
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:46,458
Against a left-handed player, it's all about reading the room.

1664
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:48,499
It's all about reading the room.

1665
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:50,868
(Learning how to play against a southpaw)

1666
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:51,899
Yes.

1667
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:55,769
(Focusing)

1668
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:57,169
I want to go home.

1669
01:01:57,569 --> 01:01:59,209
What do I do? I'm so nervous.

1670
01:01:59,739 --> 01:02:02,909
(Today's sparring lineup)

1671
01:02:03,009 --> 01:02:05,918
It'll be 2 rounds of a minute and 30 seconds.

1672
01:02:05,919 --> 01:02:07,819
And you get 40 seconds of break.

1673
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:10,818
(The first supervised sparring opponent)

1674
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:12,759
(A middle schooler)

1675
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:15,188
(The supervising level...)

1676
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,359
(went up.)

1677
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:20,928
(The second supervised sparring opponent)

1678
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:23,529
(A female adult national athlete)

1679
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,769
(The punch has leveled up as well.)

1680
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:30,108
(Will they be able to show improvement...)

1681
01:02:30,109 --> 01:02:31,669
(compared to their first sparring?)

1682
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:34,239
Are you ready to put on the gloves?

1683
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,779
I'm getting even more nervous.

1684
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:38,579
(Iron Girls' second sparring)

1685
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:41,318
Be calm.

1686
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:43,589
(The opponent is an active national athlete.)

1687
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:47,589
(The first player is Ju Hyun.)

1688
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:49,459
The second head gear in my life.

1689
01:02:51,459 --> 01:02:52,759
Just as I learned.

1690
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:54,959
Take a deep breath.

1691
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,399
(Also getting nervous)

1692
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,498
(The most nervous moment)

1693
01:03:01,499 --> 01:03:02,568
Go, Ju Hyun.

1694
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:05,008
Try what you've practiced, okay?

1695
01:03:05,009 --> 01:03:06,039
Ju Hyun.

1696
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:07,809
Go, Ju Hyun.

1697
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,249
Before entering the ring,

1698
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:11,919
I should come up with a signature move.

1699
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:18,818
(That's how she chose her signature appearance.)

1700
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:21,018
Okay. This is what I'm going to do from now on.

1701
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:22,258
(The entrance is all about confidence.)

1702
01:03:22,259 --> 01:03:24,158
One, two. Yes. You got it.

1703
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,958
Yes. One, two. Okay.

1704
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:27,158
Push, slide, hit, hook.

1705
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,529
Yes. You got it.

1706
01:03:30,629 --> 01:03:32,839
All right. Players, come forward.

1707
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:35,099
- All right. - Go, Ju Hyun.

1708
01:03:35,169 --> 01:03:37,138
No low blow. Play with manners.

1709
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:39,209
Touch gloves. Okay.

1710
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,409
At your corners. Ready.

1711
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,348
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1712
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:46,855
- Are you ready? Good luck. - Good luck.

1713
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:48,548
Round One. Go.

1714
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:50,249
(Round 1 begins.)

1715
01:03:54,219 --> 01:03:57,989
(Ju Hyun attacks first.)

1716
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:03,599
(However, she faces the opponent's punch right away.)

1717
01:04:04,129 --> 01:04:05,298
Yes. Be calm.

1718
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,269
(Guarding immediately)

1719
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,609
It's picky because she's left-handed.

1720
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:13,979
(A left-handed boxer is rare.)

1721
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:18,408
(Because their front feet touch, )

1722
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:20,479
(it's not easy to calculate the distance.)

1723
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,318
- Hook. - Yes. Keep watching.

1724
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,218
(It's not easy to predict the opponent's punch.)

1725
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:29,289
She's coming.

1726
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:33,099
(Too difficult for a boxer who learned only for a month)

1727
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,429
She's taking the lead big time.

1728
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,829
(Startled)

1729
01:04:37,129 --> 01:04:39,839
(Due to her long reach, )

1730
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,169
(every time she swings, )

1731
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:44,509
(it's a valid strike.)

1732
01:04:44,909 --> 01:04:46,909
(Flustered)

1733
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:49,749
(I must brace myself.)

1734
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:52,179
Yes.

1735
01:04:53,949 --> 01:04:55,669
(Ju Hyeong's jab is immediately countered.)

1736
01:04:56,549 --> 01:04:57,549
(Body jab)

1737
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,218
Yes. Good. You're nice and calm, Ju Hyun.

1738
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:02,889
(Guarding again without getting flustered)

1739
01:05:03,629 --> 01:05:05,829
(Swinging)

1740
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:08,968
(Ju Hyeong calculates the distance with her lead hand.)

1741
01:05:08,969 --> 01:05:11,199
Calculate with your lead hand too.

1742
01:05:12,769 --> 01:05:14,899
- Yes. Good job. - Ju Hyun.

1743
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:16,868
(Dodging)

1744
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,639
(Hitting)

1745
01:05:19,979 --> 01:05:22,708
(She successfully strikes the opponent.)

1746
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:23,748
(Approving)

1747
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:24,749
Good job.

1748
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:27,379
(Ju Hyun succeeds in sliding and hitting for the first time.)

1749
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:30,389
(However, the opponent is an active player.)

1750
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:32,559
Yes.

1751
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:35,019
(Manipulating the opponent with a fake jab)

1752
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:37,959
(Striking the unguarded abdomen)

1753
01:05:38,429 --> 01:05:41,129
(Startled by the active player's heavy punch)

1754
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:44,199
(Guarding)

1755
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:47,269
(She calmly guards against the swarming attack.)

1756
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:51,509
(Another abdomen attack)

1757
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,079
- Good luck. - It's okay.

1758
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:57,249
(The same feint)

1759
01:05:58,149 --> 01:06:00,848
(Her punch is stronger than in the first sparring.)

1760
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:02,089
When she approaches, hit.

1761
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:03,619
If she approaches, hit her.

1762
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:05,989
(Flinching, punching)

1763
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:07,988
Don't fall for that.

1764
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:09,665
(Ju Hyun is manipulated by Ju Hyeong's feint.)

1765
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:12,359
Yes. You got it. Don't give up.

1766
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:14,129
You got it.

1767
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:19,519
(Ju Hyun continues to burrow in and makes a valid strike.)

1768
01:06:19,799 --> 01:06:21,098
- Already. - Already?

1769
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:22,369
Good. You're almost there.

1770
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:23,609
Ten seconds left.

1771
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:25,008
- She's calm. - Ten seconds left.

1772
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:26,339
Focus until the end.

1773
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:28,708
(Ju Hyun looks for a chance to attack.)

1774
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:30,979
That's right. Stop.

1775
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:32,718
- Ju Hyun, are you okay? - How was it?

1776
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:33,779
Did you get hit?

1777
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:35,788
Breathe. Take a deep breath.

1778
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:37,518
(Ju Hyun got hit in the abdomen repeatedly.)

1779
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:38,549
Again.

1780
01:06:39,419 --> 01:06:41,558
(She takes a deep breath and tries to calm down.)

1781
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:42,629
Take a deep breath.

1782
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:44,658
(The pain comes belatedly.)

1783
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:46,198
Good job. That was great.

1784
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:48,058
- I almost cried. - That was good.

1785
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:49,169
You were calm.

1786
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:53,599
After the high-low combination, you have to throw a hook too.

1787
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,245
(An additional request for Round 2, high-low combination and hook)

1788
01:06:56,269 --> 01:06:58,668
(Park Si Hun, the other team's coach)

1789
01:06:58,669 --> 01:07:00,078
Don't put your weight on.

1790
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,809
- And go for the face. - Okay.

1791
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:03,478
- So... - Play like a real game.

1792
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:04,779
Okay.

1793
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:06,579
I'll get close to her.

1794
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:09,049
She's strong. She's too strong.

1795
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:11,149
Let's go.

1796
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:13,558
(The 40-second break ends in no time.)

1797
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:15,529
- Go, Ju Hyun. - Go, Ju Hyun.

1798
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:17,989
(Jab, jab, one, two)

1799
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:20,828
(Ju Hyeong corners her as soon as they start.)

1800
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:21,999
- Hook. - Yes. Until the end.

1801
01:07:22,369 --> 01:07:24,369
(Going for the low shots)

1802
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:26,338
(Even when she's getting hit, )

1803
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:28,339
(she tries the left hook.)

1804
01:07:28,869 --> 01:07:30,308
(However)

1805
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:31,369
Yes. Good job.

1806
01:07:32,009 --> 01:07:33,138
Yes. Good job.

1807
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,978
(Ju Hyun can't keep her head up due to the swarming attack.)

1808
01:07:34,979 --> 01:07:36,208
(Staggering)

1809
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:37,249
- Hook. - That's right.

1810
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:38,649
Keep watching.

1811
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,049
Watch her.

1812
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:42,078
(Getting faint)

1813
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,218
Oh, coach.

1814
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:44,659
(Moving backward without looking up)

1815
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:47,019
(She throws a punch without giving up.)

1816
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:50,058
(But she keeps dropping her head due to the endless punches.)

1817
01:07:50,059 --> 01:07:51,688
Watch.

1818
01:07:51,689 --> 01:07:52,829
Keep watching. Watch her.

1819
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:55,028
Keep watching. Watch her.

1820
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,598
(The flying punches turn her face completely.)

1821
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:58,769
(Punching with her eyes closed)

1822
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:00,499
Keep watching. Watch her.

1823
01:08:01,299 --> 01:08:02,838
(She takes a deep breath...)

1824
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:04,908
(and dashes, )

1825
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:07,779
(looking at the ground.)

1826
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:10,178
Keep your guard up.

1827
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:11,778
(She keeps her guard up calmly.)

1828
01:08:11,779 --> 01:08:13,349
You're doing well. Keep calm.

1829
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:14,818
Even if you get hit, keep watching her.

1830
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:15,919
It's okay.

1831
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:17,819
- Hook. - Straight. Yes.

1832
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:19,919
(Jab)

1833
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:23,288
(She got a jab right in the face.)

1834
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:24,528
Yes. You're doing great.

1835
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:26,129
What did I tell you? Yes!

1836
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,499
Keep trying until the end.

1837
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:28,559
Yes.

1838
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:30,768
(Dodge)

1839
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:32,298
(Punch)

1840
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:33,299
You got it.

1841
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,569
Keep trying until the end.

1842
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:36,409
Yes. Good job.

1843
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:38,208
That's so cool.

1844
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:39,209
Hook.

1845
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,409
Ju Hyun, let's do it.

1846
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:41,779
- Go for her face. - One, two.

1847
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:44,009
Yes. Nice try.

1848
01:08:44,409 --> 01:08:46,218
- She's coming. - Good job, Park Ju Hyun.

1849
01:08:46,219 --> 01:08:49,589
(Despite the lack of stamina, she looks for her chance to attack.)

1850
01:08:50,049 --> 01:08:55,019
(However, the opponent counterattacks right away.)

1851
01:08:56,289 --> 01:08:58,289
- Stop. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1852
01:08:59,059 --> 01:09:00,959
- Stop. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1853
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:02,529
Good job.

1854
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:04,198
It's okay. That's how you should do it.

1855
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,468
- Until the end. - Good job.

1856
01:09:05,469 --> 01:09:06,698
- Good job. - Good job, Ju Hyun.

1857
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:07,769
- Good job. - Well done.

1858
01:09:07,999 --> 01:09:09,238
She's pretty good...

1859
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:10,879
for someone who only learned for a month.

1860
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:12,108
You were different from last time.

1861
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:14,078
It was more nerve-racking.

1862
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:15,748
It's more painful than sparring with Sung Min.

1863
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:17,385
(The supervised sparring is more intense.)

1864
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:18,878
I almost cried.

1865
01:09:18,879 --> 01:09:20,819
(Ju Hyeong's punch almost made her cry.)

1866
01:09:21,019 --> 01:09:22,119
Anyway,

1867
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:24,018
if I give you feedback,

1868
01:09:24,019 --> 01:09:26,758
it's really hard to apply what you practiced.

1869
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:28,288
Against the big fists...

1870
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,588
and against me,

1871
01:09:29,589 --> 01:09:31,388
- she kept coming forward. - She's good.

1872
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:33,599
She did a good job. I mean it.

1873
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:36,629
It's about your mental strength.

1874
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,538
No matter how good you are outside,

1875
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,339
you should be able to do it in the ring.

1876
01:09:41,769 --> 01:09:44,208
- That was... - You still tried...

1877
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:45,468
what I ordered four times.

1878
01:09:45,469 --> 01:09:46,485
(You attempted my request 4 times.)

1879
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:48,279
Let's give it up for her.

1880
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:51,148
(Coach Ji Hoon's request: Push, slide, hit, hook)

1881
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:53,419
(High-low combination)

1882
01:09:54,619 --> 01:09:58,848
(1st slide and hit)

1883
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:02,629
(2nd slide and hit)

1884
01:10:03,389 --> 01:10:07,458
(1st high-low combination)

1885
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:11,028
(2nd high-low combination)

1886
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:12,338
I give you credit for that.

1887
01:10:12,339 --> 01:10:13,868
(It wasn't perfect, but Ju Hyun still tried.)

1888
01:10:13,869 --> 01:10:15,068
Compared to that,

1889
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:17,208
when you get hit, you have to look.

1890
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:18,408
But you were like this.

1891
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:20,379
(Ju Hyun curled up when she was getting hit.)

1892
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:23,249
That's right.

1893
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:26,978
(Due to the series of punches, )

1894
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:31,318
(Ju Hyun couldn't keep her head up.)

1895
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:32,388
Keep watching.

1896
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:35,119
(Her face was turned because she was scared of the punches.)

1897
01:10:36,129 --> 01:10:39,328
(In the end, she closed her eyes when she attacked.)

1898
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:40,759
You can't attack without watching.

1899
01:10:40,829 --> 01:10:41,998
You have to keep watching.

1900
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:43,399
Even if you get hit,

1901
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:44,729
you have to watch.

1902
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:46,498
That's really hard.

1903
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:47,638
How can you look when you're getting hit?

1904
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:48,939
You have to try.

1905
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:51,268
Only then can you see the opponent's fists.

1906
01:10:51,269 --> 01:10:52,378
You know what?

1907
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:54,578
Once you get struck once,

1908
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:56,278
- It becomes chaotic. - you become...

1909
01:10:56,279 --> 01:10:57,909
- You couldn't do it, right? - scared.

1910
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:00,348
- It was so scary. - Especially in the stomach.

1911
01:11:00,349 --> 01:11:01,748
And it was hard to approach.

1912
01:11:01,749 --> 01:11:03,518
It felt like...

1913
01:11:03,519 --> 01:11:05,589
you were long. I struggled to block you.

1914
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,158
It was probably hard to get closer to me.

1915
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:10,729
Because you're shorter than me.

1916
01:11:10,889 --> 01:11:12,658
And when would you get to meet a left-handed boxer again?

1917
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:13,659
- That's true. - Yes.

1918
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,928
If you try to punch her once,

1919
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:16,545
you should be ready to face three punches.

1920
01:11:16,569 --> 01:11:17,999
So it's my loss.

1921
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:19,938
You can't get close to her unless you get hit?

1922
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:21,419
I couldn't do it without getting hit.

1923
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:23,768
But you looked less nervous...

1924
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:25,038
- than the first sparring, right? - Yes.

1925
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,809
- You were very calm. - You were very calm.

1926
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:28,578
I agree.

1927
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:30,308
Compared to the first one,

1928
01:11:30,309 --> 01:11:32,418
- I remembered a few techniques. - Right.

1929
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:33,818
I couldn't remember anything last time.

1930
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,078
Then it's a success.

1931
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:36,488
Today, you had a successful sparring.

1932
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:37,918
I'm jealous. You did a good job.

1933
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:39,399
(Ju Hyun kept calm and did her best.)

1934
01:11:39,919 --> 01:11:41,758
(Ju Hyun's second sparring session results:)

1935
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:44,358
(She was worked up and kept going forward.)

1936
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:50,228
(She remained calm and looked for her chance.)

1937
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:51,668
- Go in. - It's all or nothing now.

1938
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:52,938
- There isn't much time left. - Go in!

1939
01:11:52,939 --> 01:12:00,378
(She swung her fists in the air without looking at the opponent.)

1940
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:04,948
(She calmly kept her eye on the opponent...)

1941
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:09,389
(and demonstrated the techniques.)

1942
01:12:09,919 --> 01:12:14,218
(Points to improve: She needs to stop looking down...)

1943
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:16,759
(when she gets hit.)

1944
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:18,958
This is crazy.

1945
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:20,499
Why am I getting so nervous?

1946
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:23,299
This is crazy.

1947
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:25,575
- No. I can do it. - It's okay. I'm sure you can do it.

1948
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,868
- I'll be calm. - Just be calm.

1949
01:12:27,869 --> 01:12:29,369
And every time you try, you improve.

1950
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:32,268
With the attitude to try it today.

1951
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,029
- I won't be a roe deer today. - One second.

1952
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:36,609
Yes. The ears.

1953
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:38,308
Okay.

1954
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:40,189
How's your breathing compared to the last time?

1955
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:42,248
(The girls gather around with worries.)

1956
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:43,389
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1957
01:12:43,689 --> 01:12:45,419
Just keep calm, okay?

1958
01:12:46,289 --> 01:12:48,288
As long as you manage to do just one thing well.

1959
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:49,629
Keep calm. Wait.

1960
01:12:50,629 --> 01:12:52,929
(Uie enters.)

1961
01:12:55,599 --> 01:12:56,669
Take a deep breath.

1962
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,699
Good luck.

1963
01:12:58,869 --> 01:12:59,869
Why am I getting nervous?

1964
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,590
- Aren't you nervous? - Focus on your goal.

1965
01:13:01,839 --> 01:13:03,138
Players, come forward.

1966
01:13:03,139 --> 01:13:04,815
(The girls' support helps her brace herself.)

1967
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:05,938
Don't go for low blows.

1968
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:07,379
Play with manners. Okay.

1969
01:13:07,909 --> 01:13:09,008
Round One.

1970
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:12,049
(Round 1 begins.)

1971
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:17,918
(Using her lead hand to block the jab)

1972
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:19,019
(Defending)

1973
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:22,219
(Big straight)

1974
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:27,459
(She gets closer, looking for a chance to attack.)

1975
01:13:28,429 --> 01:13:29,669
(Jung Ju Hyeong's strong punch)

1976
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:31,028
(After the feint)

1977
01:13:31,029 --> 01:13:34,639
(Jab)

1978
01:13:36,039 --> 01:13:39,338
(Guarding without getting flustered)

1979
01:13:39,339 --> 01:13:40,479
The opponent is...

1980
01:13:40,809 --> 01:13:41,839
good at faking.

1981
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:46,218
(Pretending to attack low...)

1982
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:47,749
(and backing up)

1983
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:49,318
(Pretending to attack low...)

1984
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:51,419
(and attacking the face)

1985
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:55,459
(However, Uie defends well with her long arms.)

1986
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:57,558
Yes.

1987
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,259
Keep going. You got it.

1988
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:01,528
Yes. Keep going.

1989
01:14:01,529 --> 01:14:02,599
You got it.

1990
01:14:03,099 --> 01:14:05,598
(Uie's straight)

1991
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:06,768
(However)

1992
01:14:06,769 --> 01:14:08,168
(Punch in the face)

1993
01:14:08,169 --> 01:14:11,038
(The opponent's jab landed in her face.)

1994
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:12,238
What did I tell you to do?

1995
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,878
- Nice, Uie. - Push.

1996
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:15,179
(Push and hook.)

1997
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:18,078
What do you do after pushing her?

1998
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,879
(However, Ju Hyeong continues to attack.)

1999
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:21,779
Yes. Again.

2000
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:24,089
(Ju Hyeong's straight was fast again.)

2001
01:14:25,149 --> 01:14:26,818
(Valid strike, Dodging)

2002
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:27,819
Eyes on her.

2003
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:29,629
Again. Push.

2004
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,089
Hook. Yes, try the hook too.

2005
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:34,059
(Push)

2006
01:14:35,459 --> 01:14:36,699
(Hook?)

2007
01:14:37,299 --> 01:14:39,438
(She tries to make a series of attacks, )

2008
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,169
(but everything is blocked.)

2009
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:44,638
(Ju Hyeong's thorough defense)

2010
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:45,639
Push again.

2011
01:14:45,839 --> 01:14:47,109
Keep watching. Yes.

2012
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:49,648
(Pushing again)

2013
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:52,949
(However, she gets Ju Hyeong's hook in return.)

2014
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:55,948
(She keeps her guard up calmly.)

2015
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,288
Yes. Keep your eyes on her.

2016
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,719
(She keeps her guard up calmly.)

2017
01:15:00,059 --> 01:15:02,458
(Playing a fierce mental game with her lead hand)

2018
01:15:02,459 --> 01:15:03,828
- The parry... - Yes. Good job.

2019
01:15:03,829 --> 01:15:05,428
- Cool. - Good job.

2020
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:06,498
She can defend.

2021
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:08,529
(Confident straight)

2022
01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:13,139
(Straight right in the gap)

2023
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:14,498
(Parry)

2024
01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:16,768
(However, Ju Hyeong blocked it again.)

2025
01:15:16,769 --> 01:15:18,308
Try again. Yes.

2026
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:19,789
(Uie keeps trying without giving up.)

2027
01:15:20,839 --> 01:15:21,878
Too big.

2028
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:23,149
You have to do the footwork.

2029
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:26,519
(Due to the distance, her movement becomes big.)

2030
01:15:27,379 --> 01:15:29,079
Yes. You got it.

2031
01:15:29,219 --> 01:15:30,588
(10 seconds left.)

2032
01:15:30,589 --> 01:15:31,949
Ten seconds. Hit.

2033
01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:33,389
Push.

2034
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,458
Yes.

2035
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:36,428
(Blocking with the lead hand)

2036
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:38,029
(Burrowing in for a strong punch)

2037
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:39,528
Push.

2038
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:40,729
Yes. Push.

2039
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,169
(Swift)

2040
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,299
- Stop. Okay. - Uie.

2041
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:51,439
You took a lot of steps.

2042
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:52,978
Take a deep breath.

2043
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,249
(She catches her breath.)

2044
01:15:57,509 --> 01:15:59,148
- She's very good. - Yes.

2045
01:15:59,149 --> 01:16:00,579
She has a good straight.

2046
01:16:01,419 --> 01:16:02,548
She was born with it.

2047
01:16:02,549 --> 01:16:03,688
They're all very good.

2048
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:04,918
(Even the former gold medalist is surprised.)

2049
01:16:04,919 --> 01:16:06,519
Good. You were good, but...

2050
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:08,118
I want to slide and hit.

2051
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:09,318
You have to slide and hit.

2052
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,028
You pushed a lot.

2053
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:12,798
Push and try slide and hit, okay?

2054
01:16:12,799 --> 01:16:13,999
Push, slide, and hit.

2055
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,759
Try pushing and hitting too, okay?

2056
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:17,329
- Yes. - Okay.

2057
01:16:17,599 --> 01:16:20,199
(Round 2 begins.)

2058
01:16:21,599 --> 01:16:24,539
(Using her long lead hand to block the jab)

2059
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,078
Yes.

2060
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,149
(Jung Ju Hyeong's feint)

2061
01:16:31,849 --> 01:16:32,918
(Stopping)

2062
01:16:32,919 --> 01:16:36,749
(Noticing the feint, Uie steps back.)

2063
01:16:37,249 --> 01:16:39,858
(With her lead hand guarding, )

2064
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:42,888
(she closes in with footwork.)

2065
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:43,958
That's it.

2066
01:16:43,959 --> 01:16:45,829
(A straight punch)

2067
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:47,929
(A simultaneous strike)

2068
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:50,728
That's it. That is exactly why you don't retreat.

2069
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:52,209
(Extending through and scoring a hit)

2070
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,898
(Uie keeps trying to attack.)

2071
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,938
You saw that just now, right?

2072
01:16:56,939 --> 01:16:58,639
Ju Hyeong is not letting Uie take control.

2073
01:16:59,879 --> 01:17:03,209
(Ju Hyeong keeps moving her feet to maintain the distance.)

2074
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:08,179
(She controls the distance, then dodges and punches.)

2075
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:11,648
(Ju Hyeong targeted the opening perfectly.)

2076
01:17:11,649 --> 01:17:13,819
Yes. That was a good hit.

2077
01:17:15,059 --> 01:17:16,159
(Valid strike)

2078
01:17:16,829 --> 01:17:20,759
(She kept throwing punches and landed a solid strike.)

2079
01:17:21,629 --> 01:17:22,929
Keep watching. Yes.

2080
01:17:23,629 --> 01:17:24,998
(A hook came swinging in.)

2081
01:17:24,999 --> 01:17:27,668
- That's it. - You can punch like that?

2082
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:29,939
- What was that just now? - She literally flew.

2083
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:33,008
(Ju Hyeong actually flew for a second.)

2084
01:17:33,009 --> 01:17:34,279
Keep watching. Yes.

2085
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:37,978
(A flashy, unorthodox attack)

2086
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:40,178
Ju Hyeong's going harder in Round Two.

2087
01:17:40,179 --> 01:17:42,319
She's quicker and lands more strikes.

2088
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:45,788
(Faster and fiercer punches)

2089
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:47,288
When she's closer, punch her.

2090
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:50,289
(Remaining time)

2091
01:17:50,529 --> 01:17:52,159
- Pour everything out. - Try it.

2092
01:17:52,689 --> 01:17:54,129
You're staying calm and doing great.

2093
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:56,029
- Go for it. - Hook.

2094
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:58,729
Yes. That's it. It's okay.

2095
01:17:59,639 --> 01:18:02,039
(Ju Hyeong's punches are faster.)

2096
01:18:02,299 --> 01:18:04,369
(But Uie hasn't lost her spirit.)

2097
01:18:07,539 --> 01:18:08,908
Focus. Push.

2098
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:10,048
(Uie blocks the attack with her lead hand...)

2099
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:13,379
(and then launches a strike.)

2100
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,379
Yes. Do that again.

2101
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:16,718
(Approaching)

2102
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,289
(But she gets blocked right away.)

2103
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:22,088
(Uie stays strong and throws another punch.)

2104
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:23,259
Up, down, and hook.

2105
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:26,658
(After Uie's punch attempt, Round 2 comes to an end.)

2106
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:28,699
- Stop. Good work. - Thank you.

2107
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:31,098
- Great job. - You've gotten better.

2108
01:18:31,099 --> 01:18:33,338
- To think you'd change this fast. - She changed right away.

2109
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:34,568
Where did the roe deer go?

2110
01:18:34,569 --> 01:18:35,899
The roe deer is dead.

2111
01:18:35,999 --> 01:18:37,039
For real?

2112
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:42,679
(Her hopping footwork draws sympathy.)

2113
01:18:43,309 --> 01:18:46,419
(But even that would get messed up.)

2114
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:49,379
(She was a roe deer boxer.)

2115
01:18:49,819 --> 01:18:52,319
(Long strides)

2116
01:18:52,689 --> 01:18:55,458
(She has gained confidence in her footwork.)

2117
01:18:55,459 --> 01:18:56,789
What's up with Uie?

2118
01:18:56,889 --> 01:18:59,828
How can someone change in a single day?

2119
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:01,799
Okay. You're done. Good job.

2120
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:03,199
- Really? - Yes.

2121
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:04,699
- Did I do well? - Yes, you did.

2122
01:19:05,729 --> 01:19:06,899
Was I not like a roe deer?

2123
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:09,069
You weren't like one at all.

2124
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:11,938
- Uie. - You're amazing.

2125
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:14,308
But I feel like I got punched in the nose four times.

2126
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:15,809
Here's what shocked me.

2127
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:17,548
She's skinny, right?

2128
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,379
But her lead hand is really strong.

2129
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:22,079
She kept blocking and hitting my hand.

2130
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,118
Doing that...

2131
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:25,649
flusters the opponent.

2132
01:19:25,789 --> 01:19:27,158
And it's a long reach.

2133
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:28,719
Blocking the attacks...

2134
01:19:29,089 --> 01:19:32,128
with her lead hand was great.

2135
01:19:32,129 --> 01:19:33,359
That gave me quite a shock.

2136
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:37,629
(With her long reach and strong lead hand, )

2137
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:41,169
(she blocked off Ju Hyeong's jabs.)

2138
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:45,908
(The lead hand is the best shield.)

2139
01:19:45,909 --> 01:19:48,309
If I may add a word,

2140
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:50,109
the lead hand conquers the world.

2141
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:53,778
- Our coach said the same thing. - You've done it.

2142
01:19:53,779 --> 01:19:56,025
- The lead hand conquers the world. - The lead hand is important.

2143
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:58,849
(Lead hand quote 1:1 jab conquers the world.)

2144
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:02,419
(Lead hand quote 2: The lead hand is the boxer's radar.)

2145
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:04,159
Uie will conquer the world.

2146
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:07,728
- You're so cool, Kim Uie! - Kim Uie!

2147
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:09,599
- Show us what you've got! - Oh, gosh.

2148
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,429
What Uie did really well...

2149
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:14,368
was react with her other hand when the opponent came in.

2150
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:16,249
That was good, even if you didn't land the hit.

2151
01:20:16,669 --> 01:20:18,008
(When the opponent tried to close in, )

2152
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:20,008
(Uie quickly threw a two.)

2153
01:20:20,009 --> 01:20:21,309
(Two)

2154
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:26,349
(Uie kept going and looked for an opening.)

2155
01:20:26,549 --> 01:20:28,179
That was great. But your weaknesses...

2156
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,188
- were your stiff shoulders... - These?

2157
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:32,488
- and your short punches. - Right.

2158
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:34,489
You stopped right after one-two.

2159
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:37,359
I wanted to try it.

2160
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:39,699
I wanted to throw a hook at least once.

2161
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:42,728
But Ju Hyeong was already on the other side,

2162
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:45,868
so it felt like I was swinging in the air.

2163
01:20:45,869 --> 01:20:49,369
You went for everything you wanted in the ring.

2164
01:20:50,109 --> 01:20:51,339
- Right. - You pulled it off.

2165
01:20:51,809 --> 01:20:53,108
- She actually did. - While I was sparring,

2166
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:55,278
the girls kept saying a roe deer was running around.

2167
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:57,378
- You became really calm. - You've improved so much.

2168
01:20:57,379 --> 01:20:58,479
You were super cool.

2169
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:02,318
(Uie's second sparring session results:)

2170
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,718
(She was full of fear about boxing.)

2171
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,859
(But now, even taking hits doesn't break her spirit.)

2172
01:21:11,629 --> 01:21:15,528
(Strengths: She has a long reach and a strong lead hand.)

2173
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:20,299
(Her straight punch is powerful.)

2174
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:24,338
(Points to improve: She needs to work on following up...)

2175
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:27,809
(with multiple punches after a one-two.)

2176
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:30,789
We should've filmed a lot of videos of the roe deer.

2177
01:21:30,879 --> 01:21:33,079
- I might never see it again. - We'll never see it.

2178
01:21:34,549 --> 01:21:36,388
- Remember what we practiced? - Yes.

2179
01:21:36,389 --> 01:21:38,519
- Try to do all of them, okay? - Yes.

2180
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:41,618
This is us testing whether you can use those techniques or not.

2181
01:21:41,619 --> 01:21:42,789
(Promising boxer Rocky Keum)

2182
01:21:42,989 --> 01:21:44,588
- Give it your all. - Got it.

2183
01:21:44,589 --> 01:21:46,229
(The goal is to try as much as possible.)

2184
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:49,999
(The main strategy is the same: Two, dodge, punch, and hook.)

2185
01:21:51,469 --> 01:21:52,469
Keum Sae Rok!

2186
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:54,939
Good luck!

2187
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:56,198
(Sae Rok seems a little nervous.)

2188
01:21:56,199 --> 01:21:57,569
Go to the center.

2189
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:00,438
Okay. Keep your manners. No low blows.

2190
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:02,039
Go to your corners.

2191
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:04,479
- Sae Rok, stay calm. - Stay calm.

2192
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:06,919
(Just do as practiced!)

2193
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:09,019
(Round 1 begins.)

2194
01:22:12,019 --> 01:22:14,259
(Guarding with her lead hand)

2195
01:22:15,419 --> 01:22:17,429
(One, two)

2196
01:22:18,459 --> 01:22:21,629
(Sae Rok throws a confident one-two.)

2197
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:22,859
Gosh.

2198
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:25,469
(She calmly sizes up her opponent.)

2199
01:22:25,869 --> 01:22:28,299
(In that instant, Ju Hyeong lands a strong punch.)

2200
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:29,969
(Valid strike)

2201
01:22:30,369 --> 01:22:31,369
(Valid strike)

2202
01:22:31,709 --> 01:22:33,108
(But Sae Rok immediately counterattacks.)

2203
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:34,479
(Counter after being hit)

2204
01:22:34,939 --> 01:22:36,239
(A face strike)

2205
01:22:36,979 --> 01:22:37,979
Nice.

2206
01:22:38,179 --> 01:22:39,249
That's it.

2207
01:22:39,349 --> 01:22:41,719
(Continuing with a one, one, two.)

2208
01:22:42,219 --> 01:22:45,889
(One, one, two)

2209
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:48,589
(Sae Rok's punch lands perfectly.)

2210
01:22:48,819 --> 01:22:51,229
- Yes. - Nice. Look at her fighting spirit.

2211
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:52,988
- That's wild. - Breathe.

2212
01:22:52,989 --> 01:22:54,699
Yes, good. Watch until the end.

2213
01:22:55,029 --> 01:22:56,029
Watch until the end.

2214
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:57,468
(After watching until the end, )

2215
01:22:57,469 --> 01:22:59,329
(she dodges and punches.)

2216
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:01,968
(She dodged Ju Hyeong's punch...)

2217
01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:04,539
(and connected with a straight.)

2218
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:05,808
Your guard.

2219
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:09,208
(Sae Rok keeps her eyes on her opponent.)

2220
01:23:09,209 --> 01:23:10,378
Watch her arms.

2221
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:11,909
Her punches are long.

2222
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:15,119
What did I tell you to do? That's it.

2223
01:23:16,589 --> 01:23:19,389
(A deep punch to the open lower area)

2224
01:23:20,889 --> 01:23:22,189
Do what next? Yes.

2225
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:24,259
(Sae Rok keeps trying.)

2226
01:23:24,589 --> 01:23:26,559
(She blocks the jab.)

2227
01:23:27,759 --> 01:23:29,398
(Low)

2228
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,399
Yes. What next?

2229
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,568
(When she takes a hit, )

2230
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:33,499
(Sae Rok immediately counters.)

2231
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:38,069
Cut her off, and then what?

2232
01:23:39,209 --> 01:23:41,539
(Cutting off her opponent's path...)

2233
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,079
(and driving a deep two)

2234
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,978
(Ju Hyeong sees the opening and scores a valid strike.)

2235
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:49,549
Watch your opponent's lead hand.

2236
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:51,999
(Ju Hyeong has sized up Sae Rok's skills.)

2237
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:54,859
(Shall I throw in some punches?)

2238
01:23:58,229 --> 01:24:00,029
(Ju Hyeong hits and pulls back fast.)

2239
01:24:03,469 --> 01:24:06,368
(Even amid a flurry of punches, )

2240
01:24:06,369 --> 01:24:08,939
(Sae Rok immediately raises her guard.)

2241
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,608
(Jabs)

2242
01:24:12,609 --> 01:24:13,739
Endure it.

2243
01:24:14,279 --> 01:24:16,309
(Sae Rok's attacks are getting blocked off.)

2244
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:18,209
All the way.

2245
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,149
(And her movements are getting bigger.)

2246
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,349
That's too big.

2247
01:24:24,989 --> 01:24:26,759
(Charging up fully)

2248
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:28,089
That's too big.

2249
01:24:28,559 --> 01:24:29,859
Don't charge up fully, Sae Rok.

2250
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:31,399
Keep your rear hand. Go immediately.

2251
01:24:31,689 --> 01:24:33,198
(Putting her guard up again)

2252
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,199
(She parries the punch.)

2253
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,999
That's it. Connect it to a hook. Yes.

2254
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:37,569
(Block)

2255
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:38,629
(Two)

2256
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:39,829
(One)

2257
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:40,899
(Two)

2258
01:24:41,469 --> 01:24:43,368
One more time. What a bummer.

2259
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,768
Again. Try it again.

2260
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:47,079
(Trying again with her guard up)

2261
01:24:48,339 --> 01:24:50,649
(However, Ju Hyeong blocks all her strikes.)

2262
01:24:51,309 --> 01:24:53,548
- All the way. - It's okay. You're steady. Good.

2263
01:24:53,549 --> 01:24:54,648
(She stays focused.)

2264
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:56,148
- Step in behind. - Two.

2265
01:24:56,149 --> 01:24:57,189
Immediately.

2266
01:24:57,349 --> 01:24:58,719
A two immediately after.

2267
01:24:59,189 --> 01:25:00,888
Stop. Good job.

2268
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:02,329
- Hang in there. - I'm proud of her.

2269
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:04,759
- Pull yourself together. - I'm super proud of her.

2270
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:06,028
Breathe.

2271
01:25:06,029 --> 01:25:09,229
(Admirable Sae Rok is calming down by taking deep breaths.)

2272
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:13,198
- Everyone's really good. - I know, right?

2273
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,369
Her punches are deep. Be careful.

2274
01:25:16,499 --> 01:25:19,509
It's the first time the director told her to be careful.

2275
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:20,808
(Boxing rookie Rocky Keum)

2276
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:23,909
Right now, you're not throwing your hook.

2277
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:25,708
Land a hook after dodging and punching.

2278
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:27,079
- My feet won't move. - I see.

2279
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:28,978
Still, try it. Okay?

2280
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:31,319
(Sae Rok will even try throwing hooks in Round 2.)

2281
01:25:31,589 --> 01:25:32,619
Start.

2282
01:25:33,089 --> 01:25:34,159
Round Two.

2283
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:38,289
(Punches rain down as soon as it starts)

2284
01:25:38,629 --> 01:25:40,328
(Sae Rok inches in with her footwork.)

2285
01:25:40,329 --> 01:25:41,528
Yes. Again.

2286
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:43,628
(Calm)

2287
01:25:43,629 --> 01:25:45,669
(Dodge and punch)

2288
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:50,408
That's it. Nice.

2289
01:25:50,409 --> 01:25:51,729
(She keeps dodging and punching.)

2290
01:25:53,169 --> 01:25:54,439
She's going to attack hard.

2291
01:25:55,179 --> 01:25:57,349
- Yes. - Two. That's it. Okay, well done.

2292
01:25:58,349 --> 01:26:00,478
(Two)

2293
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:02,848
(Dodge)

2294
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:04,888
(Punch)

2295
01:26:04,889 --> 01:26:06,448
(Hook)

2296
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:09,389
(A left hook)

2297
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:11,558
(Sae Rok tried it for the first time.)

2298
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:13,628
Okay, well done. That was a nice counter.

2299
01:26:13,629 --> 01:26:15,109
Good job, even if you didn't hit her.

2300
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:16,359
Keep the two going.

2301
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:18,729
Sae Rok is incredible.

2302
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:19,898
Punch.

2303
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:21,438
(Blocking the jabs with her lead hand)

2304
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:22,938
- Keep your guard up. - Keep your eyes on her.

2305
01:26:22,939 --> 01:26:23,939
Stay calm.

2306
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:25,109
That's it.

2307
01:26:25,909 --> 01:26:27,409
- Right now. Yes. Again. - Nice.

2308
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,378
(Another attempt of punch...)

2309
01:26:29,379 --> 01:26:31,608
(and hook)

2310
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:32,809
Stay calm. Try again.

2311
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:36,449
(Ju Hyeong immediately counters.)

2312
01:26:37,089 --> 01:26:38,388
(Attack 1)

2313
01:26:38,389 --> 01:26:40,518
(Attack 2)

2314
01:26:40,519 --> 01:26:42,259
(Attack 3)

2315
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:46,329
(The 3-punch combo leaves Sae Rok dazed.)

2316
01:26:46,729 --> 01:26:49,529
(There's still 1 minute left.)

2317
01:26:50,599 --> 01:26:52,068
Stay calm and try again.

2318
01:26:52,069 --> 01:26:53,868
(Sae Rok is breathing heavily out of exhaustion.)

2319
01:26:53,869 --> 01:26:55,069
Dodge, punch.

2320
01:26:56,339 --> 01:26:58,869
(Meanwhile, the opponent is still going strong.)

2321
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,878
(Punching, flying, tapping)

2322
01:27:00,879 --> 01:27:01,879
(Defending)

2323
01:27:02,109 --> 01:27:04,279
(Her punches flashed by in an instant.)

2324
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:07,249
That's it. Good job.

2325
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,018
(A punch and...)

2326
01:27:09,019 --> 01:27:11,589
(an attempt of a left hook)

2327
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:13,049
Great job, even if it didn't land.

2328
01:27:13,149 --> 01:27:14,989
- Nice. - Hang in there.

2329
01:27:15,959 --> 01:27:17,888
- You're doing great, Sae Rok. - Endure it.

2330
01:27:17,889 --> 01:27:19,528
Don't over-swing, Sae Rok.

2331
01:27:19,529 --> 01:27:20,928
- I told you not to do that. - More.

2332
01:27:20,929 --> 01:27:23,198
Don't forget your footwork.

2333
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:27,069
(She's only stretching her arms out without any footwork.)

2334
01:27:27,469 --> 01:27:30,138
(Sae Rok's heaving breathing fills the ring.)

2335
01:27:30,139 --> 01:27:31,808
- Sae Rok isn't giving up. - She has her eyes fixed.

2336
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:33,239
She's keeping her eyes locked.

2337
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,878
(Even though I'm tired, I won't back down.)

2338
01:27:35,879 --> 01:27:36,908
You're doing great.

2339
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:37,949
Throw in some punches.

2340
01:27:38,449 --> 01:27:39,478
Try it. It's okay.

2341
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:40,978
Hang in there until the end.

2342
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:42,019
Endure it.

2343
01:27:42,519 --> 01:27:44,125
- Ten seconds. Hang in there. - Ten seconds.

2344
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:45,718
Keep throwing in punches.

2345
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,018
- Keep going. - Endure it.

2346
01:27:47,019 --> 01:27:48,059
Keep going.

2347
01:27:48,089 --> 01:27:49,119
Inch in.

2348
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,929
Keep trying. That's it.

2349
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:53,929
- That's one point. That's it. - Go in.

2350
01:27:54,329 --> 01:27:56,358
(She throws a punch, )

2351
01:27:56,359 --> 01:27:58,468
(but the match ends with her taking a hit.)

2352
01:27:58,469 --> 01:27:59,728
- Good job. - Seriously, Sae Rok.

2353
01:27:59,729 --> 01:28:00,768
(Round 2 ends.)

2354
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:01,999
- Great job. - Gosh.

2355
01:28:02,139 --> 01:28:03,869
A bit disappointing, right? You did well.

2356
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:05,439
- I can't land any hooks. - Right.

2357
01:28:05,709 --> 01:28:06,838
It's frustrating.

2358
01:28:06,839 --> 01:28:08,539
(It's frustrating.)

2359
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:10,479
Well done.

2360
01:28:11,249 --> 01:28:12,878
- I'm exhausted. - Open your eyes.

2361
01:28:12,879 --> 01:28:13,879
Yes, ma'am.

2362
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,348
- Rocky Keum. - I'm not the type...

2363
01:28:15,349 --> 01:28:17,088
to praise people.

2364
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:19,588
None of you seems like one-month boxers.

2365
01:28:19,589 --> 01:28:21,988
I put more weight into my punches...

2366
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:23,259
since she didn't budge.

2367
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:25,228
Keeping a poker face...

2368
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:26,959
even when you get hit is very important.

2369
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:28,798
- Right. - Sae Rok kept her eyes on me...

2370
01:28:28,799 --> 01:28:30,598
- even when she got hit. - Right.

2371
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:31,969
I was really impressed.

2372
01:28:33,869 --> 01:28:36,139
(Even though the punches came right at her, )

2373
01:28:36,699 --> 01:28:39,139
(Sae Rok didn't take her eyes off the opponent.)

2374
01:28:39,409 --> 01:28:44,178
(Eyes locked in)

2375
01:28:44,179 --> 01:28:47,749
(Eyes locked in even after taking a hit)

2376
01:28:48,519 --> 01:28:51,749
(Subduing the punches with just her eyes)

2377
01:28:51,819 --> 01:28:53,518
Sae Rok is strong-willed.

2378
01:28:53,519 --> 01:28:54,718
- Yes, she really is. - Right?

2379
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,358
- That's crucial. - Yes.

2380
01:28:56,359 --> 01:28:58,488
- She's got good focus. - I can tell.

2381
01:28:58,489 --> 01:28:59,689
I wanted...

2382
01:28:59,789 --> 01:29:03,028
to throw a hook after the punch,

2383
01:29:03,029 --> 01:29:05,168
- but I wasn't able to... - This is...

2384
01:29:05,169 --> 01:29:07,568
what I felt after sparring with you.

2385
01:29:07,569 --> 01:29:09,399
You throw every punch with full strength,

2386
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:11,339
so it's hard for you to land the next one.

2387
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:15,179
(Because she threw every punch with full power, )

2388
01:29:15,539 --> 01:29:17,708
(her movements became bigger.)

2389
01:29:17,709 --> 01:29:18,709
Up to the hook.

2390
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:23,919
(And was unable to regain balance to throw the next punch)

2391
01:29:24,949 --> 01:29:26,319
You can't land a strong hook...

2392
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:28,018
- after a powerful punch. - Exactly.

2393
01:29:28,019 --> 01:29:29,818
Which one is more important, the punch or the hook?

2394
01:29:29,819 --> 01:29:32,028
- The hook. - Yes. So for the punch,

2395
01:29:32,029 --> 01:29:33,088
Go easy.

2396
01:29:33,089 --> 01:29:35,858
Use 60 percent of your strength. For the hook, use 80 percent.

2397
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:37,268
I told you, but it was tough, right?

2398
01:29:37,269 --> 01:29:38,898
- Yes. - It's only natural.

2399
01:29:38,899 --> 01:29:40,568
- My mind went blank. - Your punches...

2400
01:29:40,569 --> 01:29:43,269
need to land within this box.

2401
01:29:44,469 --> 01:29:45,808
- That's it. - I can...

2402
01:29:45,809 --> 01:29:47,038
easily tell.

2403
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:48,478
That's why I was able to dodge...

2404
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:49,578
after throwing a punch.

2405
01:29:49,579 --> 01:29:51,525
(It's only a matter of time before the opponent reads the moves.)

2406
01:29:51,549 --> 01:29:53,778
I heard the same thing last time.

2407
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:55,619
(Overload Sae Rok received the same feedback.)

2408
01:29:55,879 --> 01:29:57,748
(Sae Rok's second sparring session results:)

2409
01:29:57,749 --> 01:30:00,388
(Strengths: She attempted a variety of punches, )

2410
01:30:00,389 --> 01:30:02,819
(including ducks and left hooks)

2411
01:30:03,459 --> 01:30:10,998
(Points to improve: Her punches are still thrown with too much force.)

2412
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:18,069
(Distribution of strength is needed to land the punches consecutively.)

2413
01:30:18,139 --> 01:30:20,208
- Coach. You'd better feel nervous. - Coach. Drink some water.

2414
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:21,238
- Don't do that. - Why not?

2415
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:23,849
- Don't say things like that. - It's the ace's turn.

2416
01:30:24,309 --> 01:30:25,378
The ace is up.

2417
01:30:25,379 --> 01:30:26,449
(Full of confidence)

2418
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:29,219
Shall I go all out for the last one?

2419
01:30:29,379 --> 01:30:30,748
I'll use the whole ring.

2420
01:30:30,749 --> 01:30:31,849
(I'll use the whole ring.)

2421
01:30:33,449 --> 01:30:34,888
(The one to burn up the ring)

2422
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:36,395
Do it the way you've been doing, In Ah.

2423
01:30:36,419 --> 01:30:37,858
Your goal is to...

2424
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:39,359
- It's to stay calm. - Yes.

2425
01:30:39,929 --> 01:30:41,629
Use what you've learned.

2426
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:43,329
- You can do it, right? - Yes.

2427
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:46,498
In Ah's face instantly switched to battle mode.

2428
01:30:46,499 --> 01:30:49,299
(Battle mode on)

2429
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:51,438
- Stay calm. - Right, Stay calm.

2430
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:52,608
- Like before. - Just like before.

2431
01:30:52,609 --> 01:30:53,808
- Two, dodge, two, hook. - Okay.

2432
01:30:53,809 --> 01:30:55,255
(Be calm. Control your lead foot. Two, dodge, two, hook.)

2433
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:57,008
Stick to what we practiced. Okay?

2434
01:30:57,009 --> 01:30:58,079
Good luck!

2435
01:30:59,879 --> 01:31:01,749
All right. Touch gloves.

2436
01:31:01,979 --> 01:31:03,148
- Good luck, In Ah. - Good luck.

2437
01:31:03,149 --> 01:31:04,388
- Good luck. - Keep your manners.

2438
01:31:04,389 --> 01:31:05,848
- Stay calm. - Touch gloves.

2439
01:31:05,849 --> 01:31:07,488
- Just stick to what you've learned. - Okay.

2440
01:31:07,489 --> 01:31:09,159
(Tension fills the ring.)

2441
01:31:10,789 --> 01:31:11,789
Good luck.

2442
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:13,359
Round One.

2443
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:15,358
Stay calm.

2444
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:16,629
(Round 1 begins.)

2445
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:20,799
(Exchanging strong jabs)

2446
01:31:21,469 --> 01:31:22,538
(Countering the punch...)

2447
01:31:22,539 --> 01:31:24,939
(thrown at her immediately)

2448
01:31:25,309 --> 01:31:26,409
Do whatever you want.

2449
01:31:26,909 --> 01:31:27,909
That's it.

2450
01:31:28,009 --> 01:31:29,239
- The two are on par. - Right?

2451
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:32,209
Yes. Good.

2452
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:34,949
(A solid thud of punches)

2453
01:31:35,519 --> 01:31:37,818
(One, one, two, one, two)

2454
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:38,889
- Up to the hook. - Nice.

2455
01:31:39,219 --> 01:31:40,458
(Blocking)

2456
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:41,488
(Taking)

2457
01:31:41,489 --> 01:31:42,988
(Striking)

2458
01:31:42,989 --> 01:31:44,888
(Blocking)

2459
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:48,859
(They both hit at the same time.)

2460
01:31:50,669 --> 01:31:52,429
(At that moment, )

2461
01:31:53,099 --> 01:31:55,798
(Ju Hyeong's hook lands perfectly.)

2462
01:31:55,799 --> 01:31:57,709
- She's seeing it through. - Yes, well done.

2463
01:31:58,139 --> 01:31:59,169
That's it.

2464
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:01,809
(In Ah throws punches even while getting hit.)

2465
01:32:02,539 --> 01:32:05,048
(Immediately followed by a body shot)

2466
01:32:05,049 --> 01:32:06,849
Well done. That's it.

2467
01:32:08,179 --> 01:32:11,819
(She even changes direction toward the retreating opponent.)

2468
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:14,759
(Excited)

2469
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:16,018
Then you've got to land a body shot.

2470
01:32:16,019 --> 01:32:17,628
When she moves to the side, you've got to land a body shot.

2471
01:32:17,629 --> 01:32:18,629
Yes, just like that.
Then you've got to land a body shot.

2472
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:21,128
(When the opponent is moving to the side)

2473
01:32:21,129 --> 01:32:22,229
Yes, just like that.

2474
01:32:22,299 --> 01:32:24,999
(Low, high)

2475
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:26,869
Yes, just like that.

2476
01:32:26,899 --> 01:32:28,619
Do it when the opponent shifts to the side.

2477
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:30,168
This is amazing.

2478
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,709
(Amazing)

2479
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:34,279
(In Ah lives up to expectations.)

2480
01:32:35,009 --> 01:32:37,009
(Ju Hyeong is done sizing up In Ah.)

2481
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:40,108
(From now on, it's the real deal.)

2482
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:41,779
(Training level 1)

2483
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:42,979
(Surprised)

2484
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,089
(Training level 2)

2485
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:48,659
Hook! That's your chance to go in.

2486
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:52,028
(1 combo)

2487
01:32:52,029 --> 01:32:53,958
(2 combo)

2488
01:32:53,959 --> 01:32:55,659
(3 combo)

2489
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:57,229
Punch.

2490
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:58,468
Pull your chin down, In Ah.

2491
01:32:58,469 --> 01:33:00,149
- Keep your guard up. - In Ah, your guard!

2492
01:33:00,269 --> 01:33:01,468
You're all open right now.

2493
01:33:01,469 --> 01:33:03,339
Keep your guard up. In Ah, your guard.

2494
01:33:03,499 --> 01:33:04,939
Guard up and chin down.

2495
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:06,839
That's your chance to punch.

2496
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:08,439
Hands up.

2497
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,880
(She focuses and resets her stance.)

2498
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:11,278
(Aiming for the right time, she throws a one-two.)

2499
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:12,885
If the opponent comes in, always go for a punch.

2500
01:33:12,909 --> 01:33:14,049
Go in first.

2501
01:33:14,279 --> 01:33:15,349
Go in first.

2502
01:33:16,349 --> 01:33:18,219
- That's it. - Way to go, In Ah.

2503
01:33:19,419 --> 01:33:20,459
Be quick.

2504
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:22,758
(In Ah's attack: Step in...)

2505
01:33:22,759 --> 01:33:25,029
(and a straight punch)

2506
01:33:25,489 --> 01:33:27,198
(Ju Hyeong's counter: Dodge, )

2507
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:29,628
(punch, )

2508
01:33:29,629 --> 01:33:31,669
(and punch)

2509
01:33:32,669 --> 01:33:34,799
Be quick. Ten seconds.

2510
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:37,368
- That's it. - Your guard.

2511
01:33:37,369 --> 01:33:39,138
(In Ah tries to dodge and punch again.)

2512
01:33:39,139 --> 01:33:40,168
(Dodge, punch)

2513
01:33:40,169 --> 01:33:41,708
Hook. Go all the way.

2514
01:33:41,709 --> 01:33:43,215
That's what happens when you don't end it with a hook.

2515
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:45,449
(In Ah has a hard time landing a hook too.)

2516
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:47,248
Punch.

2517
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:48,418
Stop.

2518
01:33:48,419 --> 01:33:49,448
(Round 1 ends.)

2519
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:51,149
- In Ah, you're amazing. - Your guard.

2520
01:33:51,449 --> 01:33:53,119
Well done.

2521
01:33:54,789 --> 01:33:55,819
Breathe.

2522
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:57,788
(Calmly regaining her breath)

2523
01:33:57,789 --> 01:33:58,929
Okay. Good job.

2524
01:33:59,829 --> 01:34:00,999
I can't land a hook.

2525
01:34:01,599 --> 01:34:02,858
I can't get it right.

2526
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:04,528
That's because you're swinging too widely.

2527
01:34:04,529 --> 01:34:07,798
The opponent is purposely moving in.

2528
01:34:07,799 --> 01:34:09,739
Then you have to throw a punch, no matter what.

2529
01:34:10,469 --> 01:34:11,809
Gosh, she's...

2530
01:34:12,169 --> 01:34:14,409
- She's got power. - Right. She's really good.

2531
01:34:15,309 --> 01:34:16,608
Since it's the last sparring,

2532
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,809
- I'm going to go all out. - Go ahead.

2533
01:34:19,509 --> 01:34:23,179
(A more intense sparring is anticipated.)

2534
01:34:24,419 --> 01:34:25,518
(Round 2 begins.)

2535
01:34:25,519 --> 01:34:27,188
- Touch gloves. - Good luck!

2536
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:29,659
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2537
01:34:30,089 --> 01:34:31,129
Good luck!

2538
01:34:31,489 --> 01:34:32,658
(Training level 2)

2539
01:34:32,659 --> 01:34:33,799
Don't panic.

2540
01:34:34,559 --> 01:34:36,759
(Excited)

2541
01:34:37,929 --> 01:34:38,929
Guard up.

2542
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:43,369
(Ju Hyeong's punch was slightly faster.)

2543
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:44,669
Keep your guard up, In Ah.

2544
01:34:44,709 --> 01:34:46,208
In Ah, your guard.

2545
01:34:46,209 --> 01:34:47,209
Guard up.

2546
01:34:47,739 --> 01:34:48,778
(Ju Hyeong's dodge, )

2547
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:50,308
(punch, )

2548
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:51,978
(hook, )

2549
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:53,878
(two, )

2550
01:34:53,879 --> 01:34:55,919
(and hook)

2551
01:34:56,119 --> 01:34:58,649
(Attack 1, 2, 3, 4)

2552
01:34:58,749 --> 01:35:00,819
- Keep your guard up. - Low, high.

2553
01:35:01,389 --> 01:35:02,888
- Well done. - Stay calm.

2554
01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:03,958
Nice.

2555
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:07,628
(In Ah turns her head after getting hit.)

2556
01:35:07,629 --> 01:35:08,898
Don't turn your head.

2557
01:35:08,899 --> 01:35:10,398
Don't turn your head. Punch.

2558
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:13,028
(She must watch until the end and stay alert.)

2559
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:15,039
Put your guard up, In Ah.

2560
01:35:15,599 --> 01:35:18,438
(At Sae Rok's words, )

2561
01:35:18,439 --> 01:35:20,638
(she adjusts her stance.)

2562
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:21,779
That's it.

2563
01:35:22,139 --> 01:35:23,478
(Trying the technique she had agreed on with Coach Kim)

2564
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:25,209
Yes. Well done.

2565
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:27,248
(In Ah's counter: Punch, dodge, )

2566
01:35:27,249 --> 01:35:28,648
(punch, )

2567
01:35:28,649 --> 01:35:31,688
(and hook)

2568
01:35:31,689 --> 01:35:33,919
That's it. Yes. Well done.

2569
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:36,618
She's super fast.

2570
01:35:36,619 --> 01:35:37,628
(Ju Hyeong counters at lightning speed.)

2571
01:35:37,629 --> 01:35:39,029
- Guard up. - Guard up.

2572
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:41,199
Wasn't that another flying attack?

2573
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:42,729
- Did she do that to me too? - Yes.

2574
01:35:44,229 --> 01:35:46,629
(Landing after pulling off a flashy technique)

2575
01:35:46,769 --> 01:35:48,369
- Guard up. - Guard up.

2576
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:50,809
(And yet, Simba Seol is unbeatable.)

2577
01:35:51,469 --> 01:35:53,508
(Trying another high...)

2578
01:35:53,509 --> 01:35:54,738
(and low)

2579
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:55,778
Your guard.

2580
01:35:55,779 --> 01:35:57,579
- Keep your guard up. - Low, high.

2581
01:35:58,579 --> 01:36:01,048
(Gasping for air under the barrage of attacks)

2582
01:36:01,049 --> 01:36:02,078
Put your guard up, In Ah.

2583
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:05,848
- Put it up one more time. - What are you doing? Go in.

2584
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:07,819
That's it. Don't try to hit hard.

2585
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:09,718
You can do it.

2586
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:10,828
(Ju Hyeong hits harder.)

2587
01:36:10,829 --> 01:36:12,059
Yes. Good.

2588
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:14,698
(Ju Hyeong's big hook...)

2589
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:16,899
(and a straight)

2590
01:36:17,099 --> 01:36:18,768
- Again. Dodge. - That was a good dodge.

2591
01:36:18,769 --> 01:36:20,598
- Dodge, punch, and hook. - Nice.

2592
01:36:20,599 --> 01:36:21,599
All the way.

2593
01:36:22,299 --> 01:36:23,868
(In Ah's turn: Dodge, )

2594
01:36:23,869 --> 01:36:25,908
(punch, and a body hook)

2595
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:27,508
Nice, Seol In Ah!

2596
01:36:27,509 --> 01:36:28,608
Don't forget the two.

2597
01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:29,978
(Remaining time)

2598
01:36:29,979 --> 01:36:31,579
- You're doing well, In Ah! - Let's go!

2599
01:36:31,909 --> 01:36:34,649
(Iron Girls' genius boxer In Ah)

2600
01:36:34,819 --> 01:36:37,339
(True to her reputation, former national team member Ju Hyeong)

2601
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:40,219
(A stormy sparring session between the two)

2602
01:36:40,619 --> 01:36:42,188
(Jab 1)

2603
01:36:42,189 --> 01:36:44,028
(Jab 2)

2604
01:36:44,029 --> 01:36:45,788
(Jab 3)

2605
01:36:45,789 --> 01:36:47,059
(Jab 4)

2606
01:36:47,559 --> 01:36:49,199
(Taken aback by the consecutive jabs)

2607
01:36:49,259 --> 01:36:50,899
Do everything you want.

2608
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:52,229
Keep watching, In Ah.

2609
01:36:52,299 --> 01:36:53,669
Focus, In Ah!

2610
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:54,999
Try everything.

2611
01:36:55,269 --> 01:36:56,538
That's it. Up to the hook.

2612
01:36:56,539 --> 01:36:58,019
- It's okay. Go for a combo. - Focus.

2613
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,038
- Focus. - The last combo.

2614
01:37:00,039 --> 01:37:01,039
- All the way through. - Focus.

2615
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,138
In Ah, the last combo.

2616
01:37:02,139 --> 01:37:03,939
(Using all her strength to dodge and punch, )

2617
01:37:04,309 --> 01:37:06,609
(the hook still fails to land.)

2618
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:07,919
(Initial strike)

2619
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:09,648
In Ah, the last combo.

2620
01:37:09,649 --> 01:37:14,159
(In Ah took a hit, but she delivered a valid strike.)

2621
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:17,259
Again. Stop.

2622
01:37:17,829 --> 01:37:18,829
Well done.

2623
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:19,858
(Their sparring was captivating.)

2624
01:37:19,859 --> 01:37:21,898
- Good job. - Well done.

2625
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:23,028
(Despite her knee injury, In Ah showed incredible determination.)

2626
01:37:23,029 --> 01:37:24,199
Okay.

2627
01:37:24,969 --> 01:37:26,569
- Well... - This sparring was fun.

2628
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:29,175
That sparring session just now was on a whole different level.

2629
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,209
I think they could have a money fight.

2630
01:37:31,339 --> 01:37:33,909
Can you prepare some popcorn from now on?

2631
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,339
Gosh, Seol In Ah.

2632
01:37:36,509 --> 01:37:38,649
Goodness.

2633
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:40,579
I took a ton of hits.

2634
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,639
What did you think about the sparring?

2635
01:37:42,749 --> 01:37:45,388
First off, I couldn't do anything.

2636
01:37:45,389 --> 01:37:46,619
I tried but...

2637
01:37:47,089 --> 01:37:48,718
I must have no sense of range yet.

2638
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,228
It was the same when I sparred with Sung Min.

2639
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:53,388
I couldn't gauge the distance between us.

2640
01:37:53,389 --> 01:37:56,898
Even though the girls told me to put my guard up, I couldn't.

2641
01:37:56,899 --> 01:37:59,028
Instead, I tried to step back, loosen up,

2642
01:37:59,029 --> 01:38:01,469
- and strike again. - That was a good call.

2643
01:38:02,269 --> 01:38:03,499
And dodging and punching.

2644
01:38:03,569 --> 01:38:06,409
The coach told me Ju Hyeong was left-handed.

2645
01:38:06,509 --> 01:38:09,908
I planned to catch her punch, dodge, and follow up with a hook.

2646
01:38:09,909 --> 01:38:11,079
I bet she knew.

2647
01:38:11,209 --> 01:38:12,408
- She knows it all. - She must've read it.

2648
01:38:12,409 --> 01:38:14,018
"I'm not letting you land a hook."

2649
01:38:14,019 --> 01:38:15,978
That's exactly what I felt the entire session.

2650
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:16,979
(You bet.)

2651
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,049
It was fun.

2652
01:38:18,089 --> 01:38:19,418
It was good that you tried.

2653
01:38:19,419 --> 01:38:21,318
Even though it didn't land, it was a good attempt.

2654
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:23,089
Your boldness...

2655
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:25,488
in landing a punch as the opponent came in...

2656
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:26,929
was impressive.

2657
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:30,129
(The one-two combo was a given.)

2658
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:32,028
(She landed a punch even as she got hit.)

2659
01:38:32,029 --> 01:38:33,029
(Two)

2660
01:38:33,599 --> 01:38:35,198
That's it.

2661
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:36,568
(There's more.)

2662
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:38,568
(Dodge and punch 1)

2663
01:38:38,569 --> 01:38:40,468
(Dodge and punch 2)

2664
01:38:40,469 --> 01:38:42,439
(Dodge and punch 3)

2665
01:38:43,309 --> 01:38:45,909
(From high-lows)

2666
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:47,418
- It's okay. Go for a combo. - Focus.

2667
01:38:47,419 --> 01:38:50,579
(to dodges, punches, and hooks, In Ah tried every technique.)

2668
01:38:50,679 --> 01:38:52,988
In a way, she may feel disappointed.

2669
01:38:52,989 --> 01:38:55,418
- I'm really disappointed. - I can tell she couldn't do...

2670
01:38:55,419 --> 01:38:56,588
everything she had planned.

2671
01:38:56,589 --> 01:38:58,728
I purposely made things a bit tougher...

2672
01:38:58,729 --> 01:39:01,099
- for In Ah. - Every athlete does that.

2673
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,898
It's because she's good.

2674
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:03,998
- Exactly. - Right.

2675
01:39:03,999 --> 01:39:05,328
- It's because she's good. - Thank you for your kind words.

2676
01:39:05,329 --> 01:39:08,298
Because she's skilled, I threw in more punches.

2677
01:39:08,299 --> 01:39:09,938
But I'm curious.

2678
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:11,869
Why did you turn your head?

2679
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:15,039
(Midway through Round 2)

2680
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,548
(In Ah turned her head after taking a punch.)

2681
01:39:19,549 --> 01:39:20,749
Don't turn your head.

2682
01:39:21,379 --> 01:39:23,019
- I took too many hits. - Right.

2683
01:39:23,549 --> 01:39:25,588
But that gesture says, "I want to give up."

2684
01:39:25,589 --> 01:39:28,018
Yes. That's exactly what it means.

2685
01:39:28,019 --> 01:39:29,888
It signals that...

2686
01:39:29,889 --> 01:39:31,558
- I had no idea. - you want to...

2687
01:39:31,559 --> 01:39:35,398
- step out of the ring and stop. - It means you want to stop.

2688
01:39:35,399 --> 01:39:38,269
The referee might stop the match even if you're winning.

2689
01:39:38,669 --> 01:39:40,428
I didn't know about that.

2690
01:39:40,429 --> 01:39:42,098
Never show your back...

2691
01:39:42,099 --> 01:39:43,368
or turn your head.

2692
01:39:43,369 --> 01:39:44,408
- I had no idea. - And In Ah...

2693
01:39:44,409 --> 01:39:46,239
I'm sure you'll work on it,

2694
01:39:46,509 --> 01:39:50,739
but you need to throw your punches inside this box.

2695
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:53,608
- I have a question. - This is what you're like.

2696
01:39:53,609 --> 01:39:56,418
When we practice, we punch inside the box.

2697
01:39:56,419 --> 01:39:58,649
- Yes. - But like this...

2698
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:01,089
If I punch like this, they don't reach you.

2699
01:40:01,389 --> 01:40:02,389
I mean...

2700
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:03,418
(Like this)

2701
01:40:03,419 --> 01:40:04,728
(You're too far away.)

2702
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:05,958
- Yes, same here. - During practice...

2703
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,328
- I was taken aback. - That's me.

2704
01:40:07,329 --> 01:40:08,459
Here's the important part.

2705
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:11,369
This isn't how you punch within the box.

2706
01:40:11,569 --> 01:40:12,629
I'm still within the box.

2707
01:40:12,729 --> 01:40:14,639
(Sharp, concise punches closing in)

2708
01:40:14,739 --> 01:40:15,739
I'm still within the box.

2709
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:17,709
(Moving forward with footwork)

2710
01:40:17,909 --> 01:40:19,809
You throw punches while moving forward.

2711
01:40:19,869 --> 01:40:21,278
You close the distance...

2712
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:22,638
- with your feet. - Yes.

2713
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,649
Move in and throw short punches.

2714
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:27,348
(Attacking without footwork)

2715
01:40:27,349 --> 01:40:30,419
(Attacking using footwork)

2716
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:33,919
What do we need to practice to hit our opponent?

2717
01:40:34,219 --> 01:40:36,018
- Footwork. - Correct. It's footwork.

2718
01:40:36,019 --> 01:40:37,059
Exactly.

2719
01:40:37,559 --> 01:40:39,288
(In Ah's second sparring session results:)

2720
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:42,998
(Strengths: She made quick defensive-to-offensive transitions.)

2721
01:40:42,999 --> 01:40:46,528
(She threw lots of punches, using various techniques.)

2722
01:40:46,529 --> 01:40:52,969
(She was determined to deliver valid strikes even under attack.)

2723
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:59,449
(Points to improve: Never turn your head in the ring.)

2724
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:04,048
(Practice footwork to reduce big movements.)

2725
01:41:04,049 --> 01:41:10,689
(Fix the habit of constantly dropping the guard.)

2726
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:13,358
I observed Ju Hyeong.

2727
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,658
She allowed herself to take hits...

2728
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:19,229
so the girls could practice their techniques.

2729
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:21,069
Ju Hyeong was the best sparring partner.

2730
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:22,798
Thank you.

2731
01:41:22,799 --> 01:41:25,138
I'm so grateful that she became the sparring partner...

2732
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:27,539
- I had in mind. - Honestly,

2733
01:41:27,839 --> 01:41:29,378
I thought they wouldn't have the strength...

2734
01:41:29,379 --> 01:41:30,539
- I see. - at all.

2735
01:41:31,049 --> 01:41:34,578
"Should I only use my lead hand?"

2736
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:37,649
I had a lot on my mind about how I could help.

2737
01:41:38,049 --> 01:41:42,689
But they were packed with some serious power,

2738
01:41:42,989 --> 01:41:46,259
with punches that could count as valid strikes.

2739
01:41:46,389 --> 01:41:48,798
Concentrate as much as you can.

2740
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:51,668
Practice how to punch more accurately. Why?

2741
01:41:51,669 --> 01:41:54,368
Because the one who lands the more accurate punches will win.

2742
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:55,538
- Okay. - Okay. Understood.

2743
01:41:55,539 --> 01:41:58,008
How about we make it fun and pick today's best player?

2744
01:41:58,009 --> 01:41:59,509
- Come on. - "Today's best player?"

2745
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:01,679
- Today's... - All right. Fine.

2746
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:03,979
We all know who the best player is.

2747
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:05,279
It's not me.

2748
01:42:05,849 --> 01:42:07,619
May I pick?

2749
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:10,218
(He's simply entertained.)

2750
01:42:10,219 --> 01:42:11,488
(Who will take the glorious title of 1st place?)

2751
01:42:11,489 --> 01:42:12,549
I have no hopes for this.

2752
01:42:13,089 --> 01:42:15,089
- Sae Rok. - Yes, she has a keen eye.

2753
01:42:15,589 --> 01:42:16,619
How come?

2754
01:42:16,919 --> 01:42:18,558
- Sae Rok. - I agree.

2755
01:42:18,559 --> 01:42:19,759
- Me? - Yes.

2756
01:42:20,059 --> 01:42:22,759
Sae Rok had the most accurate punches.

2757
01:42:22,829 --> 01:42:23,858
- Me? - Yes.

2758
01:42:23,859 --> 01:42:25,528
You had the will to punch...

2759
01:42:25,529 --> 01:42:26,598
- accurately. - Absolutely.

2760
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:28,068
- You intended to do it. - Sae Rok was the best.

2761
01:42:28,069 --> 01:42:31,338
What really impressed me was Sae Rok's...

2762
01:42:31,339 --> 01:42:33,368
strong will not to give up.

2763
01:42:33,369 --> 01:42:34,608
- Yes. - The determination...

2764
01:42:34,609 --> 01:42:37,038
to keep fighting despite taking punches...

2765
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:38,148
- really stood out. - I agree.

2766
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:40,278
- Really? - All of you have strong punches,

2767
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,518
but what matters most is accuracy.

2768
01:42:42,519 --> 01:42:44,289
- Yes. - That's when it hurts.

2769
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:46,389
That's when you can earn points.

2770
01:42:47,019 --> 01:42:49,989
That makes her today's MVP. Her punches were on point.

2771
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:51,989
- How cool. - I'll work even harder.

2772
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:53,689
In the next sparring session,

2773
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,829
let's work on using the attack patterns.

2774
01:42:55,899 --> 01:42:57,498
- That's our next goal. - Okay.

2775
01:42:57,499 --> 01:42:58,929
- How about it? - I'm in.

2776
01:42:59,029 --> 01:43:00,999
- Thank you for today. - Thank you.

2777
01:43:01,769 --> 01:43:02,839
Amazing.

2778
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:04,768
- KO! - KO! Iron...

2779
01:43:04,769 --> 01:43:06,768
- Girls! - Girls!

2780
01:43:06,769 --> 01:43:07,809
Great work.

2781
01:43:08,339 --> 01:43:11,148
- Thank you for today. - I hope you win.

2782
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:12,508
- Thank you. - It was an honor.

2783
01:43:12,509 --> 01:43:14,178
- It was an honor. - I'm finally loosening up.

2784
01:43:14,179 --> 01:43:15,005
I hope you win.

2785
01:43:15,102 --> 01:43:16,102
(We're not...)

2786
01:43:16,103 --> 01:43:17,271
(actually boxing today, are we?)

2787
01:43:17,272 --> 01:43:19,042
(It says "tournament" here.)

2788
01:43:19,142 --> 01:43:20,342
(Where did the Iron Girls go?)

2789
01:43:20,712 --> 01:43:23,911
(At a boxing tournament)

2790
01:43:23,912 --> 01:43:26,082
(So far, it was just a sneak peek.)

2791
01:43:26,252 --> 01:43:27,451
(Getting knocked down...)

2792
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:29,152
(And bleeding from the nose)

2793
01:43:29,252 --> 01:43:32,692
(Facing a merciless, real tournament for the first time)

2794
01:43:32,722 --> 01:43:35,462
(The Iron Girls dive into a real tournament?)

2795
01:43:35,522 --> 01:43:37,621
(The basics of a boxing tournament, determining weight classes)

2796
01:43:37,622 --> 01:43:39,892
(I've never been below a certain weight.)

2797
01:43:39,962 --> 01:43:41,361
(Right now, I weigh around...)

2798
01:43:41,362 --> 01:43:42,961
I also need to lose weight.

2799
01:43:42,962 --> 01:43:45,032
(After determining their weight classes, )

2800
01:43:45,702 --> 01:43:47,902
(they will face actual fighters...)

2801
01:43:48,542 --> 01:43:50,742
(from the community sports competition.)

2802
01:43:51,442 --> 01:43:56,512
(It's time to put everything they've learned to the test.)

2803
01:43:57,042 --> 01:44:02,322
(They must calm their nerves...)

2804
01:44:02,452 --> 01:44:04,992
(and trust the 2 months of training.)

2805
01:44:05,152 --> 01:44:09,322
(From here on, the opponent will show no mercy.)

2806
01:44:09,462 --> 01:44:12,992
(A full 100 percent showdown)

2807
01:44:13,262 --> 01:44:14,431
(What will happen to the Iron Girls...)

2808
01:44:14,432 --> 01:44:17,032
(in the ring?)
