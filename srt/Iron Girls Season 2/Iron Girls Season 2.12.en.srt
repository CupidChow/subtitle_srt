1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,385
- I don't think I can watch it. - Do we need to actually watch it?

2
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:02,486
It's my first time watching it.

(Iron Girls 2)

4
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,556
(The girls challenged themselves to learn how to box.)

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,656
(Is this something we can do?)

6
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:10,295
(No one...)

7
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:11,426
(imagined...)

8
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:15,236
(that they'd learn a combat sport.)

9
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:18,505
(Their goal was to become...)

10
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:21,106
(a boxing champion.)

11
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,506
(They had to fight against...)

12
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,506
(the fear of a 1-on-1,)

13
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:29,176
(the fear of taking punches, )

14
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:32,316
(the fear of limits, )

15
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:36,056
(and the fear of injuries.)

16
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:41,996
(They worked hard to overcome all in the past 4 months.)

17
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:45,296
(They had their first tournaments.)

18
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,196
(Then came...)

19
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,936
(the last tournaments.)

00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,575
(Let's briefly go back in time...)

23
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,916
(to last May 15.)

24
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:07,855
(Iron Girls 2, Long-Term Training Project)

25
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:09,885
- Hold on a second. - What?

26
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,986
- What did you have? - Rock-paper-scissors, my foot!

27
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:15,596
- What should we do? - That's the starting point.

28
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,595
I had never seen anything like it.

29
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:20,226
How is it different from the skim jump?

30
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,735
(What's today's training everyone is surprised about?)

31
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:23,166
Hey, there's no end in sight.

32
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:27,066
The training you'll do today is running up the stairs.

33
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:29,505
- Running up the stairs. - Do we need to run up the stairs?

34
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,675
- These stairs? - All of it?

35
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,075
It's the same as the ski jump.

36
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:33,975
How did you find this place?

37
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,916
- There are more stairs. - Yes.

38
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,585
(Aren't these stairs all?)

39
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:38,946
What are we going to do?

40
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,316
The stairs training course you'll do from now on...

41
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,426
has the 1st section with 252 stairs.

42
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,396
When you go up, you'll come across a flatland section.

43
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:49,325
You'll have time to recover.

44
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:52,596
(A flatland section for recovery)

45
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:56,065
The last section has 130 stairs.

46
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,466
(The 2nd section with 130 stairs)

47
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:01,736
(The course is complete after climbing 382 stairs.)

48
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:04,745
(Start, 1st staircase, flatland, 2nd staircase, end)

49
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,516
(The training course has a total of 3 sections.)

50
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,775
(Start, 1st staircase, flatland, 2nd staircase, end)

51
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:12,986
(The highest elevation is 209m.)

52
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:17,315
And this is a mini-project of Iron Girls 2.

53
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:20,686
You'll come here three times and record your time.

54
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,126
What?

55
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,266
(With the term of 45 days)

56
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:29,096
(1st, 2nd, 3rd)

57
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:33,966
(Through 3 sessions of the stairs training, )

58
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:39,976
(they must succeed in shortening their time.)

59
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:41,976
- Are you ready? - Yes.

60
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,515
Get ready.

61
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:44,645
(The 1st stairs training starts.)

62
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,946
Go. All right.

63
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:52,486
(First staircase)

64
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,826
(In Ah takes the lead.)

65
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:57,496
What's up with her?

66
00:02:58,296 --> 00:03:00,566
(Taking long strides)

67
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,866
(Stamina Queen Uie goes up 2 stairs at a time.)

68
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,266
(Ju Hyun and Sae Rok follow.)

69
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:07,306
(Groaning)

70
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,506
Go.

71
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:10,846
No. It's okay. You can do it.

72
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,175
How do you do this?

73
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,346
This is impossible.

74
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:18,986
(Meanwhile, Uie takes the lead.)

75
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:22,756
(She passes the two-thirds point of the 1st staircase.)

76
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:26,586
(She keeps going up 2 stairs at a time.)

77
00:03:27,326 --> 00:03:29,626
(She becomes the 1st member to clear the 1st staircase.)

78
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,196
(Then comes the flatland section.)

79
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,065
(Since it's the flatland section, )

80
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,096
(Uie runs as she recovers her stamina.)

81
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,176
(She keeps running without stopping...)

82
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,506
(and enters the second staircase.)

83
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:48,416
(While Uie climbs up toward the endpoint)

84
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,175
Let's go.

85
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,685
(The member who was going last, Sae Rok, passes Ju Hyun.)

86
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:52,816
It's like a dessert.

87
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:54,256
All right. Run.

88
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,416
All right. Let's go. We need to keep going.

89
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,285
(Sae Rok begins to speed up.)

90
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,056
You need to compete against each other.

91
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,056
Let's try a bit harder. You're nearly at the endpoint.

92
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,236
(Uie is close to the endpoint.)

93
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:12,936
There you go. In Ah, let's go.

94
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,775
(In Ah, let's go?)

95
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,276
(In Ah, Uie)

96
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,205
(In Ah is close behind her.)

97
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,276
In Ah, that's good. In Ah is coming.

98
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,616
(When running on 2 feet gets hard, she crawls on all 4s.)

99
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:30,685
(The Simba Seol mode is on.)

100
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:31,985
(In Ah, Uie)

101
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,556
Uie, run until the end.

102
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,326
You're nearly at the end. Let's go.

103
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:37,695
She's coming.

104
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,896
There you go. Make a turn and come up to the finish line.

105
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,836
All right. Come up here.

106
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:44,336
There you go.

107
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,105
Okay.

108
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:47,165
Well done.

109
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,176
(Panting)

110
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:49,636
(Panting)

111
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,106
(She has exhausted her stamina.)

112
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,576
(Simba Seol is still going on all fours.)

113
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:55,676
(Groaning)

114
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,115
Come on. You're nearly done.

115
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:00,246
You can walk. Just don't stop. There you go.

116
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:02,285
Grit your teeth and climb up the stairs.

117
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:04,856
(Simba Seol never gives up.)

118
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:06,286
You're nearly done.

119
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:08,896
Okay. In Ah reached the finish line.

120
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:13,395
(Simba Seol passes out as well.)

121
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,766
I can't recover.

122
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,606
Let's run toward the end.

123
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:18,966
Run toward the end.

124
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:21,875
There you go. That's good.

125
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,735
Sae Rok, Ju Hyun is coming behind you.

126
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:25,046
(The last spurt)

127
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:26,205
Come on.

128
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:29,076
(The two of them don't stop until the very end.)

129
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,686
- Keep going. - There you go.

130
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:34,916
(Sae Rok: 6 minutes and 8 seconds)

131
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:36,616
- Keep going. - Okay. Well done.

132
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,325
- Keep going. - Ju Hyun, hurry up.

133
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,326
(Ju Hyun: 6 minutes and 12 seconds)

134
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:40,456
Okay.

135
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,896
(Collapsing)

136
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,566
Their facial expressions are real.

137
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,036
- That's a great record. - Well done.

138
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:50,866
- I'm exhausted. - Everyone did their best.

139
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,966
- Seriously, it was unbelievable. - They gave their all.

140
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:55,375
Seriously.

141
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,376
(Even Uie can't recover.)

142
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,475
I didn't expect it to be hard...

143
00:05:58,476 --> 00:05:59,706
- from the start. - I know.

144
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,776
I had confidence at first.

145
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:04,645
(The high-intensity training made her confidence disappear.)

146
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,916
Two sessions remain, so good luck.

147
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,115
You need to fight against your record.

148
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,586
- Okay. - Stay alert.

149
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,455
(Thus, they began to improve their stamina...)

150
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,555
Nice form.

151
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,896
(through the rigorous physical training.)

152
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:19,666
Faster.

153
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,696
One, two, hook, hook.

154
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,236
Keep the angles right.

155
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:31,876
(For 45 days, they focused on their physical training.)

156
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:34,146
(45 days later, June 29)

157
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,515
Didn't you guys miss this place?

158
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:39,185
- No. - It has been a month.

159
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,655
- Not at all. - We need to shorten our records...

160
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:44,115
by 1 or 2 seconds, right?

161
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:45,386
Just 1 or 2 seconds?

162
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:46,586
What?

163
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,825
- That's... - Captain, I did my best then.

164
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,666
- Uie did too well from the start. - Yes.

165
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,296
You can shorten it by 20 seconds.

166
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,036
- Did you say 20 seconds? - You can shorten it by 20 seconds.

167
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,705
- Get ready. - I'm scared that I'll do worse.

168
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:59,205
(The 2nd stairs training)

169
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,005
Let's go.

170
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,306
It's slippery.

171
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,306
You need to get used to it.

172
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:07,205
(Taking long strides)

173
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,346
Watch the stairs.

174
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:13,346
(Captain Uie gets ahead today as well.)

175
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,726
(The younger members follow her.)

176
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,126
(One member stands out.)

177
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,195
(During the 1st training, she groaned...)

178
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,936
(and fell behind as the weakest member.)

179
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:31,606
(After just 45 days, she runs without getting exhausted.)

180
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:36,036
(She's running next to In Ah who did well in the 1st training.)

181
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:41,245
(Uie continues to climb up 2 stairs at a time.)

182
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:44,485
(First staircase)

183
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:48,016
(So far, Uie has cut down her time by 10 seconds.)

184
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:53,626
(Uie speeds up and runs.)

185
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:56,596
(So far, In Ah has cut down her time by 5 seconds.)

186
00:07:57,656 --> 00:08:00,966
(So far, Sae Rok has cut down her time by 25 seconds.)

187
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,136
Let's pick up the speed.

188
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,866
Run as you shake your arms lightly.

189
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:07,806
Catch a breath.

190
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:11,546
(Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

191
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:15,616
(End, Uie, In Ah, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun, start)

192
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,845
(Uie is halfway through the second staircase.)

193
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,516
There you go. A bit more.

194
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:24,526
(Uie's 1st record was 4 minutes and 33 seconds.)

195
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,756
(She has less than 30 seconds left to shorten it even by 1 second.)

196
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:31,466
Let's give it the last spurt.

197
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,465
There you go.

198
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:37,566
(She must shorten her time even by 1 second!)

199
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,736
The last spurt. There you go. Well done.

200
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,676
Well done. There you go. Keep going until the end.

201
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,405
Okay. Well done.

202
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,576
(Uie completes the 2nd training.)

203
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:47,676
(Ju Hyun, Sae Rok, In Ah)

204
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:48,715
(The members arrive one after another...)

205
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,915
(as if they're proving that their effort hasn't been wasted.)

206
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,076
This is insane.

207
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,456
Okay. Well done.

208
00:08:55,856 --> 00:08:56,955
Well done.

209
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,656
(In Ah completes the 2nd training.)

210
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:04,025
Sae Rok, you're nearly done. Faster.

211
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,365
Sae Rok, you're nearly done.

212
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,426
There you go.

213
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,496
Let's shorten the time further.

214
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:09,536
Keep going until the end.

215
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,405
There you go. Well done.

216
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:14,266
(Sae Rok completes the 2nd training.)

217
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:18,475
Ju Hyun, you're nearly done.

218
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,506
Stop.

219
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,546
There you go. Well done.

220
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:23,716
Well done.

221
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:26,586
(She passes out right away.)

222
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:27,715
I'm exhausted.

223
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:30,055
(They used up every ounce of their energy.)

224
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,426
(Iron Girls are sprawled on the floor today as well.)

225
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:40,566
It isn't a good idea to lie down after reaching the finish line.

226
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:42,335
(Please stop.)

227
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,636
It's better to get up.

228
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:45,106
Get up.

229
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,536
Here's something to drink.

230
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:48,336
Get up.

231
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:50,176
It's really high-intensity.

232
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,446
How does it put people in this state in 4 to 5 minutes?

233
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:54,615
- Did it only take 4 to 5 minutes? - You know...

234
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,115
In Ah, you're sweating so much.

235
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:57,545
Isn't it water? It's water, right?

236
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,385
- No. - It has to be water.

237
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,546
Look at her nose bridge.

238
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:01,816
Look at her nose bridge.

239
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,855
There's sweat on her nose bridge.

240
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,525
I could feel that you guys did your best.

241
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:07,185
- All right. Uie. - Yes?

242
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,896
Your 1st record was 4 minutes and 33 seconds.

243
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,065
Your second record is...

244
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,196
four minutes and...

245
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,765
thirty...

246
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:15,896
Please.

247
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,635
Seconds.

248
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,266
(She shortened her time by 3 seconds.)

249
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:22,276
- Uie. - You shortened it by three seconds.

250
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,305
- Uie is crying. - Okay.

251
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,005
You shortened it by three seconds.

252
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,006
That's big.

253
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,415
In Ah, you came in 2nd. Your 1st record...

254
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,415
was 5 minutes and 22 seconds.

255
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,745
(1st record: 5 minutes and 22 seconds)

256
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,315
Your 2nd record is 5 minutes...

257
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:36,585
(2nd record: 5 minutes...)

258
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:37,686
and 13 seconds.

259
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,355
She came in faster.

260
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,956
(She shortened her time by 9 seconds.)

261
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,495
She shortened her time by nine seconds.

262
00:10:44,496 --> 00:10:45,666
(Simba Seol shortened her time by 9 seconds.)

263
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:47,796
- That's insane. - Nine seconds is impressive.

264
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:51,066
- Sae Rok, you came in third. - Yes.

265
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,466
- Your first record was... - Yes.

266
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,066
- six minutes and 8 seconds. - Six minutes and 8 seconds.

267
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,506
Your second record...

268
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:56,935
is 5 minutes and 33 seconds.

269
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,546
(She shortened her time by 35 seconds.)

270
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,805
- That's incredible. - Sae Rok, that's incredible.

271
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:03,175
- Hey. - She shortened it by 35 seconds.

272
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,385
See? She reached the finish line very quickly.

273
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:07,315
- That's incredible. - The members told me...

274
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,815
- that my stamina had improved... - That's right.

275
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:09,986
During practice.

276
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:12,285
But even when I heard those words,

277
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:17,196
I couldn't tell if my stamina had improved or not.

278
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:20,095
Even though I was far up on the staircase,

279
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,865
- I wasn't out of breath. - Right.

280
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,106
I was like, "What? Why can I keep going?"

281
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,365
"Did my stamina improve?"

282
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,876
I felt like I was going up with ease.

283
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,806
The fact that I have the strength to run...

284
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:34,406
- makes me happy. - That's right.

285
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,616
Sae Rok.

286
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:37,915
I told you that you had improved.

287
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,846
One person can't congratulate her from the bottom of her heart.

288
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,486
Park Ju Hyun.

289
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:43,656
Your first record was 6 minutes and 12 seconds.

290
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:44,926
Your second record...

291
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,825
is 5 minutes and 44 seconds.

292
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:49,496
(She shortened her time by 28 seconds.)

293
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:53,726
- Ju Hyun! - You shortened it by 28 seconds.

294
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,936
I beat the past me.

295
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,635
This is proof that you guys have worked hard.

296
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,576
- Well done, everyone. - Seriously.

297
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:04,105
- We've done so well. - Well done.

298
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:05,446
(All Iron Girls succeeded in shortening the time.)

299
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:09,216
(Afterward, they focused on boxing once again.)

300
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,445
(The first sparring)

301
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,245
(The second sparring)

302
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,916
(The third sparring)

303
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:21,326
(Then they participated in their first tournaments.)

304
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:23,826
(45 days later, August 13)

305
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,365
We're back.

306
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,865
- Okay. - It's for the stairs training.

307
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:31,235
In Ah needs to recover before the tournaments.

308
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:32,505
- She shouldn't push herself. - Ju Hyun has...

309
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,765
- an injury as well. - Yes.

310
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,235
Ju Hyun, you have bad knees as well.

311
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:37,775
The inflammation could get worse,

312
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,805
so I don't think you should do the training today.

313
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:43,415
You came here because you wanted to do it,

314
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,485
but please just time the members' performances.

315
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,846
- Okay. - Let's do that.

316
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:47,985
Okay.

317
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,656
All right. This is the last stairs training.

318
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:53,486
Get ready.

319
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:57,196
(The 3rd stairs training starts.)

320
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,926
(They go up the stairs quickly.)

321
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,265
(Sae Rok...)

322
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:06,166
(runs up two stairs at a time!)

323
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:11,976
(Her speed is similar to Uie's.)

324
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,676
How are they so good at this?

325
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:15,646
How are they so good at this?

326
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:21,916
I won't be able to keep up.

327
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,756
(First staircase)

328
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,826
(So far, Uie has cut down her time by 17 seconds.)

329
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:32,695
(So far, Sae Rok has cut down her time by 33 seconds.)

330
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:33,866
They're so fast.

331
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,036
(Panting)

332
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,465
I can't keep up.

333
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,606
(I can't keep up.)

334
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,336
(Running)

335
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:47,406
Uie!

336
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:52,816
(Uie can be seen between the trees in front of the second staircase.)

337
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,085
Uie!

338
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:55,785
No way!

339
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,256
(No way!)

340
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,626
(It hasn't even been 3 minutes.)

341
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:03,395
- Uie, the record is unbelievable. - This is incredible.

342
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,466
Uie, don't stop.

343
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:07,396
Hey, Uie!

344
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,295
(Ju Hyun cheers Uie on at the top of her lungs.)

345
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,305
(Uie)

346
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,536
(Advancing quickly)

347
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:19,176
(Uie goes up the stairs without hesitation.)

348
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:20,646
Is that Sae Rok behind her?

349
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,216
(Sae Rok is close behind.)

350
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,486
(She loses speech because she's so surprised.)

351
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,255
(Sae Rok is not far behind Uie.)

352
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:31,355
You've slowed down for the stairs.

353
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:32,856
(Checking the time)

354
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,455
Uie, you need to speed up.

355
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,856
You need to speed up a bit.

356
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:39,296
(Okay.)

357
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,796
- That's good. - Uie, hurry up.

358
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,236
- Uie, run for five seconds. - You'll make a record.

359
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,706
- Five seconds. - Keep going until the end.

360
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:47,435
Keep going until the end.

361
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,506
There you go.

362
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:51,775
(Uie completes the 3rd training.)

363
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:52,945
No way.

364
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,746
(Uie completes the 3rd training.)

365
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:59,446
Sae Rok, if you speed up, you won't regret it. Hurry up.

366
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:01,955
- Beat Sae Rok of the past. - Come on.

367
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,956
- Beat Sae Rok of the past. - Hurry up.

368
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,325
One, two.

369
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,255
- Run for five seconds. - One, two.

370
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,496
Eight, nine, ten.

371
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,496
- Hurry up. - You're nearly done.

372
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:11,765
- Come on. - You're nearly done.

373
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,565
- That's it. You're nearly done. - That's the finish line.

374
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,795
Go to the finish line.

375
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:15,866
This is incredible.

376
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:17,036
- Okay. You're done. - All done.

377
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,405
Okay.

378
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,105
(Sae Rok completes the 3rd training.)

379
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,235
- You know.. - Well done.

380
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:25,546
Until the halfway point, I couldn't keep up with Sae Rok.

381
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,375
- Really? - Yes.

382
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,876
(Sae Rok did her absolute best without stopping once.)

383
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,016
That's the sound you make when you're drained.

384
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:38,016
I'm exhausted.

385
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,426
(Groaning)

386
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,696
All right. The records are here.

387
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,626
You had the third session of the intense stairs training.

388
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:45,895
Uie,

389
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,366
your 1st record was 4 minutes and 33 seconds.

390
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:51,266
Your 2nd record was 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

391
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,466
All right. Here comes the third record.

392
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:55,575
It's four minutes...

393
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:59,845
(She shortened her time by 3 seconds between the 1st and 2nd records.)

394
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:00,905
and five seconds.

395
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:03,415
(She shortened her time by 25 seconds...)

396
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,115
(between the 2nd and 3rd records.)

397
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:06,385
Four minutes and 5 seconds.

398
00:16:06,386 --> 00:16:08,686
- She cut down 25 seconds. - My goodness.

399
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:10,655
- That's incredible. - You're lying.

400
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:11,726
You're lying.

401
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:14,025
The thing is, I know that it's true.

402
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,225
That record isn't a surprise.

403
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:18,025
She was like a monster down there.

404
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,466
(She cut down the time with monstrous speed.)

405
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:21,365
I could see you, Uie.

406
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:22,936
You looked like a branch.

407
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,435
I didn't think that it was you,

408
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:25,836
- but it was you. - Was it me?

409
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:27,436
We were at three minutes then.

410
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:28,775
It was insane.

411
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,175
- That was why I screamed so much. - Four minutes and 5 seconds.

412
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:33,706
Then I'm really curious about Sae Rok's record.

413
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,846
- What was up with you? - I...

414
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:37,116
Sae Rok,

415
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,445
your 1st record was 6 minutes and 8 seconds.

416
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:40,685
(1st record: 6 minutes and 8 seconds)

417
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:43,055
Your 2nd record was 5 minutes and 33 seconds.

418
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:44,215
(2nd record: 5 minutes and 33 seconds)

419
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:45,325
The last one, the third record...

420
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:46,885
(She shortened her time by 35 seconds...)

421
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,055
(between the 1st and 2nd records.)

422
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,855
is 4 minutes and 48 seconds.

423
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:51,195
(She shortened her time by 45 seconds...)

424
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,295
(between the 2nd and 3rd records.)

425
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:53,695
(Glancing over)

426
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,295
- All right. - You're lying.

427
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:57,265
It's true. I lay down and looked at the timer.

428
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,465
You're lying.

429
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,265
It's true. I lay down and looked at the timer.

430
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,605
- Really? - She cut down the time...

431
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:02,736
by 45 seconds.

432
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,076
- What? - Forty-five seconds.

433
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,876
So, 35 seconds and 45 seconds.

434
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,716
I feel like...

435
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:12,515
her record should be better...

436
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:14,715
- since she was so fast. - Really?

437
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:17,085
I can't believe I made it into the 4-minute range.

438
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,115
That's incredible.

439
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,625
- I'm proud of myself. - That's incredible.

440
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:21,355
- Well done. - Well done.

441
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,056
- I'm proud of you. - You worked hard.

442
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,725
Your hard work...

443
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,295
- didn't betray you. - I'm in the 4-minute rage?

444
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,836
Everyone, if you want to beat me...

445
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,836
It's the Iron Girls Challenge.

446
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,565
- Everyone. - You have to try it yourself.

447
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,236
Yes. Then you'll know how we feel.

448
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:43,976
(The Long-Term Training Project was a big success.)

449
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,586
(Also, )

450
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:50,686
(they did push-ups on the first day of the boxing training.)

451
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:59,626
(Ju Hyun couldn't bend her arms properly and kept trembling.)

452
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:07,005
(Even Stamina Queen struggled.)

453
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,276
(4 months later)

454
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,845
(Uie)

455
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:22,556
(The angle of her bent arms improved dramatically.)

456
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:26,025
(Ju Hyun)

457
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:33,996
(Their push-up skills improved along with their stamina.)

458
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,566
This is a feat for me.

459
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:39,805
This is a big improvement for me.

460
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,406
(She improved dramatically in 4 months.)

461
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:45,075
(And...)

462
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:49,976
(Sae Rok couldn't even do the basic postures before.)

463
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:55,486
(Our Sae Rok has changed.)

464
00:18:56,256 --> 00:19:01,556
(She maintains a straight posture without falling over.)

465
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:11,066
(After consistent training, she can do consecutive push-ups with ease.)

466
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:15,275
(Iron Girls have improved a lot.)

467
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,676
(9 days before the final tournament)

468
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:24,216
(In Ah's training log: Worn out after hard training)

469
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:27,885
(Sae Rok's training log:)

470
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,315
(The tournament is just around the corner. Pull yourself together.)

471
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:32,526
(Wait for the right time and throw a lot of punches.)

472
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,095
(Ju Hyun's training log: Even if my knees are burning, )

473
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:38,896
(I'll give it my all during the match!)

474
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,036
Take a break.

475
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,566
Is your wrist bad?

476
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,036
Yes. I got two shots,

477
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:47,866
but it's been feeling numb all day.

478
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:51,475
(Uie's training log: I can get my wrist treated after the match.)

479
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:52,845
(I'll think of it as a glorious wound...)

480
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,206
(and try my best without regrets.)

481
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:57,816
(Right before achieving their final goal, they can't stop here.)

482
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:10,726
(The day of the final tournament)

483
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:22,475
(The 4th Korea Sports Council President's Cup...)

484
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,506
(National Amateur Boxing Tournament)

485
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,246
(Finally, the day of the showdown)

486
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,515
(At 6am, Incheon Seonhak Stadium)

487
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:34,046
We've worked hard for today.

488
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:38,656
- Hello. - Hello.

489
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:41,455
- It's the big day. - It's finally the big day.

490
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:42,695
(Staring)

491
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,996
Did you come here by plane?

492
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,895
She looks like a pilot.

493
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,025
I drove here.

494
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:49,465
- You did? - She came here in a fighter jet.

495
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,765
- I'm in combat mode right now. - Good.

496
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:54,135
It's interesting that you have items like this at home.

497
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,806
Finally, today is the day...

498
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,306
of Iron Girls' second tournament and final showdown.

499
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:01,676
It's been four months.

500
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:03,946
You've prepared a lot for this day.

501
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,846
You've trained really hard.

502
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:07,146
How are you feeling now?

503
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,856
This tournament is different.

504
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:14,056
I want to show off what I've practiced.

505
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,755
Whether I win or lose, I'll keep going...

506
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:21,325
until I feel like I can't do better than this.

507
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:24,095
Ju Hyun is pulling off the boxing I like really well.

508
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,135
- Really? - Yes.

509
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,735
- She's incredible. - She's amazing.

510
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:29,335
I will keep throwing my one-twos...

511
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,235
and land more punches than my opponent,

512
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,106
even if I get hit a lot.

513
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,445
I'll clearly show people what One-Two Uie is like.

514
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:39,586
Then I will leave the ring without any regrets.

515
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:44,756
"I'm ready to take the hit." This means a lot.

516
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:46,455
- Right. -Those with that determination...

517
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:48,425
won't panic, no matter what happens.

518
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:51,096
- That's really scary. - Uie used to be afraid of punches,

519
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:52,725
but she has changed in four months.

520
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:53,726
- Yes. - Right.

521
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:54,826
I'm...

522
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:56,966
Silver Sae Rok.

523
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,866
- I'm Silver Sae Rok yet. - Right.

524
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,976
I'll try hard to win gold and become Keum Sae Rok.

525
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:06,005
Did you dream of becoming a soldier before?

526
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:08,545
You sound like a soldier when you give a speech.

527
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:09,846
She's so lovely.

528
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:11,775
Will you live up to your name today?

529
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,215
- Yes, I'll live up to my name. - All right.

530
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:14,545
You'll be Keum Sae Rok again after this tournament.

531
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,655
Yes. I'll get my name back.

532
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:17,715
- Okay. - Good luck!

533
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,256
In Ah. Actually...

534
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,485
I'm someone who's been knocked down once.

535
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:23,096
All that's left now is to get back up.

536
00:22:23,396 --> 00:22:24,695
(She's equipped with the determination of Simba Seol.)

537
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:26,425
I tell the other members to give it their all,

538
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,265
but I'll give you a different order.

539
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,765
- Don't give it your all. - I won't.

540
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,835
Just do it like you did...

541
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:31,865
- during practice. - I'll just try to have fun.

542
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:33,365
- I'm serious. - Right. Just try to enjoy it.

543
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,565
I'll think of it as sparring.

544
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:39,545
Good. Regardless of win or lose, just give it your all

545
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,316
and show what you've trained in the ring before you leave.

546
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,246
(Reaching out her hand)

547
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:48,545
- I'm hungry. - Are you hungry?

548
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:50,586
- I'm hungry. - Sure.

549
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:53,185
Ju Hyun says she's hungry.

550
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:54,285
She's been trying to lose weight.

551
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,456
I've never felt this hungry before.

552
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:58,556
- You've moved down in weight. - Yes.

553
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:01,225
Right. Your weight class has changed.

554
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,235
- Yes. - Right.

555
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:04,235
- How did it go? - I've been working out,

556
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:07,405
- Yes. - so I've been losing weight.

557
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:09,106
So I thought it'd be better...

558
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,905
to move down in weight and try my best.

559
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,546
That's what the coach and I discussed.

560
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:16,275
So I'm in the under-51kg division.

561
00:23:16,276 --> 00:23:17,775
Did you lose some weight then?

562
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,786
I've lost a little weight.

563
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:23,516
I've been eating chicken breast and brown rice for a few days.

564
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,425
I see. You managed to lose weight.

565
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:28,726
So I'm really afraid now.

566
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:30,695
- With the clothes on... - I know, right?

567
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:32,525
- Yes. - I know how it feels.

568
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,666
Right.

569
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,495
Ju Hyun is...

570
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,135
- in the under-51kg division. - The under-51kg division.

571
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:39,205
In Ah and Sae Rok are...

572
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,236
- in the under-54kg division. - The under-54kg division.

573
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,475
- Actually, we had another goal. - Right.

574
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:46,305
Uie's goal was to gain 1kg of muscle mass.

575
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:48,975
Sae Rok's goal was to lose body fat.

576
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,445
- Yes. - To lower body fat percentage.

577
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,216
Did you weigh yourselves?

578
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:54,315
Uie.

579
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:55,516
- Did you succeed? - You succeeded.

580
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,516
- Did you succeed? - Uie succeeded.

581
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,626
- I succeeded. - Really?

582
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,856
It's 24.1kg.

583
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:03,025
(Changes in Uie's body composition)

584
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,225
(Height: 172cm)

585
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,325
(A month ago, Weight: 52.4kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 22.9kg)

586
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:06,595
(A week ago, Weight: 52.5kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 24.1kg)

587
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:09,896
(Skeletal Muscle Mass: Plus 1.2kg, Body Fat Mass: Minus 2kg)

588
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:12,805
- It changed from 22.9kg to 24.1kg. - Yes.

589
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:14,065
That's not easy.

590
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:18,176
My body fat percentage has dropped by two percent.

591
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:20,046
And I've gained 1kg of muscle mass.

592
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:21,505
(Changes in Sae Rok's body composition)

593
00:24:21,506 --> 00:24:22,745
(Height: 169cm)

594
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:23,875
(A month ago, Weight: 53.2kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 21.9kg)

595
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:25,115
(A week ago, Weight: 53.4kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 22.9kg)

596
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:28,446
(Skeletal Muscle Mass: Plus 1kg, Body Fat Mass: Minus 1kg)

597
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,386
(Impressed)

598
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,125
That's amazing. Seriously.

599
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,055
- You've worked really hard. - Right.

600
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,325
And you've eaten well.

601
00:24:35,326 --> 00:24:36,995
Now, let's go in...

602
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,525
- and weigh in first. - We have to do this.

603
00:24:38,526 --> 00:24:39,565
Go into the stadium.

604
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:40,865
- Let's go. - Let's go.

605
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:42,166
- Let's go. - Yes.

606
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,896
(Congratulations on the Boxing Tournament.)

607
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,236
This is huge.

608
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:47,936
This is huge.

609
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:54,676
(Feeling nervous)

610
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,246
This is really big.

611
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,945
There's only one ring.

612
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,086
(A huge ring)

613
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:04,186
This is really huge.

614
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,756
This is the standard ring that professional boxers compete in.

615
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,425
(This is where the boxing tournament is taking place today.)

616
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,756
This is an amazing place.

617
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:15,366
This is the stadium where the Incheon Asian Games took place,

618
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:18,136
and where Shin Jong Hun won the gold medal in boxing...

619
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:19,366
in the Asian Games.

620
00:25:20,336 --> 00:25:23,106
The previous tournament was held in Seoul,

621
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:26,276
but this one is called the National Tournament.

622
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:27,746
It's a national tournament.

623
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:28,915
It's a national tournament.

624
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,715
(Like its name, boxers from across the country participate.)

625
00:25:30,716 --> 00:25:32,245
I'm so nervous.

626
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,916
(Like its name, boxers from across the country participate.)

627
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:39,855
(The final tournament venue for the history of Iron Girls)

628
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:41,926
This is really huge.

629
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,526
- Why are there monitors here? - Monitors?

630
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,366
Are there monitors?

631
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,336
(In front of the judges' seats)

632
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,266
(In front of the coaches' seats)

633
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,736
(There are monitors in front of the audience too.)

634
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:01,875
(Electric scoreboards that display scores from each round)

635
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,245
After Round One is over,

636
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:06,746
the scores are announced on the monitors.

637
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,516
- My goodness. - The judges' scores?

638
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,416
The coaches can see that.

639
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:13,225
And even the audience.

640
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:14,756
(The judges, coaches, and spectators can see the scores.)

641
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:16,295
After the first round is over,

642
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,256
you can see if you're winning or losing.

643
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,895
I don't want to see that.

644
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,025
(She can't breathe.)

645
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,635
I'm so nervous.

646
00:26:23,636 --> 00:26:25,335
(They feel even more nervous...)

647
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:27,036
(with the increased scale.)

648
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:28,336
This is where the boxers register.

649
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:30,376
I see.

650
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:33,546
(They leave their worries behind they register first.)

651
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,475
Affiliation, Iron Girls.

652
00:26:35,476 --> 00:26:36,846
(This is already their second time filling out the boxer ID.)

653
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:39,615
(They get their boxer ID issued...)

654
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:41,686
(and undergo medical checks first.)

655
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:43,785
Please go to the weigh-in room.

656
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,085
- Thank you. - Thank you.

657
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,286
- Take this. - Thank you.

658
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,656
- Weigh-in. - Now, finally...

659
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,556
- This is the important part. - Let's hurry and weigh in.

660
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:55,936
(This is a nerve-racking moment.)

661
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,366
- Next. Please come in. - Come in.

662
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,405
- Name? - Park Ju Hyun.

663
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,005
Yes. Show me your boxer ID.

664
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:04,236
We will take your weight. Please get on the scales.

665
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:06,106
- Here? - Yes. Please get on it.

666
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:07,705
Stay still.

667
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,346
(Ju Hyun must weigh under 51kg to pass the weigh-in.)

668
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,875
- It's 50.58kg. - It's 50.58kg.

669
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:13,415
(She passes with 50.58kg.)

670
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,415
- Yes. - You passed.

671
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,486
Get off the scales.

672
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:19,185
(She maintained her weight successfully.)

673
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:20,325
Good luck.

674
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:21,785
Yes. Please get on the scales.

675
00:27:21,786 --> 00:27:22,925
(In Ah starts the weigh-in for the under-54kg division.)

676
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:24,126
Stand still.

677
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:26,595
- It's 53.82kg. - It's 53.82kg.

678
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:28,066
Get off the scales.

679
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:29,765
(The weight from the previous tournament)

680
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:31,766
(Determined In Ah maintained her weight perfectly.)

681
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,006
(In Ah passed the weigh-in in an instant.)

682
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:36,136
(In the meantime)

683
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:38,076
- I'm so nervous. - Don't be nervous.

684
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,075
(She feels extremely nervous after taking off her shirt.)

685
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:43,216
I'm so nervous.

686
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:45,215
State your name, please.

687
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:46,645
- Keum Sae Rok. - Okay.

688
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:47,985
Hang on a second.

689
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:51,056
(Sae Rok's goal is to stay under 54kg as well.)

690
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,755
- It's 53.10kg. - Yes.

691
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,126
You passed.

692
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:57,755
(Sae Rok passed easily.)

693
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,266
- Bye. - Bye.

694
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:01,326
- Thank you. - Good luck.

695
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,565
State your name.

696
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,765
- I'm Uie. Kim Yu Jin. - Okay.

697
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,766
(And it's finally Uie's turn.)

698
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:11,505
(Uie must weigh under 51kg to pass.)

699
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:12,806
Please get on the scales.

700
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:14,306
Stand still.

701
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,945
(Her first attempt to lose weight)

702
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,386
(Did she succeed?)

703
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,185
It's 50.84.

704
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:26,955
(She passes with 50.84kg.)

705
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,726
- You passed. - Yes.

706
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:34,665
(It would've been close if she had kept her shirt on.)

707
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,196
Thank you.

708
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:37,665
Good luck.

709
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,795
(Sobbing)

710
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:41,336
(Uie succeeded in losing weight.)

711
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:43,136
I'm 50.8kg.

712
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:44,775
- I did it. - That was so close.

713
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,206
(Surprised)

714
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,276
Thank goodness you had your shirt off.

715
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:56,216
(She thanks her t-shirt too.)

716
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:58,585
We all succeeded.

717
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,626
- What should we eat? - What are we eating? Let's go.

718
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:02,555
You should recover.

719
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,956
- Eat something nutritious. - Let's eat.

720
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,196
(Amazed)

721
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:10,395
What's that?

722
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:11,836
(There's something on the table.)

723
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,865
- What... - What is this?

724
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:15,105
Gloves?

725
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,936
Are these glove rice cakes?

726
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,976
How did you think of this?

727
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:21,975
How did you make this?

728
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,275
It's so cute.

729
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:24,515
- They're so cute. - Seriously,

730
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:25,915
this is so thoughtful.

731
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,986
- How did they make them? - It's such a thoughtful gift.

732
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:30,455
- Let's eat and recover. - Thank you for the food.

733
00:29:30,456 --> 00:29:31,885
- Thank you for the food. - Okay.

734
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:32,925
Recover.

735
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:33,985
Cheers.

736
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,056
(Making a toast with gloves)

737
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:39,096
(Taking a pleasant bite of the rice cake)

738
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:44,736
(Uie, who has successfully lost weight, enjoys a hearty meal.)

739
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,805
(Ju Hyun, who was hungry, also takes a big bite.)

740
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:47,905
This is so delicious.

741
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:50,336
(Ju Hyun, who was feeling hungry, also takes a big bite.)

742
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,506
I'm feeling great now.

743
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,276
That's a relief.

744
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:01,146
A total of 280 boxers are competing in today's tournament.

745
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,915
Among them, 47 are female boxers.

746
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:09,026
They are divided into middle school, high school, 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.

747
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:10,696
There are even boxers in their 50s.

748
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,226
Today is the preliminaries,

749
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:14,125
and if you win this, you'll be in the finals tomorrow.

750
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:15,896
(Preliminary rounds today, final rounds the next day)

751
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:17,565
- This is a big competition. - They're divided into many groups.

752
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,465
(This is a big competition.)

753
00:30:19,466 --> 00:30:21,935
The round duration is different today.

754
00:30:21,936 --> 00:30:23,006
Let me tell you about it.

755
00:30:23,106 --> 00:30:24,975
Each round is 1 minute and 30 seconds.

756
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:26,205
And the rest period...

757
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,475
- was 40 seconds before. - It was 40 seconds.

758
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:28,845
In this tournament, it's one minute.

759
00:30:28,846 --> 00:30:30,316
(The rest period is 1 minute today.)

760
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:32,015
What?

761
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,186
That's enough time to have a meal.

762
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,185
You can even go to the restroom within the extra 20 seconds.

763
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,186
(They get an extra 20 seconds for the rest period.)

764
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:39,055
But I'm not the only one who can rest for one minute.

765
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:41,055
- The opponent rests too. - That's true.

766
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,285
That's not good.

767
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:44,126
Let's go back to 40 seconds.

768
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,725
Our strength is stamina.

769
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:48,666
That's my strength.

770
00:30:48,726 --> 00:30:50,166
You have to try harder.

771
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:51,866
- So the opponent can't recover. - Right.

772
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:54,536
I have to finish it in Round One.

773
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:59,706
Lastly, I'll tell you about the order of play.

774
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:02,146
The first boxer is...

775
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:03,476
Seol In Ah.

776
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:05,776
The match number is 12.

777
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,416
Park Ju Hyun. The match number is 14.

778
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:10,486
Uie is next. The match number is 15.

779
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:11,785
- Again? - Yes.

780
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,955
Our turns are all lined up.

781
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:17,196
Lastly, Sae Rok's match number is 17.

782
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,925
We can say you are fighting almost back-to-back.

783
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,025
Right.

784
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,195
- So... - Of course.

785
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,566
The coach will be really busy.

786
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:25,866
He almost has no time to take a break.

787
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:29,006
This is my second time...

788
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:31,506
participating in a boxing tournament,

789
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:36,346
and I'm fighting against the opponent whom I met again.

790
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,146
- What? - Right.

791
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:40,186
We're fighting again. Can you believe this?

792
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:43,556
(The match list was announced a week ago.)

793
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:46,555
(The name that is familiar to Ju Hyun...)

794
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,396
(is found on the match list.)

795
00:31:49,796 --> 00:31:52,896
(The final match of the last tournament)

796
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:57,036
(The very opponent who cornered Ju Hyun like a zombie)

797
00:31:57,536 --> 00:32:01,966
(She is facing the same opponent she fought so hard against...)

798
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:06,776
(in the preliminary match once again today.)

799
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:09,645
After I found that out,

800
00:32:09,646 --> 00:32:11,846
I've been seeing her face in my dreams.

801
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:13,386
I'm serious.

802
00:32:13,646 --> 00:32:15,145
It's random, isn't it?

803
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:17,616
It is drawn up randomly using the computer.

804
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:20,326
- Then how did this happen? - Actually,

805
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:22,856
I've fought the same opponent before.

806
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:26,666
There were 80 boxers entering, and I met the same opponent again.

807
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:27,895
- It happens. - It does.

808
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,135
- That's interesting. - You should accept the fate...

809
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,165
- and just fight. - Right.

810
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,366
(Even Ju Hyun, who is always positive, is feeling nervous today.)

811
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:36,436
(Now, it's time to accept their fate.)

812
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:41,276
(1 hour before the preliminaries)

813
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:45,476
(The opening ceremony begins in the stadium.)

814
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:48,816
(Ryu Seung Min, the president of the Korean Sports Council)

815
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:53,586
(The spectators are filling the seats.)

816
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:55,455
(The boxers change into their uniforms...)

817
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,056
(and start warming up 1 by 1.)

818
00:32:57,156 --> 00:33:00,696
(A fierce battle for the ticket to the finals)

819
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,766
(Iron Girls get ready to take the field.)

820
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:13,846
(Wrapping their hands with resolute determination)

821
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:20,216
(Finally)

822
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:27,886
(The preliminaries of the final tournament begin.)

823
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:34,126
(The battle in the ring begins once again.)

824
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:35,826
Again, one, two.

825
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,035
Good. Again.

826
00:33:37,036 --> 00:33:39,666
(It's time to prove their blood, sweat, and tears...)

827
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:43,176
(of the last 4 months on the ring.)

828
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:44,435
- Then you hit me like this. - Yes.

829
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:46,506
When you stand straight, it's not easy.

830
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:48,806
When the opponent hits you, you should lower your body.

831
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:50,916
You should lower your body like she does.

832
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:53,146
And two.

833
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:59,526
(For a match with no regrets)

834
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:04,125
(To defeat yesterday's me...)

835
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:07,896
(and today's opponent)

836
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,665
Let's go to the ring.

837
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:15,665
(Let's go to the ring.)

838
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,136
Stay calm.

839
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:21,875
(Iron Girls enter the stands on the 2nd floor.)

840
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,846
- Good luck. - Thank you.

841
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:27,045
(As they enter the stadium, )

842
00:34:27,046 --> 00:34:28,086
Let's do this.

843
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,615
(the tension intensifies.)

844
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,555
Gosh, it's hot.

845
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:33,086
I guess our acquaintances are sitting over there.

846
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:36,955
(Iron Girls)

847
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:38,756
(On the opposite side)

848
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:41,125
(The banners rooting for them are hanging on the opposite side.)

849
00:34:41,126 --> 00:34:42,495
(The fairy of the ring, Rocky Keum!)

850
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:43,765
(From Stamina Queen to Boxing Queen!)

851
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:45,136
(Every moment of our fierce fight is a champion.)

852
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:48,206
(Our cheer leader, Ju Hyun's father is present again today.)

853
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:52,076
(Today, not only the family and friends of Iron Girls, )

854
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:55,346
(but also the athletes who trained with them came to cheer them on.)

855
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:56,875
(Wrestlers: Kwon Young Jin, Park Hyeon Yeong)

856
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:58,815
(Former Special Forces soldiers: Kim Ji Eun, Yang Hae Ju)

857
00:34:58,816 --> 00:34:59,886
(Fitness athlete: Hong Beom Seok)

858
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:03,456
Where are our moms?

859
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,185
(Ju Hyun, I'm here.)

860
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:07,886
(In Ah's parents are here.)

861
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:10,126
Ju Hyun, let's send them a heart together.

862
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,466
(Seeing their parents, their tension melts away for a moment.)

863
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,065
Our dads are making a heart together.

864
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:19,096
(In Ah's father, Ju Hyun's father)

865
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:21,836
(Relax, girls.)

866
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:23,936
The women's tournament is about to begin.

867
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:27,876
(The boxers are waiting on the 1st floor.)

868
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:32,016
(So soon?)

869
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:36,886
(In Ah, who's fighting first, is extremely nervous.)

870
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,155
I'm scared.

871
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:39,985
(The members feel nervous too.)

872
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:41,126
It's okay, Uie.

873
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:46,226
(The last match of the men's tournament is over.)

874
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:53,506
(In Ah's match is drawing near.)

875
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,635
My turn is the match after next.

876
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:56,975
Should In Ah start warming up? Is she going now?

877
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,406
All right. Let's go.

878
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:00,675
(In Ah heads to the ring.)

879
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:01,776
Good luck.

880
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:06,986
(The members see In Ah off with trembling hearts.)

881
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:09,285
Let's do this.

882
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:10,515
(In Ah shakes off her fear and heads to the ring.)

883
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,855
- Thank you. - Good luck.

884
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:12,956
(In Ah shakes off her fear and heads to the ring.)

885
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,256
(10 minutes left before In Ah's match)

886
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:21,896
(In Ah enters the stadium.)

887
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:25,866
(She arrives at the glove room.)

888
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:29,435
(She has her clothing and hand wraps checked before a match.)

889
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,505
All right. Let's go.

890
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:32,376
(She has her attire checked before the match.)

891
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:33,745
Head.

892
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,045
(She puts on the headgear.)

893
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:36,106
Okay.

894
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,545
Just stay calm, okay?

895
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:40,315
- I'll have fun. - Yes. Just have fun.

896
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:41,616
Just do it like you're sparring.

897
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:43,786
Let's go.

898
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:46,285
I'll have fun today.

899
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:47,586
(She wants to enjoy this moment with a light heart.)

900
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:51,026
(And the opponent In Ah will fight against today)

901
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:54,966
(Tak Ye Won, 20s, under 54kg)

902
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:57,295
(Boxing experience: 7 months)

903
00:36:57,296 --> 00:37:00,266
(Taekwondo experience: 6 years)

904
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:02,636
Is In Ah's opponent strong?

905
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:04,375
- There. - There she is.

906
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:05,436
(They found the opponent.)

907
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:07,446
I'm not sure. She has long arms.

908
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:08,906
I think so.

909
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:11,215
I guess they're about the same height.

910
00:37:11,216 --> 00:37:12,715
(The opponent has a long reach.)

911
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,486
You get the feeling 30 seconds into Round 1.

912
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,355
Who did you come to root for?

913
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,526
- Iron Girls, of course. - Really?

914
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:23,095
In Ah is up next, so you should root for her together.

915
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:24,195
- Sure. We will. - All right.

916
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:25,496
(He successfully recruited a cheering squad.)

917
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:28,296
(The previous match is over.)

918
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,135
In Ah is up next.

919
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:31,496
(Finally, it's In Ah's turn.)

920
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,266
First, try a jab in the stomach,

921
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,735
give a feint,

922
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,636
and then a high-low combination.

923
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,376
Stomach, a feint, and a high-low combination.

924
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:42,346
Let's go.

925
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:44,045
She's coming.

926
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:45,816
(Seol In Ah steps up.)

927
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:52,116
Let's go, Seol In Ah!

928
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:57,355
(With everyone cheering, )

929
00:37:57,356 --> 00:38:01,196
(she steps into the ring.)

930
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:04,595
(Now all that is left...)

931
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:07,166
(is to give it her all.)

932
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:08,736
A lot of people are cheering her on.

933
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:12,306
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

934
00:38:12,636 --> 00:38:13,975
(Ju Hyun and Uie, who came down early, )

935
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:15,006
(also cheer for her.)

936
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,976
(To the center of the ring amidst the enthusiastic cheering)

937
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:20,786
Don't lower your head, and don't grab. Touch gloves.

938
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,445
- Back to your corners. - Good luck.

939
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:24,986
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

940
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,385
- Stay calm. - Seol In Ah!

941
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:30,226
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

942
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:32,725
(Preliminary Round, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Tak Ye Won)

943
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:36,165
(Round 1 begins.)

944
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,535
Good.

945
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:39,036
You can do this.

946
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:40,766
Let's go.

947
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:44,036
(In Ah's first body jab)

948
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,746
(They throw jabs at the same time.)

949
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:54,616
(In Ah throws a straight as she steps back.)

950
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:57,356
Circle around. Go back in.

951
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:58,856
In Ah, you got this.

952
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:01,456
Keep doing your footwork.

953
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,525
Circle around. Strike.

954
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,766
One, two. That's right! Circle around. Yes.

955
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:07,896
Nice.

956
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:09,736
(In Ah lands a straight while her opponent swings and misses.)

957
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:10,965
(In Ah follows up with a jab.)

958
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:12,536
(Dodges)

959
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:15,906
You're doing great.

960
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:19,945
(In Ah uses her quick footwork to keep her distance.)

961
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:21,206
Punch.

962
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:23,475
(In Ah lands a jab.)

963
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:25,616
Punch. That's it.

964
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:28,516
That's it. Good job.

965
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,755
- Nice. - KO.

966
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:32,456
(Blue Corner is given a standing eight count.)

967
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:36,426
(In Ah threw a powerful straight, )

968
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,455
(followed with a right hook.)

969
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:40,426
(The crowd goes wild.)

970
00:39:40,526 --> 00:39:43,036
(You go, In Ah!)

971
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:46,096
(That's my daughter.)

972
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:48,636
(Cheers erupting from all around.)

973
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:53,906
(The standing eight count begins for In Ah's opponent.)

974
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,416
(The referee checks the boxer's condition.)

975
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,616
Keep it up like this.

976
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:03,085
Give a feint. Yes.

977
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:04,456
(Remaining time: 30 seconds)

978
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:07,226
(In Ah evades and lands a jab.)

979
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:10,126
- You got this! - Seol In Ah!

980
00:40:11,356 --> 00:40:13,096
(They throw a jab at each other at the same time.)

981
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:17,136
Go up and down. Throw a hook.

982
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:18,496
Focus.

983
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,006
Yes. Again.

984
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:22,036
That's it. One, two.

985
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,606
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

986
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:27,476
Throw a punch. Throw it!

987
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:29,146
That's it.

988
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,946
(In Ah landed a clean right hook.)

989
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:34,685
That's it.

990
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:35,916
(She lands another right hook.)

991
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,116
(Round 1 ends.)

992
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:39,616
In Ah.

993
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:42,726
(1-minute break)

994
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:44,326
Sit.

995
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:46,255
Breathe.

996
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:47,796
You did great,

997
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:49,426
but you're backing up too much.

998
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,936
And everything you throw is landing, so keep throwing.

999
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,466
It would be even better if you throw a hook after.

1000
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,036
What did I tell you to do?

1001
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,805
- Jab, then a cross-counter. - Yes. Jab, then a cross-counter.

1002
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:57,835
And finish with a hook.

1003
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:59,775
- Jab, cross-counter, hook. - Yes. Finish with a hook.

1004
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:01,306
You're doing great. Great movement.

1005
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:05,976
(The Blue Corner also discusses their strategy.)

1006
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,315
Don't rush.

1007
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:10,055
You’re stepping in just enough for the opponent to strike.

1008
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:11,086
She's quick.

1009
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,785
Wait for her to attack, then land a double hook.

1010
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:14,956
It doesn't matter.

1011
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:17,996
Don't be intimidated, all right?

1012
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:22,426
(While the boxers prepare for Round 2,)

1013
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:26,066
(the judges tally up the points from Round 1.)

1014
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:29,105
Gosh, Round One is...

1015
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:31,436
(What is In Ah's score for Round 1?)

1016
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:34,975
(In Ah, Ye Won)

1017
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,045
(In Ah, her opponent)

1018
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:37,545
In Ah got ten points for everything.

1019
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:40,015
(In Ah wins Round 1, with 10 points for everything.)

1020
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:42,715
It's 10 to 9, 10 to 8, and 10 to 8.

1021
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:44,056
That's a huge difference.

1022
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:45,556
She's leading by a landslide.

1023
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,656
She's leading by a landslide.

1024
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:49,086
She's leading by a landslide.

1025
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:51,396
In Ah's confident,

1026
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,595
and she said she's feeling great.

1027
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:54,766
- She's doing amazing. - Yes.

1028
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:57,535
Seol In Ah, you got this!

1029
00:41:57,536 --> 00:42:00,866
(Will In Ah be able to carry the momentum through Round 2?)

1030
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:04,636
(Round 2 begins.)

1031
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,276
The vibe is good.

1032
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:08,906
You can tell she worked hard.

1033
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:12,215
- Seol In Ah! - You got this!

1034
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:15,186
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Tak Ye Won)

1035
00:42:17,456 --> 00:42:19,156
Yes.

1036
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:23,596
(In Ah lands a right hook.)

1037
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,665
That was nice.

1038
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,426
(She quickly evades her opponent's attack.)

1039
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:31,635
(In Ah waits patiently, watching for the right timing.)

1040
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,265
There's no need for In Ah to rush.

1041
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:35,335
It's her opponent who should be rushing.

1042
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:36,775
You got this!

1043
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:41,776
- Seol In Ah! - You got this!

1044
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,675
(She throws a jab in her opponent's opening.)

1045
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:46,985
(And then attempts a hook.)

1046
00:42:46,986 --> 00:42:48,115
Attack.

1047
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,216
She can't find her way in.

1048
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,516
That's it.

1049
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:52,055
Gosh, that was close.

1050
00:42:52,056 --> 00:42:53,925
More. Go short.

1051
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,126
You're doing great.

1052
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:56,956
Nice.

1053
00:42:57,256 --> 00:42:58,426
- You're doing great. - She can't find her way in.

1054
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,566
Try it. That's it.

1055
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:03,195
Move closer. That's too far.

1056
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:04,396
Keep going.

1057
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:07,636
(The opponent pushes her way in and lands a valid strike.)

1058
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:10,106
That's it. Nice.

1059
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:12,436
- Nice. - That's it.

1060
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:14,976
(A cross-counter)

1061
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,716
(The opponent strikes back with a double hook.)

1062
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:22,186
(Another cross-counter)

1063
00:43:23,756 --> 00:43:25,655
If you want to fight, she'll fight back.

1064
00:43:25,656 --> 00:43:27,556
- Seol In Ah, you got this! - You got this!

1065
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:30,926
- Seol In Ah! - You got this!

1066
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:33,566
(Stop)

1067
00:43:34,326 --> 00:43:36,096
(Listen for the stop signal!)

1068
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:39,296
(The referee warns the Blue Corner to keep her head up.)

1069
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:41,405
In Ah, do a high-low combination and a hook.

1070
00:43:41,406 --> 00:43:42,606
(Got it.)

1071
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:43,805
Fight.

1072
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:47,506
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

1073
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:51,176
(A high-low combination and a hook, just as she was coached)

1074
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,385
(Another high-low combination and a hook)

1075
00:43:54,386 --> 00:43:55,446
- Nice. - Nice.

1076
00:43:56,046 --> 00:44:02,025
(A high-low combination and a hook)

1077
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:03,426
Yes!

1078
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:05,495
(Round 2 ends.)

1079
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:06,525
You did great.

1080
00:44:06,526 --> 00:44:08,466
(Round 2 ends.)

1081
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:14,105
(Right after the round is over, cheers erupt from all around.)

1082
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:16,106
(Did you just see that?)

1083
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:17,635
Yes!

1084
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:20,306
(The Iron Girls cast in the cheering section go wild.)

1085
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:24,116
(Ju Hyun gives them a round of applause.)

1086
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,275
You did great.

1087
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:27,916
I did what you said twice.

1088
00:44:28,246 --> 00:44:29,316
Good job.

1089
00:44:30,486 --> 00:44:33,526
(They gather in the center of the ring for the results.)

1090
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:35,656
Thank you.

1091
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:40,596
(The most nerve-wracking moment)

1092
00:44:41,366 --> 00:44:45,196
(Everyone is quiet, waiting to see what happens.)

1093
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,106
(Blue Corner showed speed and tenacity.)

1094
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:50,476
(In Ah showed her powerful offense.)

1095
00:44:50,906 --> 00:44:55,246
(Which boxer will be going to the finals?)

1096
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:01,869
(Which boxer will be going to the finals?)

1097
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:14,349
(Seol In Ah wins.)

1098
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,089
(Seol In Ah advances to the finals.)

1099
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:20,049
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

1100
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:24,459
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

1101
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:29,159
(Even the crowd is in a festive mood.)

1102
00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:31,399
Okay!

1103
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:32,669
That's my In Ah.

1104
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:36,168
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

1105
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:38,139
- Seol In Ah! - Yes!

1106
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:42,408
Blue Corner, Iron Girls.

1107
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,508
- Great job. - Great job!

1108
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:47,049
(In Ah leaves the ring, overwhelmed with emotion.)

1109
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:54,459
(Ina overcame her injury and made an incredible comeback.)

1110
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,489
- Guys. - Good job.

1111
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,288
Give it your all. I'll be cheering for you, okay?

1112
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,358
(Uie and Ju Hyun are preparing for their next match.)

1113
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:01,399
Park Ju Hyun, you got this.

1114
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:03,729
- I wasn't even worried about you. - Fight in a jazzy style.

1115
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,328
Coach.

1116
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,138
(She quickly leaves, so Ju Hyun can focus ahead of her match.)

1117
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,638
- You were great. - We cheered for you.

1118
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,739
Thank you.

1119
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,439
I really did my best.

1120
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:18,309
(That's the best compliment she could give herself.)

1121
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,009
Rocky!

1122
00:46:20,149 --> 00:46:21,748
I'll be cheering for you really hard.

1123
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,919
- I love you. - Just fight like you’ve practiced.

1124
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,289
(You got this!)

1125
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:32,129
(The crowd congratulates In Ah.)

1126
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:34,059
Seol In Ah!

1127
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,599
- Captain Kim! - Sit here in the cheering section.

1128
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:38,229
I'm in the cheering squad now.

1129
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,898
- It's Ju Hyun. - Gosh, In Ah.

1130
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:43,268
Did you see me do a high-low combination and a hook?

1131
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,238
- Twice? - What happened out there?

1132
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,468
You were incredible.

1133
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:47,779
I gave it my all.

1134
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,509
(In Ah's win was solidified by...)

1135
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:54,149
(a perfectly executed high-low combination.)

1136
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,649
(This was the best moment in today's match.)

1137
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:01,019
You were really great.

1138
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:06,588
Of all the Iron Girl matches, yours was the most professional.

1139
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:07,898
- Captain, - Seriously.

1140
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:10,328
You told me I was going in too hard, and I should save up my energy.

1141
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:11,699
And I really took note of it.

1142
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,569
Boxing is so fun.

1143
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:14,939
It was amazing.

1144
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,038
(Ju Hyun is waiting for her match.)

1145
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,139
You got this.

1146
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:20,169
It's your fate. Just accept it.

1147
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:22,638
I was destined to become the Zombie Boxer.

1148
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,679
(She'll be face-to-face with the fighter from her past match.)

1149
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:26,279
I think you're the best. Seriously.

1150
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:28,179
Come on.

1151
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,888
(Ju Hyun arrives at the glove room.)

1152
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:32,919
Sit.

1153
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,789
I'm fighting against her again.

1154
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,599
(Ju Hyun is facing an opponent she fought in her first match.)

1155
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,629
(Lee Bo Ra, 30s, under 54kg)

1156
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:50,139
(She is the one who pressed Ju Hyun like a zombie in the first match.)

1157
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:53,468
(Ju Hyun won, )

1158
00:47:53,469 --> 00:47:56,239
(but it wasn't an easy match.)

1159
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,148
She might start as soon as the bell rings.

1160
00:47:58,149 --> 00:47:59,179
(She might start attaching as soon as the bell rings.)

1161
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,308
Prepare for that, okay?

1162
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:01,579
- Keep swinging the hooks. - Okay.

1163
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:03,989
I think I used...

1164
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:06,619
my arms a bit too much.

1165
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:07,659
Just now?

1166
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,089
It's okay.

1167
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,858
You warmed up enough.

1168
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,558
It could be better. Don't worry about it.

1169
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,799
(Coach Kim comforts Ju Hyun, who is anxious.)

1170
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,228
(She quietly waits for her turn, )

1171
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:22,199
(and tries to settle her mind.)

1172
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:25,639
The next match is from the women, 30s, under 51kg,

1173
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:29,239
Park Ju Hyun, of the Iron Girls.

1174
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:33,979
(Ju Hyun steps up.)

1175
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:37,748
(Calmly, as always, )

1176
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,219
(Ju Hyun heads to the ring.)

1177
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:42,889
- Ju Hyun, let's go! - Ju Hyun, let's go!

1178
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,728
- She saw us. - She saw us.

1179
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:46,829
She winked at me.

1180
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:56,699
(Ju Hyun gets on the ring.)

1181
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,709
Breathe.

1182
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:04,608
- Ju Hyun, it's nothing. - Park Ju Hyun!

1183
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,848
- This is... - Park Ju Hyun!

1184
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,478
- Park Ju Hyun! - Park Ju Hyun!

1185
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,548
Don't panic, and just relax. Take it easy.

1186
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:13,989
Just do as you always do, okay?

1187
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,518
If you keep close, she can't do anything.

1188
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,789
She doesn't have that experience.

1189
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:18,929
She's Zombie Fighter.

1190
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:20,899
She's an aggressive fighter who presses in.

1191
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:22,729
Ju Hyun, please. Let's go.

1192
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:25,229
Keep your heads up. No holding.

1193
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,568
Hitting below the belt is a foul.

1194
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:27,599
Shake hands.

1195
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:28,699
Step back.

1196
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,209
Ju Hyun, there's no reason to get nervous.

1197
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,008
Make a feint with a jab,

1198
00:49:35,009 --> 00:49:36,539
and two hooks. Okay? As soon as it begins.

1199
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,478
(Preliminary Round, Under 51kg: Lee Bo Ra versus Park Ju Hyun)

1200
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:45,219
(Round 1 begins.)

1201
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,788
Let's go, Ju Hyun!

1202
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,859
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1203
00:49:50,419 --> 00:49:51,729
- That's it. - Okay, nice.

1204
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,928
(Like the last match, the opponent presses in.)

1205
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,029
- Keep going in. - Stop.

1206
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,159
Stop.

1207
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,969
- Stop. - She's pushing too much.

1208
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,869
Red, no pushing with your head.

1209
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,368
(The opponent got a warning for keeping her head low.)

1210
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,369
She kept her head too low.

1211
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,609
She had her head on the opponent.

1212
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:07,108
- She was pushing with her head. - You can't do that, right?

1213
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:08,209
You can't push too much.

1214
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:09,938
Box.

1215
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,278
(The game resumes.)

1216
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:12,949
- Throw a punch. - That's it.

1217
00:50:13,649 --> 00:50:15,148
- Go in. - That's it.

1218
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:17,789
(Another valid jab)

1219
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:19,148
Good.

1220
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,888
(Ju Hyun makes use of her hit and defensive tactics.)

1221
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:21,989
- That's it. - Good.

1222
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,558
- She's coming in. That's it. - Once more.

1223
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,859
(The opponent charges in again.)

1224
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:30,059
(The opponent's right hook)

1225
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:32,028
Circle away. That's it.

1226
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,428
(She circles away.)

1227
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:35,468
(One, two)

1228
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,538
Good. Circle away.

1229
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:39,068
(The opponent presses in again.)

1230
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,109
Keep hitting.

1231
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:41,779
You need to use it.

1232
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,379
That's it.

1233
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,648
- Good. - Good.

1234
00:50:46,649 --> 00:50:47,748
(A slugfest goes on.)

1235
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:48,849
Circle away.

1236
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:51,089
(Ju Hyun's left hook and dodge)

1237
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,189
(The opponent's left hook)

1238
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:58,889
(A flurry from the opponent)

1239
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,528
Circle away.

1240
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:03,099
It's not easy for her to get out.

1241
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:05,369
She's fighting so hard.

1242
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:07,168
- Stay calm. - Park Ju Hyun!

1243
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:10,568
- Park Ju Hyun! - Let's go!

1244
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,639
(She got hit with a valid strike with her arm in lock.)

1245
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,008
(Jab)

1246
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,278
More! That's it! Yes!

1247
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:17,808
(Jab, right hook)

1248
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,509
You need to hit more. Don't back out too much.

1249
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,079
(Ju Hyun's jab, the opponent's hook)

1250
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:24,449
- That's it. - That's it.

1251
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,218
Ju Hyun, don't wait.

1252
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:28,219
Just go in.

1253
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,659
She's waiting too long.

1254
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:30,928
She's waiting too long.

1255
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,189
- That's it. - Stop!

1256
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,898
Don't hit the back of the head.

1257
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,228
Red, keep your head up.

1258
00:51:36,229 --> 00:51:37,569
- Keep your head up. - Box.

1259
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,499
- The head... - Stop!

1260
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:41,668
(Round 1 ends)

1261
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:43,299
Round One is over.

1262
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,609
What else can she do when the opponent keeps digging in?

1263
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:48,678
- She can't help but hit the back. - I know.

1264
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:49,839
The opponent has her head down.

1265
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,009
- She's going like this. - Yes.

1266
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,009
(They check the score for Round 1.)

1267
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,219
I see it.

1268
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,989
I can't tell with the first round.

1269
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,688
(What is the score for the intense Round 1?)

1270
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:03,119
(Bo Ra, Ju Hyun)

1271
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,988
(Opponent, Ju Hyun)

1272
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,159
Red is 10 and 9.

1273
00:52:08,399 --> 00:52:09,658
- She lost, right? - Yes, just by a bit.

1274
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,869
It's a bit tricky.

1275
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,628
It was a bit tricky, because she stepped back too much,

1276
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:15,599
and she only hit when she got hit. She shouldn't do that.

1277
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,138
After the opponent uses up her strength, she takes a rest.

1278
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:19,468
That's when she should go with a flurry of strikes.

1279
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,879
- She waited too long, right? - She just kept waiting.

1280
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:24,579
Breathe.

1281
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:26,709
Breathe.

1282
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:29,548
You're really doing great now,

1283
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:30,718
but you're getting hit by such easy strikes.

1284
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:31,848
When she makes a jab,

1285
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,448
- you can dodge to the side. - Yes.

1286
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:34,788
Then you have to attack right away.

1287
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,988
She keeps holding me, so I can't go.

1288
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,458
It's okay. Forget about that.

1289
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,988
After two hooks, dodge, and strike a one-two.

1290
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,798
Just do that. Do that, and you will win.

1291
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:42,999
- Okay. - Alright?

1292
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:45,999
Ju Hyun is also tense right now.

1293
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,998
She can't do anything other than reach a punch.

1294
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,399
She can't do anything if you press in.

1295
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:50,669
Just keep pressing in.

1296
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:53,009
As soon as they announce the ten seconds, just press in.

1297
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:55,509
You can do it. Okay?

1298
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,409
Deep breaths.

1299
00:52:58,609 --> 00:52:59,748
What are you going to do?

1300
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,648
Jab, dodge,

1301
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:02,848
- Okay. - and then a one-two.

1302
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:03,948
Just throw lots of punches.

1303
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,248
Throw lots of punches and dodge to the side.

1304
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:07,118
- Okay? - Let's go.

1305
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,688
Let's go, Park Ju Hyun!

1306
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,959
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1307
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,028
Jab, dodge, and a one-two.

1308
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:14,459
(Round 2 begins.)

1309
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:17,258
- Let's go. - Let's go, Park Ju Hyun!

1310
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:20,329
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1311
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,968
(As planned, jab, dodge, one, two)

1312
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,608
Just do that. That's it.

1313
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:26,768
Yes, just do that.

1314
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:27,808
(She continues on with jabs.)

1315
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:28,909
That's it.

1316
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,238
Good job.

1317
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,409
Hit more.

1318
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:35,519
- That's it. - That's it. You need to keep going.

1319
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:39,819
Here she comes. Punch. That's it.

1320
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,289
(After watching the timing, Ju Hyun attacks with a flurry.)

1321
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,759
(A strong jab)

1322
00:53:46,129 --> 00:53:50,099
(Two, one, two)

1323
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,799
(A finishing right hook)

1324
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:55,799
(Good job, Ju Hyun.)

1325
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,938
Again! That's it!

1326
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:01,778
(The opponent gets low again.)

1327
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:02,938
Stop!

1328
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,038
(She ends up losing her balance and falls.)

1329
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,049
(The opponent gets another warning.)

1330
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,619
Don't keep your head down.

1331
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,178
She got too many warnings.

1332
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,348
She got the same warning over and over.

1333
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:11,749
She needs to get points deducted.

1334
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,719
She keeps getting in trouble for having her head down.

1335
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:15,088
Box.

1336
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:16,859
(The game resumes.)

1337
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,859
- She's coming. - Hit!

1338
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:23,928
That's it! Good!

1339
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:25,528
She needs to strike more.

1340
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,768
More. I know you're tired, but more.

1341
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,869
(She keeps circling and throwing jabs.)

1342
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:30,398
More.

1343
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,539
That's it.

1344
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,709
(A one-two between her guard)

1345
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,338
- She's coming in. Hit one. - Let's go!

1346
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,978
(The opponent drives her to the corner again.)

1347
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:39,149
Circle away.

1348
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:43,078
(She tries to dodge by circling out, )

1349
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,619
(but the opponent keeps pressing in.)

1350
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:59,129
(Due to the opponent pressing in, it's hard to make a single punch.)

1351
00:55:00,299 --> 00:55:01,439
That's it.

1352
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:03,039
Hey, come on.

1353
00:55:03,569 --> 00:55:04,809
Hold it. That's it.

1354
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:06,209
That's it. Dodge out.

1355
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,309
That's it.

1356
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,138
She's using her head to...

1357
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,238
Don't push.

1358
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,149
(The opponent ends up getting a fourth warning.)

1359
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:14,919
Ju Hyun, cheer up.

1360
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:17,719
(Dodging after a jab)

1361
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:19,848
(A slugfest until the end)

1362
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:20,989
Stop!

1363
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:24,058
(Round 2 ends.)

1364
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,328
You did well, Ju Hyun!

1365
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:26,989
(Round 2 ends.)

1366
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:29,198
(Ju Hyun poured out all her strength.)

1367
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,298
You did well.

1368
00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:31,898
(Ju Hyun poured out all her strength.)

1369
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:32,929
You did well.

1370
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,598
- Sure. - Step back.

1371
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,499
(Now, only the results remain.)

1372
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,539
This is going to be hard to judge.

1373
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:42,579
She did get hit a lot at the end of the first round.

1374
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:46,349
(From the very start, Red Corner came in strong...)

1375
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:50,319
(by pressuring Ju Hyun with endless attacks.)

1376
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:52,789
(Ju Hyun displayed smart moves with hit and withdraws, )

1377
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:57,459
(and proved her skills in Round 2.)

1378
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,658
(Everyone outside the ring watches...)

1379
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,729
(with the same tension.)

1380
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:05,568
Please.

1381
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:07,199
No, Ju Hyun will win.

1382
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:13,139
(What will be the result of this intense match?)

1383
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:14,866
Please.

1384
00:56:14,867 --> 00:56:16,537
No, Ju Hyun will win.

1385
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:22,637
(What will be the result of this intense match?)

1386
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:28,147
(Red Corner wins.)

1387
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:32,247
(Ju Hyun loses.)

1388
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:36,187
Thank you.

1389
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:38,627
Thank you.

1390
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:41,797
You did well.

1391
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:44,426
- You did well. - You did well.

1392
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:46,596
- Good job. - Good job.

1393
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:47,937
Good job. It's okay.

1394
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:52,307
(Ju Hyun leaves the stadium despite the regrets.)

1395
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:54,037
Good job.

1396
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,176
Good job.

1397
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:58,447
(Endless applause to Ju Hyun who did her best)

1398
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,077
- Thank you. - And now...

1399
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:02,917
I had a lot of regrets.

1400
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:06,887
I didn't get to show everything I learned.

1401
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:09,387
That's what I regret.

1402
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:12,127
But when I lost,

1403
00:57:12,587 --> 00:57:14,227
I was actually glad that I lost.

1404
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:17,056
All that I've done,

1405
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:18,997
getting hurt and being in pain,

1406
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:21,237
and everyone who helped me came to my mind.

1407
00:57:22,337 --> 00:57:26,937
(Everyone who cheered for Ju Hyun)

1408
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:29,507
As I overcame this fear,

1409
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,277
I gave my all.

1410
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:34,417
I think it was a good experience.

1411
00:57:35,317 --> 00:57:37,716
So I'm satisfied.

1412
00:57:37,717 --> 00:57:39,517
(Because she gave her all, she has no regrets.)

1413
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:42,017
- Thank you. - Good work.

1414
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:44,657
(Ju Hyun leaves the stadium with relief.)

1415
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:47,526
- Good job. - Thank you.

1416
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:49,657
(The audience cheers Ju Hyun up.)

1417
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:52,097
Good job, Park Ju Hyun.

1418
00:57:52,227 --> 00:57:53,727
- Keep it up. - Thank you.

1419
00:57:56,337 --> 00:57:58,936
(And...)

1420
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:00,136
Ju Hyun.

1421
00:58:00,137 --> 00:58:02,937
(she finally meets In Ah and Captain Kim.)

1422
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:06,246
- It was... - You were amazing.

1423
00:58:06,247 --> 00:58:07,746
All your double hooks were accurate.

1424
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:09,516
If you gave your all in the last ten seconds...

1425
00:58:09,517 --> 00:58:10,776
in Round Two,

1426
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:13,217
the judges would've moved. It's a bummer.

1427
00:58:14,047 --> 00:58:16,616
- Good job. You were amazing. - Her punches were strong.

1428
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:20,027
- Let's go. One-Two Uie. - Let's go!

1429
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:23,127
(Next is Uie's match.)

1430
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:26,796
(The extreme tension...)

1431
00:58:26,797 --> 00:58:30,937
(makes her want to retch.)

1432
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:36,877
I always try my best to watch my members.

1433
00:58:37,377 --> 00:58:40,147
But at the time, I couldn't see anything.

1434
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:41,747
I barely remember it.

1435
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:49,687
(She moves to the glove room full of tension.)

1436
00:58:50,387 --> 00:58:52,827
Let's put it on.

1437
00:58:53,057 --> 00:58:55,396
- Does it fit? How is it? - Yes.

1438
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:58,167
(Putting on the head gear and the gloves)

1439
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:06,467
(Glancing)

1440
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:10,177
(Yun Bo Ra, 30s, under 51kg)

1441
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:12,306
(Boxing experience)

1442
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:17,017
(1 year and 5 months)

1443
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:20,387
(Uie also stands up.)

1444
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:22,957
As if you're playing. Try a one-two again.

1445
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:24,926
Jab. Keep your guard up.

1446
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:25,927
(Extreme mind game even before the start)

1447
00:59:25,928 --> 00:59:27,897
One-two. And the hook.

1448
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:29,457
That's right.

1449
00:59:29,727 --> 00:59:32,997
(Uie sets off.)

1450
00:59:34,497 --> 00:59:39,607
(It's time to enter the ring.)

1451
00:59:42,937 --> 00:59:46,276
(Despite the tension, )

1452
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:52,187
(she moves forward.)

1453
00:59:53,647 --> 01:00:01,057
(The unavoidable head-on match)

1454
01:00:01,427 --> 01:00:03,096
Go, Kim Uie.

1455
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:05,126
- Go! - You can do it!

1456
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:07,166
- Go, Kim Uie! - Go, Kim Uie!

1457
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:08,796
- Uie! - Uie!

1458
01:00:08,797 --> 01:00:11,807
- Uie! - Yun Bo Ra!

1459
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:15,137
Yun Bo Ra!

1460
01:00:15,707 --> 01:00:18,277
(The stadium heats up.)

1461
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:19,947
- You've worked hard until now. - Yun Bo Ra!

1462
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:22,176
Just do your best today. Imagine this is sparring.

1463
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:23,616
- No need to be intimidated. - Yes.

1464
01:00:23,617 --> 01:00:25,146
- Go, Uie! - Come forward.

1465
01:00:25,147 --> 01:00:27,316
- Uie! - Go, Yun Bo Ra.

1466
01:00:27,317 --> 01:00:29,387
Don't drop your head.

1467
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:30,987
Don't grab each other.

1468
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:32,786
Keep it above the belt.

1469
01:00:32,787 --> 01:00:34,186
Shake hands.

1470
01:00:34,187 --> 01:00:37,096
- Yun Bo Ra! - Yun Bo Ra!

1471
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:40,166
- Uie, just keep calm. Okay? - Yun Bo Ra!

1472
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,467
This is only sparring. It's okay.

1473
01:00:43,267 --> 01:00:46,066
(Round 1, Under 51kg: Yun Bo Ra versus Uie)

1474
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:48,376
Bo Ra, keep it long. The left hook.

1475
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:50,007
Body. That's right!

1476
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:52,606
That's right. Good job!

1477
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,306
You got it. Yes!

1478
01:00:54,307 --> 01:00:56,117
(Stop)

1479
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:58,317
(The Red Corner is warned.)

1480
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:00,686
She hit with this.

1481
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:02,716
She hit with the open blow.

1482
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:04,886
The opponent has a strong punch.

1483
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:06,987
It's considered cheating because it was an open blow.

1484
01:01:08,557 --> 01:01:10,557
(The game resumes.)

1485
01:01:12,397 --> 01:01:13,896
You got it. Yes!

1486
01:01:13,897 --> 01:01:16,937
(Uie's flurry of one-twos)

1487
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:18,107
Yes!

1488
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:22,636
(Uie's one-two versus the opponent's low)

1489
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,807
Uie, focus on that. That's good.

1490
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:27,307
You're punching her every time. Good job.

1491
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,917
- Kim Uie! - Kim Uie!

1492
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:33,847
(The opponent's swinging hook is wide.)

1493
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:35,087
Stop.

1494
01:01:35,787 --> 01:01:38,127
(Red Corner is warned again for the open blow.)

1495
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:39,587
- Box. - Kim Uie!

1496
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,457
- Go, Yun Bo Ra. - Uie!

1497
01:01:41,797 --> 01:01:43,397
- Good job. - Good.

1498
01:01:43,997 --> 01:01:45,227
You got it!

1499
01:01:46,027 --> 01:01:47,067
Fight back.

1500
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:48,767
Punch. Yes!

1501
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:51,537
Fight back. Yes. Fight back again.

1502
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:54,236
(Uie's flurry of one-two again)

1503
01:01:54,237 --> 01:01:55,307
Keep it up.

1504
01:01:56,177 --> 01:01:58,106
Keep it up. Fight back. Yes!

1505
01:01:58,107 --> 01:02:00,476
(As the opponent continues to try a hook...)

1506
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:02,147
Just focus on that. Yes.

1507
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:03,647
Yes!

1508
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:05,346
Again. Yes. Keep going.

1509
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,816
(She fights back with infinite one-two.)

1510
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:09,187
Like a submachine gun.

1511
01:02:09,387 --> 01:02:10,416
(Uie's valid strike 1)

1512
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,786
(Uie's valid strike 2)

1513
01:02:11,787 --> 01:02:13,486
(Uie's valid strike 3)

1514
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:15,656
(Uie's valid strike 4)

1515
01:02:15,657 --> 01:02:17,396
(Uie's valid strike 5)

1516
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:20,426
(Uie's valid strike 6)

1517
01:02:20,427 --> 01:02:21,466
(Uie's valid strike 7)

1518
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:23,067
(Uie's valid strike 8)

1519
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:26,767
- Kim Uie! - You can do it!

1520
01:02:26,967 --> 01:02:31,407
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

1521
01:02:33,107 --> 01:02:35,947
(A valid one-two strike when the opponent tries a hook)

1522
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,086
Punch. Yes!

1523
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,147
(Round 1 ends.)

1524
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:43,357
Sit.

1525
01:02:44,987 --> 01:02:46,956
Every one-two you tried worked.

1526
01:02:46,957 --> 01:02:48,027
- Was it good? - Right?

1527
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,056
You did great. Just keep it going.

1528
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,827
- It's nothing hard. That's it. - Yes.

1529
01:02:52,627 --> 01:02:53,766
- Okay? - Yes.

1530
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:54,867
Breathe.

1531
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:58,267
(Meanwhile, in the Red Corner)

1532
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:00,567
Check the score.

1533
01:03:01,107 --> 01:03:04,377
(Checking the score)

1534
01:03:06,547 --> 01:03:09,417
(Uie won Round 1.)

1535
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:11,647
- She's winning. - Totally.

1536
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:14,047
Oh, that's a relief.

1537
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:16,256
You're doing great.

1538
01:03:16,257 --> 01:03:18,156
If you can, circle around and try a one-two.

1539
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:19,157
Try a feint.

1540
01:03:19,158 --> 01:03:20,486
Give a feint and punch her when she approaches.

1541
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:23,396
And try a two when the opponent tries a jab.

1542
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:25,526
- Then try to punch her, okay? - Yes.

1543
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:27,867
Give your lead hand and wait for the opponent's jab.

1544
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,766
You're only trying one-twos. Your face is unguarded.

1545
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:32,406
Punch. Okay?

1546
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:35,206
Do your footwork and punch.

1547
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:37,776
Go for the low-high. Okay?

1548
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:40,047
Give a feint. Don't be intimidated.

1549
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:43,417
- Uie! - Uie!

1550
01:03:44,847 --> 01:03:46,886
(Round 2 begins.)

1551
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:48,287
- Uie! - Uie!

1552
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:50,087
(Uie tries one-two first.)

1553
01:03:50,857 --> 01:03:51,956
Punch. That's right.

1554
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:53,327
(The opponent fights back with the right hook.)

1555
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:55,456
Yes.

1556
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,857
(Followed by a slugfest)

1557
01:03:58,827 --> 01:04:00,166
Good job. Keep trying one-twos.

1558
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,267
Punch. Yes!

1559
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:02,766
Good job. Again.

1560
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:03,767
(The opponent fights back with a hook.)

1561
01:04:03,768 --> 01:04:05,067
You saw her hook.

1562
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:07,737
Jab and punch. Yes. Good job.

1563
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:10,076
(After the one-two, )

1564
01:04:10,077 --> 01:04:11,907
(she tries a left hook.)

1565
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:15,816
Let's go. One-Two Uie!

1566
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:17,077
- Let's go! - You can do it!

1567
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:19,347
(Stop)

1568
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:21,117
(Red Corner is warned for the third time.)

1569
01:04:21,187 --> 01:04:22,187
Time out.

1570
01:04:23,357 --> 01:04:26,527
(The game stops.)

1571
01:04:26,557 --> 01:04:28,327
(Iron Girls, give your fiery punch!)

1572
01:04:29,197 --> 01:04:32,426
(Uie waits in the neutral corner.)

1573
01:04:32,427 --> 01:04:34,397
- Uie, stay there. - Go, Kim Uie.

1574
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:36,367
Put your hair in.

1575
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:39,206
- Because it's blocking your view. - Uie!

1576
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:42,107
(The head referee helps her organize her hair.)

1577
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:46,207
(Waiting for the head referee's direction)

1578
01:04:46,777 --> 01:04:49,217
(Red Corner is ready.)

1579
01:04:49,247 --> 01:04:50,417
You can do it!

1580
01:04:50,777 --> 01:04:52,947
(The match resumes.)

1581
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:54,687
(The opponent's big right hook)

1582
01:04:56,887 --> 01:05:00,056
(Accurate one-two right on time)

1583
01:05:00,057 --> 01:05:01,257
Yes!

1584
01:05:02,627 --> 01:05:03,697
Yes.

1585
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:06,097
Nice.

1586
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,567
(The opponent's right hook again)

1587
01:05:08,997 --> 01:05:10,067
Stop.

1588
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:12,507
(Red Corner is warned for dropping her head.)

1589
01:05:13,907 --> 01:05:15,637
(The match resumes.)

1590
01:05:16,707 --> 01:05:18,977
Give a jab and punch! Yes!

1591
01:05:19,107 --> 01:05:20,607
Yes. Focus on that!

1592
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:23,217
(A series of large hook from the opponent)

1593
01:05:24,117 --> 01:05:25,387
(Stop)

1594
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:28,856
(Red Corner is warned for the open blow again.)

1595
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:29,857
Box.

1596
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:31,057
(The match resumes.)

1597
01:05:32,587 --> 01:05:34,797
She's approaching. Be careful.

1598
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,457
- Back. - Yes.

1599
01:05:36,897 --> 01:05:38,796
Yes. Good job. Punch.

1600
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:40,527
Throw a one-two.

1601
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,366
Punch! Yes!

1602
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:44,836
(The last slugfest)

1603
01:05:44,837 --> 01:05:45,907
Nice.

1604
01:05:46,137 --> 01:05:48,437
Yes. Good job.

1605
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:51,177
Feint. Yes.

1606
01:05:54,347 --> 01:05:55,717
- Good job. - Really?

1607
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:58,686
(The audience sends applause...)

1608
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:00,686
(to the boxers who did their best.)

1609
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:02,356
Good job, Kim Uie!

1610
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:03,516
Good job, Yun Bo Ra.

1611
01:06:03,517 --> 01:06:06,157
(Uie did her best with the one-twos.)

1612
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:10,026
(It's time for the objective judgment.)

1613
01:06:10,027 --> 01:06:11,327
Look forward.

1614
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:21,306
(Everyone becomes quiet...)

1615
01:06:21,307 --> 01:06:24,977
(and waits for the result.)

1616
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:34,517
(Uie wins.)

1617
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:36,787
Thank you.

1618
01:06:37,457 --> 01:06:42,027
(Even the audience finds the joy of victory thrilling.)

1619
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,167
(Uie advances to the finals.)

1620
01:06:45,497 --> 01:06:46,727
Thank you.

1621
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:49,196
(Uie's sports high school senior)

1622
01:06:49,197 --> 01:06:50,336
Good job. Keep it up.

1623
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:51,467
Thank you.

1624
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,637
Good job.

1625
01:06:53,107 --> 01:06:55,036
- Good job. - Gosh.

1626
01:06:55,037 --> 01:06:56,106
(Now, Uie can leave the ring with a smile.)

1627
01:06:56,107 --> 01:06:57,236
Good job, but...

1628
01:06:57,237 --> 01:06:58,306
I was...

1629
01:06:58,307 --> 01:06:59,476
You seemed to be a little nervous...

1630
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:00,606
- Yes. - because it was your first day.

1631
01:07:00,607 --> 01:07:01,816
- It was my first preliminary round. - Let's do better tomorrow.

1632
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:02,817
- Okay? - Yes.

1633
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,147
- Let's do better tomorrow. - Yes.

1634
01:07:04,747 --> 01:07:07,347
(Sighing in relief and joy)

1635
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,087
(Stops)

1636
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:12,626
Let's go quickly, so I can root for Sae Rok.

1637
01:07:12,627 --> 01:07:13,926
(Let's go quickly, so I can root for Sae Rok.)

1638
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:15,026
Good job.

1639
01:07:15,027 --> 01:07:20,027
(With noticeably lighter steps, )

1640
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,426
Hey.

1641
01:07:21,427 --> 01:07:22,636
(she faces the members.)

1642
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:23,637
Uie, come here.

1643
01:07:23,638 --> 01:07:27,036
- You were amazing. - Really?

1644
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:28,137
She's doing great.

1645
01:07:28,707 --> 01:07:32,147
(The last player is Sae Rok.)

1646
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:36,347
(Tension sweeps in.)

1647
01:07:37,347 --> 01:07:40,186
(She must make her 4 months of effort worthwhile in 3 minutes.)

1648
01:07:40,187 --> 01:07:41,757
Keep calm.

1649
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:44,317
(Glancing)

1650
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:49,297
(Kim Yu Jeong, 30s, under 54kg)

1651
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:55,067
(Boxing experience: 5 months)

1652
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:58,967
(She must win to advance to the finals.)

1653
01:07:59,237 --> 01:08:02,837
(Sae Rok is calmly setting her mind.)

1654
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:05,407
- Let's go, Keum Sae Rok! - Let's go, Keum Sae Rok!

1655
01:08:05,977 --> 01:08:07,707
Oh, Sae Rok.

1656
01:08:09,177 --> 01:08:12,487
(She worked hard in the past 4 months.)

1657
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:15,387
- Go, Keum Sae Rok! - Let's go!

1658
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:22,797
(It's time to prove her effort.)

1659
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,227
Sae Rok.

1660
01:08:28,197 --> 01:08:30,196
A two and a hook, okay?

1661
01:08:30,197 --> 01:08:32,907
After the two and hook, what matters the most?

1662
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:34,906
Keep your lead hand forward, so she can't hit you, okay?

1663
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,076
This is not a big deal.

1664
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:37,837
(The coach cheers her up until the end.)

1665
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:41,307
(Sae Rok finally enters the ring.)

1666
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,286
Mouthguard.

1667
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:49,057
(The head referee checks her gear before the game.)

1668
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:52,686
Keep calm. When Round One begins,

1669
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:55,756
give a feint, and walk and punch.

1670
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,926
Punch.

1671
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:58,157
Let's try that.

1672
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,597
Number one.

1673
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:02,937
Focus on the hook, okay?

1674
01:09:02,997 --> 01:09:05,767
(The opponent also gets her gear checked.)

1675
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:06,967
Keep calm in Round One.

1676
01:09:07,037 --> 01:09:08,107
You can do it.

1677
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:11,306
- Let's go, Sae Rok! - Stand here.

1678
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:13,477
- Let's go! - Don't drop your head.

1679
01:09:13,507 --> 01:09:15,216
You cannot hit the back of the head.

1680
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:16,777
No holding. No below.

1681
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:18,787
Bow.

1682
01:09:19,217 --> 01:09:20,287
To your corners.

1683
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,556
Okay. Sae Rok. You can do it.

1684
01:09:23,557 --> 01:09:25,156
- Let's go, Keum Sae Rok! - Let's go, Keum Sae Rok!

1685
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:26,956
(Round 1 begins.)

1686
01:09:26,957 --> 01:09:31,996
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Yu Jeong)

1687
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:34,026
(Sae Rok tries to attack first.)

1688
01:09:34,027 --> 01:09:35,067
Yes.

1689
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:36,197
(She throws a one-two-one.)

1690
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,036
Yes. Punch. Good.

1691
01:09:38,037 --> 01:09:39,367
She can't hit you at all.

1692
01:09:39,607 --> 01:09:40,766
Good job. Yes.

1693
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,377
- Number 1. - Number 1.

1694
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:44,507
(Sae Rok's accurate straight)

1695
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:48,317
(A series of one-twos)

1696
01:09:48,677 --> 01:09:49,916
- You're doing great. - Number two.

1697
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,377
- Number two. - You're amazing. Just keep it up.

1698
01:09:53,187 --> 01:09:55,917
(Attacking and dodging)

1699
01:09:56,617 --> 01:10:00,327
(Due to Sae Rok's long reach, the opponent's attack doesn't work.)

1700
01:10:01,187 --> 01:10:02,456
Jab.

1701
01:10:02,457 --> 01:10:04,297
- Go. - It's your chance. Yes!

1702
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:05,696
(Dodging the opponent's one-two attack)

1703
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:07,627
Good. Yes.

1704
01:10:09,037 --> 01:10:10,466
(Sae Rok's valid strike 1)

1705
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:13,206
(Sae Rok's valid strike 2)

1706
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:16,806
(Sae Rok's valid strike 3)

1707
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:19,506
(Sae Rok's valid strike 4)

1708
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,016
(Sae Rok's valid strike 5)

1709
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,017
Nice hook.

1710
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,547
Keep it up.

1711
01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:26,847
She's approaching. Watch carefully.

1712
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:28,687
She's approaching. Fight back.

1713
01:10:28,787 --> 01:10:30,487
Fight back. Yes!

1714
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:33,057
Yes. Fight back.

1715
01:10:33,058 --> 01:10:35,127
(Sae Rok keeps a distance and continues to gather valid strikes.)

1716
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:37,497
(Sae Rok's straight jab)

1717
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:40,427
(A series of one-two-one)

1718
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:42,496
Yes!

1719
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:43,567
- Circle around. - The lead hand.

1720
01:10:43,997 --> 01:10:46,306
(Sae Rok keep her lead hand up, )

1721
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:48,837
(looking for her chance without a break.)

1722
01:10:51,307 --> 01:10:53,477
- Punch! - Yes. Good job.

1723
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,817
- The lead hand. - Keep calm.

1724
01:10:57,117 --> 01:10:59,017
Punch. Try it.

1725
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,787
- Block. Yes! - Yes!

1726
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,017
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

1727
01:11:04,357 --> 01:11:05,957
Yes. Good job.

1728
01:11:06,527 --> 01:11:07,856
(The last flurry of one-two)

1729
01:11:07,857 --> 01:11:10,027
You're doing great.

1730
01:11:10,397 --> 01:11:11,827
That's awesome. Yes!

1731
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:13,027
Stop.

1732
01:11:13,497 --> 01:11:19,307
(She makes endless valid strikes to the end.)

1733
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:20,766
Stop.

1734
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:22,136
(Round 1 ends.)

1735
01:11:22,137 --> 01:11:23,836
Good job!

1736
01:11:23,837 --> 01:11:24,936
Okay.

1737
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:26,007
It's all about confidence.

1738
01:11:27,347 --> 01:11:30,247
(Tallying the points for Round 1)

1739
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:34,017
(What's the result of Round 1?)

1740
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:36,957
(Sae Rok won in Round 1.)

1741
01:11:37,057 --> 01:11:38,526
She swept Round One.

1742
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,226
Sae Rok!

1743
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:42,526
(Cheering as loud as they can for their proud Sae Rok)

1744
01:11:42,527 --> 01:11:43,697
- Sae Rok! - Good job.

1745
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:45,797
You're doing great.

1746
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:47,167
You're punching the opponent every time.

1747
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:49,037
Every one-two you tried worked.

1748
01:11:49,367 --> 01:11:50,466
You know what I mean?

1749
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:54,106
If the opponent tries a jab, hit two on that timing.

1750
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:55,576
Do you remember this?

1751
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,677
Just focus on that.

1752
01:11:56,777 --> 01:11:57,837
Keep up the good work.

1753
01:11:57,937 --> 01:12:00,046
Even if the opponent approaches, no need to get worked up.

1754
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:01,746
Just keep up what you were doing.

1755
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:02,847
Okay?

1756
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:04,916
Look. When she reaches,

1757
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:06,616
you block and dodge your head.

1758
01:12:06,617 --> 01:12:07,747
Punch as you dodge your head.

1759
01:12:07,847 --> 01:12:08,856
Punch as you dodge your head.

1760
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,456
Punch as you block with your lead hand.

1761
01:12:11,457 --> 01:12:12,586
Fight back as you dodge.

1762
01:12:12,587 --> 01:12:13,786
Good job. That was incredible.

1763
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,557
Let's make the last round great. Okay?

1764
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:20,267
(Only one round left until the finals.)

1765
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:24,266
(Round 2 begins.)

1766
01:12:24,267 --> 01:12:30,437
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Yu Jeong)

1767
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,147
Dodge and punch. Yes.

1768
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:37,717
(The slugfest begins.)

1769
01:12:37,977 --> 01:12:39,986

(Sae Rok's valid strike 7)

1776
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,196
(Sae Rok's valid strike 8, The opponent's valid strike 1)

1777
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:51,496
(Sae Rok's valid strike 9, The opponent's valid strike 2)

1778
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:53,727
(Sae Rok's valid strike 10, The opponent's valid strike 2)

1779
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:56,067
- Punch. - Keep it up.

1780
01:12:58,297 --> 01:12:59,367
She can't approach you.

1781
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:04,476
- Let's go, Keum Sae Rok! - Let's go!

1782
01:13:04,477 --> 01:13:05,907
She's approaching. Punch. Yes!

1783
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:08,977
(Straight right on the face)

1784
01:13:10,377 --> 01:13:12,717
(Making one-two using her long reach)

1785
01:13:13,287 --> 01:13:14,546
Yes!

1786
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:17,557
(Bombarding with one-two)

1787
01:13:20,557 --> 01:13:22,056
(The opponent's two hands hook...)

1788
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:25,267
(versus Sae Rok's endless one-two)

1789
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,266
The opponent's face keeps getting lifted.

1790
01:13:27,267 --> 01:13:28,637
That's crazy.

1791
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:30,236
One more time.

1792
01:13:30,237 --> 01:13:31,396
Yes. Punch. Yes!

1793
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:33,466
(Sae Rok's endless one-two attacks)

1794
01:13:33,467 --> 01:13:34,567
You're doing great!

1795
01:13:36,837 --> 01:13:38,007
- Yes. - Fight.

1796
01:13:38,077 --> 01:13:39,577
Keep your lead hand up.

1797
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:49,757
(The opponent tries a hook.)

1798
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:51,926
There isn't much time left.

1799
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,827
(There isn't much time left.)

1800
01:13:54,957 --> 01:13:56,096
Dodge and punch. Yes!

1801
01:13:56,097 --> 01:13:58,257
(Sae Rok's series of valid strikes)

1802
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,267
Good job. Keep it up.

1803
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:01,896
- Yes. - You can do it.

1804
01:14:01,897 --> 01:14:03,667
(Jab, jab, straight)

1805
01:14:04,267 --> 01:14:07,637
(Sae Rok's one-two versus the opponent's body blow)

1806
01:14:07,837 --> 01:14:09,136
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

1807
01:14:09,137 --> 01:14:10,606
- Good job, Sae Rok. - Ten seconds!

1808
01:14:10,607 --> 01:14:11,836
- Ten seconds! - Yes!

1809
01:14:11,837 --> 01:14:13,246
Sae Rok, only ten seconds!

1810
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:14,477
(Sae Rok attacks to the end.)

1811
01:14:18,517 --> 01:14:19,517
Stop.

1812
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:20,787
(Round 2 ends.)

1813
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,487
- That was crazy, Keum Sae Rok! - That was crazy, Keum Sae Rok!

1814
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:27,987
- Did you do your best? - Yes.

1815
01:14:28,027 --> 01:14:29,127
You won.

1816
01:14:30,057 --> 01:14:33,327
(Because she did her best, she has no regrets.)

1817
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:34,467
Good job.

1818
01:14:34,468 --> 01:14:35,567
(Good job.)

1819
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,637
Good job.

1820
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:40,937
(Only the results remain.)

1821
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:45,077
(Sae Rok had many valid strikes.)

1822
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,647
(The opponent threw punches to the end.)

1823
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:54,117
(Everyone waits for the result quietly.)

1824
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:57,656
- We won! - We won!

1825
01:14:57,657 --> 01:15:02,957
(Who will get to advance to the finals?)

1826
01:15:05,697 --> 01:15:10,637
(Keum Sae Rok wins.)

1827
01:15:11,497 --> 01:15:15,037
(Keum Sae Rok advances to the finals.)

1828
01:15:17,707 --> 01:15:20,107
(Good job, Keum Sae Rok.)

1829
01:15:20,577 --> 01:15:22,376
- Thank you so much. - Keum Sae Rok!

1830
01:15:22,377 --> 01:15:24,277
- I learned so much today. - Good job.

1831
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:26,416
- Thank you. - Keum Sae Rok!

1832
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:27,986
- Keum Sae Rok! - You've improved so much.

1833
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,057
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1834
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:31,617
(Good job, Lucky Rocky.)

1835
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,956
That was crazy, Keum Sae Rok!

1836
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:37,796
(Iron Girls celebrate from the bottom of their hearts.)

1837
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:40,466
- Keum Sae Rok! - Very nice.

1838
01:15:40,467 --> 01:15:43,237
(Sae rok thanks the audience with a bright smile.)

1839
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:47,266
Good job. Sae Rok, you need to cool down right away.

1840
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:49,306
If you don't cool down right now,

1841
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:50,376
then you'll have a muscle ache tomorrow.

1842
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:52,046
So you need to work out right now. Okay?

1843
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,307
(The hardcore coach won't give her a chance to rest.)

1844
01:15:54,407 --> 01:15:55,846
I'll cool down, Coach.

1845
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,377
- Yes, let's work out. - Yes.

1846
01:15:58,477 --> 01:16:00,787
- Ready to start? - Yes.

1847
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:03,887
(Sae Rok puts on the gloves again even before catching her breath.)

1848
01:16:04,257 --> 01:16:05,426
Jab. One-two.

1849
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,086
(A quick cool-down routine)

1850
01:16:07,087 --> 01:16:08,226
One-two. Yes. Cut.

1851
01:16:08,227 --> 01:16:09,296
Keep your head low.

1852
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:10,826
(While Sae Rok is cooling down...)

1853
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:12,026
You blocked everything with that.

1854
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:13,097
You blocked everything.

1855
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:14,997
And two.

1856
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,867
- Sae Rok. - Sae Rok.

1857
01:16:19,637 --> 01:16:21,637
Good job.

1858
01:16:21,837 --> 01:16:23,536
(Iron Girls gather after the preliminary round.)

1859
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,976
- Good job. I knew you could do it. - Uie.

1860
01:16:24,977 --> 01:16:26,806
- Good job. - Let's circle around.

1861
01:16:26,807 --> 01:16:27,847
(Iron Girls gather after the preliminary round.)

1862
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:30,916
- Good job. - Yes.

1863
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:31,976
I can't believe it.

1864
01:16:31,977 --> 01:16:33,317
In Ah won...

1865
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:34,747
by 10 to 8 multiple rounds.

1866
01:16:35,317 --> 01:16:37,786
That means the gap was big.

1867
01:16:37,787 --> 01:16:39,426
And Uie...

1868
01:16:39,427 --> 01:16:41,056
If you meet a player like Uie,

1869
01:16:41,057 --> 01:16:42,756
- she's very tricky. - True.

1870
01:16:42,757 --> 01:16:43,757
I mean it.

1871
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:46,426
She kept throwing punches that earned points.

1872
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:47,996
It was like a submachine gun.

1873
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:49,496
Hit once, and she would counter three times.

1874
01:16:49,497 --> 01:16:50,736
All of them earned her points.

1875
01:16:50,737 --> 01:16:52,566
From what I saw, Sae Rok barely got hit.

1876
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:53,567
- Did I see it right? - Sae Rok...

1877
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:54,806
- She barely got it. - Right?

1878
01:16:54,807 --> 01:16:56,576
Sae Rok, you were the best.

1879
01:16:56,577 --> 01:16:57,876
- Sae Rok... - She only got punched twice or so.

1880
01:16:57,877 --> 01:16:59,346
Her punches were hard. The opponent's headgear...

1881
01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:00,676
- flew up numerous times. - Totally.

1882
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:02,276
A little more, and Sae Rok would've scored a KO.

1883
01:17:02,277 --> 01:17:03,546
- Yes. - She did really well.

1884
01:17:03,547 --> 01:17:05,947
Also, Sae Rok, you used your lead hand well.

1885
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:07,887
- Yes, your guard was great. - You defended yourself well.

1886
01:17:08,617 --> 01:17:10,986
- Gosh, we're proud of you. - Well done.

1887
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:12,657
Ju Hyun may have lost, but she fought well, right?

1888
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:15,326
- For real. - She lost but fought well.

1889
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:17,426
- It was such a close game that... - Exactly.

1890
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:18,496
It could've gone into overtime.

1891
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,867
The back-and-forth made the loss all the more disappointing.

1892
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:22,636
- But Ju Hyun did really well. - You lost but fought well.

1893
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:24,536
- Ju Hyun's match... - Good job.

1894
01:17:24,537 --> 01:17:25,906
Was a bittersweet one.

1895
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,137
The pressure must have been greater since it was a revenge match.

1896
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:30,936
Even while doing theater, Ju Hyun practiced...

1897
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,777
every free minute, and I knew that very well.

1898
01:17:33,877 --> 01:17:36,777
You may have lost today, but it was still a great match.

1899
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:38,677
- Stop it. - Congratulations on third place!

1900
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:40,717
She's crying.

1901
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:42,517
What?

1902
01:17:42,987 --> 01:17:44,557
- What? The medal? - Oh, gosh.

1903
01:17:45,217 --> 01:17:48,126
(Ju Hyun's bronze medal)

1904
01:17:48,127 --> 01:17:49,127
Bronze medal?

1905
01:17:49,128 --> 01:17:51,727
- It's quite big. - The medal is huge.

1906
01:17:51,927 --> 01:17:52,927
- It's the bronze medal. - Wait.

1907
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:54,326
- Bronze medal. Right. - Nice.

1908
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,167
I forgot that I won the bronze medal.

1909
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:58,137
You lost but fought really well.

1910
01:18:03,937 --> 01:18:05,176
Guys.

1911
01:18:05,177 --> 01:18:06,206
(Everyone congratulates Ju Hyun.)

1912
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:08,447
- Well done. - Well done.

1913
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:10,216
- You fought well. - Thank you.

1914
01:18:10,217 --> 01:18:11,317
You fought really well.

1915
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:13,987
- This is making me... - Well done.

1916
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,417
Emotional.

1917
01:18:15,717 --> 01:18:17,586
I did my best. It wasn't easy at all.

1918
01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:19,027
Yes, you went all out.

1919
01:18:19,157 --> 01:18:21,427
Good job. You did really well.

1920
01:18:23,257 --> 01:18:25,626
I'm so proud of you. You really gave it your all.

1921
01:18:25,627 --> 01:18:27,396
- You won. - Well done.

1922
01:18:27,397 --> 01:18:29,237
Good. Great job.

1923
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:30,797
Here.

1924
01:18:30,798 --> 01:18:32,667
Thank you.

1925
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:34,366
Thank you.

1926
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:35,436
(Giving the medal to her mom)

1927
01:18:35,437 --> 01:18:37,037
- It's heavy, isn't it? - Yes.

1928
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,307
It was really tough.

1929
01:18:39,577 --> 01:18:41,506
Great job. You did everything you could.

1930
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:43,546
No need for long words. Just accept it.

1931
01:18:43,547 --> 01:18:44,547
Admit it.

1932
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,616
Thanks for coming all the way here.

1933
01:18:47,617 --> 01:18:49,117
(After thanking her parents)

1934
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,517
- Ju Hyun. Ta-da. - Here you go.

1935
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:54,787
- A round of applause for Ju Hyun. - What is it?

1936
01:18:54,987 --> 01:18:56,427
It's a certificate.

1937
01:18:56,897 --> 01:18:58,797
I can't remember the last time I got one.

1938
01:18:58,927 --> 01:19:00,066
Award certificate.

1939
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:02,337
Women's 30s, under 51kg, third place,

1940
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:05,067
team Iron Girls, name Park Ju Hyun.

1941
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:07,136
This certificate is awarded...

1942
01:19:07,137 --> 01:19:09,836
to the individual mentioned earlier for placing as stated...

1943
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:11,736
in the 4th Korea Sports Council...

1944
01:19:11,737 --> 01:19:12,977
President's Cup National Amateur Boxing Tournament

1945
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:16,776
From Chairman Choi Chan Wook on August 31, 2025.

1946
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,447
(4 grueling months of effort)

1947
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,216
(The moment of accepting the results)

1948
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:24,516
- You did really well. - Let's hug her.

1949
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:27,357
- You did an amazing job, Ju Hyun. - For four months.

1950
01:19:27,557 --> 01:19:29,926
- We're proud of you, Ju Hyun. - Well done.

1951
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:32,266
You gave it your all...

1952
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,866
- while doing your play. - Good job.

1953
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:35,166
- Smile. - Thank you for all your effort.

1954
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,367
- Smile now. - Well done, Ju Hyun.

1955
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:43,436
- Don't cry. You did really well. - Great work.

1956
01:19:43,437 --> 01:19:45,437
I'm sure she's feeling a mix of emotions.

1957
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:47,607
- Stop crying. - Give it to me.

1958
01:19:48,847 --> 01:19:51,447
It's been 20 years since I last received a certificate.

1959
01:19:52,077 --> 01:19:53,816
- You did really well. - Good job.

1960
01:19:53,817 --> 01:19:55,716
Good luck. Give it your all until the very end.

1961
01:19:55,717 --> 01:19:58,486
- Well done. - Stay strong until the end.

1962
01:19:58,487 --> 01:20:00,727
(The next day)

1963
01:20:01,387 --> 01:20:03,597
- Hi. - Hi.

1964
01:20:04,197 --> 01:20:05,896
- Here comes the boxers. - Hi.

1965
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:07,926
One day, we'll miss saying hi like this, won't we?

1966
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:09,696
- It's finally the last day. - That's right.

1967
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:10,896
- It's the finals. - Yes.

1968
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:12,197
- It's the finals. - It's the end of a long journey.

1969
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,566
- Did you get some sleep? - I slept for seven hours.

1970
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:15,706
(A full 7 hours of sleep)

1971
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:16,806
- Nice. - For real.

1972
01:20:16,807 --> 01:20:18,207
I also slept for eight hours.

1973
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,576
- I slept for ten hours. - What?

1974
01:20:20,577 --> 01:20:21,577
- What? - What?

1975
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:22,816
Isn't too much sleep bad?

1976
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:23,846
- Hold on. - Are you okay?

1977
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:25,076
- I bet her muscles are dead now. - You slept way too much.

1978
01:20:25,077 --> 01:20:26,446
- Did you space out? - No, listen.

1979
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,616
- What a shocker. - After a big feast,

1980
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:30,416
I kept dozing off...

1981
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,956
- and was about to pass out. - You were tired.

1982
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:33,556
Once I went to bed, I slept like a baby.

1983
01:20:33,557 --> 01:20:36,696
- Good. - Besides fighting, boxers burn...

1984
01:20:36,697 --> 01:20:39,066
- a lot of energy cheering on... - True.

1985
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,496
The other fighters.

1986
01:20:40,497 --> 01:20:41,996
- It's natural to be tired. - Totally.

1987
01:20:41,997 --> 01:20:43,596
What's a bummer is that...

1988
01:20:43,597 --> 01:20:45,807
Ju Hyun couldn't make it to the finals.

1989
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:48,067
But the other three members did.

1990
01:20:48,267 --> 01:20:49,876
Either way, the Iron Girls are one team.

1991
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:51,237
- Yes. - Yes.

1992
01:20:51,377 --> 01:20:54,276
Let's aim for winning all three gold medals and prepare well.

1993
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:55,406
- Please. - Right?

1994
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:58,516
This will be my last boxing match of my life.

1995
01:20:58,517 --> 01:20:59,616
Really?

1996
01:20:59,617 --> 01:21:01,787
I'm going to give it everything today.

1997
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,557
I plan to burn this afterwards too.

1998
01:21:04,117 --> 01:21:05,956
Today will be my final time in the ring.

1999
01:21:05,957 --> 01:21:07,826
- Stop it. - That's why...

2000
01:21:07,827 --> 01:21:11,327
I'll give my very best and step down from the ring.

2001
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,926
- Good. - I love that kind of determination.

2002
01:21:14,927 --> 01:21:16,336
- Same. - What she just showed means...

2003
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:18,266
she's going all out and leaving no regrets.

2004
01:21:18,267 --> 01:21:20,037
- I'd like to say a few words. - Go ahead.

2005
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:22,106
Thinking, "I'll do my best today."

2006
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:24,376
"I'll pour my heart and soul into it," is great,

2007
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:25,676
since today's the last match.

2008
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:27,506
But don't get carried away because of it.

2009
01:21:27,507 --> 01:21:29,276
- Yes. - You know what I mean, right?

2010
01:21:29,277 --> 01:21:31,446
The moment you get hyped in the ring,

2011
01:21:31,447 --> 01:21:32,716
- your punches go wide... - True.

2012
01:21:32,717 --> 01:21:34,387
- and your guard drops. - Right.

2013
01:21:34,517 --> 01:21:37,086
That makes it harder to beat your opponent.

2014
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:39,626
- Stay calm. - Always stay calm, got it?

2015
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:42,087
- Yes. - Great. It's the last match.

2016
01:21:42,187 --> 01:21:43,556
- Let's go. - Give it your all in the ring.

2017
01:21:43,557 --> 01:21:45,096
- Okay. - Let's go warm up.

2018
01:21:45,097 --> 01:21:46,726
- Come on. - Let's go.

2019
01:21:46,727 --> 01:21:48,527
(All our moments of fierce fighting make us champions.)

2020
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:51,337
(For the grand finals, )

2021
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:54,807
(many people have gathered.)

2022
01:21:55,037 --> 01:21:57,907
(It's a big day for everyone.)

2023
01:21:58,507 --> 01:22:03,877
(The boxers are getting ready by warming up.)

2024
01:22:04,347 --> 01:22:09,017
(The Iron Girls are warming up for the last time.)

2025
01:22:09,487 --> 01:22:10,887
(Breathing out)

2026
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:13,687
If I stop doing footwork, it's over.

2027
01:22:18,527 --> 01:22:19,567
That's it.

2028
01:22:19,797 --> 01:22:21,827
The world of competition is ruthless.

2029
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:24,796
Let's give everything I've prepared...

2030
01:22:24,797 --> 01:22:27,337
over the past four months in that ring.

2031
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:31,777
- I've got nothing to be afraid of. - Yes.

2032
01:22:31,837 --> 01:22:32,947
I've grown strong,

2033
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:35,447
and I believe I can grow even stronger.

2034
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:40,447
I want to say proudly that it was truly intense.

2035
01:22:45,417 --> 01:22:51,027
(The women's finals begin.)

2036
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:56,097
(The Iron Girls head to the stands.)

2037
01:22:57,997 --> 01:23:00,466
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2038
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:01,807
(Auntie Sae Rok)

2039
01:23:02,637 --> 01:23:08,207
(As the matches progress, )

2040
01:23:09,477 --> 01:23:14,517
(they become more nervous.)

2041
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:20,427
(They try to calm themselves down.)

2042
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:29,967
(The tension from the finals is hard to shake off.)

2043
01:23:30,397 --> 01:23:31,566
I'm so nervous.

2044
01:23:31,567 --> 01:23:32,867
There's no need to be nervous.

2045
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:34,807
Just do it like you did.

2046
01:23:35,607 --> 01:23:37,876
Your opponent is just as nervous as you. Think about it.

2047
01:23:37,877 --> 01:23:39,576
- They're extremely nervous too. - True.

2048
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:41,746
This is a battle of who can stay calmer.

2049
01:23:41,747 --> 01:23:42,947
- Got it? - Yes.

2050
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:46,116
(In Ah feels more nervous...)

2051
01:23:46,117 --> 01:23:49,047
(as she's the first member to fight in the finals.)

2052
01:23:49,717 --> 01:23:50,957
Is it her?

2053
01:23:51,857 --> 01:23:52,926
The one wearing "Kyungbuk."

2054
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,327
The boxer in front of the guy in the black top.

2055
01:23:55,387 --> 01:23:56,627
Most likely.

2056
01:23:56,697 --> 01:23:57,956
We should get ready.

2057
01:23:57,957 --> 01:23:59,027
Shall we head downstairs?

2058
01:24:00,027 --> 01:24:01,966
- Good luck. - Relax.

2059
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:03,597
- Put your mind to it. - Coach.

2060
01:24:03,697 --> 01:24:06,637
Just keep doing what you've been doing, okay?

2061
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:08,207
- Relax. - Good luck.

2062
01:24:09,037 --> 01:24:10,136
(In Ah heads to the finals first.)

2063
01:24:10,137 --> 01:24:12,577
Forget everything else. Just do as much as you did yesterday.

2064
01:24:14,407 --> 01:24:15,917
All you need to do is give it your all.

2065
01:24:16,277 --> 01:24:17,976
It's already happening.

2066
01:24:17,977 --> 01:24:19,077
- True. - Right?

2067
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:20,346
You can't turn back time.

2068
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,417
Just relax and step out of the ring after sparring.

2069
01:24:22,987 --> 01:24:24,387
- Got it? - Okay.

2070
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:30,397
(The other members are as nervous as In Ah.)

2071
01:24:32,527 --> 01:24:33,567
Is she here?

2072
01:24:35,397 --> 01:24:37,236
Warm up your body here. Good.

2073
01:24:37,237 --> 01:24:38,637
(In Ah has entered the stadium.)

2074
01:24:39,197 --> 01:24:41,437
(While the earlier matches are still going on, )

2075
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:45,037
(In Ah watches them as she warms up.)

2076
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:47,406
(Meanwhile, her opponent is getting ready for the match.)

2077
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:50,017
(Park Yu Gyeom, 20s, under 54kg)

2078
01:24:50,477 --> 01:24:51,876
(Boxing experience: 3 years)

2079
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:54,887
(10 wins in 10 matches)

2080
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:59,487
(An undefeated, skilled fighter)

2081
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:03,127
(A tough fight is expected.)

2082
01:25:04,357 --> 01:25:05,397
Let's do well.

2083
01:25:05,857 --> 01:25:07,227
Just do what I practiced.

2084
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:10,397
Why don't you warm up?

2085
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:14,366
(She warms up to relax.)

2086
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:16,837
Light one-twos. Punch. That's it.

2087
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:18,336
One, two, dodge, punch, and hook.

2088
01:25:18,337 --> 01:25:20,877
(Practicing her one, two, dodge, punch, and hook combination)

2089
01:25:21,107 --> 01:25:22,617
Yes, and pull back.

2090
01:25:22,847 --> 01:25:25,717
After you punch, bring your guard back up.

2091
01:25:25,817 --> 01:25:27,417
Do that, and you won't get hit.

2092
01:25:28,047 --> 01:25:29,917
Keep it up, and you'll get plenty of chances.

2093
01:25:31,057 --> 01:25:33,527
(The match immediately ahead has begun.)

2094
01:25:34,357 --> 01:25:36,197
(In Ah heads over to the glove room.)

2095
01:25:50,707 --> 01:25:54,077
(The final challenge to become a champion)

2096
01:25:54,377 --> 01:25:55,447
Breathe.

2097
01:25:55,607 --> 01:25:58,447
(Catching her breath)

2098
01:26:01,217 --> 01:26:03,817
(Preparing to pour out all the effort of the last 4 months)

2099
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:08,556
Your opponent is nervous too.

2100
01:26:08,557 --> 01:26:10,896
She has arms and legs, just like you.

2101
01:26:10,897 --> 01:26:12,127
- She's just another human being. - Okay.

2102
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:14,066
There's no need to be intimidated.

2103
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:15,367
She's not some alien, right?

2104
01:26:16,397 --> 01:26:19,336
Step into the ring and execute all your strategies.

2105
01:26:19,337 --> 01:26:20,367
(Stay strong and stick to what you know.)

2106
01:26:20,937 --> 01:26:23,737
(You can do it, Seol In Ah.)

2107
01:26:24,707 --> 01:26:25,877
Hit me in the forehead.

2108
01:26:26,707 --> 01:26:28,176
- Let's go. - Pull yourself together.

2109
01:26:28,177 --> 01:26:29,177
Okay.

2110
01:26:33,747 --> 01:26:37,017
(Time to bring the long journey to a close)

2111
01:26:37,157 --> 01:26:38,657
Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2112
01:26:38,817 --> 01:26:40,156
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2113
01:26:40,157 --> 01:26:41,686
Good luck.

2114
01:26:41,687 --> 01:26:43,057
(Partly worried)

2115
01:26:44,357 --> 01:26:47,626
(In Ah is starting today's team finals.)

2116
01:26:47,627 --> 01:26:49,226
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

2117
01:26:49,227 --> 01:26:52,337
(The other members cheer her on more than ever.)

2118
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:54,466
(In Ah responds brightly to their support.)

2119
01:26:54,467 --> 01:26:55,807
Good.

2120
01:26:57,507 --> 01:27:00,577
(She has given her best in every moment.)

2121
01:27:01,177 --> 01:27:03,977
No matter the outcome, stay calm. Okay?

2122
01:27:04,517 --> 01:27:05,746
Give her some water.

2123
01:27:05,747 --> 01:27:08,586
(Let's fight calmly, in my style.)

2124
01:27:08,587 --> 01:27:10,517
The outcome doesn't matter. It's like a sparring session,

2125
01:27:10,587 --> 01:27:11,957
just like the ones we've done so far.

2126
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:13,187
For real.

2127
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:15,126
You've done well up until now, okay?

2128
01:27:15,127 --> 01:27:17,557
(In Ah has done well up until now.)

2129
01:27:17,727 --> 01:27:18,757
Come up.

2130
01:27:19,357 --> 01:27:20,996
Seol In Ah!

2131
01:27:20,997 --> 01:27:22,697
- Good luck! - Good luck!

2132
01:27:23,267 --> 01:27:24,797
Let's go!

2133
01:27:28,607 --> 01:27:38,447
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

2134
01:27:38,477 --> 01:27:40,586
(Park Yu Gyeom)

2135
01:27:40,587 --> 01:27:42,917
(The finals are fierce, even in the cheering section.)

2136
01:27:43,357 --> 01:27:44,586
- After a feint, - Park Yu Gyeom!

2137
01:27:44,587 --> 01:27:45,856
- jab at her abs, - Park Yu Gyeom!

2138
01:27:45,857 --> 01:27:47,087
Then go low and high, okay?

2139
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:48,527
- Relax. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2140
01:27:50,697 --> 01:27:51,896
- I'll have fun. - Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2141
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:53,067
- Good, relax. - Good luck.

2142
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:58,067
- Be careful of your heads. - Yes, sir.

2143
01:27:58,367 --> 01:28:00,036
Don't grab your opponent or hit below the belt.

2144
01:28:00,037 --> 01:28:01,707
Touch gloves.

2145
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:03,437
- Good luck. - Thank you.

2146
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:05,037
- I'm in your care. - Corners.

2147
01:28:06,477 --> 01:28:08,176
Go all out in the ring. Got it?

2148
01:28:08,177 --> 01:28:10,717
(3 minutes to pour out the results of the last 4 months)

2149
01:28:10,847 --> 01:28:12,547
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2150
01:28:18,487 --> 01:28:19,587
Good luck.

2151
01:28:20,887 --> 01:28:23,026
(Round 1 begins.)

2152
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:27,967
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Park Yu Gyeom)

2153
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,937
(The opponent lands a valid strike first.)

2154
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:38,707
(A strong punch that made In Ah's head turn)

2155
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:42,047
(In Ah counters immediately.)

2156
01:28:42,677 --> 01:28:44,917
(The opponent corners her, targeting both low and high.)

2157
01:28:45,977 --> 01:28:48,117
(In Ah pivots and escapes.)

2158
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:52,717
(In Ah lands a powerful right hook.)

2159
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:55,827
KO. That was almost a knockout.

2160
01:28:56,527 --> 01:28:58,397
(Cross-counter)

2161
01:29:00,897 --> 01:29:02,836
- Turn. - Turn.

2162
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:04,137
Turn and punch.

2163
01:29:05,767 --> 01:29:06,936
Feint.

2164
01:29:06,937 --> 01:29:09,007
- Punch. - Feint and turn.

2165
01:29:11,907 --> 01:29:13,277
Punch. That's it.

2166
01:29:13,347 --> 01:29:14,807
(The opponent's left hook lands perfectly.)

2167
01:29:15,147 --> 01:29:16,577
(Walking in with a left hook)

2168
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:21,447
That's it. Just like that.

2169
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:25,117
(In Ah's full-power hook)

2170
01:29:25,417 --> 01:29:27,026
(The opponent staggers.)

2171
01:29:27,027 --> 01:29:28,487
(But she counters immediately with a hook.)

2172
01:29:29,387 --> 01:29:31,697
(A back-and-forth one-two combination)

2173
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,566
(After dodging the opponent's hook, )

2174
01:29:36,567 --> 01:29:38,097
(In Ah goes for a hook.)

2175
01:29:42,437 --> 01:29:44,307
(In Ah's jab follows a right hook.)

2176
01:29:51,777 --> 01:29:53,716
(The opponent throws both hand hooks.)

2177
01:29:53,717 --> 01:29:55,117
(And a body shot.)

2178
01:30:03,057 --> 01:30:06,826
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2179
01:30:06,827 --> 01:30:08,096
Pivot. Well done.

2180
01:30:08,097 --> 01:30:09,636
(Pivoting as she lands a punch)

2181
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:10,796
That's it. Good.

2182
01:30:10,797 --> 01:30:11,967
Turn.

2183
01:30:11,997 --> 01:30:13,167
Yes, pivot.

2184
01:30:13,267 --> 01:30:14,466
- Stop. - Okay, stop.

2185
01:30:14,467 --> 01:30:16,977
(Round 1 ends.)

2186
01:30:17,877 --> 01:30:19,107
- Well done. - Really?

2187
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:20,307
Well done.

2188
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:22,047
My lips are busted.

2189
01:30:23,347 --> 01:30:24,476
Are you okay?

2190
01:30:24,477 --> 01:30:26,847
(In Ah's mouth got busted from the opponent's strong punch.)

2191
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:28,917
Good job.

2192
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,857
(The opponent has used quite a bit of her stamina.)

2193
01:30:32,217 --> 01:30:36,257
(While catching her breath and pulling herself together, )

2194
01:30:36,757 --> 01:30:40,127
(the stadium is buzzing with excitement.)

2195
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:42,867
(Park Yu Gyeom)

2196
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,667
(Even the cheering battle is neck to neck.)

2197
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:46,406
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

2198
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:47,867
(We can't lose.)

2199
01:30:48,237 --> 01:30:50,976
(The stadium is heating up.)

2200
01:30:50,977 --> 01:30:52,606
(In Ah versus Yu Gyeom)

2201
01:30:52,607 --> 01:30:54,806
(The results of Round 1 are revealed.)

2202
01:30:54,807 --> 01:30:56,747
(In Ah versus the opponent)

2203
01:30:57,017 --> 01:30:58,716
- We lost Round One. - She's good.

2204
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:00,347
- We lost Round 1, 9 to 10. - Seol In Ah!

2205
01:31:00,547 --> 01:31:01,886
The opponent is incredible.

2206
01:31:01,887 --> 01:31:03,086
(It's not an easy match.)

2207
01:31:03,087 --> 01:31:04,956
- From what I see, - You're right.

2208
01:31:04,957 --> 01:31:06,957
In Ah needs to land perfect jabs.

2209
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:09,186
There's no need to throw hooks at the same time.

2210
01:31:09,187 --> 01:31:10,426
All the opponent does is throw hooks.

2211
01:31:10,427 --> 01:31:11,756
- Exactly. - Hooks are fine,

2212
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:13,326
but she should be landing jabs and then back out.

2213
01:31:13,327 --> 01:31:14,567
(In Ah should focus on jabs.)

2214
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,926
Go slower.

2215
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,336
Everything's good, even your footwork.

2216
01:31:17,337 --> 01:31:19,867
After a feint, snap a punch to her face right away.

2217
01:31:20,037 --> 01:31:21,406
Dodge and punch twice.

2218
01:31:21,407 --> 01:31:23,037
Just dodge and punch twice, got it?

2219
01:31:23,777 --> 01:31:24,876
Can you do that?

2220
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:25,936
You understand, right?

2221
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:27,407
All she does is move in.

2222
01:31:27,877 --> 01:31:29,747
What good are hooks if you can't reach her?

2223
01:31:30,177 --> 01:31:32,046
After two jabs and a right hook, use your left hand.

2224
01:31:32,047 --> 01:31:33,387
Make better use of your left hand.

2225
01:31:34,787 --> 01:31:37,357
(Round 2 strategy: Follow the jabs with consecutive hooks)

2226
01:31:37,857 --> 01:31:40,456
(Second out.)

2227
01:31:40,457 --> 01:31:41,526
Connect it with a hook.

2228
01:31:41,527 --> 01:31:42,726
Dodge immediately, okay?

2229
01:31:42,727 --> 01:31:44,157
(It's the final round.)

2230
01:31:44,897 --> 01:31:46,096
Dodge to the side.

2231
01:31:46,097 --> 01:31:48,996
(The last 1 minute and 30 seconds will decide the winner.)

2232
01:31:48,997 --> 01:31:51,596
(Round 2 begins.)

2233
01:31:51,597 --> 01:31:55,907
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Park Yu Gyeom)

2234
01:32:08,887 --> 01:32:09,956
(In Ah's valid strike: 1)

2235
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:11,556
(In Ah's valid strike: 2, The opponent's valid strike: 1)

2236
01:32:11,557 --> 01:32:13,826
(In Ah's valid strike: 3, The opponent's valid strike: 2)

2237
01:32:13,827 --> 01:32:15,826
(In Ah's valid strike: 4, The opponent's valid strike: 3)

2238
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:19,027
(In Ah's valid strike: 5, The opponent's valid strike: 4)

2239
01:32:23,397 --> 01:32:25,837
- Counterattack. - Counter!

2240
01:32:26,097 --> 01:32:27,366
Turn.

2241
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:28,907
(In Ah makes a big turn around the ring.)

2242
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:32,207
(The two boxers wait for the right timing.)

2243
01:32:32,377 --> 01:32:34,747
(The referee signals them to attack.)

2244
01:32:35,947 --> 01:32:37,016
(After dodging, )

2245
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:39,077
(In Ah lands a one-two immediately.)

2246
01:32:39,317 --> 01:32:40,486
Pivot.

2247
01:32:40,487 --> 01:32:42,847
(It turns into a full-on slugfest.)

2248
01:32:43,317 --> 01:32:45,057
- Turn. That's it. - Turn.

2249
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:48,427
- Turn. Pivot. - Turn.

2250
01:32:49,157 --> 01:32:50,426
Here she comes.

2251
01:32:50,427 --> 01:32:51,457
Cross-counter.

2252
01:32:51,997 --> 01:32:53,127
- Cross-counter it. - Dodge.

2253
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:54,826
She's tired. Attack.

2254
01:32:54,827 --> 01:32:56,197
That's it. She's drained.

2255
01:32:56,967 --> 01:32:59,067
(The jab landed perfectly.)

2256
01:33:02,337 --> 01:33:04,436
- It's the last match, In Ah! - It's the last match!

2257
01:33:04,437 --> 01:33:05,476
It's the last one.

2258
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:07,777
That's it. Good. Well done.

2259
01:33:09,007 --> 01:33:10,777
(Another powerful jab)

2260
01:33:11,517 --> 01:33:14,016
(The strong blow snaps the opponent's head around)

2261
01:33:14,017 --> 01:33:15,216
- Yes, for real. - One more time.

2262
01:33:15,217 --> 01:33:17,757
- One more. Jab. - Jab.

2263
01:33:17,957 --> 01:33:19,586
Just jab.

2264
01:33:19,587 --> 01:33:20,927
- Jab, In Ah. - Jab.

2265
01:33:22,157 --> 01:33:23,856
Here she comes. Well done. Try again.

2266
01:33:23,857 --> 01:33:25,426
She's going to attack. Counterattack.

2267
01:33:25,427 --> 01:33:27,427
- Both boxers are exhausted. - In Ah.

2268
01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:29,297
Counterattack.

2269
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:32,036
(Both landed hooks simultaneously.)

2270
01:33:32,037 --> 01:33:33,207
Again.

2271
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:35,266
(And a straight jab.)

2272
01:33:35,267 --> 01:33:36,407
- That's it. Again. - More.

2273
01:33:37,307 --> 01:33:38,477
- Try it again. - She's coming.

2274
01:33:39,007 --> 01:33:40,206
- She's tired. - Yes.

2275
01:33:40,207 --> 01:33:42,047
(Tired, her guard is down.)

2276
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:43,846
Stop.

2277
01:33:43,847 --> 01:33:45,376
(Round 2 ends.)

2278
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:46,547
Thank you.

2279
01:33:48,687 --> 01:33:49,746
Well done.

2280
01:33:49,747 --> 01:33:51,957
Round Two is over.

2281
01:33:52,557 --> 01:33:53,727
- Good job. - Well done.

2282
01:33:54,187 --> 01:33:55,256
Great work.

2283
01:33:55,257 --> 01:33:58,026
(In Ah came back after giving it her all.)

2284
01:33:58,027 --> 01:33:59,197
You did really well.

2285
01:33:59,997 --> 01:34:02,026
In Ah won Round Two.

2286
01:34:02,027 --> 01:34:03,297
(The crowd is still excited.)

2287
01:34:03,567 --> 01:34:05,137
It's a close match.

2288
01:34:07,467 --> 01:34:08,766
She won Round Two.

2289
01:34:08,767 --> 01:34:10,406
- Yes, she did. - Now...

2290
01:34:10,407 --> 01:34:11,876
- Round One... - It's a battle of small punches.

2291
01:34:11,877 --> 01:34:13,976
In Ah lost Round One by a narrow margin.

2292
01:34:13,977 --> 01:34:15,277
She still has the potential to win.

2293
01:34:16,047 --> 01:34:17,576
- Seol In Ah! - Seol In Ah!

2294
01:34:17,577 --> 01:34:19,047
(Voices united with desperation, )

2295
01:34:19,677 --> 01:34:22,447
(everyone anxiously waits for the decision.)

2296
01:34:22,847 --> 01:34:25,617
(But the opponent's team is just as desperate.)

2297
01:34:26,217 --> 01:34:28,957
(Amidst the excitement, both boxers return to the center.)

2298
01:34:30,727 --> 01:34:34,527
(Both fighters gave it their all, putting on the best match possible.)

2299
01:34:43,137 --> 01:34:45,307
(Who is the winner of this match?)

2300
01:34:50,047 --> 01:34:53,486
(At that moment, the white sign is held up.)

2301
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:55,016
(Head referee)

2302
01:34:55,017 --> 01:34:56,146
It's a tie.

2303
01:34:56,147 --> 01:34:57,217
(The white sign indicates a tie.)

2304
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:00,257
(Since In Ah won Round 2, the scores are now tied.)

2305
01:35:01,287 --> 01:35:03,357
(They return to their corners for a re-evaluation.)

2306
01:35:05,357 --> 01:35:08,067
(The stadium is filled with tension once again.)

2307
01:35:08,467 --> 01:35:10,997
(Everyone patiently waits for the re-evaluation.)

2308
01:35:11,267 --> 01:35:13,167
It's a tie. Hold on.

2309
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:15,537
Can there be a tie?

2310
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:18,006
In Ah lost Round One,

2311
01:35:18,007 --> 01:35:19,477
- while she won Round Two. - Right.

2312
01:35:19,577 --> 01:35:21,006
That turned into a tie.

2313
01:35:21,007 --> 01:35:22,347
What happens now?

2314
01:35:23,577 --> 01:35:25,546
(If the white sign indicating a tie is held up, )

2315
01:35:25,547 --> 01:35:27,517
(the 3 judges decide the winner through a re-vote.)

2316
01:35:28,887 --> 01:35:32,317
(The re-vote proceeds rapidly.)

2317
01:35:35,357 --> 01:35:39,757
(Returning to the center of the ring for the result announcement)

2318
01:35:40,727 --> 01:35:42,026
- Great job. - Thank you.

2319
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:43,567
(The two fought fiercely until the very end.)

2320
01:35:44,337 --> 01:35:47,667
(Heavy hooks thrown from the start)

2321
01:35:50,207 --> 01:35:53,747
(The opponent took the upper hand in Round 1.)

2322
01:35:54,347 --> 01:35:57,217
(Did the opponent win with her unmatched skills?)

2323
01:35:57,277 --> 01:35:59,247
Since In Ah landed many punches in Round Two,

2324
01:35:59,317 --> 01:36:01,146
she looks set to win.

2325
01:36:01,147 --> 01:36:02,847
Please.

2326
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:08,257
(With relentless attacks...)

2327
01:36:08,827 --> 01:36:12,797
(and precise, valid jabs, )

2328
01:36:12,927 --> 01:36:16,197
(In Ah dominated Round 2.)

2329
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:20,237
(Did In Ah win by taking the momentum in Round 2?)

2330
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:22,106
- Please, I beg you. - Please.

2331
01:36:22,107 --> 01:36:24,477
(As time passes, everyone grows more desperate.)

2332
01:36:30,477 --> 01:36:34,917
(Who is the winner?)

2333
01:36:35,132 --> 01:36:36,971
- Please, I beg you. - Please.

2334
01:36:36,972 --> 01:36:39,172
(As time passes, everyone grows more desperate.)

2335
01:36:45,372 --> 01:36:49,412
(Who is the winner?)

2336
01:36:57,852 --> 01:37:01,122
(Seol In Ah wins.)

2337
01:37:06,932 --> 01:37:10,332
(2 judges voted for In Ah.)

2338
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:15,101
(Seol In Ah wins the national tournament.)

2339
01:37:15,102 --> 01:37:16,772
- Great work. - Thank you.

2340
01:37:18,912 --> 01:37:22,612
(After enduring the long and tough months, )

2341
01:37:25,852 --> 01:37:28,582
(In Ah has reached the top.)

2342
01:37:29,822 --> 01:37:30,922
You fought well.

2343
01:37:32,522 --> 01:37:33,762
We won.

2344
01:37:40,202 --> 01:37:42,961
(The Iron Girls celebrate together.)

2345
01:37:42,962 --> 01:37:45,802
Yes, this is only fair.

2346
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:48,002
(And so do their families.)

2347
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:53,241
Gold medal, Seol In Ah of the Iron Girls.

2348
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:55,311
(Gold medal: Seol In Ah of the Iron Girls)

2349
01:37:55,312 --> 01:37:56,382
Congratulations.

2350
01:38:00,822 --> 01:38:01,921
Unbelievable.

2351
01:38:01,922 --> 01:38:04,752
(4 months of blood, sweat, and tears led to this moment.)

2352
01:38:05,452 --> 01:38:09,491
Silver medal, Park Yu Gyeom of the Kyungbuk Gym.

2353
01:38:09,492 --> 01:38:10,692
(The opponent fought fiercely until the end.)

2354
01:38:13,062 --> 01:38:15,001
- Thank you. Great work. - Thank you. Great work.

2355
01:38:15,002 --> 01:38:16,362
(Today's match was fierce and thrilling.)

2356
01:38:17,872 --> 01:38:19,002
Well done.

2357
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:22,141
- Good job. - In Ah!

2358
01:38:22,142 --> 01:38:24,372
(Seol In Ah of the Iron Girls is now a boxing champion.)

2359
01:38:29,182 --> 01:38:30,712
Let's go. Well done.

2360
01:38:30,912 --> 01:38:32,012
You did really well.

2361
01:38:34,182 --> 01:38:35,222
We won.

2362
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,921
It's the result of my hard work.

2363
01:38:37,922 --> 01:38:40,522
- I felt really proud of myself... - Let's go.

2364
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:41,791
And happy.

2365
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,162
(Today's result feels even more priceless and satisfying.)

2366
01:38:44,362 --> 01:38:46,092
- Thank you. - Oh, my gosh.

2367
01:38:47,032 --> 01:38:48,161
- A gold medal. - Yes.

2368
01:38:48,162 --> 01:38:49,162
(Kim Min Jung, In Ah's first tournament preliminary opponent)

2369
01:38:49,302 --> 01:38:51,672
- Congratulations. - Great work.

2370
01:38:52,532 --> 01:38:53,602
My baby.

2371
01:38:53,772 --> 01:38:55,771
- Congratulations. Really. - Congratulations.

2372
01:38:55,772 --> 01:38:58,372
Well done, In Ah. You did an amazing job.

- Good luck. - Congratulations.

2374
01:39:00,982 --> 01:39:02,182
You were awesome.

2375
01:39:04,312 --> 01:39:06,382
Keum Sae Rok, I love you.

2376
01:39:09,922 --> 01:39:13,051
(The first champion of today's tournament)

2377
01:39:13,052 --> 01:39:14,991
- I love you, In Ah. Great work. - Good luck.

2378
01:39:14,992 --> 01:39:16,422
- Do everything you want to do. - Go on upstairs.

2379
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:22,002
(The tournament hasn't ended yet.)

2380
01:39:22,762 --> 01:39:25,932
(Uie is about to fight her last match.)

2381
01:39:26,072 --> 01:39:28,971
Relax. Warm up your body. Shake.

2382
01:39:28,972 --> 01:39:30,001
(Uie tries to relax by warming up.)

2383
01:39:30,002 --> 01:39:31,472
Let's do ten one-twos.

2384
01:39:31,872 --> 01:39:34,441
One, two, three, four.

2385
01:39:34,442 --> 01:39:37,952
(Focusing in fighter-mode)

2386
01:39:38,952 --> 01:39:40,752
Don't forget about your lead hand, okay?

2387
01:39:40,882 --> 01:39:42,122
Okay, good.

2388
01:39:43,022 --> 01:39:45,952
(All preparations are complete.)

2389
01:39:46,992 --> 01:39:49,392
(The match right before Uie's begins.)

2390
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:53,192
(Uie enters the glove room.)

2391
01:39:54,362 --> 01:39:55,431
Breathe.

2392
01:39:55,432 --> 01:39:57,231
(The headgear she's worn countless times)

2393
01:39:57,232 --> 01:39:58,872
- How is it? All good? - Yes.

2394
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:05,072
(Tightening her gloves one more time)

2395
01:40:09,882 --> 01:40:11,681
Two, one, two, backstep, one, two.

2396
01:40:11,682 --> 01:40:14,182
Keep your lead hand up. Don't forget about your lead hand.

2397
01:40:14,952 --> 01:40:16,022
Nice.

2398
01:40:16,852 --> 01:40:19,492
(Who will Uie face in the finals?)

2399
01:40:20,492 --> 01:40:23,492
(Shin Han Geul, 30s, under 51kg)

2400
01:40:24,332 --> 01:40:29,302
(Boxing experience: 1 year and 6 months)

2401
01:40:30,332 --> 01:40:33,372
(Amidst a strange tension)

2402
01:40:33,602 --> 01:40:36,572
Well done. You've done really well until now.

2403
01:40:36,942 --> 01:40:38,311
Just do your best in the ring.

2404
01:40:38,312 --> 01:40:39,341
- Okay? - Okay.

2405
01:40:39,342 --> 01:40:40,841
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

2406
01:40:40,842 --> 01:40:43,082
Getting this far is already a job well done, Uie. Got it?

2407
01:40:43,382 --> 01:40:45,482
(Let's give it my all and step down without regrets.)

2408
01:40:46,412 --> 01:40:49,182
(The opponent, fully warmed up, )

2409
01:40:50,652 --> 01:40:53,252
(heads to the ring to cheers from the crowd.)

2410
01:40:54,592 --> 01:40:57,431
(Uie sets off, her eyes full of determination.)

2411
01:40:57,432 --> 01:41:00,601
- Kim Uie! - Kim Uie!

2412
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:02,302
(They start to cheer at full volume.)

2413
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:07,502
(The final hurdle before claiming the gold medal)

2414
01:41:09,972 --> 01:41:13,512
(Uie sets forth.)

2415
01:41:13,712 --> 01:41:16,982
(The other members cheer loudly for a nervous Uie.)

2416
01:41:21,252 --> 01:41:22,521
All right. Take a deep breath.

2417
01:41:22,522 --> 01:41:24,591
(Heading to the ring after a deep breath)

2418
01:41:24,592 --> 01:41:25,621
Let's go.

2419
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:28,492
(Heading to the ring after a deep breath)

2420
01:41:28,762 --> 01:41:35,231
- Uie! - Uie!

2421
01:41:35,232 --> 01:41:36,302
- Uie! - Mouthguard.

2422
01:41:37,432 --> 01:41:38,901
- Thank you. - Kim Yu Jin!

2423
01:41:38,902 --> 01:41:40,601
Uie, relax.

2424
01:41:40,602 --> 01:41:42,172
- For real. It's okay. - Okay.

2425
01:41:42,502 --> 01:41:43,571
Take it easy.

2426
01:41:43,572 --> 01:41:46,112
(Time to unleash everything she's trained for)

2427
01:41:46,272 --> 01:41:51,052
(Finals, Under 51kg: Uie versus Shin Han Geul)

2428
01:41:51,182 --> 01:41:52,911
Watch your heads and low blows.

2429
01:41:52,912 --> 01:41:54,922
No clinching. Fight fair.

2430
01:41:56,052 --> 01:41:57,052
- Corner. - Good luck.

2431
01:42:01,462 --> 01:42:02,922
Look at the height difference.

2432
01:42:03,362 --> 01:42:04,732
Let's gain points.

2433
01:42:04,762 --> 01:42:06,032
Fight as you've been doing.

2434
01:42:07,862 --> 01:42:10,601
(Round 1 begins.)

2435
01:42:10,602 --> 01:42:15,501
(Round 1, Under 51kg: Uie versus versus Shin Han Geul)

2436
01:42:15,502 --> 01:42:17,171
- Uie! - Uie!

2437
01:42:17,172 --> 01:42:18,372
- Go! - Uie!

2438
01:42:18,572 --> 01:42:20,942
(Uie's one-two preemptive attack)

2439
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:23,682
(The opponent counterattacks immediately.)

2440
01:42:24,182 --> 01:42:25,882
That's it!

2441
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:29,952
(The opponent's powerful punch that made Uie's head turn)

2442
01:42:30,122 --> 01:42:31,751
(The opponent stays low...)

2443
01:42:31,752 --> 01:42:32,951
(and attacks deeply.)

2444
01:42:32,952 --> 01:42:35,762
She's a tough opponent with a UFC-style approach.

2445
01:42:38,392 --> 01:42:39,462
Go for it.

2446
01:42:39,932 --> 01:42:41,032
Move in.

2447
01:42:41,902 --> 01:42:43,361
Attack. Again.

2448
01:42:43,362 --> 01:42:45,602
Well done. Yes, that's it, Uie.

2449
01:42:46,132 --> 01:42:47,702
(A jab when the opponent moves in)

2450
01:42:48,072 --> 01:42:50,572
(An attack utilizing her long reach)

2451
01:42:51,412 --> 01:42:53,881
Turn. Nice one.

2452
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:54,981
(Uie punches without a break.)

2453
01:42:54,982 --> 01:42:56,611
- Good. - The opponent is struggling.

2454
01:42:56,612 --> 01:42:58,681
"Her reach is long, and the punches just keep coming."

2455
01:42:58,682 --> 01:42:59,882
She's flustered.

2456
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:01,681
Hurry up and move in.

2457
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:04,652
Move around. She's going to attack. Wait for it.

2458
01:43:05,322 --> 01:43:06,391
That's it.

2459
01:43:06,392 --> 01:43:07,762
Punch.

2460
01:43:09,322 --> 01:43:12,032
(Uie's endless one-twos)

2461
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:14,761
(The opponent's jab targets openings.)

2462
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:16,462
(A wide hook follows.)

2463
01:43:19,532 --> 01:43:21,701
- One, two, three, four, five, six, - Yes.

2464
01:43:21,702 --> 01:43:24,171
- seven, eight, nine, ten. - Turn.

2465
01:43:24,172 --> 01:43:26,141
- That's it. One-two. - Nice.

2466
01:43:26,142 --> 01:43:27,881
- Turn. - Use your waist.

2467
01:43:27,882 --> 01:43:29,082
One-two after a feint.

2468
01:43:30,382 --> 01:43:32,581
Land a one-two, Uie. Attack her first.

2469
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:34,582
(They continue keeping each other in check.)

2470
01:43:37,422 --> 01:43:38,492
Number one.

2471
01:43:39,052 --> 01:43:40,092
Yes.

2472
01:43:40,992 --> 01:43:41,992
(Uie's valid strike 1)

2473
01:43:41,993 --> 01:43:43,261
(Uie's valid strike 2)

2474
01:43:43,262 --> 01:43:44,262
(Uie's valid strike 3)

2475
01:43:44,263 --> 01:43:45,461
(Uie's valid strike 4, The opponent's valid strike 1)

2476
01:43:45,462 --> 01:43:46,661
(Uie's valid strike 5, The opponent's valid strike 2)

2477
01:43:46,662 --> 01:43:47,662
(Uie's valid strike 6, The opponent's valid strike 2)

2478
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:50,871
- Number one. - That's it. Turn.

2479
01:43:50,872 --> 01:43:52,771
- Turn. - Yes.

2480
01:43:52,772 --> 01:43:54,171
Turn. Well done. Again.

2481
01:43:54,172 --> 01:43:55,542
- Another one-two. - Number one.

2482
01:43:56,402 --> 01:43:57,412
Number one.

2483
01:44:00,742 --> 01:44:02,581
- Okay. Uie won Round One. - Stop!

2484
01:44:02,582 --> 01:44:03,582
(Round 1 ends.)

2485
01:44:03,982 --> 01:44:05,551
(Uie is on a roll.)

2486
01:44:05,552 --> 01:44:07,722
- Nice, Uie. - Uie won Round One.

2487
01:44:07,852 --> 01:44:09,381
She's earned crazy points.

2488
01:44:09,382 --> 01:44:10,721
- For real. It was 1, 2, 3, 4, - 3, 4,

2489
01:44:10,722 --> 01:44:12,252
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. - 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2490
01:44:12,422 --> 01:44:14,562
To think she'd earn points like that.

2491
01:44:14,722 --> 01:44:17,332
- What? How come? - What?

2492
01:44:17,892 --> 01:44:20,192
(The results of Round 1 are revealed.)

2493
01:44:20,802 --> 01:44:23,702
(Blue Corner wins Round 1.)

2494
01:44:24,172 --> 01:44:25,571
- Shin Han Geul! - What?

2495
01:44:25,572 --> 01:44:26,801
- But why? - Uie lost?

2496
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:28,941
- Shin Han Geul! - We lost Round One?

2497
01:44:28,942 --> 01:44:30,572
(Taken aback by the shocking result)

2498
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:32,111
Why?

2499
01:44:32,112 --> 01:44:33,612
Didn't she land four times as many hits?

2500
01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:36,182
Her punches must have been...

2501
01:44:36,382 --> 01:44:37,852
too weak to score points.

2502
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:40,922
The judges were looking for more damaging strikes.

2503
01:44:41,152 --> 01:44:43,482
(The opponent's hits were more powerful than Uie's.)

2504
01:44:44,122 --> 01:44:46,051
Well done. You did well.

2505
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:47,391
- Let's attack her with jabs. - Okay.

2506
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:48,921
Jab is the answer. After some feints,

2507
01:44:48,922 --> 01:44:51,131
back out after a good punch. Just jabs, okay?

2508
01:44:51,132 --> 01:44:53,391
The opponent throws hooks when she moves in, right?

2509
01:44:53,392 --> 01:44:54,731
- Yes. - Be careful of those.

2510
01:44:54,732 --> 01:44:57,301
After you punch, you immediately back out.

2511
01:44:57,302 --> 01:44:58,771
- Turn after your punch. - Okay.

2512
01:44:58,772 --> 01:45:00,371
Either turn and punch or turn and pivot out.

2513
01:45:00,372 --> 01:45:01,601
- Got it? - Yes.

2514
01:45:01,602 --> 01:45:02,672
Attack her with jabs.

2515
01:45:02,772 --> 01:45:03,912
You were amazing.

2516
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:06,342
- You're the best. Well done. - After a right hook,

2517
01:45:06,912 --> 01:45:08,381
jump forward.

2518
01:45:08,382 --> 01:45:09,581
You need to punch again.

2519
01:45:09,582 --> 01:45:11,252
Add some head movement.

2520
01:45:11,352 --> 01:45:12,511
- You're doing well. - I agree.

2521
01:45:12,512 --> 01:45:14,152
- This is the last round. Got it? - Yes.

2522
01:45:18,692 --> 01:45:20,922
(Round 2 begins.)

2523
01:45:21,062 --> 01:45:24,432
(Round 2, Under 51kg: Uie versus Shin Han Geul)

2524
01:45:26,262 --> 01:45:30,102
- Uie! - Uie!

2525
01:45:30,132 --> 01:45:31,572
That's it.

2526
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:34,571
(The opponent throws a right hook, )

2527
01:45:34,572 --> 01:45:36,142
(followed by a jab.)

2528
01:45:36,642 --> 01:45:37,642
That's it!

2529
01:45:37,643 --> 01:45:39,711
(Uie counterattacks with a one-two combination.)

2530
01:45:39,712 --> 01:45:40,842
Wait for it.

2531
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:43,082
- That's it. - Lower your body.

2532
01:45:45,312 --> 01:45:47,751
There you go. Lower your body and get up afterward.

2533
01:45:47,752 --> 01:45:49,021
- Go in! - Now!

2534
01:45:49,022 --> 01:45:51,492
(A slugfest begins.)

2535
01:45:52,722 --> 01:45:54,121
(Uie's one-two...)

2536
01:45:54,122 --> 01:45:56,192
(versus the opponent's hooks)

2537
01:45:56,762 --> 01:45:58,992
(Uie wraps up with a jab.)

2538
01:46:00,262 --> 01:46:03,202
(The opponent ducks and throws a hook.)

2539
01:46:04,172 --> 01:46:05,201
Try it again.

2540
01:46:05,202 --> 01:46:06,332
Uie, try it again.

2541
01:46:06,832 --> 01:46:08,941
Now is your chance.

2542
01:46:08,942 --> 01:46:10,071
Get in there.

2543
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,812
- Get in there. There's no time. - Get in there.

2544
01:46:12,642 --> 01:46:15,182
(The opponent sends a flurry.)

2545
01:46:18,212 --> 01:46:21,021
(The opponent's right hook)

2546
01:46:21,022 --> 01:46:22,521
(The opponent's right hooks 2)

2547
01:46:22,522 --> 01:46:23,822
(Then comes a jab.)

2548
01:46:35,532 --> 01:46:36,632
Get in there.

2549
01:46:36,902 --> 01:46:38,001
There you go.

2550
01:46:38,002 --> 01:46:40,002
(The opponent throws a right hook again.)

2551
01:46:43,002 --> 01:46:46,312
(Uie continues to attempt the one-two.)

2552
01:46:50,482 --> 01:46:51,652
She shouldn't rest.

2553
01:46:51,682 --> 01:46:52,951
- She needs to be more aggressive. - Keep going!

2554
01:46:52,952 --> 01:46:54,021
Keep going!

2555
01:46:54,022 --> 01:46:55,081
Come on!

2556
01:46:55,082 --> 01:46:56,522
Uie, don't rest!

2557
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,792
Try it again. There you go.

2558
01:46:58,892 --> 01:47:00,592
- Keep going. That's right. - Again. There you go.

2559
01:47:00,822 --> 01:47:01,922
- Good. - Good.

2560
01:47:02,092 --> 01:47:03,121
Keep going.

2561
01:47:03,122 --> 01:47:04,331
Don't rest. There you go.

2562
01:47:04,332 --> 01:47:06,131
- There you go. Try again. - There you go.

2563
01:47:06,132 --> 01:47:08,162
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2564
01:47:08,332 --> 01:47:09,532
Get in there.

2565
01:47:09,962 --> 01:47:11,071
(Uie's jab)

2566
01:47:11,072 --> 01:47:12,171
- Again. Try it again. - There you go.

2567
01:47:12,172 --> 01:47:14,772
(Uie keeps throwing jabs.)

2568
01:47:14,972 --> 01:47:16,072
There you go. Again.

2569
01:47:16,102 --> 01:47:18,072
(Round 2 ends.)

2570
01:47:19,742 --> 01:47:21,112
Well done.

2571
01:47:21,712 --> 01:47:23,682
- Well done. - I did my absolute best.

2572
01:47:24,252 --> 01:47:25,352
You did well.

2573
01:47:27,152 --> 01:47:29,852
(Uie gave the match her all until the very end.)

2574
01:47:30,322 --> 01:47:31,322
(She ends the last match without any regrets.)

2575
01:47:31,323 --> 01:47:32,991
- She didn't do badly. - But Round Two...

2576
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:35,621
Let's shout, "Uie, let's go!" Set, go.

2577
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:38,362
- Uie, let's go! - Uie, let's go!

2578
01:47:38,992 --> 01:47:41,802
(She goes to the center of the ring for the results.)

2579
01:47:43,162 --> 01:47:44,231
Thank you for your hard work.

2580
01:47:44,232 --> 01:47:47,502
(They exchange greetings of respect.)

2581
01:47:48,572 --> 01:47:51,342
(It's time for the results.)

2582
01:47:52,342 --> 01:47:57,882
(The opponent moved in and threw hooks without hesitation.)

2583
01:47:59,352 --> 01:48:02,852
(Will the opponent win for her heavy punches?)

2584
01:48:03,652 --> 01:48:09,392
(Uie used her long reach to throw one-twos nonstop.)

2585
01:48:10,962 --> 01:48:14,532
(Will Uie win for her endless one-twos?)

2586
01:48:15,002 --> 01:48:17,772
(What will be the result of Uie's last match?)

2587
01:48:20,572 --> 01:48:23,202
(Blue Corner wins.)

2588
01:48:24,512 --> 01:48:27,272
(Uie loses.)

2589
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,952
Thank you for your hard work.

2590
01:48:35,522 --> 01:48:37,421
Thank you for your hard work.

2591
01:48:37,422 --> 01:48:39,022
(She shares a passionate hug with the opponent.)

2592
01:48:39,422 --> 01:48:40,691
Well done.

2593
01:48:40,692 --> 01:48:42,321
(Despite the loss, )

2594
01:48:42,322 --> 01:48:44,791
(Uie smiles brightly since she has overcome her fear.)

2595
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:45,962
It's okay.

2596
01:48:46,262 --> 01:48:48,461
Kim Yu Jin, well done!

2597
01:48:48,462 --> 01:48:51,532
(You did very well.)

2598
01:48:52,172 --> 01:48:55,642
To be honest, I thought to myself, "What if I have regrets?"

2599
01:48:55,942 --> 01:48:57,541
(Silver medal)

2600
01:48:57,542 --> 01:49:02,582
(Silver medal: Uie of the Iron Girls)

2601
01:49:05,182 --> 01:49:08,252
But my heart felt so light that I didn't have any regrets.

2602
01:49:08,522 --> 01:49:09,921
I'm very happy.

2603
01:49:09,922 --> 01:49:12,852
(I'm very happy.)

2604
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:17,062
(Meanwhile, )

2605
01:49:17,632 --> 01:49:21,102
(Sae Rok is the last boxer of the finals.)

2606
01:49:22,702 --> 01:49:24,332
Don't get nervous. Why would you get nervous?

2607
01:49:24,372 --> 01:49:25,471
You boxed yesterday too.

2608
01:49:25,472 --> 01:49:27,272
Don't get intimidated. Why would you get intimidated?

2609
01:49:27,672 --> 01:49:30,572
(The finals are more nerve-racking than the preliminaries.)

2610
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:34,942
(The opponent has the boxing experience of 2 years.)

2611
01:49:35,442 --> 01:49:38,582
(Sae Rok takes deep breaths due to nervousness.)

2612
01:49:39,412 --> 01:49:40,581
It's okay.

2613
01:49:40,582 --> 01:49:41,752
You can do it.

2614
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:43,222
It's nothing.

2615
01:49:44,352 --> 01:49:47,692
(She steels her heart before the final match.)

2616
01:49:47,862 --> 01:49:49,121
- It's Sae Rok's turn. - It's Sae Rok.

2617
01:49:49,122 --> 01:49:50,792
I hope Sae Rok wins.

2618
01:49:51,332 --> 01:49:53,531
Sae Rok, let's win gold.

2619
01:49:53,532 --> 01:49:56,702
(Iron Girls' last match is even more nerve-racking.)

2620
01:49:57,262 --> 01:49:59,372
Let's enjoy it without any regrets.

2621
01:50:00,102 --> 01:50:01,772
No one can beat the person who enjoys herself.

2622
01:50:01,842 --> 01:50:02,902
That's right.

2623
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:07,141
(With each step, )

2624
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:10,542
(she goes to the ring for the final match.)

2625
01:50:11,152 --> 01:50:13,082
(Sae Rok, good luck!)

2626
01:50:13,182 --> 01:50:14,452
I love you.

2627
01:50:15,022 --> 01:50:17,352
(She walks past Uie.)

2628
01:50:17,722 --> 01:50:21,392
(Keum Sae Rok is up.)

2629
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:23,962
Do your best, okay?

2630
01:50:24,632 --> 01:50:25,832
Hold on.

2631
01:50:26,232 --> 01:50:30,132
(Keum Sae Rok enters the ring.)

2632
01:50:34,032 --> 01:50:38,072
(She calms her mind one last time.)

2633
01:50:38,242 --> 01:50:39,472
Sae Rok, please do well.

2634
01:50:40,312 --> 01:50:41,481
This is precious.

2635
01:50:41,482 --> 01:50:42,842
(Nervous)

2636
01:50:42,942 --> 01:50:44,082
Touch gloves.

2637
01:50:44,112 --> 01:50:47,251
(Iron Girls' last match)

2638
01:50:47,252 --> 01:50:49,221
Good luck. Stay calm.

2639
01:50:49,222 --> 01:50:53,322
(It's time to put an end to the 4-month journey.)

2640
01:50:57,222 --> 01:50:58,831
(Finals, Under 51kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Anonymous)

2641
01:50:58,832 --> 01:51:00,031
(Round 1 begins.)

2642
01:51:00,032 --> 01:51:01,102
Box!

2643
01:51:04,572 --> 01:51:06,701
(The opponent attacks first with hooks.)

2644
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:08,571
Circle around.

2645
01:51:08,572 --> 01:51:10,171
(Sae Rok circles around right away.)

2646
01:51:10,172 --> 01:51:11,611
- Circle around. - Go in there.

2647
01:51:11,612 --> 01:51:12,671
Good. There you go.

2648
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:14,382
There you go. Circle around. There you go.

2649
01:51:15,742 --> 01:51:17,381
(Sae Rok's straight)

2650
01:51:17,382 --> 01:51:18,652
(The opponent's right hook)

2651
01:51:20,952 --> 01:51:24,922
(The opponent closes the distance in an aggressive way.)

2652
01:51:25,552 --> 01:51:30,562
(Sae Rok keeps her lead hand forward and looks for the right timing.)

2653
01:51:31,432 --> 01:51:32,831
(The opponent's valid strike: 1)

2654
01:51:32,832 --> 01:51:34,932
(The opponent's valid strike: 2, 3)

2655
01:51:37,832 --> 01:51:38,871
(Sae Rok's jab)

2656
01:51:38,872 --> 01:51:39,931
That's right.

2657
01:51:39,932 --> 01:51:41,371
(The opponent's hook)

2658
01:51:41,372 --> 01:51:42,472
One more time.

2659
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:45,012
Mind the left side.

2660
01:51:46,312 --> 01:51:47,442
Mind the left side.

2661
01:51:48,082 --> 01:51:49,542
Slow down.

2662
01:51:51,152 --> 01:51:52,651
(Sae Rok's flurry of one-twos...)

2663
01:51:52,652 --> 01:51:54,081
(versus the opponent's right hook)

2664
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,982
Stop.

2665
01:51:57,182 --> 01:51:59,021
(Listen to the stop signal!)

2666
01:51:59,022 --> 01:52:00,822
- Blue Corner, don't lock arms! - Keum Sae Rok!

2667
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:06,432
(Blue Corner gets a warning for locking arms.)

2668
01:52:06,832 --> 01:52:07,901
Box.

2669
01:52:07,902 --> 01:52:09,402
(The match resumes.)

2670
01:52:11,072 --> 01:52:12,932
- Go first. - There you go.

2671
01:52:14,972 --> 01:52:17,201
(Sae Rok's straight)

2672
01:52:17,202 --> 01:52:20,572
(The opponent's right hook)

2673
01:52:23,782 --> 01:52:25,612
(The opponent throws a flurry of right hooks.)

2674
01:52:26,282 --> 01:52:28,882
(Sae Rok circles around.)

2675
01:52:36,092 --> 01:52:37,161
There you go.

2676
01:52:37,162 --> 01:52:38,392
Take it to the end.

2677
01:52:38,632 --> 01:52:39,892
Go. Circle around.

2678
01:52:40,532 --> 01:52:41,762
Stop.

2679
01:52:42,362 --> 01:52:43,561
Don't push.

2680
01:52:43,562 --> 01:52:44,732
Don't pull.

2681
01:52:46,102 --> 01:52:50,042
(They get a warning for pushing and pulling the arms.)

2682
01:52:50,372 --> 01:52:51,471
Box.

2683
01:52:51,472 --> 01:52:52,572
(The match resumes.)

2684
01:52:54,242 --> 01:52:55,311
Stop.

2685
01:52:55,312 --> 01:52:57,242
(Round 1 ends.)

2686
01:52:59,882 --> 01:53:00,981
She's aggressive, right?

2687
01:53:00,982 --> 01:53:02,182
It's okay. Sit down.

2688
01:53:02,982 --> 01:53:04,522
Sit down. All right.

2689
01:53:05,892 --> 01:53:07,421
I think she fell behind a bit in Round One.

2690
01:53:07,422 --> 01:53:08,462
A little bit.

2691
01:53:09,222 --> 01:53:10,622
There wasn't a big difference.

2692
01:53:11,662 --> 01:53:13,891
(Round 1 was fierce.)

2693
01:53:13,892 --> 01:53:16,162
(What will be the results?)

2694
01:53:17,602 --> 01:53:19,972
Sae Rok fell behind in Round 1 with the score of 10 to 9.

2695
01:53:20,332 --> 01:53:21,942
I hope she hits the opponent more.

2696
01:53:22,542 --> 01:53:25,172
I hope she stretches out her hands more for jabs and hooks.

2697
01:53:25,212 --> 01:53:27,471
- The punches she throws land. - I know.

2698
01:53:27,472 --> 01:53:29,412
She just needs to throw jabs.

2699
01:53:30,442 --> 01:53:32,682
All of your punches are landing.

2700
01:53:33,312 --> 01:53:35,152
Both your lead hand and rear hand are coming into contact.

2701
01:53:35,622 --> 01:53:36,781
Attack first.

2702
01:53:36,782 --> 01:53:37,892
You can attack first.

2703
01:53:38,352 --> 01:53:40,421
Be careful when the opponent does this.

2704
01:53:40,422 --> 01:53:44,532
Cross-counter or go, two, one, two. Okay?

2705
01:53:44,592 --> 01:53:46,131
What should you do when the opponent follows you?

2706
01:53:46,132 --> 01:53:47,432
Pivot and attack.

2707
01:53:47,492 --> 01:53:49,661
Pivot and attack right away. Remember that.

2708
01:53:49,662 --> 01:53:50,862
Okay? Breathe.

2709
01:53:51,502 --> 01:53:52,932
Seconds out.

2710
01:53:54,002 --> 01:53:55,141
She needs to throw many punches.

2711
01:53:55,142 --> 01:53:56,902
If she wins this round,

2712
01:53:57,002 --> 01:54:00,311
the judges will have a re-vote. So, she needs many good punches.

2713
01:54:00,312 --> 01:54:02,141
She shouldn't save them in this round.

2714
01:54:02,142 --> 01:54:03,342
She needs to attack a lot.

2715
01:54:04,952 --> 01:54:06,481
You're doing well. This is the last round.

2716
01:54:06,482 --> 01:54:07,552
All right.

2717
01:54:08,282 --> 01:54:10,351
(It's the last chance to pour in 4 months of effort.)

2718
01:54:10,352 --> 01:54:11,551
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2719
01:54:11,552 --> 01:54:13,251
- Keum Sae Rok, let's go! - Keum Sae Rok, let's go!

2720
01:54:13,252 --> 01:54:14,622
(Iron Girls' final round)

2721
01:54:15,192 --> 01:54:17,861
(Our last 1 minute and 30 seconds)

2722
01:54:17,862 --> 01:54:19,862
- Let's go. - Sae Rok, let's go.

2723
01:54:19,892 --> 01:54:21,101
(Round 2 begins.)

2724
01:54:21,102 --> 01:54:22,831
Box.

(Sae Rok's valid strike: 1, 2)

2727
01:54:29,202 --> 01:54:30,972
There you go. That's it.

2728
01:54:31,342 --> 01:54:33,542
(A strong straight punch)

2729
01:54:34,412 --> 01:54:37,142
(A slugfest begins.)

2730
01:54:37,642 --> 01:54:40,512
(The opponent follows her persistently.)

2731
01:54:40,612 --> 01:54:41,651
Pivot.

2732
01:54:41,652 --> 01:54:44,322
(Sae Rok pivots quickly.)

2733
01:54:44,922 --> 01:54:46,092
- Pivot and attack. - Good!

2734
01:54:47,492 --> 01:54:48,622
Pivot and attack.

2735
01:54:52,262 --> 01:54:53,991
Pivot and attack.

2736
01:54:53,992 --> 01:54:55,532
There you go. Pivot and attack right away.

2737
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:56,832
There you go.

2738
01:54:57,202 --> 01:54:59,102
- That's it. There you go. - That's it!

2739

(Sae Rok's left hook follows.)

2741
01:55:04,712 --> 01:55:06,842
(She follows it up with the one-two.)

2742
01:55:07,242 --> 01:55:08,911
(One, two)

2743
01:55:08,912 --> 01:55:09,981
(Dodging)

2744
01:55:09,982 --> 01:55:11,682
That was amazing. Well done.

2745
01:55:12,282 --> 01:55:13,511
- Sae Rok, you can do it! - The opponent is exhausted.

2746
01:55:13,512 --> 01:55:14,921
- The opponent is exhausted. - Sae Rok, go in there!

2747
01:55:14,922 --> 01:55:16,522
She needs to get in there.

2748
01:55:22,522 --> 01:55:23,862
- Punch! There you go. - Yes.

2749
01:55:24,222 --> 01:55:25,431
There you go. Throw the one-two.

2750
01:55:25,432 --> 01:55:27,191
There you go. Pivot.

2751
01:55:27,192 --> 01:55:28,301
Pivot and attack.

2752
01:55:28,302 --> 01:55:29,402
Do it again.

2753
01:55:31,172 --> 01:55:33,072
(The opponent attempts a hook.)

2754
01:55:33,632 --> 01:55:34,942
There you go. Go in there.

2755
01:55:35,802 --> 01:55:40,442
(Sae Rok gets past the guard and makes a valid strike.)

2756
01:55:41,042 --> 01:55:42,042
Get in there!

It's the last round. That's right. Go in there.

2760
01:55:53,492 --> 01:55:55,561
Go in there. The opponent is exhausted.

2761
01:55:55,562 --> 01:55:56,792
(Sae Rok's jab gets past the guard.)

2762
01:55:57,692 --> 01:55:59,462

You can't say that she lost.

2782

Sae Rok, well done.

2783
01:56:43,872 --> 01:56:45,741
You used up your energy. Well done.

It was the best you've done.

01:56:56,282 --> 01:56:57,451
You did an amazing job.

2788
01:56:57,452 --> 01:56:59,422
- I have no regrets. - You have no regrets. Let's go.

2789
01:56:59,822 --> 01:57:01,891
(After a match that left no regrets, it's time for the judgment.)

2790
01:57:01,892 --> 01:57:03,621
I think Sae Rok will win.

2791
01:57:03,622 --> 01:57:05,362
Please.

2792
01:57:08,732 --> 01:57:11,672
(The moment of the last judgment)

2793
01:57:12,072 --> 01:57:13,702
Sae Rok has to be the winner.

2794
01:57:14,072 --> 01:57:16,672
- Round Two was amazing. - That's right.

2795
01:57:17,042 --> 01:57:19,712

01:57:51,912 --> 01:57:53,312
She has a chance of winning.

2811
01:57:54,512 --> 01:57:59,952
(The opponent showed heavy hooks.)

2812
01:58:00,382 --> 01:58:05,392
(Sae Rok pressed her with a flurry.)

2813
01:58:05,852 --> 01:58:06,891
Please.

2814
01:58:06,892 --> 01:58:08,791
(What will be the result of the fierce match?)

2815
01:58:08,792 --> 01:58:10,621
- Red. - Red.

2816
01:58:10,622 --> 01:58:12,792
- Red! - Red!

2817
01:58:17,702 --> 01:58:23,602
(Keum Sae Rok wins.)

2818
01:58:25,672 --> 01:58:30,342
(The members are happier than anyone.)

2819
01:58:31,882 --> 01:58:34,281
(Keum Sae Rok wins the national competition.)

2820
01:58:34,282 --> 01:58:35,322
Nice.

2821
01:58:35,882 --> 01:58:37,522
That's right.

2822
01:58:37,722 --> 01:58:40,692
She won all the points in Round Two.

2823
01:58:40,852 --> 01:58:43,522
(We're proud of you, Keum Sae Rok.)

2824
01:58:43,922 --> 01:58:45,931
- Well done. You worked hard. - Thank you.

2825
01:58:45,932 --> 01:58:47,862
- Thank you. - You worked hard.

2826
01:58:48,432 --> 01:58:51,431
(After a fierce match, Sae Rok took the victory.)

2827
01:58:51,432 --> 01:58:53,402
(Staggering)

2828
01:58:53,732 --> 01:58:56,442
Please come forward.

2829
01:58:57,242 --> 01:59:00,612
Gold medal, Keum Sae Rok of Iron Girls.

2830
01:59:01,582 --> 01:59:04,752
(Iron Girls' last boxing champion is born.)

2831
01:59:05,552 --> 01:59:06,712
She fought very well.

2832
01:59:07,112 --> 01:59:08,622
My voice is hoarse.

2833
01:59:08,922 --> 01:59:10,952
Sae Rok won gold like the meaning of her last name.

2834
01:59:12,522 --> 01:59:14,221
(Keum Sae Rok became Gold Sae Rok.)

2835
01:59:14,222 --> 01:59:16,092
Seriously, you fought well.

2836
01:59:16,462 --> 01:59:17,791
(She shares her happiness with her coach.)

2837
01:59:17,792 --> 01:59:19,331
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2838
01:59:19,332 --> 01:59:20,432
You won in the end.

2839
01:59:21,192 --> 01:59:24,331
(Sae Rok leaves the ring with a light heart.)

2840
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:27,502
- Keum Sae Rok! - Go down slowly.

2841
01:59:27,902 --> 01:59:30,802
(The family members cheer happily as well.)

2842
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:33,512
I love you guys.

2843
01:59:34,542 --> 01:59:38,182
(Now that the burden is gone, she shows a big smile.)

2844
01:59:39,152 --> 01:59:40,381
I was so happy...

2845
01:59:40,382 --> 01:59:44,322
that I had a gold medal around my neck.

2846
01:59:44,652 --> 01:59:47,522
I felt proud. I was like, "Is this right?"

2847
01:59:48,922 --> 01:59:53,392
(4 months ago, 2 minutes in the ring seemed to last so long.)

2848
01:59:55,002 --> 02:00:00,702
(Sae Rok was the weakest member of Iron Girls.)

2849
02:00:01,972 --> 02:00:08,012
(However, with tenacious effort, )

2850
02:00:08,312 --> 02:00:13,452
(she pushed hard until the end without giving up.)

2851
02:00:13,782 --> 02:00:18,892
(Sae Rok became the champion.)

2852
02:00:19,452 --> 02:00:22,362
(I did it!)

2853
02:00:22,562 --> 02:00:24,292
Keum Sae Rok!

2854
02:00:25,862 --> 02:00:30,101
(They have a tearful reunion after everything is over.)

2855
02:00:30,102 --> 02:00:32,502
You did well. You did really well.

2856
02:00:33,072 --> 02:00:34,941
(They know how hard Sae Rok has practiced.)

2857
02:00:34,942 --> 02:00:36,102
You did well.

2858
02:00:36,442 --> 02:00:38,311
You did really well.

2859
02:00:38,312 --> 02:00:41,041
You turned the tables in Round Two.

2860
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:43,312
- You came from behind and won. - You came from behind and won.

2861
02:00:43,512 --> 02:00:46,812
Sae Rok won gold like the meaning of her last name.

2862
02:00:47,052 --> 02:00:49,222
I got my last name.

2863
02:00:49,522 --> 02:00:52,422
I'm Gold Sae Rok, not Silver Sae Rok.

2864
02:00:55,962 --> 02:00:57,662
Everyone did a great job. Seriously.

2865
02:00:58,132 --> 02:00:59,531
Everyone was the best.

2866
02:00:59,532 --> 02:01:00,962
(Iron Girls poured out their energy without regrets.)

2867
02:01:01,232 --> 02:01:03,062
I poured out my everything.

2868
02:01:03,662 --> 02:01:05,072
I did my absolute best.

2869
02:01:05,172 --> 02:01:06,731
Seriously. You did well.

2870
02:01:06,732 --> 02:01:09,342
I'm sad that it has ended, but everyone did well.

2871
02:01:09,542 --> 02:01:10,542
Seriously.

2872
02:01:10,543 --> 02:01:12,111
(The challenge was beautiful since they did their best.)

2873
02:01:12,112 --> 02:01:13,712
I'm on the verge of tears.

2874
02:01:14,542 --> 02:01:15,882
Cry, In Ah.

2875
02:01:16,282 --> 02:01:17,842
It's okay to cry today.

2876
02:01:18,042 --> 02:01:19,651
We did it.

2877
02:01:19,652 --> 02:01:20,681
(The two of them won a gold medal in the end.)

2878
02:01:20,682 --> 02:01:22,081
You did really well.

2879
02:01:22,082 --> 02:01:24,551
- You did too. - You were incredible.

2880
02:01:24,552 --> 02:01:26,192
- The punches were well-timed. - You know,

2881
02:01:26,652 --> 02:01:29,361
the Best Boxer in the 20s Award went to...

2882
02:01:29,362 --> 02:01:31,092
- In Ah. - Really?

2883
02:01:31,692 --> 02:01:33,561
- In Ah. - Really?

2884
02:01:33,562 --> 02:01:34,592
Really?

2885
02:01:34,802 --> 02:01:35,831
Really?

2886
02:01:35,832 --> 02:01:37,362
(Was In Ah named the best boxer?)

2887
02:01:37,962 --> 02:01:40,131
- Hey. - She deserves it.

2888
02:01:40,132 --> 02:01:42,771
- She deserves it. - We heard news that In Ah won...

2889
02:01:42,772 --> 02:01:44,241
the Best Boxer in the 20s Award.

2890
02:01:44,242 --> 02:01:45,571
- She deserves it. - That's right.

2891
02:01:45,572 --> 02:01:49,412
(She bursts into tears.)

2892
02:01:51,482 --> 02:01:52,552
Cry.

2893
02:01:53,012 --> 02:01:56,651
(She overcame injuries and achieved a beautiful result.)

2894
02:01:56,652 --> 02:02:00,321
We heard news that In Ah won the Best Boxer in the 20s Award.

2895
02:02:00,322 --> 02:02:01,861
- She deserves it. - That's right.

2896
02:02:01,862 --> 02:02:03,492
Of course. It was the best match.

2897
02:02:04,832 --> 02:02:07,031
- Go and receive the award. - Let's go.

2898
02:02:07,032 --> 02:02:09,962
- Let's go. - There goes In Ah.

2899
02:02:10,102 --> 02:02:12,131
Here comes the best boxer in the 20s.

2900
02:02:12,132 --> 02:02:13,632
The best boxer in the 20s.

2901
02:02:13,872 --> 02:02:16,042
(Congratulations.)

2902
02:02:17,202 --> 02:02:19,372
Here comes the best boxer in the 20s.

2903
02:02:19,742 --> 02:02:22,512
She trained for four months.

2904
02:02:27,252 --> 02:02:29,921
(For the past 4 months, )

2905
02:02:29,922 --> 02:02:34,452
(she used all her might to test her limits.)

2906
02:02:35,062 --> 02:02:39,962
(She experienced the hardship of an injury.)

2907
02:02:40,362 --> 02:02:43,461
(But In Ah got back up...)

2908
02:02:43,462 --> 02:02:46,972
(and won the Best Boxer Award.)

2909
02:02:47,632 --> 02:02:49,342
In Ah, let's go!

2910
02:02:51,142 --> 02:02:54,271
(That's why this moment makes her even more emotional.)

2911
02:02:54,272 --> 02:02:55,882
You won the Best Boxer Award too.

2912
02:02:57,082 --> 02:02:58,681
- Please come this way. - Congratulations.

2913
02:02:58,682 --> 02:02:59,812
(It's time to go on the podium.)

2914
02:03:00,252 --> 02:03:02,782
My goodness.

2915
02:03:04,582 --> 02:03:07,892
(In Ah goes on the podium.)

2916
02:03:07,922 --> 02:03:08,922
This is incredible.

2917
02:03:09,162 --> 02:03:10,291
(You're cool, Seol In Ah!)

2918
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:11,592
There's a certificate too.

2919
02:03:11,962 --> 02:03:14,531
The Best Boxer Award for the women in the 20s division...

2920
02:03:14,532 --> 02:03:16,432
under 54kg.

2921
02:03:16,662 --> 02:03:19,402
The winner is Seol In Ah of Iron Girls.

2922
02:03:20,032 --> 02:03:21,771
(Amateur Boxing Championships, The best boxer, Seol In Ah)

2923
02:03:21,772 --> 02:03:23,872
- Shake hands. - Thank you.

2924
02:03:24,772 --> 02:03:25,842
Guys!

2925
02:03:26,572 --> 02:03:28,281
This is insane.

2926
02:03:28,282 --> 02:03:30,082
- How should I hold it? Like this? - We're proud of you.

2927
02:03:31,182 --> 02:03:32,581
Shouldn't this be on the news?

2928
02:03:32,582 --> 02:03:34,182
Please put it on the news.

2929
02:03:34,682 --> 02:03:36,152
She's cool.

2930
02:03:36,252 --> 02:03:37,951
- She's incredible. - I'll take a photo.

2931
02:03:37,952 --> 02:03:38,952
She's incredible.

2932
02:03:39,352 --> 02:03:41,322
- Is number one in the frame? - Yes, it is.

2933
02:03:42,462 --> 02:03:45,531
(Today's achievement is even more precious.)

2934
02:03:45,532 --> 02:03:49,102
You're the best.

2935
02:03:49,562 --> 02:03:51,162
One, two, three.

2936
02:03:56,542 --> 02:03:58,171
- Don't cry. - This platform is...

2937
02:03:58,172 --> 02:04:00,672
- Let's do this. - Shall we do that?

2938
02:04:03,182 --> 02:04:05,152
I can't believe I'm here with you guys.

2939
02:04:05,552 --> 02:04:07,112
Everyone worked so hard.

2940
02:04:07,382 --> 02:04:09,082
One, two, three.

2941
02:04:14,592 --> 02:04:17,891
We're done.

2942
02:04:17,892 --> 02:04:19,392
(The final tournament ends.)

2943
02:04:19,432 --> 02:04:21,491
Here comes the champion.

2944
02:04:21,492 --> 02:04:22,761
It's over for real.

2945
02:04:22,762 --> 02:04:24,932
All right. Well done, everyone.

2946
02:04:27,272 --> 02:04:29,502
- The results are the best. - We're done.

2947
02:04:29,602 --> 02:04:31,872
Let's go over today's results.

2948
02:04:32,442 --> 02:04:33,612
Two gold medals.

2949
02:04:34,442 --> 02:04:36,812
One silver medal. One bronze medal.

2950
02:04:36,942 --> 02:04:38,211
We have gold, silver, and bronze medals.

2951
02:04:38,212 --> 02:04:40,111
We have all three.

2952
02:04:40,112 --> 02:04:41,481
(They won precious medals after the 4-month journey.)

2953
02:04:41,482 --> 02:04:44,421
And Sae Rok's nickname used to be Silver Sae Rok.

2954
02:04:44,422 --> 02:04:46,521
- It became Gold Sae Rok. - That's right.

2955
02:04:46,522 --> 02:04:47,851
She got her last name back.

2956
02:04:47,852 --> 02:04:49,662
- Sae Rok. - Dad!

2957
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:51,862
I got my last name back!

2958
02:04:52,062 --> 02:04:53,261
(Congratulations.)

2959
02:04:53,262 --> 02:04:56,501
Also... Seriously, I didn't expect this.

2960
02:04:56,502 --> 02:04:58,802
- The best boxer in the 20s... - The Best Boxer Award.

2961
02:04:59,102 --> 02:05:01,701
Is Seol In Ah.

2962
02:05:01,702 --> 02:05:04,001
I've become the Lion King.

2963
02:05:04,002 --> 02:05:05,912
(Simba Seol became the Lion King.)

2964
02:05:06,112 --> 02:05:07,172
Seriously.

2965
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:09,441
To be honest, I wondered at times...

2966
02:05:09,442 --> 02:05:12,811
if the coach was training the members too hard.

2967
02:05:12,812 --> 02:05:15,181
But he achieved these results.

2968
02:05:15,182 --> 02:05:17,452
Our coach played a big role.

2969
02:05:18,282 --> 02:05:19,551
Wear my medal.

2970
02:05:19,552 --> 02:05:21,621
(They give their medals to the coach.)

2971
02:05:21,622 --> 02:05:23,221
To the coach.

2972
02:05:23,222 --> 02:05:25,231
He'll pull his neck muscles.

2973
02:05:25,232 --> 02:05:27,131
- He'll pull his neck muscles. - Here.

2974
02:05:27,132 --> 02:05:28,901
I'll hold it for now.

2975
02:05:28,902 --> 02:05:30,602
(He's moved.)

2976
02:05:30,902 --> 02:05:33,572
When I first received the offer to be on the show,

2977
02:05:33,772 --> 02:05:36,002
I got hung up on the results.

2978
02:05:37,242 --> 02:05:38,271
Because of that,

2979
02:05:38,272 --> 02:05:42,542
I used a strong tone with you guys, so it must have been tough.

2980
02:05:43,112 --> 02:05:50,052
(But he watched them do their best right by their side.)

2981
02:05:50,252 --> 02:05:51,992
Steel yourself and box without any pressure, okay?

2982
02:05:52,252 --> 02:05:56,191
(He realized that the process was more valuable than the outcome.)

2983
02:05:56,192 --> 02:05:58,122
I realized that the process was more important.

2984
02:05:58,432 --> 02:06:02,102
It really was an honor to work with you guys for four months.

2985
02:06:02,202 --> 02:06:03,761
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2986
02:06:03,762 --> 02:06:05,271
It was an honor for us too.

2987
02:06:05,272 --> 02:06:07,501
I remember a moment from the beginning of the season.

2988
02:06:07,502 --> 02:06:09,741
Was it when you sparred against a middle schooler?

2989
02:06:09,742 --> 02:06:12,172
I thought, "It'll be hard."

2990
02:06:12,972 --> 02:06:15,441
You turned away when you took a punch.

2991
02:06:15,442 --> 02:06:18,712
I was so certain that it'd take more than a month or two.

2992
02:06:18,982 --> 02:06:21,311
You took many punches.

2993
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:22,981
(To an expert, Iron Girls' challenge seemed impossible.)

2994
02:06:22,982 --> 02:06:25,592
I thought, "It'll be hard." I thought it was impossible.

2995
02:06:30,892 --> 02:06:33,491
(But Iron Girls achieved their goals through an insane amount of effort.)

2996
02:06:33,492 --> 02:06:35,101
I was so impressed.

2997
02:06:35,102 --> 02:06:36,961
Watching you made me look back upon myself.

2998
02:06:36,962 --> 02:06:40,672
Again, I was very moved.

2999
02:06:41,202 --> 02:06:43,241
- Captain Kim kept our minds strong. - That's right.

3000
02:06:43,242 --> 02:06:44,771
- Thank you so much. - He rooted for us every day.

3001
02:06:44,772 --> 02:06:46,571
- He gave us physical training. - That's right.

3002
02:06:46,572 --> 02:06:48,171
A round of applause for the captain and coach!

3003
02:06:48,172 --> 02:06:49,681
(A round of applause for the captain and coach!)

3004
02:06:49,682 --> 02:06:51,851
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you so much.

3005
02:06:51,852 --> 02:06:53,512
When I think about it,

3006
02:06:53,882 --> 02:06:56,521
all four of you have a gold medal each.

3007
02:06:56,522 --> 02:06:57,982
- That's right. - That's right.

3008
02:06:59,522 --> 02:07:01,621
(Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

3009
02:07:01,622 --> 02:07:04,322
(Women in the 30s division under 54kg 1st place, Uie)

3010
02:07:08,832 --> 02:07:10,961
(Korea Sports Council President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

3011
02:07:10,962 --> 02:07:13,702
(Women in the 30s division under 54kg 1st place, Keum Sae Rok)

3012
02:07:18,512 --> 02:07:20,571
(Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

3013
02:07:20,572 --> 02:07:23,582
(Women in the 30s division under 51kg 1st place, Park Ju Hyun)

3014
02:07:28,282 --> 02:07:30,681
(Korea Sports Council President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

3015
02:07:30,682 --> 02:07:33,252
(Women in the 20s division under 54kg 1st place, Seol In Ah)

3016
02:07:38,092 --> 02:07:39,632
Everyone became a champion.

3017
02:07:40,162 --> 02:07:41,361
Congratulations.

3018
02:07:41,362 --> 02:07:44,902
(All Iron Girls became a boxing champion.)

3019
02:07:46,172 --> 02:07:49,471
(Looking back on the past 4 months)

3020
02:07:49,472 --> 02:07:50,702
Well...

3021
02:07:55,782 --> 02:07:58,582
Iron Girls was...

3022
02:07:59,252 --> 02:08:00,612
very difficult for me.

3023
02:08:01,052 --> 02:08:04,552
My physical strength was very lacking.

3024
02:08:06,692 --> 02:08:09,522
Although I had tried all sorts of sports,

3025
02:08:10,422 --> 02:08:13,291
my physical strength was very lacking...

3026
02:08:13,292 --> 02:08:16,232
compared to that of the members.

3027
02:08:18,702 --> 02:08:20,972
"When I enter the tournament,"

3028
02:08:21,132 --> 02:08:23,272
"I won't be able to do anything in Round Two."

3029
02:08:24,972 --> 02:08:30,282
(Knowing what she lacked, she trained harder.)

3030
02:08:32,482 --> 02:08:36,352
(She analyzed and studied the boxing techniques endlessly.)

3031
02:08:37,422 --> 02:08:39,651
(Compared to 4 months ago, )

3032
02:08:39,652 --> 02:08:42,362
(her physical strength improved dramatically.)

3033
02:08:43,622 --> 02:08:46,132
My opponent got exhausted,

3034
02:08:46,262 --> 02:08:47,992
but I held out until the end.

3035
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:53,032
I truly have no regrets.

3036
02:08:53,502 --> 02:08:55,132
I was sincere.

3037
02:08:55,602 --> 02:08:57,042
I was truly passionate.

3038
02:08:57,902 --> 02:09:01,642
Entering the ring was enough to scare me.

3039
02:09:02,882 --> 02:09:05,852
My heart beat so fast.

3040
02:09:06,512 --> 02:09:08,411
I kept retching.

3041
02:09:08,412 --> 02:09:09,881
(Uie became more nervous than the other members.)

3042
02:09:09,882 --> 02:09:11,052
I mean,

3043
02:09:11,582 --> 02:09:13,121
what if I came down the ring...

3044
02:09:13,122 --> 02:09:14,851
without the chance to do anything I've practiced?

3045
02:09:14,852 --> 02:09:16,222
That thought scared me the most.

3046
02:09:17,822 --> 02:09:21,532
(She stood out as the ace in terms of stamina.)

3047
02:09:22,502 --> 02:09:25,161
No matter how much I punched the mitts...

3048
02:09:25,162 --> 02:09:27,002
and had the supervised sparring with the coach,

3049
02:09:27,902 --> 02:09:31,002
I didn't seem to get better. It made me upset.

3050
02:09:31,202 --> 02:09:34,012
(Uie became small when it came to boxing.)

3051
02:09:35,682 --> 02:09:38,482
(However, she got back up again.)

3052
02:09:39,882 --> 02:09:43,722
(Uie dedicated herself to training.)

3053
02:09:44,352 --> 02:09:45,821
I did my best.

3054
02:09:45,822 --> 02:09:48,692
(I did my best.)

3055
02:09:49,092 --> 02:09:52,131
Had I thought, "I should've tried a bit harder,"

3056
02:09:52,132 --> 02:09:53,892
I would've cried on the spot.

3057
02:09:54,332 --> 02:09:57,502
But my heart felt so light that I didn't have any regrets.

3058
02:09:57,802 --> 02:09:59,931
(Uie showed the biggest smile on the ring.)

3059
02:09:59,932 --> 02:10:02,101
I'm very happy.

3060
02:10:02,102 --> 02:10:03,402
(I'm very happy that I had a match I didn't regret.)

3061
02:10:03,972 --> 02:10:07,442
I'm not ashamed of how I've trained in the past four months.

3062
02:10:08,412 --> 02:10:11,982
The first and the biggest wall...

3063
02:10:12,112 --> 02:10:15,482
was the fear of hitting and getting hit.

3064
02:10:15,922 --> 02:10:18,552
Being someone who rarely gets scared...

3065
02:10:18,852 --> 02:10:20,621
or nervous,

3066
02:10:20,622 --> 02:10:22,562
I thought, "Doing this won't be a problem."

3067
02:10:22,662 --> 02:10:25,891
But when I watched the members box...

3068
02:10:25,892 --> 02:10:27,761
before my eyes,

3069
02:10:27,762 --> 02:10:29,101
I was shocked.

3070
02:10:29,102 --> 02:10:30,502
(Watching people box made her scared of boxing.)

3071
02:10:33,802 --> 02:10:36,472
Tears fell down my face.

3072
02:10:37,542 --> 02:10:41,342
(Fear came before excitement.)

3073
02:10:41,712 --> 02:10:43,881
But there was no way around it.

3074
02:10:43,882 --> 02:10:46,852
I just had to do it.

3075
02:10:48,082 --> 02:10:52,792
(Despite her busy schedule, she improved her stamina.)

3076
02:10:53,122 --> 02:10:56,562
I kept trying to overcome...

3077
02:10:56,662 --> 02:10:59,532
the fear inside me.

3078
02:11:01,662 --> 02:11:05,201
(Ju Hyun entered the ring countless times.)

3079
02:11:05,202 --> 02:11:08,001
I think the process played a part...

3080
02:11:08,002 --> 02:11:11,372
in making me stronger and more level-headed.

3081
02:11:12,242 --> 02:11:14,742
I never thought that I'd achieve something like that.

3082
02:11:15,612 --> 02:11:16,842
It's a big change.

3083
02:11:17,712 --> 02:11:20,211
I think it was a good experience.

3084
02:11:20,212 --> 02:11:21,882
(She achieved an unimaginable growth in the past 4 months.)

3085
02:11:22,382 --> 02:11:23,821
(And...)

3086
02:11:23,822 --> 02:11:25,182
I had never thought...

3087
02:11:25,422 --> 02:11:27,752
of stopping due to an injury.

3088
02:11:28,892 --> 02:11:32,392
(She became exhausted on the ring and sustained an injury.)

3089
02:11:33,262 --> 02:11:34,892
It was the hardest.

3090
02:11:35,262 --> 02:11:37,261
I had practiced with all my might,

3091
02:11:37,262 --> 02:11:38,971
so needing to stop...

3092
02:11:38,972 --> 02:11:40,832
because an injury was very...

3093
02:11:42,642 --> 02:11:46,071
(The injury was hard to accept since she had worked very hard.)

3094
02:11:46,072 --> 02:11:48,981
When I thought about the members, production crew,

3095
02:11:48,982 --> 02:11:51,242
coach, captain, and family members...

3096
02:11:51,512 --> 02:11:53,182
who were worried about me,

3097
02:11:53,482 --> 02:11:56,622
I wondered if I was being too stubborn. But in the end...

3098
02:11:56,822 --> 02:11:58,991
(July 31, Thursday: I want to box. August 1, Friday: I want to box.)

3099
02:11:58,992 --> 02:12:00,951
Even when I was taking time off due to an injury,

3100
02:12:00,952 --> 02:12:02,762
I really wanted to box.

3101
02:12:03,622 --> 02:12:04,822
It's so much fun.

3102
02:12:05,662 --> 02:12:07,092
It's so much fun. Seriously.

3103
02:12:07,892 --> 02:12:12,672
(She enjoyed boxing more than anyone.)

3104
02:12:13,072 --> 02:12:14,632
It's fun to watch myself grow.

3105
02:12:14,732 --> 02:12:17,571
It's fun to try again after doing something badly.

3106
02:12:17,572 --> 02:12:18,741
(In Ah was the happiest when she boxed.)

3107
02:12:18,742 --> 02:12:20,572
The entire process is fun.

3108
02:12:21,512 --> 02:12:24,841
That was why I made an effort to recover quickly.

3109
02:12:24,842 --> 02:12:28,852
(In Ah trained passionately since she liked boxing very much.)

3110
02:12:29,782 --> 02:12:32,082
In the end, I returned...

3111
02:12:32,552 --> 02:12:34,051
and entered the ring.

3112
02:12:34,052 --> 02:12:35,091
(In the end, she entered the ring again.)

3113
02:12:35,092 --> 02:12:36,692
It made me very happy.

3114
02:12:37,962 --> 02:12:39,491
The sense of accomplishment is so big.

3115
02:12:39,492 --> 02:12:41,161
Being on Iron Girls always makes me realize...

3116
02:12:41,162 --> 02:12:42,501
how I can lead a fun life...

3117
02:12:42,502 --> 02:12:44,331
and set up a happy routine.

3118
02:12:44,332 --> 02:12:45,362
(A sense of accomplishment and joy followed after she overcame all.)

3119
02:12:45,632 --> 02:12:48,071
My expectations and imagination...

3120
02:12:48,072 --> 02:12:50,102
weren't as great as the ending I had today.

3121
02:12:55,212 --> 02:12:59,112
(Iron Girls overcame the time of fear through sweat.)

3122
02:12:59,352 --> 02:13:01,551
(Uie, Keum Sae Rok, Park Ju Hyun, Seol In Ah)

3123
02:13:01,552 --> 02:13:05,852
(There were big and small injuries, )

3124
02:13:06,522 --> 02:13:11,762
(but the four of them overcame all and entered the ring.)

3125
02:13:12,992 --> 02:13:16,402
(What's the takeaway for Iron Girls?)

3126
02:13:16,832 --> 02:13:18,832
I'm really proud of myself.

3127
02:13:19,702 --> 02:13:22,502
I was very scared,

3128
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:25,672
but I pulled through until the very end.

3129
02:13:26,142 --> 02:13:29,782
I like myself very much.

3130
02:13:30,742 --> 02:13:33,152
The impactful lesson was,

3131
02:13:33,412 --> 02:13:35,051
"I can do anything I set my mind to."

3132
02:13:35,052 --> 02:13:36,052
(I can do anything I set my mind to.)

3133
02:13:36,053 --> 02:13:39,522
I was so moved when I realized...

3134
02:13:40,292 --> 02:13:42,762
that hard work actually paid off.

3135
02:13:43,662 --> 02:13:45,062
Unbelievable!

3136
02:13:45,862 --> 02:13:47,692
I used to think, "There's no way I can win a medal."

3137
02:13:48,902 --> 02:13:50,162
But it actually happened.

3138
02:13:52,572 --> 02:13:55,271
I gained so much confidence. I can do it too.

3139
02:13:55,272 --> 02:13:56,972
I can do it without getting scared.

3140
02:13:57,572 --> 02:14:00,341
The one who challenges herself to do what she likes...

3141
02:14:00,342 --> 02:14:02,172
and puts in the effort is invincible.

3142
02:14:02,612 --> 02:14:04,741
For four months,

3143
02:14:04,742 --> 02:14:07,412
I dedicated myself fully to the boxing training.

3144
02:14:07,782 --> 02:14:09,452
I want to thank...

3145
02:14:09,982 --> 02:14:13,052
everyone who has sparred with me for my sake.

3146
02:14:13,752 --> 02:14:15,621
Just as we were serious about boxing,

3147
02:14:15,622 --> 02:14:17,521
our opponents...

3148
02:14:17,522 --> 02:14:19,331
competed with all their might.

3149
02:14:19,332 --> 02:14:21,192
I thought it was very cool.

3150
02:14:22,462 --> 02:14:24,161
For 2 rounds of 1 minute and 30 seconds each,

3151
02:14:24,162 --> 02:14:26,031
we fought to the best of our abilities...

3152
02:14:26,032 --> 02:14:28,072
and wrapped up with a smile.

3153
02:14:28,632 --> 02:14:30,241
I think that's the charm of boxing.

3154
02:14:30,242 --> 02:14:32,172
(The charm of boxing)

3155
02:14:32,442 --> 02:14:34,412
The more I learned about boxing,

3156
02:14:34,742 --> 02:14:39,081
the more I realized, "I need to focus on myself."

3157
02:14:39,082 --> 02:14:41,682
Seriously, every sport is a fight against oneself.

3158
02:14:43,052 --> 02:14:45,591
"Who your opponent is doesn't change a thing."

3159
02:14:45,592 --> 02:14:47,022
"You just need to do your own thing."

3160
02:14:47,722 --> 02:14:50,661
Overcoming yourself is more important...

3161
02:14:50,662 --> 02:14:52,392
than the outcome.

3162
02:14:53,332 --> 02:14:54,392
I think...

3163
02:14:55,192 --> 02:14:57,962
I've won the fight against myself.

3164
02:15:01,002 --> 02:15:03,902
I couldn't have done this by myself.

3165
02:15:04,402 --> 02:15:07,872
The days I trained alone were the absolute worst.

3166
02:15:08,472 --> 02:15:10,912
A group of 3 was more fun than a group of 2.

3167
02:15:11,212 --> 02:15:13,682
A group of four made me happier and more passionate...

3168
02:15:13,782 --> 02:15:14,952
than a group of three.

3169
02:15:15,552 --> 02:15:18,352
My teammates always told me that I was the best.

3170
02:15:18,682 --> 02:15:21,892
I received a lot of love, so it was nice.

3171
02:15:21,952 --> 02:15:23,091
- I love you. - I love you.

3172
02:15:23,092 --> 02:15:24,222
- We can do it. - I love you.

3173
02:15:25,162 --> 02:15:29,261
(Iron Girls finished yet another race...)

3174
02:15:29,262 --> 02:15:34,402
(together.)

3175
02:15:34,602 --> 02:15:36,501
- Iron... - Iron...

3176
02:15:36,502 --> 02:15:43,012
- Girls! - Girls!

3177
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:50,922
(Cheering you on in your fight)
