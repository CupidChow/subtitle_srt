1
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:34,976
(Finally, the first tournament)

2
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,516
Uie's opponent...

3
00:00:36,716 --> 00:00:40,186
(Uie's opponent was suddenly disqualified.)

4
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:43,156
(Uie decided to prepare for the finals.)

5
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:48,526
(The other members prepared for their matches.)

6
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:52,025
In the Red Corner, Iron Girls' Seol In Ah.

7
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:55,636
(Finally, the tournament begins)

8
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:59,106
Keep going, In Ah.

9
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:00,876
Three.

10
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:02,436
What? It's a knockout.

11
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,846
Go after her. There you go.

12
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:07,215
Her willpower is insane.

13
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,656
(Iron Girls poured in their effort.)

14
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:09,976
There you go.

15
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,315
Yes. Block it.

16
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:13,916
(After a fierce back-and-forth, )

17
00:01:14,316 --> 00:01:19,126
(all members of Iron Girls advanced to the final.)

18
00:01:19,386 --> 00:01:20,495
We won!

19
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:23,566
(Will they be able to win in the final as well?)

20
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,365
(The day of the final of the boxing tournament)

21
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,865
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:28,895
- Hello.
- Hello.

23
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,636
- Hello.
- Hello.

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,835
- Captain, save me.
- What's wrong?

25
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:33,836
- Uie.
- My first match will be...

26
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:35,876
- the final.
- You'll have the first match today.

27
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:38,246
- How did this happen?
- The first match.

28
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,575
Yesterday,

29
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,675
you were well-rested and in the best condition.

30
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:44,686
- She woke up at 2am today.
- She woke up at 2am.

31
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:47,155
When I lay down on the sofa in the living room,

32
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,215
my heartbeats were like the club music.

33
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,285
(Boom, boom)

34
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,085
I could hear them.

35
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:53,555
You can tell that she hasn't slept, right?

36
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:55,096
She's haggard.

37
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,225
She's like how we were yesterday.

38
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:59,725
Uie, although you're nervous now,

39
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:03,265
I'm sure that your routine will come out as the time approaches.

40
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:04,405
- Of course.
- Okay.

41
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:05,726
Would you loosen your grip a bit?

42
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:06,875
(Iron grip)

43
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,876
- It's natural to be nervous.
- She has an iron grip.

44
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,605
- She has an iron grip.
- You're alone in this situation.

45
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,286
- That's right.
- So, it's understandable.

46
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,606
Uie, you'll do well.

47
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,175
The other three members had a match before.

48
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,745
- I'm more nervous today.
- Are you more nervous?

49
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:17,785
- Of course.
- The thing is,

50
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,515
- I'm more nervous today as well.
- Why?

51
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:21,656
Now, I want to do well.

52
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,256
I saw my opponent yesterday.

53
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:25,855
Instead of being nervous,

54
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,055
- I'm just...
- You're scared, right?

55
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:28,056
(You're scared, right?)

56
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,126
I'm like, "Let's survive!"

57
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:30,566
It's a survival.

58
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:32,965
(Ju Hyun watched the match of her opponent for the final.)

59
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,236
The boxer in red.

60
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:35,565
She's Ju Hyun's opponent.

61
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:36,835
Watch the boxer in red carefully.

62
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,156
Watch the boxer in red carefully.

63
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,236
- What?
- Gosh. What's that?

64
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,246
(The boxer from the red corner charged at her opponent.)

65
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,646
(She had the attacking style of charging endlessly.)

66
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:48,415
Her stamina is insane.

67
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,545
(The incessant attacks scared her.)

68
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:50,786
Is she a zombie?

69
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,685
Ju Hyun, you'll have a big match tomorrow.

70
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:53,915
You'll have a big match.

71
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:54,955
(She had a big match planned for the final.)

72
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:55,956
What?

73
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,455
"Let's not get devoured."

74
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:59,125
- It'll be neck-and-neck.
- The match of the century.

75
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,526
If you box like you did yesterday, you'll win a gold medal.

76
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:03,055
Her attacking pattern was too simple.

77
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,965
You just need to avoid falling into that simple trap.

78
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:05,995
- Really?
- Yes.

79
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,995
However, since this is the final, you need to stay a bit more alert.

80
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:11,565
- Okay.
- Keep that in mind.

81
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,566
All right.

82
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,306
Now, I'll share the order of your matches.

83
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:16,705
- Seol In Ah, - Yes?

84
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:17,776
You're number five.

85
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,545
Park Ju Hyun, you're number eight.

86
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,545
- Uie, you're number nine.
- What?

87
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:23,016
Keum Sae Rok, you're number ten.

88
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:24,845
I can't believe it.

89
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,616
(Their matches will be back-to-back.)

90
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,586
(The order of their matches in the preliminary round)

91
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,655
(Number 32, number 36, number 39, number 41)

92
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:32,885
(3 matches)

93
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:34,325
(2 matches)

94
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:36,495
(1 match)

95
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,766
(There were matches in between.)

96
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,596
(Today, three members' matches are back-to-back.)

97
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,006
It's the very next match.

98
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:47,405
The coach and the boxer...

99
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:50,645
usually chat while watching the previous match, right?

100
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:51,705
When this happens, they can't do that.

101
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,306
The boxer needs to get ready by herself.

102
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:56,016
(Yesterday, during the preliminary round.)

103
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:58,846
(the members were on standby with the coach.)

104
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:02,316
(However, they must be on standby alone.)

105
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,936
(It's bad news for Uie who'll have her first match today.)

106
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,825
- What will you do, Uie?
- It's okay.

107
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,855
- I can do it.
- You should have that experience.

108
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,426
- Got it.
- Oh, no.

109
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,325
Still, it's Uie's first match.

110
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:13,936
- It's okay.
- Uie will do well.

111
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,695
Let's go inside...

112
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:17,765
- and eat before we warm up.
- We need to eat.

113
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,535
- Let's eat and get ready.
- Let's hurry up.

114
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:20,735
- Let's go.
- Okay. Today as well,

115
00:04:20,736 --> 00:04:22,405
- let's avoid injuries and have fun.
- Let's go.

116
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,575
Let's do this. Let's go.

117
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:24,705
Let's go.

118
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:27,346
(1 hour before the boxing tournament begins)

119
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,045
I'm nervous.

120
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,922
(Iron Girls change into their uniforms after a meal.)

121
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:34,185
(While the three who experienced the preliminary round get ready)

122
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,256
It's okay.

123
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,356
The best in Seoul.

124
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:39,886
(Uie changes into her uniform for the first time.)

125
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,626
Finally, Uie will have her first match.

126
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,025
It's my first time wearing the uniform.

127
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,026
It's nice.

128
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:51,466
(She checks the headgear ahead of time.)

129
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:56,336
(After checking the strength of the hits, )

130
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:01,016
(she begins to wrap her hands.)

131
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:05,186
I can't wrap my hands because they're shaking.

132
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:06,915
(Shaking)

133
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,786
(She manages to calm her mind.)

134
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,755
Let's come down from the ring without any regrets.

135
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,636
(They're busy getting ready for their matches.)

136
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,596
Let's come down from the ring without any regrets.

137
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:17,965
- Ju Hyun, what are you doing?
- I got this.

138
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,366
That's insane.

139
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,276
She's applying the undereye eyeliner.

140
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:24,366
(Fierce)

141
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:26,836
(Let's not lose in terms of gaze.)

142
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,556
(Is there eyeliner for intimidation?)

143
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,046
(I'll draw it this thick.)

144
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,816
(She planned the intimidation method over ten days ago.)

145
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,415
(What do you think? Do I look strong?)

146
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,416
Do I look strong?

147
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:40,816
Hey, it's no joke. You look scary.

148
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,216
That's good.

149
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,216
That's good.

150
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:44,986
That's good.

151
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:47,926
(She's ready.)

152
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,695
(2025 Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

153
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,026
(30 minutes before the boxing tournament begins)

154
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:58,566
(Other boxers begin to warm up.)

155
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,206
(The first match of the final begins.)

156
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:05,576
(As a fierce match takes place, )

157
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,516
(Iron Girls begin to warm up.)

158
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,225
There you go. After a jab comes a two.

159
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,226
There you go.

160
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:23,226
Hook, jab.

161
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:24,796
- Pivot, jab.
- There you go.

162
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:26,065
- Shuffle, - Shuffle.

163
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,366
- jab, jab.
- Jab. There you go.

164
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,366
(In Ah will go first.)

165
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,505
Don't go overboard.

166
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,736
(In Ah will go first.)

167
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,836
Have confidence in your fists.

168
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,575
Have confidence in your fists.

169
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,606
(She seems to be very nervous.)

170
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:45,916
(In the preliminary round, In Ah's opponent showed strong punches.)

171
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,016
- Coach.
- It's okay.

172
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,656
She's good.

173
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:49,915
The boxer in red is better.

174
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,562
- The boxer in red will win.
- She seems sturdy.

175
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,826
The boxer in red has a good guard.

176
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,356
When she goes in...

177
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:56,995
Does she have heavy punches?

178
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,436
She's the type to go for infighting.

179
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:01,035
I'm so nervous.

180
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,165
- What?
- I'm so nervous.

181
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,566
Are you nervous? It's okay.

182
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,105
- There's no need to be nervous.
- She's good at this.

183
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,136
This.

184
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,506
When she does that, pivot.

185
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,175
(They practice right away.)

186
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,245
Then this will happen.

187
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:13,946
- Will I be able to see it?
- Yes. Listen.

188
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:15,476
When she does this, just pivot.

189
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,346
Doing that will be enough.

190
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,015
Please save me.

191
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,085
Why am I so nervous today?

192
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:22,006
(She calms her nervous heart with great effort.)

193
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:25,626
- Fight for yourself today.
- Okay.

194
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,825
(The preliminary round is over.)

195
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:28,926
Let's go.

196
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,896
(What remains is one match in the final round.)

197
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:38,336
(They enter the stadium feeling nervous.)

198
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:42,406
(The member who's going first, In Ah sits down.)

199
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,276
(Nervous)

200
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,875
(Uie enters in a nervous state.)

201
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,976
There she is!

202
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,586
(A group of people cheers loudly upon seeing Uie.)

203
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,886
(Who are the friends Uie is greeting with enthusiasm?)

204
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:58,086
(They're the actors who were in a play with Uie.)

205
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:03,126
(They became tight as they took the stage together.)

206
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,666
(Actress Im Soo Hyang, Actress Park Ha Sun)

207
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,566
(She feels so grateful that she tears up.)

208
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,795
Park Ju Hyun!

209
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:11,512
(Right next to them, Ju Hyun's dad is ready to cheer.)

210
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,906
(Dad, you're here.)

211
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,976
(Uie and Ju Hyun feel less nervous thanks to their cheers.)

212
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:20,446
(Meanwhile, )

213
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:24,516
(In Ah's mouth goes dry as she's going first.)

214
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:29,956
(In Ah's match approaches.)

215
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:38,896
(She drinks water and moves to ease her nerves.)

216
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,436
Believe in yourself, okay?

217
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:47,505
(She steels her heart until the end.)

218
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:48,775
The first one,

219
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:49,776
- In Ah.
- In Ah.

220
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,776
In Ah, go and get ready.

221
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:52,806
(It's time to go and get ready for the final.)

222
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,215
Let's go, Seol In Ah!

223
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,246
(Let's go, Seol In Ah!)

224
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:57,515
(In Ah sets out for the first final in her life.)

225
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,585
Coach, please take this.

226
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,546
(In Ah sets out for the first final in her life.)

227
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:01,885
The hands.

228
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,286
Okay. Let's go.

229
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,186
All right.

230
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:13,226
(She wore the headgear many times, )

231
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:18,506
(but the final feels different.)

232
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:20,775
Since this will be the last match,

233
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,676
- shall we tighten the gloves?
- Okay.

234
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:24,952
- Isn't it better to tighten them?
- Yes, it is.

235
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,006
Afterward,

236
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:27,715
tell us what is was like.

237
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,516
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- It's okay.

238
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:31,185
It's okay.

239
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:32,792
(As the match approaches, she becomes more nervous.)

240
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,056
I can do it.

241
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,286
I even survived the tough training.

242
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,026
Think of it as punching a sandbag.

243
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,676
- Shadowbox.
- Don't get intimidated. It's okay.

244
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,525
You've trained a lot.

245
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:44,795
- I've trained a lot.
- That's right.

246
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:46,165
I can say that without shame.

247
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,696
That's right. You've trained a lot.

248
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,036
Do you want to put on the headgear first?

249
00:09:50,196 --> 00:09:51,405
Let's go.

250
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:54,136
(In Ah's opponent is getting ready as well.)

251
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:58,146
(Kim Yeo Jin, 20s, under 54kg)

252
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:02,546
(Boxing experience: 1 year and 7 months)

253
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,515
The boxer in red is really good.

254
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:06,015
(In Ah's opponent, the boxer in red, is really good.)

255
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:07,115
I'm nervous.

256
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,486
It's more nerve-racking to watch.

257
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,986
(Everyone expects that it'll be a tough match.)

258
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,055
- Go in!
- Let's go!

259
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,225
- Let's see.
- Let's go!

260
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,366
Put your guard up.

261
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,666
Go ahead.

262
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,126
There you go.

263
00:10:20,226 --> 00:10:21,465
There you go. Then...

264
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,066
That will come in handy. Go ahead.

265
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:24,806
There you go.

266
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,506
That's what you need to do.

267
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:30,306
(As she takes deep breaths, she goes over the techniques.)

268
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:32,046
I can do it.

269
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:33,876
I can do it. Let's come out as ash.

270
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,846
I'll just collapse in the ring.

271
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:37,786
I'll pour out all of my energy.

272
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:40,686
Hey, my sister.

273
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,356
Ju Hyun, I'll do well.

274
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,055
Have fun, okay?

275
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,955
- Have fun, king of the animals.
- I'll do well.

276
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,826
- I'll do well.
- Have fun.

277
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:50,965
- I love you.
- All of us can do it.

278
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,825
- I'll root for you guys afterward.
- Let's believe in ourselves.

279
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,565
I'll root for you guys afterward.

280
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,265
- Do well.
- Do what you want to do, okay?

281
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,266
You can do it.

282
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,136
I can do this!

283
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:01,436
Let's go.

284
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:05,106
(Seol In Ah steps up.)

285
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:08,146
(Final, Under 54kg: Kim Yeo Jin versus Seol In Ah)

286
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,416
In the Blue Corner, Iron Girls' Seol In Ah.

287
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,715
- Go, Seol In Ah!
- Go, Seol In Ah!

288
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,286
Let's go!

289
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,386
- Go, Red Corner!
- You got this!

290
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:22,526
(The members are nervous too.)

291
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:28,636
(The captain's face takes on a set expression.)

292
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,106
(In Ah is ready.)

293
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:36,536
(She takes her first step into the ring for the final.)

294
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:38,945
Just stay calm and give it your all.

295
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:41,846
You don't have to overdo it, though.

296
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,086
Okay? Don't rush things.

297
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:48,086
(The referee is checking the opponent's gear.)

298
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:50,486
Seol In Ah, let's go!

299
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:55,026
(In Ah is doing her final check.)

300
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,366
(2025 Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup Boxing Tournament)

301
00:11:58,526 --> 00:11:59,566
Let's go.

302
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,646
Have a clean fight and don't hit below the belt.

303
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:02,896
Touch gloves.

304
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:04,406
Back to your corners.

305
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:06,035
- Go, Seol In Ah!
- One, two, three.

306
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:08,506
- Go, Seol In Ah!
- Go, Seol In Ah!

307
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:09,736
Go ahead and do it, In Ah.

308
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:11,976
Box.

309
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:13,906
(Round 1 begins.)

310
00:12:14,046 --> 00:12:15,515
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Kim Yeo Jin versus Seol In Ah)

311
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:16,915
That's it. Continue your footwork.

312
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,946
- That's it.
- Punch.

313
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,315
- You should attack right away.
- Attack right away.

314
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:22,716
- Good. Keep going.
- There you go.

315
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,456
Stop.

316
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:27,895
(Both boxers are warned for their passive attacks.)

317
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:28,896
Box.

318
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,626
- Punch.
- Good.

319
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,326
Nice. Keep going.

320
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,995
(Once again, the opponent strikes first.)

321
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:39,036
- Good. Keep going like that.
- You're doing well.

322
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,806
Go.

323
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,235
- That's it.
- Okay.

324
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:45,476
- Good. That's it.
- Punch. Again.

325
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,405
Punch until the end. That's it.

326
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,946
Good. Keep going until the end. Once again.

327
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:53,246
- Again.
- You're doing well until the end.

328
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,285
- Punch. That's it. Good.
- Yes.

329
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,686
- Good.
- That's it. Again.

330
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,785
You can do this. That was good. Well done.

331
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,726
(A jab followed by a straight)

332
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,366
(A slugfest follows.)

333
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,696
(In Ah's straight and the opponent's hook)

334
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:10,296
(In Ah's straight)

335
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,036
- That's it. Good. Step back.
- Stop.

336
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,106
Stop.

337
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:16,376
(The referee stops the match once again.)

338
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,576
(The Red Corner is warned to keep her head up.)

339
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,305
It's okay. Keep trying a cross-counter.

340
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:21,215
- Box.
- Go, Seol In Ah.

341
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,816
(The match resumes.)

342
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:23,976
Go.

343
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,515
- You can do this.
- She can't see.

344
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,656
(With constant feints, )

345
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,916
(the two boxers wait for the right time to attack.)

346
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:35,996
(Fiercely exchanging punches)

347
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,895
(The opponent's valid strikes: 1)

348
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:39,325

- Circle around.

353
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,045
- Go!
- That's it. Good.

354
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,315
There you go. Step back.

355
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,276
- Circle around.
- That's it.

356
00:13:56,446 --> 00:13:58,245
Circle around. There you go.

357
00:13:58,246 --> 00:13:59,285
Stop.

358
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:02,016
(Round 1 ends.)

359
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,825
(In Ah safely finished Round 1.)

360
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:05,956
Breathe.

361
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,526
You did well. Good job.

362
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:15,136
It was good.

363
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,035
Even your hooks landed well, right?

364
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,306
You wait too long after a jab.

365
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,375
Just throw a one-two and a jab.

366
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:23,836
Then throw another one-two.

367
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,206
Throw a one-two and then wait.

368
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:28,746
It's not hard, right? Are you all right?

369
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,775
- She has a long reach, so...
- I know.

370
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,345
I told you to just avoid her front hand.

371
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:33,845
You can dodge and punch.

372
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,356
You made good cross-counters.

373
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:36,585
Keep side-stepping.

374
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,146
If your punches don't land, weave and retreat to the side. Okay?

375
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,286
You can do this.

376
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,726
She was a little outplayed in Round One.

377
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:45,456
She has to show something in Round Two.

378
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,586
There wasn't much of a difference.

379
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,436
The opponent is really strong.

380
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,005
In Ah is doing a great job.

381
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,206
(In Ah is doing well against a strong opponent.)

382
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,705
- Try a high-low combination.
- Okay.

383
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:56,952
(In Ah needs to show her prowess in Round 2.)

384
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,305
- Seol In Ah!
- Seol In Ah!

385
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:00,546
- Go, Seol In Ah!
- Let's go!

386
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,286
(The members are watching her.)

387
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:06,085
I can do this.

388
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,356
(I can do this.)

389
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,426
(She pulls herself together and does her footwork.)

390
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,556
Ready.

391
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,195
- All right. You're the best, In Ah.
- Box.

392
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,676
- You're the best.
- You can do this.

393
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:19,266
(Simba Seol steps up again.)

394
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,395
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Kim Yeo Jin versus Seol In Ah)

395
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:23,336
It's the last round. Watch out for body shots.

396
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,906
- Good.
- That's it.

397
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,976
- One, two...
- Well done!

398
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:31,245
(A perfect right hook)

399
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,606
(A jab followed.)

400
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:40,146
(The right hook landed perfectly.)

401
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,815
- There you go!
- Stop.

402
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,756
(A standing eight count for the Red Corner)

403
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:46,485
It's a standing eight count.

404
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,096
The opponent got a clean hit.

405
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:49,726
Stop. Take a step forward.

406
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:52,025
Good job. Wait over there.

407
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,225
(Standing 8 count: If a boxer is judged...)

408
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:54,465
(unable to continue safely, the referee counts...)

409
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,965
(from 1 to 8 to determine whether the match can go on.)

410
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,512
(Failure to recover within the count may result in a K.O.)

411
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,466
(After checking the boxer's condition, )

412
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:01,506
Step forward. Box.

413
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,536
(the match resumes.)

414
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,305
(In Ah keeps the momentum going and attacks first.)

415
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,516
- Go.
- Jab and go in.

416
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,046
Keep going. Good.

417
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,616
You're doing well.

418
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,756
- Go, Seol In Ah!
- Go, Seol In Ah!

419
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:17,926
Again. That's it.

420
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,425
That's it. Good!

421
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,225
Circle around. There you go.

422
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:23,026
Yes! Turn around.

423
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,196
Good.

424
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:30,966
(In Ah's straight flurry)

425
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:33,865
- Good.
- Circle around.

426
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,306
(The opponent's right hook)

427
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,645
(A fierce slugfest)

428
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,145
- Get out of it.
- There you go. Nice.

429
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,276
That's it!

430
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:48,086
(A powerful right hook)

431
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:50,015
Good. That's it!

432
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,626
(And a body shot follows.)

433
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:52,985
Good.

434
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:54,225
(In Ah lands a series of valid strikes.)

435
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,026
You're almost there. You're doing a good job.

436
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,765
- She's coming in.
- Go, In Ah.

437
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,366
Continue your footwork. Good.

438
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:04,265
All right. You're doing well.

439
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,935
Punch. You should counter a cross. That's it.

440
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:08,806
(The opponent forces In Ah into a corner, allowing punches.)

441
00:17:12,206 --> 00:17:14,746
(Body shot)

442
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,686
(A right hook)

443
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,385
(In Ah tries to escape, )

444
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:25,086
(but she is once again cornered by a fierce attack.)

445
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:29,056
(After the opponent's one-two, )

446
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,966
(In Ah allows another valid strike with her guard down.)

447
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,836
(She calls up her last reserves of strength to defend.)

448
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,435
Ten seconds.

449
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:39,612
(There's less than 10 seconds left.)

450
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:40,836
No, In Ah.

451
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,836
- Good. Circle around.
- Get out of it.

452
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:54,146
(The opponent's valid strikes)

453
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,185
Get out of it, In Ah.

454
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,186
Stop.

455
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:04,866
(In Ah collapses to the ground.)

456
00:18:04,926 --> 00:18:05,966
Stop.

457
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:13,936
Hang on.

458
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:18,376
(She can't get back up for a while.)

459
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:29,256
(Those who were watching...)

460
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,955
(are also taken aback by the unexpected situation.)

461
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:35,096
Why?

462
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:36,996
What do we do?

463
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,966
(Sae Rok is standing rooted to the spot.)

464
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,836
(Uie can't bring herself to watch it.)

465
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:47,436
What do we do?

466
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,486
- No. I shouldn't cry.
- This is bad.

467
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:52,306
She's worn out. She must be exhausted.

468
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,145
She was really exhausted,

469
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,986
but she just hung in there with her willpower.

470
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,245
After it was over...

471
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,345
(She held out with all her might for 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

472
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,316
She was drained of energy, and her legs gave out.

473
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:06,756
(The medical team goes in to check her condition.)

474
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,025
(She tries to get up, )

475
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,366
(but her body isn't working the way she wants.)

476
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:15,966
(She keeps breathing hard.)

477
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,696
Take a deep breath.

478
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,036
Do you know where you are?

479
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,106
- Breathe.
- Where are you now?

480
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:23,936
- Where are we?
- A stadium.

481
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:25,106
- Stadium?
- Stadium?

482
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:27,176
- Breathe slowly.
- How is she?

483
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,986
It's all right. You just need to catch your breath.

484
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,945
Is there any part that feels weak? Move your fingertips.

485
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,116
- I can't move my legs.
- You can't move your legs?

486
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,326
Are you okay, In Ah? Can you hear me?

487
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,886
Keep breathing..

488
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:42,896
It's all right. Keep breathing.. You'll be fine.

489
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:45,425
No. In Ah will get over this.

490
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,496
(The members are watching it anxiously.)

491
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,435
She held out with her willpower.

492
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,206
(They try hard to hold back tears.)

493
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:53,506
In Ah will be fine.

494
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,606
She gave it her all.

495
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:57,306
Breathe.

496
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,045
(In Ah got her breath back a little.)

497
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,316
Try to raise your head and sit up slowly.

498
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,016
(She sits up with the help of the medical team.)

499
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:07,846
You did well.

500
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,716
- You're all right.
- Is it over?

501
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:11,226
Yes, it's over. Get up.

502
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,356
Slowly.

503
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,526
- It's okay.
- You did well.

504
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,996
I have no strength in my body.

505
00:20:22,836 --> 00:20:24,566
- Keep breathing.
- Breathe.

506
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:27,065
Take a deep breath slowly.

507
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,152
(After she leans against the corner)

508
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,136
- Is it over?
- Yes. It's over.

509
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,676
- It's okay.
- Sit up straight.

510
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:34,306
- It's okay.
- Keep your back straight.

511
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,245
- Breathe. Take a deep breath.
- You did well.

512
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:38,716
(She bursts into tears.)

513
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,776
Raise your head and breathe. It's okay.

514
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,086
Take a deep breath slowly.

515
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,886
(As she has worked passionately, )

516
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,155
You did a good job.

517
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,165
(she is more disappointed.)

518
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,226
You did well.

519
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:56,636
You tried your best. I saw it all.

520
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,306
- You worked hard.
- Can you come down?

521
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:00,366
Come on down.

522
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:02,606
Try to go down.

523
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:03,796
Be careful as you come down.

524
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:04,906
Move slowly.

525
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:06,406
Please help her go down.

526
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:12,346
(Leaving her regrets behind, In Ah descends the ring.)

527
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:16,716
(The spectators give it up for her as they understand how she feels.)

528
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:17,816
Move slowly.

529
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:19,586
She needs to lie down.

530
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,326
My goodness. Be careful.

531
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:22,895
- Slowly.
- Her left foot.

532
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:24,826
(Her legs give out again as she goes back.)

533
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:27,225
(In Ah goes to the waiting area with the support of the medical team.)

534
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:28,466
Move slowly.

535
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:30,195
No. Don't cry.

536
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:31,556
(The members were watching In Ah.)

537
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:33,706
Don't let it get you down.

538
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,735
If you get disturbed here, In Ah will feel bad for you.

539
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:37,736
Don't let it get to you.

540
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:39,546
- Try your best and stay focused.
- Okay.

541
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,816
Anything can happen before your match.

542
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:44,276
Let's just focus on our matches.

543
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,746
She's right.

544
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,816
(The matches continue.)

545
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,955
- Is your vision blurry?
- Vision...

546
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:52,555
No. It is fine.

547
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:53,625
You're just feeling weak.

548
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,595
I said I'd use all my strength, so I did.

549
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:57,025
Did she eat anything?

550
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:58,925
- Yes, she had a meal.
- She did?

551
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:00,095
Her blood pressure is normal.

552
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,265
(Her blood pressure is normal.)

553
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,465
Don't overtax yourself.

554
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,595
The members...

555
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:04,666
(After getting some rest)

556
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:06,865
- I have to go to the members.
- Okay.

557
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,075
- You can go later. Move slowly.
- Careful.

558
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,276
(She sits up slowly.)

559
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:12,446
I'm fine, Mom.

560
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:14,605
- I...
- I know you worked so hard.

561
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:17,276
(My daughter worked so hard.)

562
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:19,716
You did a great job.

563
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:22,655
I really worked hard.

564
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,855
I know. I know that better than anyone.

565
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:28,426
(I know that better than anyone.)

566
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:33,126
(The words melt In Ah's upset heart.)

567
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,835
I worked really hard.

568
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,936
I know that. You really did.

569
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,606
What Mom said...

570
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:47,046
melted my heart despite all that.

571
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:51,915
I was so grateful that she recognized my hard work.

572
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,856
I felt like the past three months of my effort were being recognized.

573
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:58,185
You tried really hard.

574
00:22:58,186 --> 00:22:59,326
You did a great job.

575
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,196
Seriously...

576
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,065
I'm fine.

577
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,506
(After getting things off her chest)

578
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,595
You should go.

579
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,072
(In Ah forces herself to smile, feeling bad for her mom.)

580
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:11,336
Did Ju Hyun's match begin?

581
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:12,666
I don't know.

582
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,206
I wasn't in my right mind.

583
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:15,576
I should go.

584
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,205
- No. Take your time.
- You need to rest.

585
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:18,575
- No.
- Can you walk?

586
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,816
- I have to go see Ju Hyun.
- Let's see if you can walk.

587
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,516
Just help me get up.

588
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:25,085
- Compared to before...
- Slowly.

589
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,416
No. You can't move.

590
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:27,546
Stay seated.

591
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:29,416
My legs feel so weak now.

592
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:32,755
Get some more rest.

593
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,856
(She is still not 100 percent recovered.)

594
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:37,896
Yes. You should lie down.

595
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,196
I want to go.

596
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:43,196
(But what's more important is to recover.)

597
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:45,766
(She will get some rest and see how things go.)

598
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:50,406
(The matches continue.)

599
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:52,746
Go ahead.

600
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:54,276
(Ju Hyun's match is coming up soon.)

601
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,375
- I have my headgear.
- Okay.

602
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:57,916
I just need these.

603
00:23:59,616 --> 00:24:00,845
- I'm okay.
- Are you all right?

604
00:24:00,846 --> 00:24:02,316
- You'll be fine.
- I'm fine.

605
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:05,956
(She puts her coach at his ease with a cheerful voice.)

606
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,756
There you go.

607
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,095
- Go, Ju Hyun!
- Just focus on your match.

608
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:13,296
(She tries to focus on her upcoming match.)

609
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,736
(Moving to the waiting area)

610
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:18,635
(She's fighting right after In Ah, so she should be nervous.)

611
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,666
Ju Hyun.

612
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,606
- Take it easy, okay?
- Yes.

613
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:22,935
- Stay calm.
- Okay.

614
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:24,005
It's no big deal.

615
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,252
She will charge as soon as it begins.

616
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,475
What will you do then?

617
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:27,505
- Two, hook.
- That's it.

618
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:28,575
- One, two.
- Right.

619
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:30,652
- Then one, two, and withdraw.
- Two, hook, withdraw.

620
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:32,986
She will go to the left.

621
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:37,386
(The opponent showed a fierce fight in the preliminary.)

622
00:24:37,516 --> 00:24:39,455
One, two, pivot.

623
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,855
One, two, shuffle.

624
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,025
Keep repeating it.

625
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:43,325
If she keeps getting close...

626
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,925
- and I feel like it's not working, - Okay.

627
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,095
I'll find another way to break through.

628
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:48,966
(I'll find another way to break through.)

629
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:52,706
(Her eyes show her determination not to give in.)

630
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,076
(Another big match is expected.)

631
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:58,806
(Lee Bo Ra, 30s, under 51kg)

632
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,446
(Boxing experience: 4 years)

633
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,986
(Final, Under 51kg: Park Ju Hyun versus Lee Bo Ra)

634
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:10,485
Park Ju Hyun!

635
00:25:10,486 --> 00:25:11,555
- Go, Ju Hyun!
- Let's go!

636
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:13,386
(A strong supporter, her dad cheers her on.)

637
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:16,696
(Recharging her fighter's spirit)

638
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,466
(The second final match of Iron Girls)

639
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,836
(All preparations are complete.)

640
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,236
Try your best. You can do this.

641
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,736
Just do your thing. Don't worry about it. Okay?

642
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:31,945
Her arms are quite long.

643
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,806
Push her into a corner. Okay?

644
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:36,176
Finish it when she is cornered.

645
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,176
Park Ju Hyun.

646
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,746
Good. Let's do this.

647
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:44,056
(I just need to fight as I prepared.)

648
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:45,685
Go, Park Ju Hyun!

649
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:49,055
(The members cheer her on from their own places.)

650
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,426
Go, Ju Hyun!

651
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,295
(Only one step left to becoming the champion)

652
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:54,596
No slipping.

653
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,536
Don't clinch and don't lower your head.

654
00:25:57,996 --> 00:25:59,036
Touch gloves.

655
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,336
To your corners.

656
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:03,935
Go, Ju Hyun.

657
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,006
Round One.

658
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,305
- Box.
- Go, Park Ju Hyun!

659
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:08,616
(Round 1 begins.)

660
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,615
Good. Let's go.

661
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:12,615
- Good.
- Circle around.

662
00:26:12,616 --> 00:26:14,285
- That's it.
- Well done circling away.

663
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:15,355
- Keep circling around.
- Again.

664
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,555
- Good.
- That's it.

665
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,356
(Ju Hyun throws a one-two as she backs away.)

666
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:21,526
(As the opponent loses her balance while charging, )

667
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:26,596
(Ju Hyun calmly throws a one-two.)

668
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:28,165
(The opponent gets out and charges again.)

669
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,365
Circle around again.

670
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:30,865
- Circle around.
- Again. Good.

671
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:33,365
(Ju Hyun circles away, responding with a one-two.)

672
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:35,282
That's it. You have to fight after circling away.

673
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:37,106
Fight after circling away.

674
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,475
(But the opponent doesn't stop.)

675
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:40,975
Good. That's it.

676
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,275
Circle around. Push.

677
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,475
Push ahead.

678
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,616
Circle around.

679
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:50,015
(The opponent's valid strikes)

680
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:53,886
(The opponent's valid strikes)

681
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,295
Circle around.

682
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:56,976
(Ju Hyun allowed 8 strikes in an instant.)

683
00:26:57,556 --> 00:26:58,966
- Circle around.
- Get out of it.

684
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:00,895
You can withdraw.

685
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:03,596
(She withdraws again and counterattacks.)

686
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,066
(Ju Hyun's left hook)

687
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,506
Circle around.

688
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:10,535
You have a long reach.

689
00:27:10,536 --> 00:27:11,605
Get out of it.

690
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:12,652
(The two boxers clinch after a constant onslaught.)

691
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:15,076
Stop.

692
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:16,776
Stop.

693
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:18,246
Keep your head up.

694
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:19,916
Box.

695
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:21,545
Don't allow a body shot. Don't let her punch.

696
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:23,056
- That's it. Circle around.
- Good.

697
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,386
Punch and circle around. Good.

698
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:28,855
(She lands a right hook as she circles away.)

699
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,926
(Staggering)

700
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:35,195
Yes. That's it. Keep going like that.

701
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,666
There you go. You should do that.

702
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:38,095
- Circle around again.
- Circle around.

703
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:39,566
- Stop.
- That's it.

704
00:27:39,706 --> 00:27:40,735
Stop.

705
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:41,775
Blue. No open blows.

706
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,736
(The Blue Corner is warned again.)

707
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:45,905
(An open blow is striking with the palm of the hand.)

708
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,505
(In boxing, it is considered a foul, )

709
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:49,016
(and it can result in a warning.)

710
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,316
Box.

711
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,475
Good. You're doing well.

712
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:52,585
Like that. Circle around.

713
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:53,586
Circle around.

714
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,155
(Ju Hyun is in danger of being pushed back into a corner again.)

715
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:57,516
Circle around. Good.

716
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,156
That's it.

717
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,326
There you go.

718
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:04,356
(She throws a jab as she withdraws.)

719
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:07,226
(Jab)

720
00:28:09,136 --> 00:28:12,606
(Jab)

721
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:14,466
Yes! That's it!

722
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:16,006
- Good. Again.
- Stop.

723
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:18,705
(Ju Hyun did a 360-degree turn.)

724
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,046
Stop.

725
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:21,346
Don't turn around.

726
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:22,415
(Ju Hyun receives a warning.)

727
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,476
Box.

728
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:25,685
Keep going like that. Yes.

729
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:28,786
(Less than 10 seconds remain.)

730
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,756
Stop.

731
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,066
(Round 1 ends with Ju Hyun's valid strike.)

732
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,596
Well done.

733
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:44,635
This is chaotic.

734
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:45,636
- That was really tough.
- Yes.

735
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:47,066
It's not easy to circle around.

736
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,182
In that case, you should raise your guard...

737
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:51,136
and counterattack like this.

738
00:28:51,776 --> 00:28:53,076
She's no big deal, right?

739
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:55,745
You are landing all your jabs as you circle around.

740
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,576
You should do what you're good at. Okay?

741
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,615
- You did a great job.
- I should be quick with my timing.

742
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:01,215
(Her punches are accurate, but timing is crucial.)

743
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,556
You know what I mean, right?

744
00:29:02,786 --> 00:29:04,256
Here's what you need to do.

745
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:05,985
Don't withdraw. Just circle around. Okay

746
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:07,056
Punch as you pivot.

747
00:29:07,556 --> 00:29:09,725
Look straight at her. You're not tired yet.

748
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:10,756
Open your eyes wide.

749
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:12,426
Finish it when she's cornered.

750
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,196
Don't let her get out.

751
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,596
Use all your strength.

752
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,866
She gets out because you take a breather.

753
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,135
Understood?

754
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:20,365
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

755
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,936
- Answer me. Okay?
- Yes.

756
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:23,676
Go.

757
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,052
(Going back into the ring with a mad determination.)

758
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,476
(A fiercer match is expected.)

759
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:32,316
(But Ju Hyun has become even more composed.)

760
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:33,845
Together!

761
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:34,945
- Park Ju Hyun!
- Ju Hyun!

762
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:38,486
(It's heating up with the enthusiasm of the spectators.)

763
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:41,056
There she goes.

764
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:43,225
Box.

765
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:45,995
(Round 2 begins.)

766
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:47,026
Box.

767
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,666
- Go, Ju Hyun!
- Go, Ju Hyun!

768
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,376
- Go, Ju Hyun!
- She's coming close again.

769
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:52,135
That's it. Nice.

770
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:53,805
(As the opponent charges forward, )

771
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:55,182
(she circles away and throws a two.)

772
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:56,306
Good, Ju Hyun.

773
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:57,735
Go right away.

774
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:58,905
(She delivers a one-two as she circles around again.)

775
00:29:58,906 --> 00:29:59,906
Again.

776
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:00,946
That's it.

777
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,176
Good. Circle around again. There you go.

778
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,216
(Cross-counter)

779
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,216
(Ju Hyun's straight follows.)

780
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,726
(Staring at the opponent)

781
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,026
That's it. Nice.

782
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:17,155
(Ju Hyun strikes and withdraws, staring at the opponent.)

783
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,195
You're doing well, Ju Hyun.

784
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:19,395
You're the best.

785
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:20,895
That's it. There you go.

786
00:30:20,896 --> 00:30:22,035
You're doing well, Ju Hyun.

787
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:23,095
You're the best.

788
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,366
That's it. Keep going like that.

789
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:26,836
Circle around.

790
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,096
- Circle around.
- Good. Push her into a corner.

791
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:33,945
Good. That's nice.

792
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:36,516
(The opponent pushes her way in like a bulldozer.)

793
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,286
(Ju Hyun tries to keep her distance, )

794
00:30:39,886 --> 00:30:40,915
(but the opponent charges again.)

795
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,286
You're doing well, Ju Hyun.

796
00:30:42,886 --> 00:30:44,632
- Ju Hyun. Keep going like that.
- Keep your head up.

797
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:45,936
- No open blows.
- Park Ju Hyun.

798
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:47,125
(The Blue Corner receives a warning again.)

799
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:48,186
Box.

800
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,095
Circle around.

801
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,296
That's it.

802
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:52,925
Good. Again.

803
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:54,296
(Another straight to the face)

804
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,496
Park Ju Hyun. Hang in there.

805
00:30:57,796 --> 00:31:00,466
That's it. Circle around. Get away.

806
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,876
(The match goes on nonstop as they circle around the ring.)

807
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,136
That's it.

808
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,346
Keep going.

809
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,086
Keep going. Yes, circle around.

810
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,486
More. That's it.

811
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,116
Circle around. That's it.

812
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:21,186
(Ju Hyun lands a right hook.)

813
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,556
More.

814
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:24,196
Circle around.

815
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:25,695
Circle around.

816
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,696
(There's only 10 seconds left.)

817
00:31:26,697 --> 00:31:28,126
Ju Hyun, circle around.

818
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:31,135
Ju Hyun, circle around.

819
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,012
(Ju Hyun keeps landing valid strikes in the final stretch of the match.)

820
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:35,475
Yes. That's it.

821
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,676
That's what I'm talking about.

822
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:40,846
(She keeps landing valid strikes until the very end.)

823
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:46,416
(Round 2 ends.)

824
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:49,816
(Ju Hyun lets out a roar of joy.)

825
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:53,226
(Giving it her all, Ju Hyun finished her final match.)

826
00:31:53,926 --> 00:31:56,756
(She feels relief and joy.)

827
00:31:57,326 --> 00:32:00,666
(The Iron Girls, who had been anxious throughout 3 minutes, )

828
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:03,736
(give a relieved round of applause.)

829
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:07,666
(The crowd cheers for the intense match.)

830
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,876
(Ju Hyun's dad, who is her personal cheerleader, )

831
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:13,436
(raises both arms high, regardless of the result.)

832
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,646
Yes!

833
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,646
- Yes!
- You did it!

834
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,786
You did great. See? You did it.

835
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:24,386
- That's it.
- I'm so exhausted.

836
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:25,786
Yes.

837
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,686
(Her opponent also looks worn out after giving it her all.)

838
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:32,725
Goodness.

839
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:34,566
I raised my hand. What if I lose?

840
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:36,465
It's fine. You did great.

841
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:38,166
Win or lose. It's fne.

842
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,336
(All that’s left is the results announcement.)

843
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:46,276
(Both fighters are waiting for the results.)

844
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,346
(The judges start tallying the results.)

845
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:53,186
(Tension fills the arena once again.)

846
00:32:55,786 --> 00:33:01,156
(Are the Iron Girls about to have their first champion?)

847
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,996
(Ju Hyun's opponent was far from easy.)

848
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:07,726
(The two fighters fought fiercely from start to finish.)

849
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,366
(It’s impossible to predict the result.)

850
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,906
Red.

851
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:19,306
(Park Ju Hyun wins.)

852
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:22,545
(Ju Hyun falls to the ground...)

853
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:25,686
(as soon as the result she had longed for is announced.)

854
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:32,126
(Ju Hyun's first ever win on Iron Girls)

855
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:36,896
(It's a result she achieved through consistent training.)

856
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:39,296
You did great.

857
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:40,566
You really did great.

858
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,036
Gosh.

859
00:33:43,566 --> 00:33:45,536
(The eldest Iron Girl is relieved, )

860
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:47,805
(and Captain Kim gives her a round of applause.)

861
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:49,136
Amazing.

862
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:50,976
This is a tactical victory.

863
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,846
(And no one is happier than the cheer captain.)

864
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:55,775
(Today is another reminder that hard work pays off.)

865
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:56,776
You did great.

866
00:33:57,746 --> 00:33:59,045
You really did great.

867
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:01,192
(Coach Ji Hoon, who had gone through it all with her, gives her a hug.)

868
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:02,915
You really did great.

869
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,786
Go say hello.

870
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:07,632
(Ju Hyun goes to pay her respects to the blue corner for a great match.)

871
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,955
She was really scary.

872
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:10,596
- You were great.
- Thank you.

873
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:12,866
We will now begin the award presentation for this match.

874
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,265
(The long-awaited silver medal presentation)

875
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:21,136
Blue Corner, Lee Bo Ra.

876
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,645
For gold, Red Corner,

877
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,376
Park Ju Hyun.

878
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,445
(Gwang Bok put up an impressive fight.)

879
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,846
Mom.

880
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:35,246
Gosh.

881
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:37,556
(My first gold medal)

882
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:41,486
I won a medal.

883
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:43,826
(This one)

884
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:47,526
(The joy of victory is short-lived.)

885
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:49,035
Tighter.

886
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,635
- You did great.
- You did great.

887
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,506
You did so great.

888
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:54,782
- You were so impressive. Good job.
- You did a good job.

889
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,105
Gold medal.

890
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:57,535
You did so great.

891
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:59,605
(She shares the joy of being a champion with Captain Kim.)

892
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,906
Gosh.

893
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:03,346
You did so great.

894
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:08,446
(Meanwhile, )

895
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:11,656
(without time to rejoice, Uie is focused on her upcoming match.)

896
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:16,156
(She moves around to loosen up, )

897
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:21,666
(trying to calm her nerves.)

898
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:25,035
(At the same time, her opponent is preparing for the match.)

899
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:27,866
(Kim Hyeon Hee, 40s, under 54kg)

900
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:29,935
(Boxing experience: 3 years)

901
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,406
(Holds a record of 2 wins and 0 losses.)

902
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,106
You saw Ju Hyun earlier, right?

903
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,276
- Just do that.
- Just like that.

904
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,345
Look. There's no need to be scared.

905
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,316
This is easy.

906
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,346
Okay.

907
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:46,526
(For Uie, who advanced by default, )

908
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:50,796
(this is going to be her first and last game.)

909
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,265
(Even the crowd is nervous.)

910
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,196
- This is Uie's first match.
- Is she up?

911
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:01,906
(The fighters make their way into the ring.)

912
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,716
- Kim Hyeon Hee, you got this!
- Kim Hyeon Hee, you got this!

913
00:36:04,836 --> 00:36:05,906
Mouth.

914
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,706
Uie, you got this!

915
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,716
Uie, you got this!

916
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:12,646
(Uie's first ever boxing match)

917
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,115
Get ready.

918
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:16,256
(Round 1 begins.)

919
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,256
Fight.

920
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:21,926
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Kim Hyeon Hee versus Uie)

921
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:23,526
Let's go.

922
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:25,425
That's it.

923
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:26,796
Yes. Just do that.

924
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:29,065
That's it. Yes.

925
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:31,696
(A flurry of one-two punches)

926
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,066
That's it. Yes.

927
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,676
(A clean straight punch)

928
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,075
(From the start, Uie attacks aggressively.)

929
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,076
She's coming in.

930
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,516
Yes.

931
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,685
Let's go. One-two.

932
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:48,145
That's it. Yes.

933
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:49,332
(Throwing one-two punches and stepping back)

934
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:50,485
That's it.

935
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,426
That's it. Yes.

936
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:54,025
Nice.

937
00:36:54,026 --> 00:36:55,556
Yes, Uie. You're doing good.

938
00:36:56,196 --> 00:36:58,596
- Uie, you're the best.
- Uie, you're the best.

939
00:36:59,196 --> 00:37:02,636
(Uie keeps attempting to throw one-two punches.)

940
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,866
Keep your eyes on her.

941
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:09,106
That's it.

942
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:10,936
- Again.
- Again.

943
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,206
Circle around.

944
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:16,816
Keep your eyes on her.

945
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:19,016
That's it.

946
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:20,786
(The two fighters face off once again.)

947
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,215
Kim Hyeon Hee, you're doing great.

948
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:25,486
You got this!

949
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:31,196
(Uie's opponent throws a right hook.)

950
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:35,835
(She is becoming increasingly aggressive.)

951
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,866
That's it. Nice.

952
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:39,836
Nice. You're doing great.

953
00:37:40,966 --> 00:37:42,376
Uie, you're doing great!

954
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:45,206
(Another cross counter)

955
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:49,316
(Uie throws a straight punch, while Hyeon Hee throws a hook.)

956
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,686
(Only 10 seconds remain.)

957
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:57,486
(Hyeon Hee throws a hook, while Uie throws a one-two.)

958
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,496
(Round 1 ends.)

959
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:08,166
- You got this!
- Uie, you got this.

960
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:09,965
You did so great.

961
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,596
- You won the first round.
- Right.

962
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:12,966
You did great.

963
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,736
It's nothing, right? You did great.

964
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:18,006
You did so great, but keep throwing jabs...

965
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,606
and you have to hit her with a one-two and a hook.

966
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,515
If you can throw a hook,

967
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:24,416
- your punches will definitely land.
- Got it.

968
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:27,546
(Meanwhile, in the red corner)

969
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:29,985
She has a long reach,

970
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:31,655
so go low and attack with a one-two.

971
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:34,286
Go low, not face-to-face.

972
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,756
Throw a one-two and a hook.

973
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:39,426
It's a one-two and then a hook.

974
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,596
(Just one round away from the gold medal.)

975
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:47,606
(She has to give it her all in 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

976
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:49,575
Get ready.

977
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,336
(Round 2 begins.)

978
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:53,775
Fight.

979
00:38:53,776 --> 00:38:56,846
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Kim Hyeon Hee versus Uie)

980
00:38:57,976 --> 00:38:59,885
Circle around.

981
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,366
(As soon as the round begins, Hyeon Hee attacks aggressively.)

982
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:06,626
- Uie.
- Uie.

983
00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:13,525
Circle around.

984
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,526
(Uie's opponent throws a series of strikes again.)

985
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:20,005
(The opponent's valid strike: 1)

986
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,505
(The opponent's valid strike: 2)

987
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:26,746
(The opponent's valid strike)

988
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,976
She knows she fell behind in Round One.

989
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:33,345
- Uie.
- Uie.

990
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:35,715
Kim Uie, you got this.

991
00:39:35,716 --> 00:39:38,486
- You got this!
- Uie!

992
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:43,556
(Uie's opponent throws a right hook.)

993
00:39:44,026 --> 00:39:45,896
Keep going. Quickly. That's it.

994
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:50,566
(Uie throws a left hook.)

995
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:53,006
(Her opponent momentarily loses balance and falls.)

996
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,736
Keep going. Quickly. That's it.

997
00:39:57,136 --> 00:40:00,376
(The crowd goes wild at the intensity of the match.)

998
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:03,546
She's so good.

999
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,316
(The opponent gets back up on her feet.)

1000
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,156
You got this!

1001
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,716
(The match resumes.)

1002
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:17,956
(A slugfest begins.)

1003
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,566
Uie, don't forget the hook.

1004
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:23,666
- You got this!
- Uie, you got this!

1005
00:40:23,696 --> 00:40:25,136
- That's it.
- You got this!

1006
00:40:25,196 --> 00:40:26,906
- You got this!
- Again!

1007
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:33,606
(Her opponent launches a flurry of punches.)

1008
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:34,876
Pivot and block.

1009
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:36,476
Pivot and move in.

1010
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:42,656
That's it.

1011
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:48,586
(Uie dodges the one-two and counters with a hook.)

1012
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,826
Again.

1013
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,655
That's it.

1014
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:53,896
- Okay. Nice.
- That's it.

1015
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:59,636
(The two boxers attack until the very end.)

1016
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:01,035
Stop.

1017
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:02,576
(Round 2 ends.)

1018
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,036
You did well.

1019
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:07,606
(Uie's first match was intense.)

1020
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,616
(You are amazing, Uie!)

1021
00:41:10,716 --> 00:41:12,046
I think she won.

1022
00:41:13,086 --> 00:41:14,715
You did well, Uie!

1023
00:41:14,716 --> 00:41:15,716
Okay.

1024
00:41:15,717 --> 00:41:17,355
You did well, Uie!

1025
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,056
(Thank you!)

1026
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:21,725
(She cheerfully greets her team, who supported her.)

1027
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:22,755
She did so well.

1028
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:24,595
She finally looks comfortable, now that it's over.

1029
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:25,695
Yes, it's over. She did a good job.

1030
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:27,165
- Good job.
- Good job.

1031
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,142
(Uie looks much brighter, now that her tension is eased.)

1032
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:33,406
(And now is the time for the judgement.)

1033
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:35,875
Uie did so well.

1034
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:38,136
(The most nerve-racking moment)

1035
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,846
(It is Uie's first debut match, )

1036
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:44,316
(and also the championships.)

1037
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,085
Please.

1038
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:50,386
(Please.)

1039
00:41:50,756 --> 00:41:54,056
(The judges carefully tally the results.)

1040
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:58,456
(Everyone holds their breath as they watch.)

1041
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:02,166
(She put in her everything into the 3 minutes.)

1042
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:06,236
(How will the results be?)

1043
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:07,946
Please.

1044
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:09,317
(Please.)

1045
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:12,987
(The judges carefully tally the results.)

1046
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:17,427
(Everyone holds their breath as they watch.)

1047
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:21,197
(She put in her everything into the 3 minutes.)

1048
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:25,067
(How will the results be?)

1049
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,307
(Uie won.)

1050
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:39,687
(Uie's first win in a tournament)

1051
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:42,757
It was too strict. It was way too hard.

1052
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:44,557
Good job. You're the best.

1053
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:47,687
Thank you.

1054
00:42:48,587 --> 00:42:49,856
(Her efforts from the past 3 months finally shone.)

1055
00:42:49,857 --> 00:42:51,897
Good job.

1056
00:42:52,057 --> 00:42:53,297
Goodness.

1057
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:55,267
Uie.

1058
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:57,596
(Oh, the medal!)

1059
00:42:57,597 --> 00:43:00,567
(She was so happy that she forgot about the medal.)

1060
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:04,537
(Guys, I got the gold medal!)

1061
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:08,006
(They know how genuine her efforts were, )

1062
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:09,817
(so they send stronger cheers.)

1063
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:16,887
(The gold medal goes to Uie of the Iron Girls.)

1064
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:18,757
Thank you.

1065
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:25,127
(The hard-earned outcome for her 3 months of blood, sweat, and tears)

1066
00:43:26,127 --> 00:43:30,297
(The joy of having made another accomplishment)

1067
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,436
Uie.

1068
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:34,607
(And tears of joy)

1069
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:35,867
Good job.

1070
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:39,976
- We still have Sae Rok left.
- Yes.

1071
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:42,047
- Good job.
- Let's cheer for Sae Rok.

1072
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:48,347
(The last one up, Sae Rok.)

1073
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:51,787
(Who is Sae Rok's opponent?)

1074
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:54,357
(Yang Hyun Sil, 30s, under 54kg)

1075
00:43:54,557 --> 00:43:56,456
(Boxing: 1 year and 3 months, Jiu-jitsu: 6 years)

1076
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:57,897
(Wrestling: 2 years, Judo: 1 year)

1077
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:02,067
(She has experience with all kinds of martial arts.)

1078
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:06,537
(You can tell that the opponent is relaxed.)

1079
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:08,137
I'll just do it.

1080
00:44:10,237 --> 00:44:11,476
(The last one in line is the most nerve-racking turn.)

1081
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:12,606
I can do it.

1082
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:13,847
We can all do it.

1083
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:20,517
(Sae Rok gets ready for the match.)

1084
00:44:20,587 --> 00:44:21,787
- Should I take it off?
- Yes.

1085
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:24,217
Now get ready with this temperature.

1086
00:44:24,987 --> 00:44:28,687
(The tension builds up as it gets closer.)

1087
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:29,926
I know you're nervous,

1088
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:31,607
but everybody will sincerely cheer you on.

1089
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:33,567
Good luck, Sae Rok.

1090
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,266
- Show them.
- Good luck.

1091
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:36,267
(She heads for the ring.)

1092
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:37,367
Here.

1093
00:44:37,368 --> 00:44:38,466
- You saw the match, right?
- Yes.

1094
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,836
Just go like that, okay?

1095
00:44:39,837 --> 00:44:41,337
Okay?

1096
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:42,467
Just do it.

1097
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:47,806
(The final step toward the gold medal.)

1098
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,306
- Let's go, Sae Rok!
- Let's go!

1099
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:50,517
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1100
00:44:50,977 --> 00:44:52,016
- Let's go!
- Just do it the same way as usual.

1101
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,817
- Don't get scared. It's nothing.
- Let's go!

1102
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,986
- Let's go. I can do this.
- You can do it.

1103
00:44:55,987 --> 00:44:57,217
(Let's go! I can do this!)

1104
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:01,557
I can do it.

1105
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:04,256
You can do it!

1106
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,426
(Today's final match will prove her efforts from the past 3 months.)

1107
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:06,496
Watch out for your head.

1108
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:08,167
No holding, and no hitting below here.

1109
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:09,226
Shake hands.

1110
00:45:09,227 --> 00:45:10,737
Good luck. Back to your places.

1111
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,067
Sae Rok.

1112
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:14,067
Let's go.

1113
00:45:14,607 --> 00:45:15,707
Let's go.

1114
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:19,436
Round One.

1115
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,746
(Round 1 begins.)

1116
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:21,747
Let's go!

1117
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:24,347
Let's go, Sae Rok!

1118
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:31,787
(The opponent makes a body shot.)

1119
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:33,577
(The opponent throws a straight.)

1120
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:36,897
(And connects it to a jab)

1121
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:39,197
Keep moving.

1122
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:40,637
- Keep moving.
- Let's go.

1123
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:41,867
That's it.

1124
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:42,897
That's it.

1125
00:45:44,497 --> 00:45:47,306
(Sae Rok's valid strike: 1)

1126
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:49,006
(The opponent's valid strike: 1, Sae Rok's valid strike: 2)

1127
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,277
That's it. Keep going.

1128
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:52,757
(The opponent's body shot versus Sae Rok's straight)

1129
00:45:54,577 --> 00:45:56,177
(They exchange jabs.)

1130
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:59,576
(Sae Rok attacks with long reaches.)

1131
00:45:59,577 --> 00:46:01,087
Let's go, Sae Rok.

1132
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:07,177
(And to that, the opponent attacks with a high-low combination.)

1133
00:46:07,757 --> 00:46:08,927
Again. Watch.

1134
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:10,196
Watch carefully.

1135
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:12,057
- She shouldn't be in the corner.
- No.

1136
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:14,126
Let's go, Sae Rok!

1137
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:16,026
(The opponent keeps cornering her.)

1138
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:17,137
That's it.

1139
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:19,237
(Cross-counter)

1140
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:21,836
(Sae Rok follows up with a long jab.)

1141
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:23,117
You need to reach until the end.

1142
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,106
(The opponent's jab...)

1143
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:28,847
(and a high-low combination)

1144
00:46:32,677 --> 00:46:33,817
- That's it.
- Hit.

1145
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,016
- Hit.
- Let's go, Sae Rok.

1146
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:36,086
- That's it.
- That's it.

1147
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:39,016
(A slugfest follows.)

1148
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:40,757
Again. Do that again.

1149
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:42,057
Let's go.

1150
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,626
(The opponent throws a right hook.)

1151
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:49,167
(And a jab)

1152
00:46:54,107 --> 00:46:57,276
(The opponent doesn't stop and keeps driving in.)

1153
00:46:57,277 --> 00:46:59,306
Just throw an uppercut.

1154
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,507
(The opponent throws a clean jab at her instantly.)

1155
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:04,076
Hey, look.

1156
00:47:04,077 --> 00:47:06,047
(It's her last chance to attack in Round 1.)

1157
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,587
(Round 1 ends with Sae Rok's valid strike.)

1158
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:17,457
(40-second rest period)

1159
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:19,097
Breathe.

1160
00:47:19,497 --> 00:47:20,597
Breathe.

1161
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:25,437
(Sae Rok breathes heavily.)

1162
00:47:25,537 --> 00:47:27,566
She was losing a lot at first,

1163
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:30,006
but she didn't back down, and kept throwing punches.

1164
00:47:30,007 --> 00:47:34,507
So I think that's when the opponent's spark died out.

1165
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,117
I think the opponent will attack even more.

1166
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:38,776
I think she will keep coming in.

1167
00:47:38,777 --> 00:47:39,787
(Worried)

1168
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:41,386
You did well.

1169
00:47:41,387 --> 00:47:43,517
Keep your high-low combination just like you did.

1170
00:47:44,387 --> 00:47:48,427
(Round 2 strategy: Dive in with the high-low combination.)

1171
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:50,926
The opponent keeps coming in low.

1172
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:51,997
Then what should you do?

1173
00:47:52,297 --> 00:47:54,766
Cross-counter after the one, okay?

1174
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:56,266
Just cross-counter with the opponent.

1175
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:57,436
(Round 2 strategy: Counterattack with the cross-counter.)

1176
00:47:57,437 --> 00:47:58,537
Breathe.

1177
00:47:58,767 --> 00:47:59,887
You're doing well right now.

1178
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,307
- Let's go, Hyun Sil!
- Let's go, Hyun Sil!

1179
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:06,877
- Let's go, Sae Rok!
- Let's go, Sae Rok!

1180
00:48:07,277 --> 00:48:08,907
Show them, Sae Rok!

1181
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:12,577
(There is only one round left.)

1182
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,056
Round Two.

1183
00:48:18,057 --> 00:48:19,317
(Round 2 begins.)

1184
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:20,556
This is the last round.

1185
00:48:20,557 --> 00:48:22,527
- Let's go, Sae Rok!
- Let's go, Sae Rok!

1186
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:23,827
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1187
00:48:26,057 --> 00:48:27,326
Keep going.

1188
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:28,467
Don't get scared.

1189
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:30,266
- That's it.
- That's it.

1190
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:31,466
- More!
- Keep going!

1191
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:32,996
(She corners her opponent.)

1192
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,806
(And throws a flurry of punches.)

1193
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:36,237
- Good! That's it!
- That's it!

1194
00:48:36,307 --> 00:48:37,506
- Yes, good.
- That's it!

1195
00:48:37,507 --> 00:48:38,806
(Two...)

1196
00:48:38,807 --> 00:48:40,747
(and even a hook.)

1197
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:43,946
(Once more, two...)

1198
00:48:43,947 --> 00:48:46,587
(and hook)

1199
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:48,817
Keep going!

1200
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,816
(The opponent counterattacks right away.)

1201
00:48:51,817 --> 00:48:53,957
- More.
- More.

1202
00:48:54,657 --> 00:48:56,087
Throw it. Watch.

1203
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:58,357
Throw it. Keep moving.

1204
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:01,166
Keep moving.

1205
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,196
- Number 2.
- Number 2.

1206
00:49:03,197 --> 00:49:05,717
(After exchanging attacks, they keep in check for a long time.)

1207
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:07,237
Go in.

1208
00:49:07,907 --> 00:49:08,937
Throw it.

1209
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:13,377
(A heavy right hook from the opponent)

1210
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:15,546
- That's it.
- That's it.

1211
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:18,017
(Sae Rok counterattacks with a jab.)

1212
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:20,717
(Cross-counter)

1213
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:24,416
- You have to keep going.
- That's it.

1214
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,557
(And another cross-counter)

1215
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:27,327
You have to reach out.

1216
00:49:30,997 --> 00:49:32,156
Keep going, Sae Rok.

1217
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:37,467
(The opponent gets low and throws a jab.)

1218
00:49:38,637 --> 00:49:40,807
(Sae Rok counterattacks with a jab, as well.)

1219
00:49:41,037 --> 00:49:42,867
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

1220
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:44,676
- That's it. Go with number 1.
- Number 1.

1221
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:47,197
(Sae Rok pushes forward after getting hit with a valid strike.)

1222
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:49,407
That's it. Follow her!

1223
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:50,817
One, two!

1224
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:57,157
(However, she missed her chance to attack.)

1225
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,257
Let's go for the last one.

1226
00:49:59,857 --> 00:50:02,127
Go for it. Get in there.

1227
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:05,596
- Hold on!
- To the right.

1228
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:07,227
(The two get close near the end.)

1229
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:09,067
- Get in there.
- Get in there.

1230
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:12,797
(Round 2 ends.)

1231
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:15,477
- I don't know about this round.
- That was kind of ambiguous.

1232
00:50:15,837 --> 00:50:18,177
(However, the die is cast.)

1233
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:22,347
I got hit too much.

1234
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:25,277
That was close, right?

1235
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:31,587
(Regretting as soon as the match ends)

1236
00:50:32,257 --> 00:50:36,627
(The judges are combining the scores.)

1237
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:38,357
Please, sir.

1238
00:50:39,157 --> 00:50:41,427
(Nervous)

1239
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:47,067
(Time to announce)

1240
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:53,177
(The past 3 months flash before her eyes.)

1241
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:56,045
(Nervous)

1242
00:50:56,745 --> 00:51:01,645
(Time to announce)

1243
00:51:02,715 --> 00:51:07,855
(The past 3 months flash before her eyes.)

1244
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,925
(Keum Sae Rok lost.)

1245
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:16,225
Bow.

1246
00:51:17,165 --> 00:51:19,664
- Good job.
- Good job. That was a good fight.

1247
00:51:19,665 --> 00:51:21,565
(Applause to Sae Rok who did her best)

1248
00:51:23,165 --> 00:51:25,805
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

1249
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:27,874

1250
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,674

1252
00:51:31,415 --> 00:51:33,415
- Thank you. I'm rooting for you.
- Thank you.

1253
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:38,215
- Good job.
- Good job.

1254
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:40,184
Silver medal goes to the Blue Corner.

1255
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:42,384
Keum Sae Rok from Iron Girls.

1256
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:43,494
(Silver medal to Keum Sae Rok from Iron Girls)

1257
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:44,595
It's the silver medal.

1258
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:46,925
- Thank you.
- Gold medal...

1259
00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:48,764
- It's shining even more.
- She deserves it.

1260
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:51,364
- It shines even more.
- Gold medal to the Red Corner.

1261
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:53,135
Yang Hyun Sil from Action School.

1262
00:51:53,435 --> 00:51:54,735
Good fight.

1263
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:56,264
Thank you.

1264
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:58,834
(Bowing bravely to the end)

1265
00:51:58,835 --> 00:52:00,675
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1266
00:52:01,505 --> 00:52:03,374
Good job. You did great.

1267
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,914
- Sorry.
- No. You were amazing.

1268
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:05,975
Thank you.

1269
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:07,245
Gosh.

1270
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:08,615
It's okay.

1271
00:52:09,115 --> 00:52:10,254
It's okay. Good job.

1272
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:11,255
(Although Sae Rok's sad, she still shows her smile.)

1273
00:52:11,255 --> 00:52:12,255
- It's okay.
- Good job.

1274
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:14,924
Sorry. I'll be more enthusiastic next time.

1275
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:17,255
- Good job.
- Why are you apologizing?

1276
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,664
Good job.

1277
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,924
(Celebrating Sae Rok who did her best to the end)

1278
00:52:22,925 --> 00:52:24,694
I love you.

1279
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:26,805
Good job.

1280
00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:28,305
Thank you.

1281
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,274
The silver medal. Amazing.

1282
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,651
- May I have your attention, please?
- Good job.

1283
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:33,504
Still, I got the silver medal.

1284
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,204
- Of course.
- Yes.

1285
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:37,744
- Hey. You still beat one.
- I won.

1286
00:52:37,745 --> 00:52:39,074
I did a good job.

1287
00:52:39,075 --> 00:52:40,444
- That was amazing.
- Good job.

1288
00:52:40,445 --> 00:52:42,284
Let's go. Good job.

1289
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,561
(Iron Girls' first tournament ends.)

1290
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:44,715
Bokddeong.

1291
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:46,785
Bokddeong.

1292
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:48,284
Do you want to take a picture, Dad?

1293
00:52:48,285 --> 00:52:49,755
- Since I got a medal?
- Yes.

1294
00:52:49,855 --> 00:52:51,795
Let's take a picture. One, two, three.

1295
00:52:52,195 --> 00:52:54,965
(Taking a picture with the family who cheered them)

1296
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:57,865
What's going on? Why are there so many celebrities?

1297
00:52:57,935 --> 00:53:00,265
(The members of "Our Little Sister" rooted for her.)

1298
00:53:00,865 --> 00:53:04,635
(Iron Girls spend time catching up after the first tournament.)

1299
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:06,675
- Let's take a picture together.
- A picture?

1300
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:09,075
One, two, three.

1301
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:13,275
(Commemorating the win in the first tournament)

1302
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,514
- One, two...
- Go. One, two, three.

1303
00:53:15,515 --> 00:53:18,285
- Go, Iron Girls.
- Go, Iron Girls.

1304
00:53:19,015 --> 00:53:21,354
(After the first tournament)

1305
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:23,554
Finally, it's over.

1306
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:24,954
Good job.

1307
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:26,295
Gosh.

1308
00:53:26,695 --> 00:53:29,565
- Yes.
- The first tournament is over.

1309
00:53:29,725 --> 00:53:31,464
- Good job.
- Good job.

1310
00:53:31,465 --> 00:53:33,635
It was so much pressure.

1311
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:35,504
- It's finally over.
- You did a great job.

1312
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,604
Good job. You were amazing.

1313
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,305
- Coach.
- Good job.

1314
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:42,305
Anyway, In Ah...

1315
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:45,615
- She endured the game.
- She endured it.

1316
00:53:45,815 --> 00:53:47,285
But when the match was over,

1317
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:49,745
her legs gave out,

1318
00:53:50,515 --> 00:53:51,885
and she passed out.

1319
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,654
She's recovered.

1320
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:56,724
But still, to protect her,

1321
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:59,024
- the tournament isn't over.
- We have another training.

1322
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:01,294
So it's best for her to rest.

1323
00:54:01,295 --> 00:54:03,341
(She was sent to the hospital for a more detailed checkup.)

1324
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,495
It would've been nice if she were smiling here with us.

1325
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:09,434
She was supposed to receive a medal...

1326
00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:11,234
on the ring after the match.

1327
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:12,774
It was the only one that didn't happen.

1328
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:13,945
- Right.
- That's right.

1329
00:54:14,075 --> 00:54:15,475
What's happening to her medal?

1330
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:17,075
- What?
- What?

1331
00:54:17,475 --> 00:54:19,215
- Coach?
- Coach?

1332
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:23,484
In Ah's medal.

1333
00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:25,314
- Congratulations, In Ah.
- So cool.

1334
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:28,355
Congratulations, In Ah.

1335
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,224
- In Ah.
- The silver medal.

1336
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,455
You endured it to the end and got it.

1337
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:35,565
Her opponent was a boxer from Vietnam.

1338
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:37,634
She lost, but she fought well.

1339
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:38,664
- She lost, but she fought well.
- It was very close.

1340
00:54:38,665 --> 00:54:40,205
- Yes.
- Right.

1341
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:42,335
Their 1st tournament just after 3 months.

1342
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,305
They trained only for three months.

1343
00:54:44,475 --> 00:54:46,775
Two gold and two silver.

1344
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:48,274
Everyone got a medal.

1345
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:49,644
(2 gold medals, 2 silver medals)

1346
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,574
Congratulations on the two silver medals.

1347
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:52,855
- You were amazing.
- Seriously.

1348
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,244
(Silver medal for Sae Rok and In Ah)

1349
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:55,715
Good job.

1350
00:54:56,515 --> 00:54:58,815
- I was lucky.
- Gold medals are incredible.

1351
00:54:59,485 --> 00:55:00,884
Uie and Park Ju.

1352
00:55:00,885 --> 00:55:02,285
- Congratulations.
- Gwang Bok.

1353
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:03,954
Hey, this is a miracle.

1354
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:05,995
- It's a miracle.
- Can you believe it?

1355
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:10,864
(From a novice boxer...)

1356
00:55:10,865 --> 00:55:14,565
(who was even scared to hit and get hit, )

1357
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:17,304
(she bravely overcame...)

1358
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:20,875
(various fears...)

1359
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:26,345
(and won the gold medal.)

1360
00:55:30,555 --> 00:55:31,854
- And...
- Park Ju.

1361
00:55:31,855 --> 00:55:34,585
- Congratulations.
- Gwang Bok. Congratulations.

1362
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,825
- That's wonderful.
- Wait. Is this your second win?

1363
00:55:36,995 --> 00:55:38,054
- What?
- Amazing.

1364
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:39,795
Two wins out of two games.

1365
00:55:40,155 --> 00:55:41,195
No loss.

1366
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:43,764
- One hundred percent winning rate.
- One hundred percent winning rate.

1367
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:45,264
- One hundred percent winning rate.
- Zero defeats.

1368
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:46,735
- That's amazing.
- Zero defeats.

1369
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:49,134
(When she got punched for the first time, )

1370
00:55:49,135 --> 00:55:53,875
(she kneeled down on the ring.)

1371
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:59,445
(The teary boxer who couldn't even watch her colleague's game...)

1372
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:06,185
(grew up to be a dogged mad boxer.)

1373
00:56:06,455 --> 00:56:08,085
Yes! You got it!

1374
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:14,164
(That's how Ju Hyun became the champion.)

1375
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:15,464
Congratulations.

1376
00:56:15,465 --> 00:56:17,545
- Congratulations on the gold medal.
- It's amazing.

1377
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:21,304
All the matches were very intense.

1378
00:56:21,305 --> 00:56:22,404
They were dynamic.

1379
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:24,404
You gave your all.

1380
00:56:24,405 --> 00:56:26,635
I like the story.

1381
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,074
The main game is next month.

1382
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:30,075
- Yes.
- That's right.

1383
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,974
Let's give your all to the last one month.

1384
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:35,044
One of the things I always have on my mind is...

1385
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:37,755
if you don't enjoy your win and just regret it,

1386
00:56:38,055 --> 00:56:40,355
you're not motivated in the next game.

1387
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:42,655
So we should all celebrate together...

1388
00:56:42,825 --> 00:56:45,324
and cheer up with joy.

1389
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,564
- That's right.
- Let's wrap up here.

1390
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:49,524
- You won.
- Let's shout victory.

1391
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,094
- Let's cheer up.
- Yes!

1392
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:53,294
- Yes.
- Let's send applause to each other.

1393
00:56:53,295 --> 00:56:54,834
- KO!
- Iron!

1394
00:56:54,835 --> 00:56:57,604
- Girls!
- Girls!

1395
00:56:57,605 --> 00:56:59,374
- We won!
- Congratulations.

1396
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,975
- We won!
- Congratulations.

1397
00:57:01,045 --> 00:57:02,304
(Excited)

1398
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:04,244
- Congratulations.
- We won.

1399
00:57:04,245 --> 00:57:06,114
- You won.
- I won.

1400
00:57:06,115 --> 00:57:07,615
- Thank you.
- I won.

1401
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:10,714
Good job, everyone. I love you.

1402
00:57:10,715 --> 00:57:12,755
(Iron Girls' first tournament ends.)

1403
00:57:13,885 --> 00:57:17,025
(After the intense first tournament...)

1404
00:57:17,455 --> 00:57:20,125
(The next day)

1405
00:57:21,395 --> 00:57:22,965
My neck hurts.

1406
00:57:24,595 --> 00:57:26,765
It's a sign that you got hit a lot.

1407
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:29,565
- She was strong.
- I was scared.

1408
00:57:29,835 --> 00:57:30,875
I was like...

1409
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:33,285
You were discouraged by her charisma.

1410
00:57:33,645 --> 00:57:34,645
You were discouraged.

1411
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:36,144
How am I supposed to overcome it?

1412
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:38,444
- That is...
- There's so much to do in boxing.

1413
00:57:38,445 --> 00:57:40,785
Use more punches.

1414
00:57:41,945 --> 00:57:45,355
(They still have a long way to go.)

1415
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:49,585
(Silver Sae Rok who won the silver medal...)

1416
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,425
(is training to become Gold Sae Rok.)

1417
00:57:57,665 --> 00:57:59,385
Right on the next day after the tournament.

1418
00:58:00,665 --> 00:58:01,864
I can't even speak.

1419
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:04,575
(Pulling off so much training where she can't even speak)

1420
00:58:04,705 --> 00:58:06,875
(However)

1421
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,174
(Sae Rok's training log: I guess I'm finally relaxed.)

1422
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:11,414
(I'm so sick. I got a severe fever after the tournament.)

1423
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:14,244
(This time, it's pretty severe. I have a drama shoot tomorrow.)

1424
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:16,245
(I won't be able to train for a while.)

1425
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:20,855
(Sae Rok's body aches severely on top of her busy schedule.)

1426
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,895
(Iron Girls have been recording their personal training.)

1427
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,364
(May, June, July)

1428
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:30,965
(Sae Rok's training log was full of training.)

1429
00:58:32,435 --> 00:58:35,805
(However, she couldn't train for a week.)

1430
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:40,304
(Sae Rok is back for training after a week.)

1431
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:42,904
(Sae Rok)

1432
00:58:42,905 --> 00:58:45,215
(Actor Lee Sang Yi)

1433
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:50,045
(She stretches her arms after a while.)

1434
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:52,015
(Panting)

1435
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,855
Harder.

1436
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:57,124
(She can't keep her guard up.)

1437
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:00,665
(She can't possibly do her footwork.)

1438
00:59:01,195 --> 00:59:03,064
(Her stamina dropped so much in a week.)

1439
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:04,435
You can't show your back.

1440
00:59:04,935 --> 00:59:06,395
Push him. That's right.

1441
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:08,304
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1442
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:10,634
(I was anxious about losing my stamina after resting for too long.)

1443
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:11,834
(It dropped significantly.)

1444
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:13,605
(I worked so hard on it. It's precious.)

1445
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:16,945
(Upset)

1446
00:59:17,245 --> 00:59:18,414
(Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

1447
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:22,115
(To bring up the stamina that went down, )

1448
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:27,855
(she focuses on training without a break.)

1449
00:59:28,155 --> 00:59:29,724
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1450
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:31,454
(I'll try hard again. I'll go for it.)

1451
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,124
(Let's do it without regrets.)

1452
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,925
(I've done it before. I know I can do it.)

1453
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:38,765
(Her dash to win the gold medal)

1454
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:44,334
(Even when she's down, all she thinks about is boxing.)

1455
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:45,374
(Sae Rok)

1456
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:51,415
(As a result, her stamina and technique rose in no time.)

1457
00:59:51,945 --> 00:59:56,045
(How about Uie?)

1458
00:59:56,645 --> 01:00:00,624
(Focused training based on her tournament experience)

1459
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,625
(Uie)

1460
01:00:01,626 --> 01:00:02,655
(Exclaiming)

1461
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,594
You got it.

1462
01:00:04,595 --> 01:00:07,095
(Her hook is getting stronger.)

1463
01:00:07,495 --> 01:00:11,765
(Raising the power and the accuracy of her technique)

1464
01:00:12,135 --> 01:00:14,534
Now you know what your strength is.

1465
01:00:14,535 --> 01:00:16,265
Try to make use of it. Keep your guard up.

1466
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:20,374
(To keep her promise with herself, )

1467
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:24,275
(she exercising her muscles steadily to increase her muscle mass.)

1468
01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:26,574
I went to the gym.

1469
01:00:26,575 --> 01:00:30,015
I'll have meat mainly.

1470
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:31,584
Protein.

1471
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:32,885
(Protein)

1472
01:00:32,915 --> 01:00:35,324
To be honest, I just ordered what I wanted.

1473
01:00:35,325 --> 01:00:37,225
(To be honest, I just ordered what I wanted.)

1474
01:00:37,995 --> 01:00:43,495
(Raw beef with brown rice)

1475
01:00:43,835 --> 01:00:46,135
(Satisfactory)

1476
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:49,204
Before going boxing, for carbohydrates,

1477
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:52,105
I'm going to have salad pasta. Then, I'm heading to the gym.

1478
01:00:52,435 --> 01:00:54,404
(Making healthy salad pasta herself)

1479
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:55,475
Oh, I love it.

1480
01:00:56,675 --> 01:00:59,475
Now that the food is ready...

1481
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:01,614
This is the kick.

1482
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:05,414
With just a little, it tastes and smells amazing.

1483
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:07,055
It's the perfect salad dressing.

1484
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:08,424
(Ju Hyun's salad pasta is ready.)

1485
01:01:08,425 --> 01:01:09,455
It smells so good.

1486
01:01:09,825 --> 01:01:10,825
Now...

1487
01:01:10,826 --> 01:01:13,625
(Now, it's time to enjoy it.)

1488
01:01:16,695 --> 01:01:18,295
It's good. It's really delicious.

1489
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:22,605
(Trying the shrimp to get protein)

1490
01:01:23,035 --> 01:01:25,874
This sauce goes better with shrimp.

1491
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:28,145
It's the perfect sauce for all.

1492
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:30,944
Now that I have eaten,

1493
01:01:30,945 --> 01:01:32,915
I'm off to get ready for the battle.

1494
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:34,745
I can do it.

1495
01:01:34,746 --> 01:01:36,484
- Punch.
- You got it.

1496
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:38,331
(Today, she's working on strengthening her punch.)

1497
01:01:38,355 --> 01:01:39,954
(Training to be stronger)

1498
01:01:39,955 --> 01:01:41,595
Hear that sound when you give more power?

1499
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:44,154
(Ju Hyun's training log: My left arm feels like ripping, )

1500
01:01:44,155 --> 01:01:45,524
(and my calves are about to burst, but I feel getting stronger today.)

1501
01:01:45,525 --> 01:01:46,624
Yes. Keep it up.

1502
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,065
(but I feel getting stronger today.)

1503
01:01:48,465 --> 01:01:51,795
(Never missing a day of jump rope practice)

1504
01:01:52,365 --> 01:01:55,205
(She can even sing.)

1505
01:01:56,605 --> 01:01:57,834
Nice.

1506
01:01:57,835 --> 01:01:59,634
(My footwork must get faster to deceive the opponent.)

1507
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:00,645
(Legs, be faster.)

1508
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:03,705
Stamina is the basis of a boxer.

1509
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:06,344
(Exercising to increase her basic stamina...)

1510
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:07,444
Eighteen.

1511
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:09,284
(despite her busy schedule)

1512
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:10,445
Nineteen.

1513
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:12,554
(Ju Hyun's training log:)

1514
01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:14,324
(I went jogging after the show.)

1515
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:16,125
(I did 2 sets of 20 sit-ups after every 1km.)

1516
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:23,165
(I was got off work late today, so I did jump rope and jogged.)

1517
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:30,535
(Spending every day training)

1518
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:35,775
(The members gathered again for training.)

1519
01:02:35,945 --> 01:02:37,574
Now, you're boxers.

1520
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:39,515
(There's no time left.)

1521
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:41,914
(Making an effort to give their all and to leave no regrets)

1522
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:43,044
Harder.

1523
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:44,315
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

1524
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:46,554
(However, )

1525
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,785
(someone's missing.)

1526
01:02:50,325 --> 01:02:51,594
Focus.

1527
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:52,724
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1528
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:53,754
(I was excited to exercise with Uie and Ju Hyun.)

1529
01:02:53,755 --> 01:02:54,925
(I miss In Ah.)

1530
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:57,064
(Ju Hyun's training log: Training with Rocky and Uie.)

1531
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,334
(I missed In Ah, )

1532
01:02:58,335 --> 01:03:00,595
(but we braced ourselves and trained hard.)

1533
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:04,735
(Where is In Ah?)

1534
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:07,504
(The first tournament is over, and in 2 weeks...)

1535
01:03:07,505 --> 01:03:08,745
Hello.

1536
01:03:08,875 --> 01:03:09,944
(Producer, writer)

1537
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:11,474
(The members of Iron Girls gather 1 by 1.)

1538
01:03:11,475 --> 01:03:14,145
Long time no see. I missed you so much.

1539
01:03:15,485 --> 01:03:16,514
(Gwang Bok appears.)

1540
01:03:16,515 --> 01:03:18,055
- Hello.
- Hello.

1541
01:03:18,555 --> 01:03:20,925
- The testosterone queen.
- The testosterone queen.

1542
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:22,655
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1543
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:25,355
As soon as you arrive?

1544
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:26,925
Have you all been well?

1545
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,064
- I missed you.
- I've been well, of course.

1546
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:30,401
(Gathering for the first time since the first tournament)

1547
01:03:30,425 --> 01:03:32,334
- You know my dad was there.
- Yes.

1548
01:03:32,335 --> 01:03:35,305
He couldn't talk for a week after he returned to Busan.

1549
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:37,734
He must've wanted to tell everyone.

1550
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:38,834
- No.
- He lost his voice.

1551
01:03:38,835 --> 01:03:40,304
He lost his voice.

1552
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,504
From cheering?

1553
01:03:41,505 --> 01:03:43,104
- His voice was completely gone.
- Really?

1554
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:44,415
He couldn't say a word.

1555
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:45,674
"Get me food."

1556
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:47,014
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's how he was talking.

1557
01:03:47,015 --> 01:03:48,444
So he went to the hospital for a week.

1558
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:51,854
- He rooted for us so much.
- Yes.

1559
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:53,584
"Go, Keum Sae Rok!"

1560
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:55,284
(Ju Hyun's father rooted for them as loud as he could.)

1561
01:03:55,285 --> 01:03:56,684
My mom was like,

1562
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:59,695
"What did your dad do there?"

1563
01:04:00,695 --> 01:04:01,695
(Her mother, who had no idea what was going on, was completely lost.)

1564
01:04:01,696 --> 01:04:03,665
"Why can't he speak?"

1565
01:04:06,165 --> 01:04:07,294
(Everyone welcomes someone.)

1566
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:08,504
- Hello.
- Hello.

1567
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:09,534
Welcome back.

1568
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:10,975
You look so pretty today.

1569
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:12,375
Hello.

1570
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:13,734
You look so much better.

1571
01:04:13,735 --> 01:04:16,304
- Your hair grew so much.
- It got so long.

1572
01:04:16,305 --> 01:04:18,105
(Iron Girls, including In Ah, have gathered.)

1573
01:04:18,215 --> 01:04:20,114
- You look calm and...
- I know.

1574
01:04:20,115 --> 01:04:21,614
You look like a newlywed bride.

1575
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:23,345
She's wearing all black.

1576
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:24,955
You look calm.

1577
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,655
Have you all been well?

1578
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:30,284
We haven't been well.

1579
01:04:30,285 --> 01:04:31,754
Right. It's the aftereffect of the tournament.

1580
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:32,854
After the tournament,

1581
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:34,864
- she got sick.
- Right.

1582
01:04:34,865 --> 01:04:38,365
Because it was our first tournament,

1583
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:40,334
we were all very nervous.

1584
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,805
- There was an aftereffect.
- We were too concerned about it.

1585
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:44,405
Right.

1586
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,705
Anyway,

1587
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,444
how are you feeling, In Ah?

1588
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:50,505
I...

1589
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,974
- Hey.
- This is important.

1590
01:04:52,975 --> 01:04:54,814
No one could ask her.

1591
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:57,044
To be honest, we're trying to read your face.

1592
01:04:57,045 --> 01:04:59,915
Because we don't know about your condition.

1593
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:05,225
(The final of In Ah's first tournament)

1594
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:13,165
(She made a scary last-minute spurt.)

1595
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:18,235
(Since it was the final, she gave her all.)

1596
01:05:20,805 --> 01:05:24,975
(In the end, she was exhausted...)

1597
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:30,184
(and passed out on the ring.)

1598
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:32,615
None of us knows how that feels.

1599
01:05:32,715 --> 01:05:34,154
"Is In Ah exhausted?"

1600
01:05:34,155 --> 01:05:35,584
"Did she give her all?" That's what we thought...

1601
01:05:35,585 --> 01:05:37,124
- when we joined the tournament.
- True.

1602
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,624
- After the tournament, - That's what I thought too.

1603
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,354
We even took a picture for winning the medal.

1604
01:05:40,355 --> 01:05:41,565
Then...

1605
01:05:42,395 --> 01:05:45,695
- You couldn't miss a picture.
- you told us after the tournament.

1606
01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:48,434
I was so confused.

1607
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:50,135
No wonder you were confused.

1608
01:05:50,935 --> 01:05:52,775
I didn't want to make you worry,

1609
01:05:52,835 --> 01:05:53,835
so I kept it a secret...

1610
01:05:53,836 --> 01:05:56,145
- on the day of the tournament.
- Right.

1611
01:05:56,445 --> 01:06:01,615
Because I was worried about affecting the tournament.

1612
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:03,744
Be careful when you come down.

1613
01:06:03,745 --> 01:06:04,814
Slowly.

1614
01:06:04,815 --> 01:06:06,284
Can someone help her on the floor?

1615
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:07,824
(After she gave her all...)

1616
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:11,595
(and got off the ring...)

1617
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,064
Don't push yourself too much.

1618
01:06:15,065 --> 01:06:17,195
(Even when she was completely exhausted, )

1619
01:06:17,835 --> 01:06:19,034
I have to go see the girls.

1620
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:20,434
(all In Ah thought about was the members.)

1621
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,104
- Compared to before...
- Slowly.

1622
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:24,304
(She wanted to go back to the stadium, )

1623
01:06:24,305 --> 01:06:26,304
- Don't push yourself.
- Let me put this on.

1624
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:28,904
(but she couldn't move her legs.)

1625
01:06:28,905 --> 01:06:31,145
My legs feel so weak now.

1626
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,774
Lie down slowly.

1627
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:34,615
Lie down slowly. Don't worry.

1628
01:06:35,045 --> 01:06:36,315
Okay. One second.

1629
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:37,515
It's okay.

1630
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:38,854
- It hurts so much.
- Where does it hurt?

1631
01:06:38,855 --> 01:06:40,285
My right side back.

1632
01:06:40,585 --> 01:06:42,054
It hurts.

1633
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:44,554
(Due to the increasing pain, she was sent to the hospital in the end.)

1634
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:45,595
Hold on.

1635
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:48,294
(In Ah didn't tell the others...)

1636
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:49,794
- It hurts so much.
- We're on it. Don't worry.

1637
01:06:49,795 --> 01:06:52,195
(in case they'd be worried before the tournament.)

1638
01:06:52,895 --> 01:06:55,764
(So they didn't know about her condition...)

1639
01:06:55,765 --> 01:06:58,004
(on the day of the tournament.)

1640
01:06:58,005 --> 01:07:01,074
It felt like I had no energy.

1641
01:07:01,075 --> 01:07:03,504
It felt like I ran out of all my energy.

1642
01:07:03,505 --> 01:07:04,714
"Wait. Why can't I move my legs?"

1643
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:06,375
("Wait. Why can't I move my legs?")

1644
01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:09,014
On the day of the tournament, I thought I couldn't move them...

1645
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:11,685
because I was exhausted and used up all my energy.

1646
01:07:12,555 --> 01:07:16,954
But I couldn't move one leg as I wanted.

1647
01:07:16,955 --> 01:07:19,031
(The pain that was expected to be temporary continued.)

1648
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:21,594
(A treatment was necessary, )

1649
01:07:21,595 --> 01:07:25,265
(so she was hospitalized immediately.)

1650
01:07:26,235 --> 01:07:28,435
I can't feel if I'm holding back.

1651
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:32,304
Do it. Press your foot.

1652
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:35,505
(She couldn't strain her leg.)

1653
01:07:35,805 --> 01:07:36,844
The other way.

1654
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,574
I did rehabilitation exercises for 1, 2, and 3 days.

1655
01:07:39,575 --> 01:07:43,015
Rehab therapy, physiotherapy, and even injections.

1656
01:07:43,245 --> 01:07:46,554
As I gained muscles and was recovering,

1657
01:07:46,555 --> 01:07:49,025
my ankle didn't move as I wanted.

1658
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,155
I couldn't strain it.

1659
01:07:51,725 --> 01:07:54,495
My ankles weren't getting better.

1660
01:07:55,065 --> 01:07:56,694
Even I felt...

1661
01:07:56,695 --> 01:08:01,335
my ankle wasn't in the condition to box.

1662
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:04,274
So even though I love boxing so much,

1663
01:08:04,275 --> 01:08:07,404
I knew I couldn't compete in the tournament in August...

1664
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:10,674
because of my ankles.

1665
01:08:10,675 --> 01:08:12,414
(I knew I couldn't compete in the tournament in August.)

1666
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,715
That's what I was thinking.

1667
01:08:15,185 --> 01:08:17,244
I'd given up in my heart.

1668
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:19,715
(I'd given up in my heart.)

1669
01:08:19,985 --> 01:08:21,724
You were probably startled the most.

1670
01:08:21,725 --> 01:08:25,655
You probably struggled the most mentally.

1671
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:28,364
As you know, I enjoyed boxing so much.

1672
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:32,764
I was sad to think I had to give up.

1673
01:08:32,765 --> 01:08:34,465
(It wasn't easy to give up.)

1674
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:37,065
I blamed my injury so much.

1675
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,735
I didn't want to stop there.

1676
01:08:40,975 --> 01:08:42,005
It felt like...

1677
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:44,374
I was locked in a cage.

1678
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,374
Like this.

1679
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,415
"No more."

1680
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,514
- That's how much I loved boxing.
- More!

1681
01:08:50,515 --> 01:08:52,414
I don't know how I lived without boxing.

1682
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:54,525
That's how fun it was.

1683
01:08:55,655 --> 01:08:56,954
The joy of reading the moves ahead...

1684
01:08:56,955 --> 01:08:58,555
and successfully landing a valid strike.

1685
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:01,364
"That's how you'll move, right? I'll dodge it and counterattack."

1686
01:09:01,365 --> 01:09:03,125
And then landing that strike. The joy of it.

1687
01:09:03,195 --> 01:09:04,765
Nice. That's it.

1688
01:09:05,465 --> 01:09:06,494
Well done.

1689
01:09:06,495 --> 01:09:08,834
That feeling was strangely satisfying.

1690
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:11,175
(That feeling was strangely satisfying.)

1691
01:09:13,205 --> 01:09:14,305
Thank you.

1692
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:16,504
- Very close.
- That was awesome.

1693
01:09:16,505 --> 01:09:17,825
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1694
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:21,915
I...

1695
01:09:22,915 --> 01:09:24,584
boxed like a mad person.

1696
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:25,691
(In Ah kept going with all her might.)

1697
01:09:25,715 --> 01:09:27,654
- It's over, right?
- Breathe. Yes, it's over.

1698
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:28,924
(That's why the last tournament was disappointing for her.)

1699
01:09:28,925 --> 01:09:30,331
- You did well.
- Straighten your back.

1700
01:09:30,355 --> 01:09:31,901
- It's okay.
- Straighten your back slowly.

1701
01:09:31,925 --> 01:09:33,254
- Breathe.
- You did well.

1702
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:34,765
- Deep breaths.
- Well done.

1703
01:09:36,765 --> 01:09:38,405
Lift your head up and breathe. It's okay.

1704
01:09:39,495 --> 01:09:40,594
Breathe in and out slowly.

1705
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:45,175
(The tears she shed back then are unforgettable.)

1706
01:09:45,535 --> 01:09:46,675
You did well.

1707
01:09:49,175 --> 01:09:52,514
(And the trustworthy, reliable members...)

1708
01:09:52,515 --> 01:09:57,044
(who were there with her)

1709
01:09:57,045 --> 01:09:58,115
That's why...

1710
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,985
I wondered why I still felt unhappy even after I'd already given up,

1711
01:10:03,025 --> 01:10:05,025
and why I kept having conversations with myself.

1712
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:10,895
The reason was that I'd given up too quickly.

1713
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:13,565
It was far too soon to quit.

1714
01:10:14,705 --> 01:10:17,364
(Questioning whether she had given up too quickly, )

1715
01:10:17,365 --> 01:10:20,505
(In Ah pondered deeply.)

1716
01:10:21,105 --> 01:10:24,815
My ankles have recovered about 80 percent.

1717
01:10:26,445 --> 01:10:28,645
But honestly, with my ankles mostly healed...

1718
01:10:30,145 --> 01:10:31,655
and my determination,

1719
01:10:32,815 --> 01:10:34,315
I want everyone...

1720
01:10:35,855 --> 01:10:38,354
to cheer me on until the end...

1721
01:10:38,355 --> 01:10:40,655
as I pursue the goals...

1722
01:10:40,725 --> 01:10:43,625
the Iron Girls have aimed for...

1723
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:47,364
from the very start.

1724
01:10:47,365 --> 01:10:48,805
I want...

1725
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,105
to train...

1726
01:10:51,275 --> 01:10:53,134
as much as possible until the very end.

1727
01:10:53,135 --> 01:10:55,505
(I want to continue the challenge.)

1728
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,644
I want to do as much as I can...

1729
01:10:57,645 --> 01:10:59,414
without overstraining myself.

1730
01:10:59,415 --> 01:11:00,415
You're amazing.

1731
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:04,244
But that doesn't mean I'll go full-on out of greed.

1732
01:11:04,245 --> 01:11:08,424
Even if I have to withdraw on the day of the tournament,

1733
01:11:08,425 --> 01:11:10,524
I simply want to show my passion...

1734
01:11:10,525 --> 01:11:12,924
by preparing until the very last moment.

1735
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:16,395
If I were in In Ah's shoes, I'd make the same decision.

1736
01:11:16,465 --> 01:11:18,734
That's why we understand you.

1737
01:11:18,735 --> 01:11:21,665
- True.
- We knew you'd make this choice.

1738
01:11:21,905 --> 01:11:25,134
But I want to add a word of advice.

1739
01:11:25,135 --> 01:11:26,705
- Yes.
- Don't overdo it.

1740
01:11:27,335 --> 01:11:29,805
I don't want anyone getting hurt again.

1741
01:11:29,945 --> 01:11:32,044
It'd be great...

1742
01:11:32,045 --> 01:11:34,115
if you could have fun...

1743
01:11:34,945 --> 01:11:38,015
while staying as careful as possible.

1744
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:40,954
In Ah is truly strong.

1745
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:43,054
- Totally, and it's cool.
- I wouldn't...

1746
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:44,501
- She has incredible willpower.
- True.

1747
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:46,224
- I have a gift.
- What is it?

1748
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:48,465
It's for In Ah.

1749
01:11:50,595 --> 01:11:52,135
Are you trying to move me?

1750
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:54,135
Oh, my.

1751
01:11:54,505 --> 01:11:57,364
- Oh, my.
- Right.

1752
01:11:57,365 --> 01:11:58,535
Right.

1753
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:01,074
(Passing on In Ah's silver medal)

1754
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:02,374
Thank you.

1755
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,015
- It's a priceless medal.
- For real.

1756
01:12:05,115 --> 01:12:07,214
(She finally gets to touch the medal.)

1757
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:08,445
It's a treasure.

1758
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:11,814
I both love it and hate it at the same time.

1759
01:12:11,815 --> 01:12:13,015
My feelings are all mixed up.

1760
01:12:13,185 --> 01:12:14,284
Did everyone get theirs?

1761
01:12:14,285 --> 01:12:15,385
- Yes.
- Yes.

1762
01:12:16,525 --> 01:12:17,765
- I'll take it with me.
- Okay.

1763
01:12:18,195 --> 01:12:20,025
The front of the medal is quite pretty.

1764
01:12:20,155 --> 01:12:21,565
We received it in the ring.

1765
01:12:21,965 --> 01:12:23,685
You should too, in the upcoming tournament.

1766
01:12:23,825 --> 01:12:25,794
- You get it, right?
- I hope I can make it to the ring.

1767
01:12:25,795 --> 01:12:27,194
If only the referee could put it on her.

1768
01:12:27,195 --> 01:12:29,205
I'll do my best until the very end.

1769
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:31,304
Honestly, it feels amazing.

1770
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,005
- Having your arm raised.
- Right?

1771
01:12:33,235 --> 01:12:34,944
I want to feel it one more time.

1772
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:36,145
You felt it twice, didn't you?

1773
01:12:36,205 --> 01:12:37,874
Our goal should be to win the finals.

1774
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,845
Let's stay undefeated, Park Ju Hyun.

1775
01:12:39,915 --> 01:12:42,144
My heart races just thinking about the tournament.

1776
01:12:42,145 --> 01:12:43,184
- Really?
- Yes.

1777
01:12:43,185 --> 01:12:47,084
I didn't feel relieved after the first tournament.

1778
01:12:47,085 --> 01:12:50,224
If anything, I thought, "This is really tough."

1779
01:12:50,225 --> 01:12:54,594
"We've come this far for the August tournament."

1780
01:12:54,595 --> 01:12:56,125
"It's only going to get tougher."

1781
01:12:56,165 --> 01:12:58,534
- The draw matters a great deal, - I agree.

1782
01:12:58,535 --> 01:13:00,365
And the opponent's style is also important.

1783
01:13:00,395 --> 01:13:03,035
Some styles I can handle well,

1784
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:05,304
while others are more difficult.

1785
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:07,634
But that's something you only find out in the ring.

1786
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:08,674
That's totally true.

1787
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:13,945
The atmosphere of the venue can be really overwhelming.

1788
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:18,285
But since this is our second and final tournament,

1789
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:22,954
wouldn't we feel more confident...

1790
01:13:22,955 --> 01:13:25,624
than nervous or anxious?

1791
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:26,695
True.

1792
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:29,425
Winning and losing are, of course, important.

1793
01:13:30,025 --> 01:13:31,294
- But if we do our best...
- Yes.

1794
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:32,394
(Regardless of the outcome, to end without regrets)

1795
01:13:32,395 --> 01:13:33,434
Let's do this.

1796
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:34,905
Let's stay strong and do it again.

1797
01:13:35,105 --> 01:13:36,465
We can do it.

1798
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:38,504
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1799
01:13:38,505 --> 01:13:40,174
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

1800
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:42,005
(Aiming for everyone to finish)

1801
01:13:43,805 --> 01:13:46,215
Today is day one of my return.

1802
01:13:46,615 --> 01:13:48,645
- Shall we take baby steps, Coach?
- Yes.

1803
01:13:48,745 --> 01:13:50,285
I tried some moves alone.

1804
01:13:50,545 --> 01:13:51,884
My ankle snaps.

1805
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:54,015
It doesn't have enough strength yet.

1806
01:13:54,585 --> 01:13:55,685
The footwork...

1807
01:13:56,855 --> 01:13:58,095
is doable.

1808
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:00,524
Since your ankles are weak,

1809
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:02,895
rely more on your waist and less on footwork.

1810
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:06,234
(In Ah's training log: Boxing is honestly frightening.)

1811
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:08,234
(Even the thought of it makes me swallow hard.)

1812
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,334
(But since I've decided to do it, )

1813
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:13,335
(I'll give my all in my role as one of the Iron Girls.)

1814
01:14:14,135 --> 01:14:17,444
(Other days too, training focused more on the upper body)

1815
01:14:17,445 --> 01:14:18,445
My ankles feel weak.

1816
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:21,145
(Her ankles are still weak.)

1817
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:23,945
My ankles won't move as I want, and it's frustrating.

1818
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:26,315
(Screaming)

1819
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:31,185
(In Ah's stamina, combined with her injury, is wearing her down.)

1820
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:34,664
(Unexpectedly, I had to rest 2 two weeks.)

1821
01:14:34,665 --> 01:14:37,824
(I'm worried my stamina and skills won't recover as before.)

1822
01:14:37,825 --> 01:14:40,835
(But this is my last chance. I'll be careful until the end.)

1823
01:14:42,405 --> 01:14:47,575
(Despite not being in perfect condition, In Ah gives it her all.)

1824
01:14:48,305 --> 01:14:52,675
(In Ah is steadily regaining her performance level.)

1825
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:55,685
(10 days before the final tournament)

1826
01:14:56,185 --> 01:14:58,084
- Hi.
- Hi.

1827
01:14:58,085 --> 01:14:59,384
Hi.

1828
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:01,054
- Hi.
- Hi.

1829
01:15:01,055 --> 01:15:03,101
(The Iron Girls have arrived for the official training.)

1830
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:06,154
Two wins in two matches. Undefeated.

1831
01:15:06,155 --> 01:15:07,354
I'm jealous.

1832
01:15:07,355 --> 01:15:10,195
(Undefeated boxer Gwang Bok)

1833
01:15:10,395 --> 01:15:12,294
I'm Silver Sae Rok.

1834
01:15:12,295 --> 01:15:14,135
(2 matches, 1 win, 1 loss)

1835
01:15:14,295 --> 01:15:17,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

1836
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:19,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

1837
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,334
- Are you okay?
- It's been a while.

1838
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:21,704
- Hi.
- Long time no see.

1839
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:23,074
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

1840
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:24,674
Our final destination.

1841
01:15:24,675 --> 01:15:26,415
- Right.
- We have...

1842
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:28,845
ten days until the Incheon tournament.

1843
01:15:28,985 --> 01:15:32,515
Today will be the final check.

1844
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:35,355
We went through so many tests on the first day.

1845
01:15:35,725 --> 01:15:41,255
Right? Do you remember the training you were all excited about?

1846
01:15:41,465 --> 01:15:42,995
- Which one?
- We did a lot that day.

1847
01:15:43,065 --> 01:15:44,095
You did?

1848
01:15:44,195 --> 01:15:45,195
(Curious)

1849
01:15:45,196 --> 01:15:46,235
What can it be?

1850
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:48,434
I can't recall. It was an endless day.

1851
01:15:48,435 --> 01:15:50,035
Punch Kim Dong Hyun's face.

1852
01:15:50,765 --> 01:15:52,274
- What?
- Do you remember?

1853
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:54,135
(We're doing that again?)

1854
01:15:54,305 --> 01:15:55,305
I'm in.

1855
01:15:55,306 --> 01:15:56,704
No, wait. What?

1856
01:15:56,705 --> 01:15:59,414
Stop, you're not well yet. Calm down.

1857
01:15:59,415 --> 01:16:00,744
- All of a sudden?
- Are we doing it?

1858
01:16:00,745 --> 01:16:02,615
(More fired up than ever)

1859
01:16:02,785 --> 01:16:04,285
- I...
- Kim Dong Hyun.

1860
01:16:04,715 --> 01:16:06,755
(The reason they're all so pumped up is that...)

1861
01:16:07,515 --> 01:16:11,655
(4 months ago, they knew nothing about boxing.)

1862
01:16:12,255 --> 01:16:13,355
(Annoying, aren't I?)

1863
01:16:14,495 --> 01:16:16,665
(Just keeping their fists up was tough.)

1864
01:16:16,995 --> 01:16:19,165
(Why can't I hit you?)

1865
01:16:19,295 --> 01:16:20,295
(Mom!)

1866
01:16:20,565 --> 01:16:21,565
(Mom!)

1867
01:16:22,135 --> 01:16:24,505
(Lasting for 2 minutes felt almost impossible.)

1868
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:27,185
(But forget about the Iron Girls from 4 months ago!)

1869
01:16:27,475 --> 01:16:29,805
(They're coming back for a revenge match.)

1870
01:16:30,145 --> 01:16:33,415
(An upgraded version of Punch Captain Kim)

1871
01:16:33,815 --> 01:16:36,685
(Iron Girls versus Captain Kim, who will win the revenge match?)

1872
01:16:36,785 --> 01:16:38,014
(And...)

1873
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,715
Today, the four of you...

1874
01:16:40,285 --> 01:16:41,384
will fight each other.

1875
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:42,884
- Us four?
- The four of us?

1876
01:16:42,885 --> 01:16:45,195
(Iron Girl versus Iron Girl)

1877
01:16:45,995 --> 01:16:48,424
(Yesterday's friend...)

1878
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:51,465
(becomes today's opponent.)

1879
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,105
(A ruthless world of competition)

1880
01:16:55,265 --> 01:16:58,175
(Iron Girl versus Iron Girl, how will it end?)

1881
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,451
- I watched the first episode.
- I see.

1882
01:17:00,475 --> 01:17:02,904
After seeing it, I was determined...

1883
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:05,514
to make the girls land ten punches on him.

1884
01:17:05,515 --> 01:17:07,275
Now that the girls have been trained,

1885
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,414
Captain Kim will have to dodge properly.

1886
01:17:10,415 --> 01:17:12,485
From what I know,

1887
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:15,225
two of you are injured.

1888
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:17,055
I'm suddenly all better now.

1889
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,125
- For real?
- Yes.

1890
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:22,565
I realized the importance of footwork.

1891
01:17:22,865 --> 01:17:24,864
I worked hard to improve it,

1892
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:26,194
and busted my knees.

1893
01:17:26,195 --> 01:17:27,294
(Ju Hyun also has a knee injury.)

1894
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:28,934
But I knew a day like this would come,

1895
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:30,435
so I practiced walking footwork.

1896
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:33,234
(Everyone will participate with unyielding determination.)

1897
01:17:33,235 --> 01:17:35,505
- I still can't do running footwork.
- Hold on.

1898
01:17:35,775 --> 01:17:37,904
- Captain Kim, you didn't...
- Yes?

1899
01:17:37,905 --> 01:17:40,245
- wear headgear back then, did you?
- I didn't.

1900
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:41,645
What about this time?

1901
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:43,815
I'm going to wear one today.

1902
01:17:45,185 --> 01:17:46,754
(Danger detected)

1903
01:17:46,755 --> 01:17:48,725
I will wear one today.

1904
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:51,054
- Shall we get ready?
- Make me see stars.

1905
01:17:51,055 --> 01:17:53,095
Make me see stars, okay? Really bright ones.

1906
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:55,565
Before we start training,

1907
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:57,764
it's good to get your body warmed up.

1908
01:17:57,765 --> 01:17:59,894
I'll give you a spray to use beforehand.

1909
01:17:59,895 --> 01:18:01,834
We warm up, right?

1910
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:03,465
This helps you do just that.

1911
01:18:05,175 --> 01:18:07,204
- Thank you. Rub it in.
- It warms you up.

1912
01:18:07,205 --> 01:18:08,475
Yes, rub it in.

1913
01:18:08,675 --> 01:18:10,275
Me too, since I need to spar too.

1914
01:18:12,345 --> 01:18:14,045
Are you mistaking that for a body oil?

1915
01:18:14,415 --> 01:18:15,614
No, I need a generous amount.

1916
01:18:15,615 --> 01:18:17,215
(Being thorough to fight all four girls)

1917
01:18:17,645 --> 01:18:19,155
Let's at least hit once.

1918
01:18:20,255 --> 01:18:21,255
Seriously.

1919
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:23,054
This is our only chance...

1920
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:25,395
to hit someone who has fought in the UFC.

1921
01:18:25,895 --> 01:18:27,594
Captain Kim is wearing his boxing shoes.

1922
01:18:27,595 --> 01:18:29,565
Captain Kim has a pair of boxing shoes?

1923
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:31,665
Nice.

1924
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:33,211
(First time seeing him in boxing shoes)

1925
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:34,495
Nice. I like it.

1926
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:36,865
(The Iron Girls are warming up.)

1927
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:39,735
(Suddenly charging)

1928
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:42,081
(Provoking before the match even begins)

1929
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:44,305
- Don't touch the Blue Corner.
- Shoes?

1930
01:18:46,675 --> 01:18:48,714
(Showing off his warm-up)

1931
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:50,384
Your shoes look weird.

1932
01:18:50,385 --> 01:18:51,985
Those shoes seem special.

1933
01:18:53,055 --> 01:18:54,484
I'm touching it too.

1934
01:18:54,485 --> 01:18:55,524
Yes, two of them.

1935
01:18:55,525 --> 01:18:57,584
(Targeted attack on the Red Corner)

1936
01:18:57,585 --> 01:18:58,755
The fighting spirit.

1937
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:00,295
Jab.

1938
01:19:00,395 --> 01:19:01,455
One, two.

1939
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:02,725
One, two.

1940
01:19:02,865 --> 01:19:03,994
One, two, dodge, punch.

1941
01:19:03,995 --> 01:19:05,164
(He's even hitting the mitts now?)

1942
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:06,195
Up to hooks.

1943
01:19:07,195 --> 01:19:09,365
Captain Kim, why are you doing that?

1944
01:19:09,505 --> 01:19:11,434
I'm seizing the initiative.

1945
01:19:11,435 --> 01:19:12,504
Even if I'm not punching,

1946
01:19:12,505 --> 01:19:13,574
I'm seizing the initiative.

1947
01:19:13,575 --> 01:19:14,581
(Why seize it against us?)

1948
01:19:14,605 --> 01:19:16,475
- I'll be on defense only.
- Here.

1949
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,915
(But even if he's just trying out, )

1950
01:19:20,345 --> 01:19:22,414
(he's making fierce noises.)

1951
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:24,384
(Shocked)

1952
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,515
Okay.

1953
01:19:25,755 --> 01:19:26,784
(Groaning)

1954
01:19:26,785 --> 01:19:27,815
(Groaning)

1955
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:30,555
(These are a fighter's punches.)

1956
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,294
Gosh, that's incredible.

1957
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:34,354
You weren't just a celebrity, Captain Kim.

1958
01:19:34,355 --> 01:19:35,895
- You were indeed an athlete.
- Right?

1959
01:19:36,065 --> 01:19:37,924
- I'm done.
- Your hooks are really powerful.

1960
01:19:37,925 --> 01:19:39,235
Right, I'm done.

1961
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:41,434
(Meanwhile, the first boxer gets ready.)

1962
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:42,505
Wait.

1963
01:19:43,035 --> 01:19:45,011
- Aren't you hurt, In Ah?
- It came flying like this.

1964
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:46,135
Yes, I am.

1965
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:48,235
- I'll go slow.
- Are you okay?

1966
01:19:49,105 --> 01:19:50,804
Wear this.

1967
01:19:50,805 --> 01:19:51,914
Wear it on top of that.

1968
01:19:51,915 --> 01:19:55,685
Of course. I'm one of those people with weak ankles.

1969
01:19:56,385 --> 01:19:58,615
- I'll go slow.
- Are you okay?

1970
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:00,884
(Scared)

1971
01:20:00,885 --> 01:20:02,185
But In Ah is strong.

1972
01:20:03,185 --> 01:20:06,524
Your mouthguard makes it look like you have no teeth.

1973
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:08,025
- I know, right?
- Really?

1974
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,394
You really look like you have no teeth.

1975
01:20:10,395 --> 01:20:12,195
(Captain Kim's terrifying mouthguard)

1976
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:13,675
I used it during my tournaments.

1977
01:20:14,035 --> 01:20:15,305
My UFC tournaments.

1978
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:16,464
- After seven years?
- Yes.

1979
01:20:16,465 --> 01:20:17,905
- Just because of us?
- Yes.

1980
01:20:18,575 --> 01:20:20,504
I'd love to take a good punch like in a match.

1981
01:20:20,505 --> 01:20:22,445
I rarely got hit in matches.

1982
01:20:23,345 --> 01:20:25,945
(Meanwhile, In Ah is...)

1983
01:20:26,315 --> 01:20:28,385
It's been a while since I wore a mouthguard.

1984
01:20:28,885 --> 01:20:30,414
All right, to the center.

1985
01:20:30,415 --> 01:20:31,415
(Everyone is ready.)

1986
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:35,524
- Okay.
- A grand comeback match.

1987
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:36,784
(Simba Seol's grand comeback match)

1988
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:37,825
Okay.

1989
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:40,055
- Isn't that foul play?
- Right.

1990
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:41,524
What? What was that just now?

1991
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:42,525
- Isn't that foul play?
- Right.

1992
01:20:42,526 --> 01:20:44,164
(An openly biased referee)

1993
01:20:44,165 --> 01:20:45,834
What? What was that just now?

1994
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:47,534
- Do your job properly.
- Okay.

1995
01:20:47,535 --> 01:20:48,941
- Let's do this.
- Don't provoke each other.

1996
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:50,735
- Okay.
- Play fair.

1997
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:53,004
Go.

1998
01:20:53,005 --> 01:20:54,034
Okay.

1999
01:20:54,035 --> 01:20:55,515
(The two boxers go to their corners.)

2000
01:20:55,545 --> 01:20:57,004
The sparring will be one round...

2001
01:20:57,005 --> 01:20:58,514
- of two minutes.
- Okay.

2002
01:20:58,515 --> 01:20:59,544
Are you ready?

2003
01:20:59,545 --> 01:21:01,044
Round One.

2004
01:21:01,045 --> 01:21:02,084
(In Ah's revenge match...)

2005
01:21:02,085 --> 01:21:03,184
Box.

2006
01:21:03,185 --> 01:21:04,445
(begins.)

2007
01:21:04,515 --> 01:21:05,515
Box.

2008
01:21:05,516 --> 01:21:08,385
(What will Simba Seol's comeback match be like?)

2009
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:10,055
She has returned.

2010
01:21:10,355 --> 01:21:13,395
(Low, low, high)

2011
01:21:13,695 --> 01:21:15,224
That's it. Nice.

2012
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:16,395
She keeps hitting him.

2013
01:21:16,825 --> 01:21:17,894
Dodge.

2014
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:19,064
(Pressuring him using different punch combinations)

2015
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:20,934
- Yes.
- Look at how he keeps watching her.

2016
01:21:20,935 --> 01:21:21,935
Dodge.

2017
01:21:23,205 --> 01:21:24,435
(Feint, high)

2018
01:21:24,665 --> 01:21:25,674
(Using techniques nonstop)

2019
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:27,435
- He's not dodging jabs.
- Good.

2020
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:29,674
Captain Kim never looks away.

2021
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:31,745
(Captain Kim dodges without blinking an eye.)

2022
01:21:32,175 --> 01:21:34,575
(In Ah's punches don't land on him.)

2023
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:36,655
Why aren't you hitting me? Hit me already.

2024
01:21:37,045 --> 01:21:39,255
Hit me.

2025
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:41,514
(Enraged)

2026
01:21:41,515 --> 01:21:42,655
Hit me.

2027
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,825
(In Ah throws a rapid series of punches, )

2028
01:21:48,255 --> 01:21:52,295
(and Stun Gun dodges every one.)

2029
01:21:52,465 --> 01:21:54,065
That just now was legendary.

2030
01:21:54,395 --> 01:21:55,504
He dodges every punch.

2031
01:21:55,505 --> 01:21:56,835
Stun Gun is still on a roll.

2032
01:21:57,165 --> 01:22:00,035
(In Ah follows him and throws a wide punch.)

2033
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:03,375
(Captain Kim narrowly evades it.)

2034
01:22:04,445 --> 01:22:06,144
(Throwing a straight with a shout)

2035
01:22:06,145 --> 01:22:07,375
- That's it. Nice.
- No.

2036
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:11,245
(A solid valid strike)

2037
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,554
- That's it. Nice.
- Good.

2038
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:15,125
- No.
- Good.

2039
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:16,585
What "no?" I did hit you.

2040
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:17,754
Try and hit me.

2041
01:22:17,755 --> 01:22:18,855
Hit me.

2042
01:22:18,955 --> 01:22:20,094
Come on.

2043
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:21,555
(She ducks in...)

2044
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:24,424
(and unleashes...)

2045
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:25,735
(a flurry of punches.)

2046
01:22:26,065 --> 01:22:27,294
You've got him. Nice.

2047
01:22:27,295 --> 01:22:28,935
(In Ah's straight punch lands perfectly.)

2048
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:34,875
(In Ah used to throw punches at random.)

2049
01:22:36,605 --> 01:22:39,545
(She presses Captain Kim with rapid combinations.)

2050
01:22:39,945 --> 01:22:43,745
(Feint, feint, straight, hook, uppercut)

2051
01:22:44,745 --> 01:22:47,314
(In Ah lashes out with fierce punches, )

2052
01:22:47,315 --> 01:22:49,885
(but Captain Kim evades them all.)

2053
01:22:50,055 --> 01:22:51,855
- Gosh, that's...
- He dodges really well.

2054
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:54,425
- Ten seconds.
- Go for it.

2055
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:56,525
- Punch. Yes, that's it.
- Nice.

2056
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,194
(A hook after a high feint)

2057
01:22:59,195 --> 01:23:00,395
That's the feint I meant.

2058
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:02,104
Nice. Again.

2059
01:23:02,105 --> 01:23:03,865
(Pushing with full force until the very end)

2060
01:23:04,465 --> 01:23:05,504
Yes.

2061
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:06,574
Stop.

2062
01:23:06,575 --> 01:23:08,304
(In Ah's revenge match ends.)

2063
01:23:08,305 --> 01:23:09,605
- Okay.
- Okay.

2064
01:23:10,645 --> 01:23:12,745
- I hit you.
- You didn't.

2065
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:14,414
- Good job.
- Only slightly.

2066
01:23:14,415 --> 01:23:15,615
It barely touched me.

2067
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:18,244
- Did you catch my hook-feint?
- Yes.

2068
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:19,685
- My combination.
- Yes, it hit him.

2069
01:23:19,815 --> 01:23:20,884
Well done.

2070
01:23:20,885 --> 01:23:21,885
(In Ah is excited that her strategy worked.)

2071
01:23:21,886 --> 01:23:23,324
You stayed sharp to dodge the punches.

2072
01:23:23,325 --> 01:23:26,725
A few punches that looked deadly just missed me.

2073
01:23:26,855 --> 01:23:28,325
I saw them pass by.

2074
01:23:29,495 --> 01:23:31,795
(Punches flew past Captain Kim.)

2075
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:34,564
He barely dodges them by maybe 1cm or so.

2076
01:23:34,565 --> 01:23:36,565
That's professional-level dodging.

2077
01:23:37,505 --> 01:23:39,004
Dodging like that puts him...

2078
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:40,734
at the perfect distance to counterattack.

2079
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:43,304
But he got hit when I threw two feints.

2080
01:23:43,305 --> 01:23:44,444
Just once.

2081
01:23:44,445 --> 01:23:45,445
- "Just once?" - Twice.

2082
01:23:45,445 --> 01:23:46,445
- Twice.
- Twice.

2083
01:23:46,446 --> 01:23:48,315
- More like three times.
- You hit me twice.

2084
01:23:49,515 --> 01:23:53,485
(A perfect hook after a feint)

2085
01:23:54,885 --> 01:23:59,425
(In Ah's valid strike landed perfectly.)

2086
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:01,624
In Ah always had...

2087
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:05,094
the instinct to land a punch, like a beast.

2088
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:06,195
But now,

2089
01:24:06,295 --> 01:24:07,564
she's tricked me several times.

2090
01:24:07,565 --> 01:24:08,804
I thought she missed,

2091
01:24:08,805 --> 01:24:10,535
- but it was all a feint.
- Well done.

2092
01:24:10,765 --> 01:24:13,075
It's fun. I forgot that boxing was fun.

2093
01:24:14,035 --> 01:24:16,744
From what I can see, Uie will be my toughest opponent.

2094
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:19,544
I prefer boxers who rely on single, heavy blows.

2095
01:24:19,545 --> 01:24:21,414
Uie won't be easy.

2096
01:24:21,415 --> 01:24:23,184
- How come? Why?
- Okay.

2097
01:24:23,185 --> 01:24:25,754
Even if Captain Kim raises his guard, she'll keep attacking.

2098
01:24:25,755 --> 01:24:28,724
Uie's greatest strength is the number of punches she throws.

2099
01:24:28,725 --> 01:24:31,085
Between the punches to dodge and the ones to take,

2100
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:33,095
which should I dodge?

2101
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:34,924
You only need to dodge two punches.

2102
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:36,595
- One, two.
- What?

2103
01:24:37,295 --> 01:24:39,434
- She throws 300 one-twos.
- She's hard to predict.

2104
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:40,465
Exactly.

2105
01:24:40,565 --> 01:24:42,605
- Okay.
- Uie will be tough.

2106
01:24:42,935 --> 01:24:44,904
Isn't that cheating, like throwing 300 punches?

2107
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:45,934
No.

2108
01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:47,274
Play fair.

2109
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:48,674
- Touch gloves. Okay.
- Okay.

2110
01:24:48,675 --> 01:24:49,705
Corners.

2111
01:24:49,905 --> 01:24:51,004
Uie can't be analyzed.

2112
01:24:51,005 --> 01:24:54,275
Feel how strong her punches are, despite her innocent-looking eyes.

2113
01:24:54,545 --> 01:24:56,014
Round One.

2114
01:24:56,015 --> 01:24:57,084
(Uie's revenge match...)

2115
01:24:57,085 --> 01:24:58,184
Box.

2116
01:24:58,185 --> 01:25:00,055
(begins.)

2117
01:25:00,215 --> 01:25:01,215
Box.

2118
01:25:01,216 --> 01:25:02,854
(She rushes in with innocent eyes.)

2119
01:25:02,855 --> 01:25:03,884
I'm excited.

2120
01:25:03,885 --> 01:25:05,894
(Probing with jabs...)

2121
01:25:05,895 --> 01:25:07,025
(before landing a body shot)

2122
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:09,424
(Jab, jab, two, hook)

2123
01:25:09,425 --> 01:25:10,465
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

2124
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,994
(Her first attack...)

2125
01:25:12,995 --> 01:25:15,035
(hits the bullseye.)

2126
01:25:15,905 --> 01:25:17,365
She hit him right away.

2127
01:25:18,365 --> 01:25:20,104
(Stun Gun retreats, backing away.)

2128
01:25:20,105 --> 01:25:22,275
The attack was supposed to end after the right hook.

2129
01:25:22,305 --> 01:25:23,575
But a jab after that?

2130
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,955
- That was amazing.
- Follow it up with a hook.

2131
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:27,455
- Well done. That's it.
- This is...

2132
01:25:28,015 --> 01:25:29,084
- Yes.
- Again?

2133
01:25:29,085 --> 01:25:30,325
- Nice.
- That's a long attack.

2134
01:25:31,045 --> 01:25:32,215
What is this?

2135
01:25:32,815 --> 01:25:34,415
(Uie used to throw playful punches.)

2136
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:36,454
(Now, she observes and attacks.)

2137
01:25:36,455 --> 01:25:37,854
Punch again.

2138
01:25:37,855 --> 01:25:41,024
(Uie has grown into a boxer with a deadly one-two.)

2139
01:25:41,025 --> 01:25:42,095
That's it. Nice.

2140
01:25:42,195 --> 01:25:43,364
Good.

2141
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:44,794
(Captain Kim is busy dodging her punches.)

2142
01:25:44,795 --> 01:25:45,834
Yes.

2143
01:25:45,835 --> 01:25:48,135
Don't put any distance between you two.

2144
01:25:48,235 --> 01:25:49,265
- Keep going.
- Gosh.

2145
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:50,964
Here he comes.

2146
01:25:50,965 --> 01:25:52,034
- Punch.
- Gosh.

2147
01:25:52,035 --> 01:25:53,835
(Focused until the very end)

2148
01:25:54,305 --> 01:25:55,504
(Taking a knee guard)

2149
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:57,025
- Until the end.
- She's watching him.

2150
01:25:57,775 --> 01:25:59,344
(Uie persistently throws punches.)

2151
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:00,875
- Okay.
- That's it. Good.

2152
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:02,384
Punch. Yes.

2153
01:26:02,385 --> 01:26:03,584
Punch. Nice.

2154
01:26:03,585 --> 01:26:05,085
Good job. Hurry. Again.

2155
01:26:05,315 --> 01:26:06,614
Stop.

2156
01:26:06,615 --> 01:26:08,154
- Uie.
- Well done.

2157
01:26:08,155 --> 01:26:09,835
- She throws countless punches.
- Exactly.

2158
01:26:10,025 --> 01:26:11,224
(Even the almighty Stun Gun is tired.)

2159
01:26:11,225 --> 01:26:12,925
(Plopping)

2160
01:26:13,295 --> 01:26:15,394
- That was insane, Uie.
- Really?

2161
01:26:15,395 --> 01:26:17,165
I think you threw at least 200 punches.

2162
01:26:17,325 --> 01:26:18,965
Coach Kim, is it foul play to kneel down?

2163
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:21,065
- Yes, that's a foul.
- Sorry.

2164
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:23,435
- "A foul?" - I broke the rules.

2165
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:25,004
You bent down quite deeply.

2166
01:26:25,005 --> 01:26:26,835
- I have many techniques...
- Yes?

2167
01:26:27,005 --> 01:26:28,905
To unsettle my opponent when I'm in a pinch.

2168
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:31,405
I rarely go down on my knees.

2169
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:34,374
Captain Kim moves around like crazy.

2170
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,514
- "What is he doing?" - That is how...

2171
01:26:35,515 --> 01:26:36,585
I throw my opponent off.

2172
01:26:37,145 --> 01:26:39,515
"What is he doing? Why is he dropping to one knee?"

2173
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:42,755
(What is he doing?)

2174
01:26:43,085 --> 01:26:45,255
(Punishing him right away)

2175
01:26:45,555 --> 01:26:48,894
I thought he was proposing to me.

2176
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:50,725
(Will you spar with me?)

2177
01:26:51,295 --> 01:26:52,665
(Embarrassed)

2178
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:54,034
It was super entertaining.

2179
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:55,164
Uie is...

2180
01:26:55,165 --> 01:26:56,364
- a little timid.
- True.

2181
01:26:56,365 --> 01:26:57,604
Right?

2182
01:26:57,605 --> 01:26:59,274
In exchange for your timidness,

2183
01:26:59,275 --> 01:27:01,535
- your defense has improved greatly.
- I agree.

2184
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:04,144
On top of that, you've gotten...

2185
01:27:04,145 --> 01:27:06,644
much better at attacking with your lead hand.

2186
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:07,914
- Yes.
- You've improved greatly.

2187
01:27:07,915 --> 01:27:09,285
(Satisfied)

2188
01:27:10,115 --> 01:27:11,214
Are you ready?

2189
01:27:11,215 --> 01:27:12,385
(Who is the next boxer?)

2190
01:27:12,585 --> 01:27:13,784
Get ready.

2191
01:27:13,785 --> 01:27:14,785
What's up with those two? They're hilarious.

2192
01:27:14,786 --> 01:27:15,985
Round One.

2193
01:27:16,725 --> 01:27:17,755
Box.

2194
01:27:18,925 --> 01:27:21,795
(Rushing out as soon as the match begins)

2195
01:27:24,595 --> 01:27:27,135
(Ju Hyun starts with jabs.)

2196
01:27:29,865 --> 01:27:33,504
(She successfully hits Captain Kim within 8 seconds.)

2197
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:35,475
Ju Hyun hit him as soon as the match started.

2198
01:27:37,305 --> 01:27:39,674
(Throwing a low and high feint)

2199
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:40,775
That's it.

2200
01:27:41,445 --> 01:27:45,245
(Stun Gun dodges at lightning speed.)

2201
01:27:45,455 --> 01:27:48,115
(He dodges skillfully in every direction.)

2202
01:27:49,355 --> 01:27:50,855
- Yes.
- Nice.

2203
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:53,024
- That's it.
- Yes.

2204
01:27:53,025 --> 01:27:54,794
(This time, she lands a jab on his chin.)

2205
01:27:54,795 --> 01:27:55,825
Hold on.

2206
01:27:55,865 --> 01:27:56,924
(1 punch)

2207
01:27:56,925 --> 01:27:58,494
(2 punches)

2208
01:27:58,495 --> 01:27:59,564
He got trapped.

2209
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:01,335
Punch. That's it. Keep watching him.

2210
01:28:02,305 --> 01:28:06,805
(Eventually, Stun Gun's legs give way.)

2211
01:28:07,475 --> 01:28:08,945
You've got good stamina.

2212
01:28:10,305 --> 01:28:13,774
(Ju Hyun used to have neither technique...)

2213
01:28:13,775 --> 01:28:16,415
(nor stamina.)

2214
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:21,015
(Now, she can attack for a full round.)

2215
01:28:21,415 --> 01:28:23,024
That's it, a flurry of punches.

2216
01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:24,854
(She has grown into a menacing boxer.)

2217
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:26,025
Stop.

2218
01:28:26,555 --> 01:28:28,455
(Ju Hyun's revenge match ends.)

2219
01:28:28,495 --> 01:28:29,495
Round One.

2220
01:28:29,496 --> 01:28:30,536
(The next and final round)

2221
01:28:31,025 --> 01:28:32,064
Box.

2222
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:33,385
(Sae Rok's revenge match begins.)

2223
01:28:33,595 --> 01:28:34,794
(Attacking fiercely from the start)

2224
01:28:34,795 --> 01:28:36,005
She's fast.

2225
01:28:36,535 --> 01:28:37,605
You're strong.

2226
01:28:38,465 --> 01:28:39,575
Your punches are heavy.

2227
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:42,204
(Landing punches)

2228
01:28:42,205 --> 01:28:43,274
Stay calm.

2229
01:28:43,275 --> 01:28:45,104
(A heavy straight punch)

2230
01:28:45,105 --> 01:28:46,544
- Do you need an ambulance?
- Again.

2231
01:28:46,545 --> 01:28:47,945
Chase after him.

2232
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:49,315
Nice.

2233
01:28:51,845 --> 01:28:52,855
(Screaming)

2234
01:28:52,885 --> 01:28:54,855
(Captain Kim suddenly goes down?)

2235
01:28:54,915 --> 01:28:56,925
She stepped on my foot.

2236
01:28:57,525 --> 01:28:58,825
(While taking quick steps, )

2237
01:28:58,925 --> 01:29:00,655
(she ends up stepping on his foot.)

2238
01:29:02,325 --> 01:29:03,364
Two.

2239
01:29:03,365 --> 01:29:05,025
(The gentle step...)

2240
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:06,935
(knocks him down immediately.)

2241
01:29:07,135 --> 01:29:08,764
- Get up. Hurry up.
- Get up.

2242
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:10,535
Stop wasting time, Captain Kim.

2243
01:29:10,705 --> 01:29:11,705
What?

2244
01:29:11,706 --> 01:29:13,674
One, two,

2245
01:29:13,675 --> 01:29:16,274
- three, four...
- She stepped on my foot.

2246
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:17,875
(The biased referee is cheerful.)

2247
01:29:17,945 --> 01:29:19,975
- Okay.
- Seven, eight, okay.

2248
01:29:20,145 --> 01:29:21,615
- We chose a bad referee.
- Box.

2249
01:29:24,285 --> 01:29:26,185
(Sae Rok corners him once again.)

2250
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:29,324
Stay calm. Don't rush.

2251
01:29:29,325 --> 01:29:32,895
(Captain Kim is busy dodging the flurry of punches.)

2252
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,665
(Screaming)

2253
01:29:36,565 --> 01:29:37,565
(Screaming)

2254
01:29:37,566 --> 01:29:40,765
(Having no energy left to throw punches, )

2255
01:29:41,395 --> 01:29:43,905
(Sae Rok collapsed before even 2 minutes had passed.)

2256
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:47,474
- That's good. Again. Ten seconds.
- Nice.

2257
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:49,774
- Good. Well done.
- Great.

2258
01:29:49,775 --> 01:29:51,895
(Gained stamina to go all out in the last 10 seconds)

2259
01:29:52,075 --> 01:29:53,314
You're almost there.

2260
01:29:53,315 --> 01:29:54,675
Stop.

2261
01:29:54,715 --> 01:29:56,385
Greet each other.

2262
01:29:56,885 --> 01:29:57,914
She's different, right?

2263
01:29:57,915 --> 01:29:59,861
Sae Rok is different, isn't she? She's the best, right?

2264
01:29:59,885 --> 01:30:00,914
Unbelievable, right?

2265
01:30:00,915 --> 01:30:02,924
Back when we didn't know anything,

2266
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:04,254
we also fought for two minutes, didn't we?

2267
01:30:04,255 --> 01:30:06,024
We thought we were throwing strong punches,

2268
01:30:06,025 --> 01:30:07,754
but they were actually weak ones.

2269
01:30:07,755 --> 01:30:11,964
Today, we finally understood what Coach Kim meant,

2270
01:30:11,965 --> 01:30:14,634
and it felt like some of our punches actually landed on him.

2271
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:16,534
It's only today that we've realized...

2272
01:30:16,535 --> 01:30:18,435
just how much we've improved.

2273
01:30:18,565 --> 01:30:19,604
(Feeling proud)

2274
01:30:19,605 --> 01:30:21,504
Coach Kim's eyes have become teary.

2275
01:30:21,505 --> 01:30:23,704
- Don't cry.
- Coach Kim is tender-hearted.

2276
01:30:23,705 --> 01:30:25,005
- I really...
- He cries easily.

2277
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:28,844
We've worked so hard that...

2278
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:30,285
- even Coach Kim was moved.
- Right.

2279
01:30:30,315 --> 01:30:32,045
Honestly,

2280
01:30:32,145 --> 01:30:33,754
I think you've built enough technique...

2281
01:30:33,755 --> 01:30:36,225
and discovered your own style.

2282
01:30:36,485 --> 01:30:39,455
Our tournament is in ten days, right?

2283
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:41,194
Think about the opponent you'll likely face,

2284
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:43,565
and about everything we've trained for each day up to now.

2285
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:45,894
- What are we doing?
- Today, the four of you...

2286
01:30:45,895 --> 01:30:47,664
- What are we doing?
- will fight each other.

2287
01:30:47,665 --> 01:30:49,104
- Us four?
- The four of us?

2288
01:30:49,105 --> 01:30:50,135
Yes.

2289
01:30:51,135 --> 01:30:52,705
(Two months ago)

2290
01:30:53,975 --> 01:30:59,015
(They were scared even before it began.)

2291
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:02,745
(The first supervised sparring was over in a flash.)

2292
01:31:03,145 --> 01:31:05,414
(The second supervised sparring...)

2293
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:06,484
(was still all about struggling to adjust.)

2294
01:31:06,485 --> 01:31:07,855
(She's super fast.)

2295
01:31:09,285 --> 01:31:12,925
(During the three sparring sessions, )

2296
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:17,525
(as they got punched with real intensity, they discovered...)

2297
01:31:17,965 --> 01:31:21,035
(their own strengths and styles while their skills improved.)

2298
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:25,265
(The final sparring opponent: the Iron Girls)

2299
01:31:25,465 --> 01:31:27,675
Rather than going all out,

2300
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:29,474
focus on testing whether your techniques work.

2301
01:31:29,475 --> 01:31:31,545
- Just until, "This would work." - Exactly.

2302
01:31:31,645 --> 01:31:34,474
All combat sports athletes train like this most often.

2303
01:31:34,475 --> 01:31:36,344
A sparring session with teammates,

2304
01:31:36,345 --> 01:31:37,984
simulating real matches and adapting to the opponent's style.

2305
01:31:37,985 --> 01:31:39,691
Athletes mostly train through full matches.

2306
01:31:39,715 --> 01:31:41,414
- I'm in.
- It sounds fun.

2307
01:31:41,415 --> 01:31:43,924
Uie and Ju Hyun will spar together as partners.

2308
01:31:43,925 --> 01:31:46,155
(Park Ju Hyun versus Uie)

2309
01:31:46,355 --> 01:31:47,425
- It's us.
- Us two.

2310
01:31:48,155 --> 01:31:49,225
Between roommates.

2311
01:31:49,725 --> 01:31:51,205
You're great matches for one another.

2312
01:31:51,395 --> 01:31:53,235
- An in-fighter and out-boxer.
- The opposite.

2313
01:31:53,265 --> 01:31:55,311
- And an in-fighter and out-boxer.
- An in-fighter and out-boxer.

2314
01:31:55,335 --> 01:31:57,204
- Yes.
- Good. The first match.

2315
01:31:57,205 --> 01:32:00,205
Uie versus Park Ju Hyun. Please get ready.

2316
01:32:03,205 --> 01:32:07,675
(Ju Hyun and Uie prepare to spar.)

2317
01:32:09,185 --> 01:32:12,015
The sparring session will be 2 rounds of 2 minutes each.

2318
01:32:12,655 --> 01:32:13,785
I love you, Uie.

2319
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:16,824
- With that, Ji Hyun will punch Uie.
- After saying that...

2320
01:32:16,825 --> 01:32:18,484
- She'll punch her.
- That's scarier.

2321
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:20,724
- That's scarier.
- Ju Hyun's eyes will change.

2322
01:32:20,725 --> 01:32:22,255
I really like you, you know?

2323
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:23,965
All right. Ready?

2324
01:32:24,865 --> 01:32:26,235
(Suddenly changing)

2325
01:32:27,135 --> 01:32:29,565
(Her mad-mode is on.)

2326
01:32:30,505 --> 01:32:33,335
(The in-fighter who calmly...)

2327
01:32:34,205 --> 01:32:37,205
(sizes up the opponent before charging in like a bull)

2328
01:32:38,105 --> 01:32:40,345
(Mad Boxer Park Ju Hyun)

2329
01:32:40,515 --> 01:32:41,945
(And her opponent)

2330
01:32:42,275 --> 01:32:44,185
(Blessed with incredible reach)

2331
01:32:45,115 --> 01:32:48,355
(Dominating everyone with just the one-two combination)

2332
01:32:49,325 --> 01:32:51,525
(One-Two Uie)

2333
01:32:51,655 --> 01:32:53,755
Get ready. Round One.

2334
01:32:53,925 --> 01:32:55,294
An in-fighter and out-boxer.

2335
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:56,295
Box.

2336
01:32:56,296 --> 01:32:57,725
(Round 1 begins.)

2337
01:33:03,905 --> 01:33:05,481
(They jab at each other, sizing each other up.)

2338
01:33:05,505 --> 01:33:06,934
(Ju Hyun attempts a body shot.)

2339
01:33:06,935 --> 01:33:08,905
(Uie lands a straight punch.)

2340
01:33:09,605 --> 01:33:12,245
(A feisty straight punch)

2341
01:33:13,545 --> 01:33:16,044
(Jabbing after parrying)

2342
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:17,945
Feint, retreat, and then punch.

2343
01:33:18,215 --> 01:33:20,284
- Be quick.
- Yes, that's it.

2344
01:33:20,285 --> 01:33:21,984
(A body shot after a feint)

2345
01:33:21,985 --> 01:33:23,955
Yes, that's it. Move high and low.

2346
01:33:24,325 --> 01:33:25,971
- Move high and low.
- The intensity went up right away.

2347
01:33:25,995 --> 01:33:27,915
- The girls are real boxers now.
- High and low.

2348
01:33:28,395 --> 01:33:29,625
High and low.

2349
01:33:29,665 --> 01:33:31,324
(Probing like a real fight)

2350
01:33:31,325 --> 01:33:32,795
Yes, fool her like that.

2351
01:33:33,335 --> 01:33:34,464
Nice. Good.

2352
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:35,765
- What?
- Well done.

2353
01:33:36,035 --> 01:33:37,905
(A cross-counter)

2354
01:33:38,065 --> 01:33:39,775
(Another cross-counter)

2355
01:33:39,835 --> 01:33:41,775
(Valid strike)

2356
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:44,475
- Again. Watch your opponent.
- Stretch out.

2357
01:33:44,805 --> 01:33:46,315
(Ju Hyun aims for the low.)

2358
01:33:46,545 --> 01:33:49,115
That's it. Get up now. That's how you do it.

2359
01:33:49,185 --> 01:33:51,515
- Uie slipped away well.
- She has improved.

2360
01:33:51,615 --> 01:33:52,955
Guard up, Ju Hyun.

2361
01:33:53,155 --> 01:33:54,595
- Move in with your guard up.
- Yes.

2362
01:33:55,155 --> 01:33:56,955
(Calmly looking for the right timing)

2363
01:33:57,085 --> 01:33:58,384
(Striking immediately)

2364
01:33:58,385 --> 01:33:59,395
(Parrying)

2365
01:34:00,055 --> 01:34:01,555
- That's it.
- Park Ju!

2366
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:02,994
That was a smart move by Ju Hyun.

2367
01:34:02,995 --> 01:34:04,355
(A perfectly-timed jab once again)

2368
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:05,665
That was great timing.

2369
01:34:08,265 --> 01:34:10,665
(Jabbing at each other to find the perfect timing to attack)

2370
01:34:10,705 --> 01:34:11,835
(A valid strike by Ju Hyun)

2371
01:34:12,305 --> 01:34:13,881
(After calmly observing Uie's movements, )

2372
01:34:13,905 --> 01:34:15,805
(Ju Hyun lands a jab through her open guard.)

2373
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:17,304
- That was a long punch by Ju Hyun.
- Well done.

2374
01:34:17,305 --> 01:34:19,615
She overcame the long reach with the jab.

2375
01:34:19,775 --> 01:34:21,495
(Uie kept her eyes on Ju Hyun's movements.)

2376
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:22,615
(A parry after a cross-counter)

2377
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:23,615
Good.

2378
01:34:23,845 --> 01:34:25,785
(Looking for the perfect timing to strike)

2379
01:34:26,255 --> 01:34:27,255
Yes.

2380
01:34:27,255 --> 01:34:28,255
(Parrying)

2381
01:34:28,256 --> 01:34:31,524
(A straight punch and a valid jab)

2382
01:34:31,525 --> 01:34:32,555
That's it. Well done.

2383
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,154
Both of you did well.

2384
01:34:34,155 --> 01:34:35,194
(Ju Hyun's jab pierces through.)

2385
01:34:35,195 --> 01:34:36,195
- Both of them are...
- Follow the two...

2386
01:34:36,196 --> 01:34:37,795
- They're good.
- with a hook.

2387
01:34:39,165 --> 01:34:40,434
Staying composed is good.

2388
01:34:40,435 --> 01:34:42,095
Uie's current rhythm is nice.

2389
01:34:43,435 --> 01:34:45,535
- Nice, Ju Hyun.
- Amazing.

2390
01:34:47,135 --> 01:34:48,281
- Ten seconds.
- She targets...

2391
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:49,344
- Nice rhythm.
- any opening.

2392
01:34:49,345 --> 01:34:50,775
All right, good.

2393
01:34:51,305 --> 01:34:52,945
That was too wide. Make it short.

2394
01:34:53,115 --> 01:34:54,175
Yes.

2395
01:34:54,475 --> 01:34:55,815
(A straight punch)

2396
01:34:56,245 --> 01:34:58,114
(Ju Hyun's straight punch pierced through the reach.)

2397
01:34:58,115 --> 01:34:59,384
- Ju Hyun.
- Both of you did well.

2398
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:00,385
- Just now...
- Stop.

2399
01:35:00,386 --> 01:35:02,585
(Round 1 ends.)

2400
01:35:04,755 --> 01:35:07,255
- You two are amazing.
- It was so much fun.

2401
01:35:07,795 --> 01:35:09,394
- Are you okay?
- Was I too strong?

2402
01:35:09,395 --> 01:35:11,195
- No, you're fine.
- Am I too strong?

2403
01:35:11,365 --> 01:35:13,865
All right, come over here. Well done.

2404
01:35:14,095 --> 01:35:16,635
Uie counterattacked perfectly at the right time.

2405
01:35:16,865 --> 01:35:18,625
Ju Hyun responded well with a cross-counter.

2406
01:35:18,765 --> 01:35:20,334
- You two are incredible.
- That's how it's done.

2407
01:35:20,335 --> 01:35:22,604
You two know each other's techniques.

2408
01:35:22,605 --> 01:35:23,975
You've quickly figured out...

2409
01:35:24,045 --> 01:35:27,444
how to block and turn it against one another.

2410
01:35:27,445 --> 01:35:28,844
I can't reach her.

2411
01:35:28,845 --> 01:35:30,444
Ju Hyun, your timing was great.

2412
01:35:30,445 --> 01:35:31,784
Now, connect it with one more move.

2413
01:35:31,785 --> 01:35:34,084
After a high-low combination, follow up with a hook.

2414
01:35:34,085 --> 01:35:37,085
And Uie, what did I tell you to do after your one-two?

2415
01:35:37,185 --> 01:35:38,925
- Your lead hand...
- Two, hook.

2416
01:35:39,185 --> 01:35:41,795
- That's what you should do. Got it?
- Thank you.

2417
01:35:41,855 --> 01:35:43,194
Follow through, okay?

2418
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:44,394
- All right. Corners.
- You two are amazing.

2419
01:35:44,395 --> 01:35:45,795
You're like real boxers right now.

2420
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:47,705
This is like professional-level training.

2421
01:35:48,065 --> 01:35:49,234
They're really skilled.

2422
01:35:49,235 --> 01:35:50,264
- That was fun.
- Well done.

2423
01:35:50,265 --> 01:35:51,904
Both of them can read and punch well.

2424
01:35:51,905 --> 01:35:52,975
The last round.

2425
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:55,104
- Two, then a hook.
- Well done.

2426
01:35:55,105 --> 01:35:57,044
(Reviewing her Round 2 task)

2427
01:35:57,045 --> 01:35:58,545
(Recharged with madness)

2428
01:35:58,775 --> 01:35:59,775
Box.

2429
01:35:59,776 --> 01:36:00,845
(Round 2 begins.)

2430
01:36:04,615 --> 01:36:06,515
Stay calm, everyone. You're doing well.

2431
01:36:08,615 --> 01:36:09,624
Yes.

2432
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,225
(After parrying, Uie jabs.)

2433
01:36:12,325 --> 01:36:13,394
(Ju Hyun's counter straight punch)

2434
01:36:13,395 --> 01:36:14,854
Yes. Nice one.

2435
01:36:14,855 --> 01:36:16,325
Ju Hyun has great timing.

2436
01:36:16,895 --> 01:36:19,025
(Ju Hyun kept looking for the perfect moment.)

2437
01:36:19,065 --> 01:36:20,195
- That's it.
- Yes.

2438
01:36:20,535 --> 01:36:21,864
(After defending, )

2439
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,345
(she strikes at just the right time.)

2440
01:36:24,005 --> 01:36:26,335
(Dodge)

2441
01:36:26,635 --> 01:36:27,981
(She dodges every punch from Uie, )

2442
01:36:28,005 --> 01:36:29,444
(then jabs without hesitation.)

2443
01:36:29,445 --> 01:36:30,974
Her timing is spot on.

2444
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:33,514
(Ju Hyun has a sharp sense for timing and spotting openings.)

2445
01:36:33,515 --> 01:36:35,914
Good. Well done.

2446
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,235
(Launching another fierce attack)

2447
01:36:37,315 --> 01:36:40,185
(Uie watches Ju Hyun carefully.)

2448
01:36:41,785 --> 01:36:43,024
- Nice.
- Goodness.

2449
01:36:43,025 --> 01:36:44,525
You're doing great, Uie.

2450
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,831
- That's it. Punch when you move in.
- Uie.

2451
01:36:46,855 --> 01:36:48,254
- Dodge.
- Be tricky, Uie.

2452
01:36:48,255 --> 01:36:49,325
Punch. Well done.

2453
01:36:49,965 --> 01:36:50,994
(Groaning)

2454
01:36:50,995 --> 01:36:52,364
(Using her long reach, she lands a straight.)

2455
01:36:52,365 --> 01:36:53,534
- Be tricky, Uie.
- Punch. Well done.

2456
01:36:53,535 --> 01:36:55,094
- That was a long reach.
- Good.

2457
01:36:55,095 --> 01:36:56,215
She has a really long reach.

2458
01:36:56,405 --> 01:36:58,525
I didn't think I'd get hit, but her reach is so long.

2459
01:36:59,405 --> 01:37:00,535
Come on. Keep going.

2460
01:37:02,005 --> 01:37:03,075
Continue.

2461
01:37:03,105 --> 01:37:05,644
Watch carefully. That's it. Again.

2462
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:07,315
Attack again. Punch.

2463
01:37:07,615 --> 01:37:09,015
- Nice, Park Ju.
- That's it.

2464
01:37:09,415 --> 01:37:11,885
(Guard up, a straight punch)

2465
01:37:12,085 --> 01:37:13,445
(A cross-counter at the same time)

2466
01:37:13,755 --> 01:37:15,155
(As Uie goes for a one-two, )

2467
01:37:15,215 --> 01:37:17,255
(Ju Hyun's jab slips through.)

2468
01:37:17,355 --> 01:37:18,884
(Following up with a one-two)

2469
01:37:18,885 --> 01:37:20,295
- Nice, Park Ju.
- Go.

2470
01:37:20,355 --> 01:37:21,624
(But Uie countered with a straight.)

2471
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,785
- Nice, Park Ju.
- That's it.

2472
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:24,625
- Both of them are great.
- Good.

2473
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:26,134
You're both playing mind games.

2474
01:37:26,135 --> 01:37:28,195
That's it. Nice one.

2475
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,165
That's it.

2476
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:31,605
That's it.

2477
01:37:32,265 --> 01:37:34,174
That's it. Nice one.

2478
01:37:34,175 --> 01:37:36,105
(Ju Hyun lands a perfect straight punch.)

2479
01:37:36,675 --> 01:37:38,274
(Gwang Bok is on a roll.)

2480
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:39,974
- A counter.
- Yes, that was great.

2481
01:37:39,975 --> 01:37:40,991
(Ju Hyun waits to attack again.)

2482
01:37:41,015 --> 01:37:42,314
- You followed up well, Ju Hyun.
- Gosh.

2483
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,675
- That cross-counter was...
- Yes.

2484
01:37:43,815 --> 01:37:45,745
Follow up. Nice. Good job just now.

2485
01:37:46,185 --> 01:37:48,715
(Trying a body shot after a feint)

2486
01:37:48,815 --> 01:37:50,725
(But Uie seizes the moment to counter...)

2487
01:37:50,885 --> 01:37:54,094
(with a flurry of one-twos, her specialty.)

2488
01:37:54,095 --> 01:37:55,854
Well done. That was good.

2489
01:37:55,855 --> 01:37:57,025
Great job, Uie.

2490
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:59,045
- Great job, Uie.
- The body shot was a mistake.

2491
01:37:59,195 --> 01:38:00,441
- You're right.
- That two was great.

2492
01:38:00,465 --> 01:38:04,265
(Ju Hyun focuses again and watches for the right timing.)

2493
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,435
Yes. Great. Watch carefully.

2494
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:07,704
(A long punch landed instantly.)

2495
01:38:07,705 --> 01:38:09,005
(Staggering)

2496
01:38:09,275 --> 01:38:10,275
Eyes on each other.

2497
01:38:10,275 --> 01:38:11,275
(Sparta, keep going!)

2498
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:12,914
(Are you good?)

2499
01:38:12,915 --> 01:38:14,775
They're both eyeing each other.

2500
01:38:15,315 --> 01:38:17,385
Try to land a high punch. Yes, good job.

2501
01:38:18,445 --> 01:38:19,485
That's it.

2502
01:38:19,855 --> 01:38:21,655
(Ju Hyun lands a perfect jab.)

2503
01:38:21,815 --> 01:38:24,025
How can she endure that long reach?

2504
01:38:25,425 --> 01:38:27,095
Ten seconds. Come on.

2505
01:38:27,825 --> 01:38:29,395
- That's it. Nice one.
- What?

2506
01:38:30,325 --> 01:38:34,295
(Uie's valid strike, Ju Hyun's valid strike)

2507
01:38:34,565 --> 01:38:36,685
(Shocked by the fierce attack all the way to the end)

2508
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:38,865
Well done.

2509
01:38:39,475 --> 01:38:40,475
Stop.

2510
01:38:40,476 --> 01:38:42,535
(Round 2 ends.)

2511
01:38:43,005 --> 01:38:44,181
- Good job.
- Did it not hurt?

2512
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:45,605
- No. Are you okay?
- Was it okay?

2513
01:38:45,975 --> 01:38:47,175
Well done. Greet each other.

2514
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:51,514
- Why are you both so good?
- That was crazy.

2515
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:53,554
- That was so much fun.
- Good job.

2516
01:38:53,555 --> 01:38:55,055
Please have one more round.

2517
01:38:55,115 --> 01:38:56,884
- Seriously.
- That's how professionals train.

2518
01:38:56,885 --> 01:38:58,254
I was so shocked.

2519
01:38:58,255 --> 01:38:59,694
Despite this level of intensity,

2520
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:01,495
the two of them could train...

2521
01:39:01,825 --> 01:39:04,341
without getting their feelings hurt. They were like professionals.

2522
01:39:04,365 --> 01:39:06,335
I know...

2523
01:39:06,695 --> 01:39:07,995
her style.

2524
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:10,264
I know her style.

2525
01:39:10,265 --> 01:39:12,505
I know that I'll take three hits for a chance.

2526
01:39:13,035 --> 01:39:14,704
At first, I got closer.

2527
01:39:14,705 --> 01:39:17,004
I could see her going for a two,

2528
01:39:17,005 --> 01:39:18,375
so I dodged and still got hit.

2529
01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:21,585
(In Round 2, they were looking for the right time to attack.)

2530
01:39:22,715 --> 01:39:25,945
(She dodged, but the punch went straight to her face.)

2531
01:39:26,015 --> 01:39:28,215
I didn't think that I'd get hit. You have a long reach.

2532
01:39:28,415 --> 01:39:29,985
- It's long.
- Her reach is so long.

2533
01:39:30,025 --> 01:39:31,425
Uie,

2534
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:32,555
you did really well.

2535
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:34,454
The waterwheel punches practically disappeared.

2536
01:39:34,455 --> 01:39:35,654
- That's right.
- Really?

2537
01:39:35,655 --> 01:39:36,664
- Yes.
- That's right.

2538
01:39:36,665 --> 01:39:37,724
- She stopped doing this.
- Just now,

2539
01:39:37,725 --> 01:39:39,634
the punches were precise.

2540
01:39:39,635 --> 01:39:41,835
- Really?
- Your punches are precise now.

2541
01:39:42,035 --> 01:39:45,804
(In the previous sparring, Uie showed the waterwheel punches.)

2542
01:39:45,805 --> 01:39:47,775
(However, in today's sparring)

2543
01:39:48,135 --> 01:39:49,274
(Valid strike)

2544
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:51,995
(She stretched out her long arms and struck the opponent precisely.)

2545
01:39:52,075 --> 01:39:54,044
(Even afterward, she didn't show the waterwheel punches.)

2546
01:39:54,045 --> 01:39:56,385
(She made valid strikes.)

2547
01:39:56,515 --> 01:39:57,985
I couldn't attack.

2548
01:39:58,245 --> 01:39:59,414
But you're very strong.

2549
01:39:59,415 --> 01:40:01,254
She's really good at attacking at the right time.

2550
01:40:01,255 --> 01:40:02,984
I know. She's really good at timing her attacks.

2551
01:40:02,985 --> 01:40:04,984
Among people I've sparred with,

2552
01:40:04,985 --> 01:40:06,754
- she was the most difficult.
- That's right.

2553
01:40:06,755 --> 01:40:07,924
Why was I the most difficult?

2554
01:40:07,925 --> 01:40:10,365
Even though her eye level was below mine,

2555
01:40:10,495 --> 01:40:13,264
- she threw precise punches upward.
- That's right.

2556
01:40:13,265 --> 01:40:15,035
I couldn't dodge.

2557
01:40:15,335 --> 01:40:16,364
(She sought out the right timing...)

2558
01:40:16,365 --> 01:40:19,065
(and punched without hesitation.)

2559
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,174
(Ju Hyun saw and punched well throughout the round.)

2560
01:40:22,175 --> 01:40:23,374
At the right time,

2561
01:40:23,375 --> 01:40:24,674
she overcame her short height and attacked.

2562
01:40:24,675 --> 01:40:26,214
- Her timing was amazing.
- I know.

2563
01:40:26,215 --> 01:40:27,474
It isn't easy to do that.

2564
01:40:27,475 --> 01:40:28,744
She has sharp eyes.

2565
01:40:28,745 --> 01:40:29,745
(I'm the boxer with no losses, Park Ju Hyun.)

2566
01:40:29,746 --> 01:40:31,561
- She was so cool.
- Her footwork was good too.

2567
01:40:31,585 --> 01:40:33,584
Two strikes were perfect.

2568
01:40:33,585 --> 01:40:35,054
They were the strikes...

2569
01:40:35,055 --> 01:40:36,895
a judge could give a standing eight count for.

2570
01:40:37,185 --> 01:40:39,594
(A flurry in Round 2)

2571
01:40:39,595 --> 01:40:41,655
(Her jab was timed perfectly.)

2572
01:40:41,755 --> 01:40:43,865
(The second punch also came at the right time.)

2573
01:40:44,195 --> 01:40:47,295
(Uie's head was thrown back.)

2574
01:40:47,395 --> 01:40:50,305
She had some clean hits.

2575
01:40:50,805 --> 01:40:51,934
(Well done, Park Ju Hyun.)

2576
01:40:51,935 --> 01:40:54,374
Today's sparring was beneficial...

2577
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:55,674
- for everyone's growth.
- Seriously.

2578
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:56,944
- Thank you.
- It was so cool.

2579
01:40:56,945 --> 01:40:58,544
- I love you.
- Same here.

2580
01:40:58,545 --> 01:41:00,645
- It was the real deal.
- Seriously.

2581
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:02,044
All right. Now comes...

2582
01:41:02,045 --> 01:41:03,584
- the next sparring.
- Okay.

2583
01:41:03,585 --> 01:41:06,555
It's Keum Sae Rok versus Seol In Ah. Get ready.

2584
01:41:07,285 --> 01:41:09,684
As you throw jabs,

2585
01:41:09,685 --> 01:41:12,385
- give feints, okay?
- Okay.

2586
01:41:12,425 --> 01:41:13,824
- Do other things when you practice.
- I should focus on what I did.

2587
01:41:13,825 --> 01:41:15,955
Now, focus on fooling your opponent...

2588
01:41:16,025 --> 01:41:17,225
and throwing a two.

2589
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:20,695
It has been a while.

2590
01:41:21,735 --> 01:41:24,234
(In Ah is sparring 3 weeks after the 1st tournament.)

2591
01:41:24,235 --> 01:41:26,134
Sae Rok's reach is incredibly long.

2592
01:41:26,135 --> 01:41:28,875
That's right. That's why you need to go in there.

2593
01:41:31,745 --> 01:41:33,844
(She enters the ring in a nervous and excited state.)

2594
01:41:33,845 --> 01:41:36,315
It has been so long.

2595
01:41:37,385 --> 01:41:40,754
(Sae Rok is ready as well.)

2596
01:41:40,755 --> 01:41:43,755
You can tell that their punches will be painful.

2597
01:41:44,285 --> 01:41:45,354
I'm in your care.

2598
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:46,394
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2599
01:41:46,395 --> 01:41:47,624
- I love you.
- Like what you saw earlier,

2600
01:41:47,625 --> 01:41:49,124
spar in a way that trains you.

2601
01:41:49,125 --> 01:41:51,465
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2602
01:41:51,865 --> 01:41:54,065
(She judges the situation calmly.)

2603
01:41:54,295 --> 01:41:57,235
(Even when she takes hits, she doesn't give up.)

2604
01:41:57,535 --> 01:41:59,935
(The member with willpower, Determined Sae Rok)

2605
01:42:02,275 --> 01:42:03,344
(She is good at dodging...)

2606
01:42:03,345 --> 01:42:04,674
(and using techniques.)

2607
01:42:04,675 --> 01:42:07,115
(She's a skilled boxer who's good at everything.)

2608
01:42:07,445 --> 01:42:10,215
(The ace member, Simba Seol)

2609
01:42:10,315 --> 01:42:11,415
Round One.

2610
01:42:11,445 --> 01:42:13,514
(A match between two heavy-hitters)

2611
01:42:13,515 --> 01:42:14,584
Box.

2612
01:42:14,585 --> 01:42:15,715
(Round 1 begins.)

2613
01:42:21,495 --> 01:42:22,995
- Oh, my.
- There you go.

2614
01:42:23,065 --> 01:42:26,695
(Throwing a cross-counter from the get-go)

2615
01:42:28,465 --> 01:42:30,335
(Sae Rok attempts a straight punch.)

2616
01:42:30,605 --> 01:42:31,734
(In Ah attempts a body shot in retaliation.)

2617
01:42:31,735 --> 01:42:33,505
There you go. Both of you are doing great.

2618
01:42:33,635 --> 01:42:34,775
There you go.

2619
01:42:35,335 --> 01:42:36,375
There you go.

2620
01:42:37,305 --> 01:42:38,505
There you go. Watch carefully.

2621
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:39,844
(In Ah's straight...)

2622
01:42:39,845 --> 01:42:41,015
(and high-low combination)

2623
01:42:41,215 --> 01:42:43,445
(Sae Rok blocks the punch.)

2624
01:42:43,585 --> 01:42:44,614
(Grunting)

2625
01:42:44,615 --> 01:42:45,985
(Valid body shot)

2626
01:42:47,115 --> 01:42:49,055
(In Ah continues to attempt an attack.)

2627
01:42:49,185 --> 01:42:50,224
(Sae Rok watches In Ah.)

2628
01:42:50,225 --> 01:42:51,355
Sae Rok.

2629
01:42:51,885 --> 01:42:53,325
- There you go. That's good.
- Okay.

2630
01:42:54,055 --> 01:42:56,394
(Cross-counter)

2631
01:42:56,395 --> 01:42:58,124
- What a cross-counter.
- Good.

2632
01:42:58,125 --> 01:43:00,765
They're like professional boxers. They're professional boxers now.

2633
01:43:00,995 --> 01:43:03,865
(They continue to look for the right time to attack.)

2634
01:43:04,235 --> 01:43:05,634
(A sudden slugfest)

2635
01:43:05,635 --> 01:43:07,305
- Keep going.
- There you go.

2636
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:08,435
(Valid strike)

2637
01:43:09,535 --> 01:43:10,574
(Valid strike)

2638
01:43:10,575 --> 01:43:12,805
(Valid strike)

2639
01:43:12,905 --> 01:43:14,475
There you go. Keep it short.

2640
01:43:14,515 --> 01:43:15,614
Keep it short.

2641
01:43:15,615 --> 01:43:17,045
(Sae Rok rushes forward with jabs.)

2642
01:43:17,845 --> 01:43:19,384
Sae Rok, you're doing great.

2643
01:43:19,385 --> 01:43:20,991
(They watch each other's moves with so much intensity.)

2644
01:43:21,015 --> 01:43:22,414
(In Ah tries to get her to punch with a feint.)

2645
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:23,455
Nice feint.

2646
01:43:26,455 --> 01:43:27,555
There you go.

2647
01:43:28,025 --> 01:43:29,624
Go for a body shot. Jab.

2648
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:31,395
(After dodging, she lands a valid strike.)

2649
01:43:32,565 --> 01:43:33,894
(Sae Rok pushes her.)

2650
01:43:33,895 --> 01:43:35,265
Don't fall back. There you go.

2651
01:43:35,435 --> 01:43:36,734
(Another cross-counter)

2652
01:43:36,735 --> 01:43:37,764
Don't fall back.

2653
01:43:37,765 --> 01:43:40,535
(As In Ah falls back, Sae Rok attacks.)

2654
01:43:40,575 --> 01:43:42,775
Go to the side.

2655
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:44,205
There you go.

2656
01:43:45,245 --> 01:43:46,304
You guys are doing great.

2657
01:43:46,305 --> 01:43:48,875
(Sae Rok calmly waits for the right time.)

2658
01:43:49,145 --> 01:43:52,785
(In Ah moves her body to find the find time to attack.)

2659
01:43:53,115 --> 01:43:54,635
They definitely have different styles.

2660
01:43:56,285 --> 01:43:59,284
(In Ah is an infighter with a lot of movements, )

2661
01:43:59,285 --> 01:44:01,071
(and Sae Rok is an outfighter who waits for a big hit.)

2662
01:44:01,095 --> 01:44:02,124
(In Ah attempts a body shot with a feint.)

2663
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:04,195
Go in there. Come on.

2664
01:44:04,365 --> 01:44:05,695
There you go. That's good.

2665
01:44:06,025 --> 01:44:07,195
There you go. That's good.

2666
01:44:07,235 --> 01:44:08,795
Keep going until the end.

2667
01:44:08,965 --> 01:44:10,034
That's good. Keep going until the end.

2668
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,064
(Sae Rok corners her.)

2669
01:44:11,065 --> 01:44:12,985
Why are you withdrawing to the back after a hit?

2670
01:44:13,235 --> 01:44:14,705
Go to the side.

2671
01:44:15,075 --> 01:44:16,505
Go to the side. There you go.

2672
01:44:16,945 --> 01:44:19,074
(Jab, one, )

2673
01:44:19,075 --> 01:44:20,574
(two)

2674
01:44:20,575 --> 01:44:24,815
(She throws out punches.)

2675
01:44:26,715 --> 01:44:30,285
(After dodging quickly, she puts up her guard.)

2676
01:44:32,555 --> 01:44:33,725
Sae Rok, you're doing great.

2677
01:44:34,095 --> 01:44:35,194
- Stop.
- Okay.

2678
01:44:35,195 --> 01:44:36,594
- Well done.
- Nice.

2679
01:44:36,595 --> 01:44:37,665
Come here.

2680
01:44:38,425 --> 01:44:39,595
- They're good.
- Well done.

2681
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:41,465
- They're really good.
- Well done.

2682
01:44:41,595 --> 01:44:42,795
- It's fun.
- Come over here.

2683
01:44:43,095 --> 01:44:44,705
- Nice.
- Well done.

2684
01:44:44,835 --> 01:44:46,004
You guys did great.

2685
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:47,505
Sae Rok, what you did well was this.

2686
01:44:47,775 --> 01:44:50,775
The way you stayed calm and kept attempting a two was great.

2687
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:53,244
But you should follow up with a hook after a two.

2688
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,844
Do a hook after a two.

2689
01:44:54,845 --> 01:44:57,284
Otherwise, do a jab after a two. Connect the attacks.

2690
01:44:57,285 --> 01:44:58,484
Then your punches will land.

2691
01:44:58,485 --> 01:44:59,514
In Ah,

2692
01:44:59,515 --> 01:45:01,514
your feints and movements were amazing.

2693
01:45:01,515 --> 01:45:03,284
However, after punching,

2694
01:45:03,285 --> 01:45:05,685
you just need to move to the side.

2695
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,024
You keep moving to the back.

2696
01:45:07,025 --> 01:45:08,494
- Okay.
- Do you understand?

2697
01:45:08,495 --> 01:45:10,724
After a hit, pivot to the left.

2698
01:45:10,725 --> 01:45:12,394
Then you'll have defense.

2699
01:45:12,395 --> 01:45:14,434
Okay? Your movements are great.

2700
01:45:14,435 --> 01:45:16,435
My feet won't listen to me.

2701
01:45:17,365 --> 01:45:19,735
(Her ankle isn't fully recovered.)

2702
01:45:19,805 --> 01:45:21,705
Her punches are so strong.

2703
01:45:22,475 --> 01:45:24,545
Sae Rok, your punches are seriously spicy.

2704
01:45:24,845 --> 01:45:25,904
You're the best.

2705
01:45:25,905 --> 01:45:28,214
Hey, your punches are heavy.

2706
01:45:28,215 --> 01:45:30,344
(Speak for yourself.)

2707
01:45:30,345 --> 01:45:31,721
- You guys are doing great.
- Seriously.

2708
01:45:31,745 --> 01:45:33,115
Okay. Round Two.

2709
01:45:33,515 --> 01:45:35,054
- Box.
- You guys are doing great.

2710
01:45:35,055 --> 01:45:36,215
(Round 2 begins.)

2711
01:45:37,385 --> 01:45:40,255
They're having a serious boxing training.

2712
01:45:40,695 --> 01:45:43,595
(In Ah throws jabs like she did in Round 1.)

2713
01:45:44,295 --> 01:45:45,694
There you go. Keep going until the end.

2714
01:45:45,695 --> 01:45:46,795
Don't move to the back.

2715
01:45:48,135 --> 01:45:49,634
(In Ah's straight comes first.)

2716
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,435
(Then comes a cross-counter.)

2717
01:45:51,665 --> 01:45:53,704
(Sae Rok attacks.)

2718
01:45:53,705 --> 01:45:54,774
(Like her strategy for Round 2)

2719
01:45:54,775 --> 01:45:56,621
(she succeeds in following up with a jab after the one-two!)

2720
01:45:56,645 --> 01:45:57,704
Pivot.

2721
01:45:57,705 --> 01:45:58,745
In Ah, pivot.

2722
01:46:02,475 --> 01:46:04,084
(Readying her footwork)

2723
01:46:04,085 --> 01:46:05,714
Jab, jab, dodge, hook, two.

2724
01:46:05,715 --> 01:46:07,354
There you go. Watch out for it.

2725
01:46:07,355 --> 01:46:09,595
Sae Rok, you're doing great. Sae Rok, use the lead hand.

2726
01:46:09,715 --> 01:46:10,754
There you go.

2727
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:12,925
(In Ah uses her lead hand aggressively.)

2728
01:46:12,985 --> 01:46:14,295
Sae Rok, do the one-two.

2729
01:46:15,295 --> 01:46:17,464
(Upon hearing Uie, she throws the one-two.)

2730
01:46:17,465 --> 01:46:19,665
(In Ah was cornering Sae Rok with jabs.)

2731
01:46:19,935 --> 01:46:21,594
(A sudden straight)

2732
01:46:21,595 --> 01:46:23,435
(Sae Rok begins to corner In Ah.)

2733
01:46:23,565 --> 01:46:25,764
(Throwing a straight between the jabs)

2734
01:46:25,765 --> 01:46:28,245
(She uses her long reach to make valid strikes with her jabs.)

2735
01:46:28,305 --> 01:46:30,044
(She follows up with a two...)

2736
01:46:30,045 --> 01:46:32,074
(and wraps up with a cross-counter.)

2737
01:46:32,075 --> 01:46:33,075
Go.

2738
01:46:33,076 --> 01:46:35,675
(In Ah pivots to dodge.)

2739
01:46:37,945 --> 01:46:39,844
(After a feint, )

2740
01:46:39,845 --> 01:46:41,984
(she makes a body shot.)

2741
01:46:41,985 --> 01:46:43,654
Connect the attacks until the end.

2742
01:46:43,655 --> 01:46:46,324
Gosh. I can't believe they can do this.

2743
01:46:46,325 --> 01:46:47,755
I can't believe they can do this.

2744
01:46:48,655 --> 01:46:51,925
(The two of them look for the right time to attack.)

2745
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:53,764
(In Ah closes the gap quickly.)

2746
01:46:53,765 --> 01:46:55,635
There you go. That's good.

2747
01:46:56,495 --> 01:46:59,235
(She went to fight at close range.)

2748
01:47:00,075 --> 01:47:01,634
(Sae Rok lands a jab.)

2749
01:47:01,635 --> 01:47:03,944
(However, In Ah countered with a valid strike.)

2750
01:47:03,945 --> 01:47:06,344
(Cross-counter)

2751
01:47:06,345 --> 01:47:07,915
That's good.

2752
01:47:08,015 --> 01:47:09,444
Withdraw.

2753
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:10,745
Pivot. There you go.

2754
01:47:11,045 --> 01:47:12,484
That's how you withdraw.

2755
01:47:12,485 --> 01:47:14,484
- Sae Rok follows her well.
- Sae Rok follows her well.

2756
01:47:14,485 --> 01:47:15,515
That's how you withdraw.

2757
01:47:15,615 --> 01:47:17,224
(Sae Rok follows her again.)

2758
01:47:17,225 --> 01:47:18,684
(She throws a jab.)

2759
01:47:18,685 --> 01:47:19,824
There you go.

2760
01:47:19,825 --> 01:47:21,345
(She lands consecutive valid strikes.)

2761
01:47:21,925 --> 01:47:23,925
Use your lead hand. There you go.

2762
01:47:25,325 --> 01:47:27,335
There you go. That's good.

2763
01:47:27,365 --> 01:47:31,105
(A slugfest begins.)

2764
01:47:31,335 --> 01:47:32,834
(They land a valid strike each.)

2765
01:47:32,835 --> 01:47:33,934
(Hook)

2766
01:47:33,935 --> 01:47:34,975
(Dodging)

2767
01:47:35,805 --> 01:47:36,974
(Sae Rok's valid strike)

2768
01:47:36,975 --> 01:47:39,744
(In Ah's valid strike)

2769
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:40,774
(Oh, my!)

2770
01:47:40,775 --> 01:47:42,415
Those hooks were very powerful.

2771
01:47:42,475 --> 01:47:44,115
- Cross-counter.
- In Ah is so fast.

2772
01:47:44,815 --> 01:47:45,914
(In Ah attacks again, )

2773
01:47:45,915 --> 01:47:46,955
(but Sae Rok dodges.)

2774
01:47:47,255 --> 01:47:50,684
(They attack and defend fiercely.)

2775
01:47:50,685 --> 01:47:52,405
There you go. That's good. Watch carefully.

2776
01:47:52,725 --> 01:47:53,925
Put your guard up.

2777
01:47:54,355 --> 01:47:55,424
- Put your guard up.
- Ten seconds.

2778
01:47:55,425 --> 01:47:56,985
Put your lead hand up and get in there.

2779
01:47:57,065 --> 01:47:58,264
Dodge.

2780
01:47:58,265 --> 01:48:00,265
(In Ah follows Sae Rok and circles the ring.)

2781
01:48:00,395 --> 01:48:01,964
Good. There you go. Watch the distance.

2782
01:48:01,965 --> 01:48:03,864
Watch the distance. That's it. Watch carefully.

2783
01:48:03,865 --> 01:48:05,235
My goodness. Okay.

2784
01:48:05,405 --> 01:48:06,974
That's it. Watch carefully.

2785
01:48:06,975 --> 01:48:08,674
(In Ah collapses because her ankles give out.)

2786
01:48:08,675 --> 01:48:09,775
Well done.

2787
01:48:10,105 --> 01:48:12,004
Her ankles gave out. Are you okay?

2788
01:48:12,005 --> 01:48:13,474
- I have no strength in them.
- Seriously.

2789
01:48:13,475 --> 01:48:14,945
(Worried)

2790
01:48:15,075 --> 01:48:16,644
- I have no strength in them.
- Seriously.

2791
01:48:16,645 --> 01:48:17,645
Well done.

2792
01:48:17,646 --> 01:48:18,745
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

2793
01:48:18,915 --> 01:48:19,915
It's okay.

2794
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:21,684
(In Ah gave her all to the sparring she hasn't had in a while.)

2795
01:48:21,685 --> 01:48:23,284
I have no strength in my ankles.

2796
01:48:23,285 --> 01:48:24,885
Seriously. I was so startled.

2797
01:48:25,425 --> 01:48:26,955
Both of you guys are amazing.

2798
01:48:28,195 --> 01:48:29,354
I love you.

2799
01:48:29,355 --> 01:48:30,824
(They wrap up with a display of affection.)

2800
01:48:30,825 --> 01:48:32,325
They wrapped up with "I love you."

2801
01:48:32,665 --> 01:48:34,595
- Both of you guys did well.
- Sae Rok.

2802
01:48:35,195 --> 01:48:37,134
We can't help but box...

2803
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:39,334
- as if it's an actual match.
- That's right.

2804
01:48:39,335 --> 01:48:40,704
Instinctively...

2805
01:48:40,705 --> 01:48:42,605
We're boxers, so...

2806
01:48:43,775 --> 01:48:44,844
That's right.

2807
01:48:44,845 --> 01:48:45,904
- Are we?
- Yes.

2808
01:48:45,905 --> 01:48:47,414
- Yes.
- We have that instinct,

2809
01:48:47,415 --> 01:48:49,544
so we can't help but box as if it's an actual match.

2810
01:48:49,545 --> 01:48:50,685
However,

2811
01:48:51,185 --> 01:48:53,415
I got a taste of In Ah's punch for the first time.

2812
01:48:53,715 --> 01:48:55,685
Gosh. The first time,

2813
01:48:55,955 --> 01:48:57,225
when I first got hit...

2814
01:48:57,385 --> 01:48:58,584
(Ringing)

2815
01:48:58,585 --> 01:49:00,495
That's what it felt like.

2816
01:49:00,525 --> 01:49:01,825
(Right at the start of Round 1)

2817
01:49:01,855 --> 01:49:03,535
(they exchanged punches at the same time.)

2818
01:49:03,725 --> 01:49:06,125
(Sae Rok was taken aback by the intensity.)

2819
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:09,435
Even though her ankle isn't in perfect condition,

2820
01:49:09,735 --> 01:49:11,504
I didn't stand a chance.

2821
01:49:11,505 --> 01:49:14,205
And In Ah threw a hook.

2822
01:49:14,535 --> 01:49:16,304
- It would've been bad if it landed.
- Right.

2823
01:49:16,305 --> 01:49:17,575
Thankfully, she missed.

2824
01:49:18,045 --> 01:49:19,474
I still managed to dodge a few.

2825
01:49:19,475 --> 01:49:20,575
- You did.
- Yes.

2826
01:49:22,645 --> 01:49:25,044
(Dodge)

2827
01:49:25,045 --> 01:49:27,455
(Dodge again)

2828
01:49:27,985 --> 01:49:30,685
(Sae Rok's evading skills improved.)

2829
01:49:31,085 --> 01:49:32,354
That was fun.

2830
01:49:32,355 --> 01:49:33,425
You did so great.

2831
01:49:33,755 --> 01:49:36,355
I experienced the downsides of getting injured.

2832
01:49:36,395 --> 01:49:38,115
- My ankle won't listen to me.
- Of course.

2833
01:49:38,265 --> 01:49:39,324
I wanted to pivot,

2834
01:49:39,325 --> 01:49:41,164
but my ankle only moved halfway.

2835
01:49:41,165 --> 01:49:42,895
I thought I turned it.

2836
01:49:43,335 --> 01:49:44,405
It's disappointing.

2837
01:49:44,565 --> 01:49:46,664
I was really surprised, though.

2838
01:49:46,665 --> 01:49:49,305
This is the first time I've seen you spar with each other.

2839
01:49:49,775 --> 01:49:53,075
It's incredible how much growth you've achieved...

2840
01:49:53,405 --> 01:49:54,815
in such a short time.

2841
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:57,144
You'll win the competition for sure if you keep training like this.

2842
01:49:57,145 --> 01:49:58,184
Yes, that's right.

2843
01:49:58,185 --> 01:49:59,661
That was impressive. All four of you.

2844
01:49:59,685 --> 01:50:00,685
- You too.
- That was impressive.

2845
01:50:00,686 --> 01:50:01,755
Let's win this thing.

2846
01:50:02,455 --> 01:50:05,384
That was such a valuable training session.

2847
01:50:05,385 --> 01:50:06,484
- We were so cool.
- It was great.

2848
01:50:06,485 --> 01:50:07,555
Yes, you were cool.

2849
01:50:07,625 --> 01:50:09,624
The competition is now...

2850
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:11,464
only ten days away. Right around the corner.

2851
01:50:11,465 --> 01:50:12,941
- It really is.
- It's right around the corner.

2852
01:50:12,965 --> 01:50:15,464
So I propose that we go and get some good food.

2853
01:50:15,465 --> 01:50:17,034
- Eating is part of training, right?
- Yes, please!

2854
01:50:17,035 --> 01:50:19,264
I haven't heard that in a while. "Eating is part of training."

2855
01:50:19,265 --> 01:50:21,334
- Yes. Eating is part of training.
- Give us some protein.

2856
01:50:21,335 --> 01:50:23,004
- Protein. Yes.
- Protein.

2857
01:50:23,005 --> 01:50:24,304
You know what's loaded with protein?

2858
01:50:24,305 --> 01:50:25,904
- Barbecue!
- Let's go get Korean pork!

2859
01:50:25,905 --> 01:50:27,575
- Gosh.
- Gosh!

2860
01:50:27,675 --> 01:50:29,144
- Yes!
- Let's hurry.

2861
01:50:29,145 --> 01:50:30,721
(They head to their final training session.)

2862
01:50:30,745 --> 01:50:34,385
It feels like a classic, old-school restaurant with good food.

2863
01:50:34,915 --> 01:50:36,885
- I'm excited.
- I'm starving.

2864
01:50:37,355 --> 01:50:39,084
We'll have the boiled pork.

2865
01:50:39,085 --> 01:50:40,194
All right.

2866
01:50:40,195 --> 01:50:42,824
We'll have the boiled pork. We're starving.

2867
01:50:42,825 --> 01:50:44,795
- Gosh.
- Hello.

2868
01:50:45,295 --> 01:50:47,034
(A full-course meal with boiled Korean pork)

2869
01:50:47,035 --> 01:50:48,135
This is amazing.

2870
01:50:48,465 --> 01:50:50,734
- Gosh, this is...
- This looks so pretty.

2871
01:50:50,735 --> 01:50:52,134
- Look at all this.
- Korean pork is the best.

2872
01:50:52,135 --> 01:50:53,504
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

2873
01:50:53,505 --> 01:50:56,035
Nothing beats pork for restoring energy.

2874
01:50:56,135 --> 01:50:58,375
Eating pork is a must after working out.

2875
01:50:58,505 --> 01:51:00,374
This will go so well with the pork.

2876
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:02,444
- Thank you for the food.
- Eat up.

2877
01:51:02,445 --> 01:51:04,044
- Eat up.
- Eat up.

2878
01:51:04,045 --> 01:51:05,184
This looks so good.

2879
01:51:05,185 --> 01:51:06,955
This is insane.

2880
01:51:07,915 --> 01:51:09,254
- I prefer perilla oil.
- I prefer perilla oil too.

2881
01:51:09,255 --> 01:51:10,255
Gosh.

2882
01:51:10,256 --> 01:51:11,485
(Try it.)

2883
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:13,254
It's so tender.

2884
01:51:13,255 --> 01:51:14,354
Really?

2885
01:51:14,355 --> 01:51:15,725
- Yes.
- Boiled pork.

2886
01:51:16,225 --> 01:51:17,495
The umami flavor is...

2887
01:51:17,795 --> 01:51:18,795
- The pork?
- Gosh.

2888
01:51:18,796 --> 01:51:19,825
(Gosh!)

2889
01:51:20,395 --> 01:51:21,494
It's so good that it makes me mad.

2890
01:51:21,495 --> 01:51:23,311
(The pork tastes so good that it makes her mad.)

2891
01:51:23,335 --> 01:51:25,064
The pork is such good quality.

2892
01:51:25,065 --> 01:51:26,565
It's really tender.

2893
01:51:27,605 --> 01:51:28,905
(Gosh!)

2894
01:51:29,275 --> 01:51:30,644
(In awe)

2895
01:51:30,645 --> 01:51:31,975
- It's so good.
- Look at that.

2896
01:51:32,175 --> 01:51:34,474
It's so soft and tender. So good.

2897
01:51:34,475 --> 01:51:37,144
What we're eating is Korean pork,

2898
01:51:37,145 --> 01:51:39,114
so we're getting good protein.

2899
01:51:39,115 --> 01:51:40,414
(Nodding in agreement)

2900
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:41,715
It's so good.

2901
01:51:42,815 --> 01:51:46,625
(Uie puts two pieces in her mouth.)

2902
01:51:47,355 --> 01:51:49,425
(In Ah eats a piece with makguksu.)

2903
01:51:49,895 --> 01:51:51,425
This is great for wrapping the pork.

2904
01:51:54,995 --> 01:51:56,735
Coach, try this. It's really good.

2905
01:51:57,935 --> 01:51:59,134
It's really good, right?

2906
01:51:59,135 --> 01:52:00,475
(Dancing in joy)

2907
01:52:01,435 --> 01:52:02,804
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

2908
01:52:02,805 --> 01:52:04,044
I can't stop eating.

2909
01:52:04,045 --> 01:52:05,951
(Everyone is training their chopsticks skills nonstop.)

2910
01:52:05,975 --> 01:52:07,815
- We ate everything.
- We finished everything.

2911
01:52:07,945 --> 01:52:09,044
- Did you enjoy the food?
- Yes.

2912
01:52:09,045 --> 01:52:10,605
- It was really good.
- It was so good.

2913
01:52:10,685 --> 01:52:14,055
We've prepared gifts for you.

2914
01:52:14,085 --> 01:52:15,754
- What is it?
- It's to wish you luck...

2915
01:52:15,755 --> 01:52:16,785
in the tournament.

2916
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:18,224
Here.

2917
01:52:18,225 --> 01:52:20,325
- Is this real?
- These are for you.

2918
01:52:20,955 --> 01:52:23,625
They're Korean pork to give you strength.

2919
01:52:23,795 --> 01:52:25,694
(Korean pork set for a healthy boost)

2920
01:52:25,695 --> 01:52:26,965
- Amazing.
- This is amazing.

2921
01:52:27,795 --> 01:52:29,665
- These look luxurious.
- Don't be shocked.

2922
01:52:30,365 --> 01:52:31,534
(Wishing them a great fight, these are for strength restoration)

2923
01:52:31,535 --> 01:52:33,335
- Korean pork.
- This is insane.

2924
01:52:34,075 --> 01:52:36,735
- We should have a party.
- It comes with every cut.

2925
01:52:36,905 --> 01:52:38,004
Well...

2926
01:52:38,005 --> 01:52:42,345
When fighters have about ten days before their competitions,

2927
01:52:42,645 --> 01:52:45,214
they have to eat well, and maintain good physical condition.

2928
01:52:45,215 --> 01:52:46,844
- That's the most important thing.
- Yes, sir!

2929
01:52:46,845 --> 01:52:48,114
Maintain good physical condition,

2930
01:52:48,115 --> 01:52:51,084
and promise me to be in your best shape on competition day.

2931
01:52:51,085 --> 01:52:52,124
- Okay.
- Okay.

2932
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:54,194
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2933
01:52:54,195 --> 01:52:55,313
(The eating part of their training is now over too.)

2934
01:52:55,337 --> 01:52:57,007
(The long-awaited final competition)

2935
01:52:57,107 --> 01:52:58,907
(It's finally the big day.)

2936
01:52:59,407 --> 01:53:02,237
(This time, it's a national competition.)

2937
01:53:02,577 --> 01:53:05,307
(The competition is on a much grander scale.)

2938
01:53:06,007 --> 01:53:08,047
(This is the last boxing match I'll ever fight in.)

2939
01:53:08,077 --> 01:53:09,747
(I want to live without regrets.)

2940
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,387
(This one feels different.)

2941
01:53:12,647 --> 01:53:15,657
(I want to be able to look back and say, "It was really intense.")

2942
01:53:15,917 --> 01:53:18,257
(The Iron Girls...)

2943
01:53:18,287 --> 01:53:20,596
(are prepared and ready to...)

2944
01:53:20,597 --> 01:53:23,057
(fight.)

2945
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:25,297
(Fighting against their fear, )

2946
01:53:26,027 --> 01:53:32,707
(it's time for them to trust themselves in the ring.)

2947
01:53:32,807 --> 01:53:33,936
(Now, )

2948
01:53:33,937 --> 01:53:35,337
(let's go to the ring.)

2949
01:53:38,777 --> 01:53:42,217
(They have to give it their all.)

2950
01:53:42,747 --> 01:53:45,087
(You have to attack! Sae Rok, go for it!)

2951
01:53:45,447 --> 01:53:48,286
(After today, )

2952
01:53:48,287 --> 01:53:52,327
(there won't be any more opportunities.)

2953
01:53:52,427 --> 01:53:55,226
(Will the Iron Girls...)

2954
01:53:55,227 --> 01:53:59,067
(be able to become champions?)

2955
01:53:59,394 --> 01:54:01,394
