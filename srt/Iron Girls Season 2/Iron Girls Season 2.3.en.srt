1
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,303
(Boxing is...)

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,434
(all about survival.)

3
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,674
(With the hardcore coach,)

4
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,203
(a hardcore jump rope session follows.)

5
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,643
(Endless training)

6
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:44,514
(Endless wise saying)

7
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:46,644
(The time they have left is 3 months.)

8
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,484
(They have to endure the hardcore training...)

9
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,714
(to become a boxing champion.)

10
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:55,484
(Trials make the Iron Girls more passionate.)

11
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:59,197
(To make their passions hotter,)

12
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,294
(the strongest female fighters in Korea show up.)

13
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,994
(The power of the female fighters...)

14
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,504
(that surprises everyone.)

15
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:12,304
(The hamsters are speechless.)

16
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:14,244
(And the surprise is not over yet!)

17
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:15,973
(They turn their own bodies...)

18
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:18,574
(as well as the Iron Girls' bodies.)

19
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,884
(What training will they go through with the female fighters?)

20
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:23,713
Let's go.

21
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:25,313
(Filling up the wide sandy beach)

22
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:26,854
Let's go out, fight, and win!

23
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:30,654
Let's do this.

24
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:31,993
(The energy of the fighters overflows with fighting spirit.)

25
00:01:31,994 --> 00:01:33,824
They're scary.

26
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:35,863
They're scary.

27
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:37,864
They look scary in those outfits.

28
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:39,593
- Shoulders back. Be confident.
- Shoulders back!

29
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:41,303
- Are we going there?
- Keep them broad.

30
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:42,464
Keep your back straight.

31
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,034
Are you stretching your back?

32
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,073
- Hold your breath.
- Look brave.

33
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:47,243
(In Ah holds a candle to the sun.)

34
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,974
All right. We have the 16 strongest female fighters...

35
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,274
in the country here.

36
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,583
As I told you in the morning,

37
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:57,083
you will be going through a special physical training...

38
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,714
that I prepared with the fighters.

39
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,083
When else could we do that?

40
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:02,483
- When else would we do this?
- When else? This is a good chance.

41
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:04,423
I'm honored that I'm standing next to them.

42
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,923
- We're honored.
- I'm standing right next to them.

43
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,024
Thank you.

44
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:09,093
We have put together...

45
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,264
the most difficult exercises from each category...

46
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,064
that are also designed to train you for boxing.

47
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:15,264
That's the physical training we prepared.

48
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:17,733
So I hope you take on these team missions...

49
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,603
as part of your training.

50
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:21,343
Captain, Ju Hyun is not here.

51
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,073
Right. Ju Hyun is absent.

52
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,644
Actually, Ju Hyun had a minor car accident...

53
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:28,344
- on her way here this morning.
- I see.

54
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,383
- Ju Hyun really wanted to join us, - Right.

55
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,713
- but she needs to get some rest.
- She should.

56
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:34,923
So Ju Hyun is not joining us today.

57
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:38,554
Well... Can I make a suggestion?

58
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:43,223
- If the athletes here...
- Yes.

59
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:44,834
are okay with it,

60
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:47,133
I'd like Captain Kim here...

61
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,964
- to join our team.
- Can he join us?

62
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:52,274
(Former UFC welterweight, once ranked 6th in the world)

63
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,143
- Can he join our team?
- Do you mind if he joins us?

64
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:56,474
(A suggestion that puts the athletes at a disadvantage)

65
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,714
I don't think it will make a big difference.

66
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,084
(The well-founded confidence of national athletes)

67
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:02,614
(Flustered)

68
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:05,013
(Confident)

69
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:06,113
- How...
- This is crazy.

70
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:07,623
Are you not threatened at all?

71
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:08,923
- I mean...
- He's a man.

72
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,324
- They don't seem to care.
- Seriously, are you okay with it?

73
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:13,153
- You're so cool.
- This is crazy.

74
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:16,064
Then I will have to try my best.

75
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,193
All right. How reliable.

76
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,293
(They easily got Captain Kim on their team.)

77
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:21,246
So what is today's training?

78
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:24,333
I only prepared exercises that help improve boxing skills.

79
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,287
Here's the first event.

80
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,744
It is related to the national jiu-jitsu fighters.

81
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:31,974
It is important for us to have a strong upper body.

82
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:35,644
We focus our routines on grip strength and forearm muscles.

83
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:37,484
(Jiu-jitsu is a sport where you grab the opponent's uniform...)

84
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,584
(and subdue the opponent with the strength of forearm muscles.)

85
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,153
We often do the farmer's carry...

86
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:45,523
where we hold kettlebells in both arms and carry them.

87
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:46,894
(They build their forearm muscles with the farmer's carry.)

88
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:49,223
In boxing, forearm muscles are important...

89
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:52,633
to make your punch stronger and avoid any wrist injuries.

90
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,304
So, instead of kettlebells...

91
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:56,703
Let me show you something.

92
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,204
What? What are we carrying?

93
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,744
What is that?

94
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,204
- That's a lot.
- Goodness.

95
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:04,613
How many are they?

96
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,273
It's Carrying Sandbags.

97
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,644
(The first special training, Carrying Sandbags)

98
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:10,514
One sandbag weighs 5kg.

99
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,153
And we have 800 sandbags, which is 4t.

100
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,683
(That's 4t total, with 800 sandbags.)

101
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,123
- This is crazy.
- It's insane.

102
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,124
- That's insane.
- What do we do?

103
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,724
- My arms will be worn out.
- Come on.

104
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:21,433
How many are they?

105
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,794
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

106
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:26,534
My gosh, there are 800 bags.

107
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:30,604
All the players of each team will start at the same time.

108
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,974
Each team's box is located 25m away.

109
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:38,074
The team that moves the most sandbags to their box...

110
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,814
within 5 minutes wins this mission.

111
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:44,583
Because this is forearm muscle training,

112
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,583
you can't carry the sandbags on your arms or shoulders.

113
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,023
- We can only carry it like this?
- And you can't throw them either.

114
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,424
You must carry them only with your hands.

115
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:50,794
- I'm excited.
- Does that mean...

116
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,454
- Okay. That's good.
- Have you done it before?

117
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:54,364
Let's do this. Seriously, let's give it a try.

118
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,024
Hey, we can win at least one event.

119
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,893
You know how we do a long-distance race.

120
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,333
- We should do this like that.
- Okay.

121
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,133
- We should pace ourselves.
- Move steadily.

122
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:04,274
(Team Taekwondo's plan is to carry them quickly, little by little.)

123
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,703
Should we carry a lot in one go,

124
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,643
or carry less and make more trips?

125
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:09,743
I think it's better to carry a lot in one go.

126
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,473
I'll carry a lot and take it slow, too.

127
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,573
I can't run anyway.

128
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:14,213
- Let's just do it and see.
- Shall we?

129
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,314
- Let's just do it.
- Something else...

130
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:17,084
We have to win no matter what.

131
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:18,614
I have no intention of losing.

132
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,354
- We can do well, right?
- Yes.

133
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,854
All we do every day is grab each other's uniforms.

134
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,623
- This is our game.
- Right.

135
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,594
Hang on. Wait.

136
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,324
Listen.

137
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:32,234
Wouldn't it be too disadvantageous for you if I joined them?

138
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:33,763
It's okay.

139
00:05:33,764 --> 00:05:35,203
You can just do it.

140
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:37,333
Captain. I'm sorry to say this, but no one seems to care.

141
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,173
- Just come here.
- Just come.

142
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,073
- Come on. Then...
- We have no time for this.

143
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,774
I will use only one hand.

144
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:44,973
And I'll try my best.

145
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,973
- Okay.
- I'm serious. I'll use one hand.

146
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,244
All right.

147
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,714
- I know the other events.
- Yes.

148
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:52,653
I think this is the only event that you can win in.

149
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:54,283
- Let's do it. We have to win this.
- Let's win.

150
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:55,653
- We will win this one.
- I know the rest of the events.

151
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,353
- All right. Let's do this.
- Seriously.

152
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:58,553
Hey, it's only five minutes.

153
00:05:58,554 --> 00:05:59,993
We just need to hold our breath for five minutes.

154
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,293
Just brace yourself and do it. Okay?

155
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,323
- Let's go.
- Do it until the end.

156
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:04,093
- Let's choke!
- Let's twist!

157
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,663
- Let's win!
- Team Jiu-jitsu!

158
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,893
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

159
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,064
(Team Jiu-jitsu, the strongest in the push-pull sport)

160
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,303
Let's go, Team Wrestling!

161
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,504
(Team Wrestling, the experienced warriors)

162
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,733
- Make the impossible, possible!
- Possible!

163
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,873
- Okay.
- There's no giving up!

164
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,503
- Let's go, Team Taekwondo!
- Let's go, Team Taekwondo!

165
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:19,343
- Iron Girls!
- Iron Girls!

166
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,344
Okay.

167
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:22,944
- Ready.
- Okay.

168
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,484
(Special Forces Martial Arts)

169
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,883
(Will the Iron Girls...)

170
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:30,184
(be able to perform well among the athletes?)

171
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,693
- Ready.
- Okay.

172
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,694
(Ready)

173
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,594
(The competition is fierce from the start.)

174
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,634
It looks heavy.

175
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,244
(The players are rushing toward the sandbags.)

176
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:50,544
Hang on.

177
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,174
(Kim So Hui of Team Taekwondo leaves first.)

178
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:54,984
(One sandbag in each hand)

179
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,813
(Speed is the key.)

180
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:58,853
(Taekwondo)

181
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:01,284
(She takes an overwhelming lead.)

182
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,483
This is training.

183
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:04,953
(Captain Dong Hyun follows her.)

184
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,294
(4 sandbags, 20kg)

185
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,864
(Bulging forearm muscles)

186
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,494
This is training.

187
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,764
This is training.

188
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,173
(While Team Taekwondo moves 1 or 2 in each hand at a time...)

189
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,344
Just carry as much as you can.

190
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:25,174
(Sae Rok)

191
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,314
(She's carrying 2 bags in each hand, which is a total of 20kg.)

192
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,613
(Sae Rok carries them quickly,)

193
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:33,114
(running 25m without stopping.)

194
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:36,684
(Uie is also carrying 20kg.)

195
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,154
(In Ah tries carrying 30kg.)

196
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,624
We have to reach 150kg. Keep going.

197
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,834
(Carrying a total of 30kg using both hands)

198
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,834
(It's me, Strong In Ah.)

199
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,313
(Come on!)

200
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:03,314
(The strength of forearm muscles!)

201
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:08,284
Why did they have to pile this so high?

202
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,793
(Meanwhile, Team Special Forces Martial Arts?)

203
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,654
Sergeant Kim is carrying three bags in each hand.

204
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:15,694
(Beautiful back muscles)

205
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,403
(Special Forces Martial Arts)

206
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,434
Let's go.

207
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:26,203
Look at Operator Jo. She's carrying six bags.

208
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,204
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts starts to stand out.)

209
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:31,844
(Her back muscles stand out, too.)

210
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,113
(Sandbags are no big deal.)

211
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:38,684
(They move them lightly.)

212
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,794
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts moves 30kg at a time.)

213
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:51,194
(Meanwhile, Team Jiu-jitsu is quiet as if they're not breathing.)

214
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:56,134
(Peaceful while carrying 35kg)

215
00:08:56,534 --> 00:09:00,134
(Jiu-jitsu players are strong without making a sound.)

216
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,673
(Since this is a training session they usually do,)

217
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,173
(they are completely unfazed.)

218
00:09:05,174 --> 00:09:07,544
(Grabbing the sandbags the way they grab uniforms)

219
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,153
(The sandbags pile up.)

220
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:15,324
(4 minutes remaining)

221
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:19,124
(What about Team Wrestling?)

222
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,464
(Carrying 40kg easily)

223
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,094
- Let's move four.
- Good.

224
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,234
- Hyeon Yeong, move four.
- Okay.

225
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,703
- Han Bit, move four.
- Okay.

226
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,304
(All members of Team Wrestling move 40kg at a time.)

227
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,033
Good.

228
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,903
(Team Wrestling overpowers the other teams.)

229
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:37,004
This is going well.

230
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,444
Nice.

231
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:45,483
(With 4 people moving once, a total of 160kg is added.)

232
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,384
(3 minutes remaining)

233
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:51,724
(Captain Kim is struggling while using only one hand.)

234
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:53,924
It's not balanced.

235
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:58,394
(He overcomes the imbalance with his strength.)

236
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,334
We're doing well.

237
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,533
Hey, we are...

238
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:04,804
in the top ranks now.

239
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,533
It's going really well.

240
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:07,543
(There is hope.)

241
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:08,773
Good.

242
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,844
Sae Rok is carrying three.

243
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,143
In Ah is carrying three.

244
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,484
(Iron Girls are doing a good job.)

245
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,214
(Groaning)

246
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,824
(If there's a chance, we should move faster.)

247
00:10:21,324 --> 00:10:24,624
(Sae Rok speeds up, breathing heavily.)

248
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:33,064
(Panting)

249
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,933
Good.

250
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,734
(Stimulating the forearm muscles!)

251
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:40,073
(Uie shows up, too.)

252
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,243
(Uie)

253
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,944
(As the Stamina Queen, she starts to speed up.)

254
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:46,473
(She moves quickly.)

255
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,784
Good. We're doing well.

256
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,784
(She quickly sets off again.)

257
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,054
(Uie)

258
00:10:58,055 --> 00:10:59,994
(Squeezing out all the strength of her forearm muscles.)

259
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,764
(She keeps moving forward without panicking.)

260
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:09,604
(She quickly adds five more bags.)

261
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:11,403
Let's do this.

262
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,473
(The Iron Girls' box fills up quickly.)

263
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,544
(2 minutes remaining)

264
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,514
(The sandbags of 4t)

265
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,343
Gosh, you're doing amazing.

266
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,483
(Everyone moves them over and over again...)

267
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,883
(without stopping,)

268
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:29,124
(but there are still a lot left.)

269
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,293
(They have to move faster...)

270
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,794
(to move more bags.)

271
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:40,193
(The players are moving more busily.)

272
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:42,034
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

273
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,734
We can do this.

274
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:45,274
Let's do this.

275
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,373
You have one minute left.

276
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,474
(1 minute remaining)

277
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,644
(They have only 1 minute left.)

278
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:51,814
Let's go.

279
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:55,284
(Enduring the sharp pain in their forearms,)

280
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,314
(they run at full speed.)

281
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,883
- It's the last 30 seconds.
- Let's go!

282
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:02,024
(They have 30 seconds left.)

283
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,523
- Twenty.
- I'm sorry.

284
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:11,593
Nineteen.

285
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:12,664
Eighteen.

286
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:13,694
Seventeen.

287
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:14,964
Sixteen.

288
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,533
(Sae Rok picks up a sandbag that's on the ground...)

289
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,573
(and tries to go back,)

290
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:20,633
(but she soon retreats since she's running out of time.)

291
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,804
(10 seconds remaining)

292
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,843
(To put the sandbags they are carrying into the box,)

293
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,344
(they run at full speed.)

294
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:27,784
Three.

295
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,013
(The game is over.)

296
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:34,184
Nice.

297
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:35,923
And these.

298
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:37,324
(The last ones count.)

299
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:40,324
(This is killing me.)

300
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,693
It's not bad.

301
00:12:42,694 --> 00:12:43,864
Well done.

302
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:45,533
- Good job.
- Good.

303
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:46,934
(They encourage their teammates, who worked hard together.)

304
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,434
Five minutes is shorter than I thought.

305
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,173
Which part does it hurt the most?

306
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,003
Here. From here to here.

307
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,604
- Forearm muscles, right?
- Yes.

308
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:56,174
My arms are perfectly fine.

309
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,173
- I know.
- I'm not tired at all.

310
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,313
- I should've carried more.
- Right.

311
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,483
(This is no big deal for Team Jiu-jitsu.)

312
00:13:01,484 --> 00:13:03,744
When you knock your opponent out at the last minute,

313
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:06,013
you have to squeeze out the strength of your fist.

314
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:07,213
So your forearm muscles are important.

315
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,683
This was a great workout for it.

316
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:10,153
- It was really hard.
- Right.

317
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,454
And it helps build up your stamina.

318
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:13,893
First,

319
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,463
we will count the sandbags...

320
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,093
that each team moved.

321
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,094
- Okay.
- Okay.

322
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:21,534
We will count ten at a time.

323
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:22,764
Ten sandbags.

324
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,803
- Ten.
- Ten.

325
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,034
Twenty.

326
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,003
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

327
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:29,703
- Fifty.
- Fifty.

328
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,114
- A hundred.
- A hundred.

329
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,474
We're still good.

330
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,074
Are you done taking out a hundred bags?

331
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,284
- There's not much difference.
- I think we have fewer...

332
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:36,583
I think we have fewer than they do.

333
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:37,913
- Really?
- Show me.

334
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,054
(Team Taekwondo feels nervous.)

335
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:41,983
(The two teams look similar.)

336
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,065
Really? Do you have that many?

337
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,853
All right. It's 110.

338
00:13:44,854 --> 00:13:46,123
- It's 110.
- It's 110.

339
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:47,693
- It's 120.
- It's 120.

340
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,430
- It's 130.
- It's 130.

341
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:51,333
(A close match)

342
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,393
A close match for last place.

343
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,994
- I don't think we can win.
- We can't?

344
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,563
A close match for last place.

345
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:56,934
- All right.
- What?

346
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,610
We will take one out at a time now.

347
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,144
We're almost there.

348
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:02,373
It's 131.

349
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,674
It's 131.

350
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:05,313
It's 132.

351
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:06,974
- It's 132.
- It's 132.

352
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,483
It's 133.

353
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:09,814
(Which team carried the fewest sandbags?)

354
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:14,854
Do you have more?

355
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,124
- Three!
- We have?

356
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,123
(Iron Girls, who did unexpectedly well?)

357
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,894
(Team Taekwondo of speed?)

358
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,323
It's 134.

359
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,024
It's 134.

360
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,693
(What about Iron Girls?)

361
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:28,204
(There's nothing.)

362
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:31,003
(Team Taekwondo avoided coming last.)

363
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,034
That was the last one.

364
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,403
The difference is one.

365
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:34,673
(The difference is 1.)

366
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,103
- We win!
- Oh, no.

367
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,374
- This is the best.
- We're not the bottom.

368
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,743
I should've carried five at the last minute.

369
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:40,874
(Iron Girls carried 133 sandbags.)

370
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:42,913
At the last minute...

371
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,284
(They're sad, but they accept the result.)

372
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:46,254
I can't believe the difference is only one.

373
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,753
It was only one.

374
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,054
- It was so close.
- Iron Girls took fifth place.

375
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,593
And Team Taekwondo...

376
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:53,953
- took fourth place.
- It's okay. It's good enough.

377
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:55,163
- We did well.
- All right.

378
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,608
Let's continue counting.

379
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,703
- All right.
- We lost, but we did well.

380
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:02,804
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts with strong back muscles)

381
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:08,344
(Team Wrestling with their strength as their strategy)

382
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:13,514
(Team Jiu-jitsu, who are used to this training session)

383
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:17,954
(Who is the winner of the first training session?)

384
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:20,554
All right. Let's count five bags.

385
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:21,872
Starting at 140.

386
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:23,683
- At 140.
- At 1.

387
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:24,993
- Two.
- Two.

388
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:28,464
(The sandbags keep coming.)

389
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:30,193
- That's insane.
- That's amazing.

390
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,694
- They're insanely good.
- That's really amazing.

391
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,748
All right. Let's count five bags.

392
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,877
- Starting at 140.
- At 140.

393
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:37,887
- One.
- One.

394
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,417
- Two.
- Two.

395
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,947
- Three.
- Four.

396
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,458
- Five.
- Five.

397
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,287
- That's insane.
- That's amazing.

398
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,628
- They're insane.
- That's really amazing.

399
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:48,098
- It's 145.
- It's 145.

400
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:49,827
All right.

401
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,127
(Monitoring their progress again)

402
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:53,498
We'll now count them 1 by 1.

403
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:54,668
It's 146.

404
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:55,868
- It's 146.
- It's 146.

405
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:56,967
It's 147.

406
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,338
- It's 147.
- It's 147.

407
00:15:58,408 --> 00:16:00,408
- It's 148.
- It's 148.

408
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:01,837
It's 149.

409
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:03,338
- It's 149.
- It's 149.

410
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,508
Do you have more?

411
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,108
You do.

412
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,447
- It's 150.
- It's 150.

413
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,478
(Their 150th sandbag)

414
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,618
(What about Team Special Forces Martial Arts?)

415
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:14,558
(They're out of sandbags.)

416
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:15,757
- Are you done?
- Yes, we're done.

417
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:16,788
They're out of sandbags.

418
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:18,987
- Did you take one out?
- We did.

419
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,258
They won by a single sandbag.

420
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,328
- We won!
- They won by one sandbag.

421
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,698
- We won.
- Gosh.

422
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,698
Yes, they did well.

423
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:28,297
- Gosh. They won by one.
- Really?

424
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:30,467
- That's cool.
- How did they win by one?

425
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,107
And the Team Wrestling...

426
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,678
is the clear front-runner.

427
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,707
(They still have a lot left.)

428
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,548
Let's count by ten.

429
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,077
(Counting by ten)

430
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:42,248
- What? Ten?
- It's...

431
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,447
It's 160.

432
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,247
- It's 160.
- It's 160. Gosh.

433
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:46,517
It's 170.

434
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:48,058
It's 170.

435
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,358
It's not even a fair fight.

436
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,757
- Now, 1 by 1. It's 171.
- It's 171.

437
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,187
- It's 172.
- It's 172.

438
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:55,857
- It's 173.
- It's 173.

439
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,497
- It's 174.
- It's 174.

440
00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:58,927
- It's 175.
- It's 175.

441
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:00,027
- What did you say?
- It's 176.

442
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,868
- It's 176.
- It's 177.

443
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,198
- It's 178.
- That was 178.

444
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:05,438
Team Wrestling is the winner!

445
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,208
That's amazing.

446
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:10,077
(Carrying Sandbags)

447
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,548
- That was fun.
- What a relief.

448
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:12,977
(The Iron Girls are in 5th place.)

449
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:14,177
(Team Taekwondo is in 4th place.)

450
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:15,547
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts is in 3rd place.)

451
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,047
(Team Jiu-jitsu is in 2nd place.)

452
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,418
(Team Wrestling is in 1st place.)

453
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:21,318
The first round is over.

454
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,688
- We lost by one bag.
- I'm so disappointed.

455
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,157
I think that it came down to a difference in our mindsets,

456
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,488
- so I'm very disappointed.
- Right.

457
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,927
But I do have hope that we could actually...

458
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:30,997
- win.
- It's possible.

459
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:33,697
Also, they're on the national Taekwondo team,

460
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,868
but they were so happy to beat us by just one bag.

461
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,008
(Busted)

462
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,778
Yes!

463
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:43,638
- Right, I was...
- Right.

464
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:44,907
Were you really that happy?

465
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:46,608
- A win is a win.
- Yes.

466
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,417
- Fair enough.
- They celebrated as if...

467
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:50,578
- they'd won the gold medal.
- Agreed.

468
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:53,318
This session is...

469
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,957
related to the Team Special Forces Martial Arts.

470
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,527
- What?
- What kind of training...

471
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,658
does the Team Special Forces Martial Arts usually do?

472
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:03,928
Special Forces Martial Arts mainly focus on lethal techniques.

473
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:05,397
- What?
- What?

474
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,067
(Just hearing that...)

475
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:08,838
- What?
- Do they really kill people?

476
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:12,068
Subduing quickly with force is the top priority.

477
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:15,578
(Since it is designed for real combat situations,)

478
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,847
(strong and swift responses are essential.)

479
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:21,617
That's why reflex and agility are key.

480
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,218
(That's why reflex and agility are key.)

481
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,788
Reflex is...

482
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,118
really important in boxing, too.

483
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,717
You sound like you're explaining boxing to us.

484
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,657
- Right.
- Reflex and agility...

485
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:33,888
are all instant reaction times.

486
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:35,657
That's why this training is...

487
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:36,858
(That's what this next training is about!)

488
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,498
I'm looking forward to this.

489
00:18:39,128 --> 00:18:40,898
(It's not something scary, right?)

490
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:42,598
Agility Sprints.

491
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:46,768
- Everyone will...
- I'm so bad at those.

492
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,538
lie face down with their backs to the starting line.

493
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,878
At the sound of the whistle, you run.

494
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,178
And whoever grabs the flag first wins.

495
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,388
The match will go on until only one person is left.

496
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:00,847
Stay sharp and focused.

497
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,318
This session is for testing your agility.

498
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:04,187
My heart is pounding. I suddenly feel nervous.

499
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,057
- I'm nervous, too.
- I'm nervous.

500
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,528
(Nerve-wracking)

501
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:14,168
(Sae Rok, In Ah, Uie)

502
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,738
Lie face down on the ground.

503
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,507
(The athletes are nervous as well.)

504
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,648
I came in last in the "Idol Star Athletics Championships."

505
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,148
This is going to be bad.

506
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,288
Are you nervous?

507
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:34,788
I'm nervous, too.

508
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,188
(Determined)

509
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:40,188
Ready.

510
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:46,398
(At the sound of the whistle,)

511
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,768
(they kick up clouds of dust...)

512
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:56,908
(and run with explosive speed.)

513
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:07,188
(They charge toward the flags.)

514
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:11,017
(As the athletes surge forward,)

515
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,328
(In Ah refuses to fall behind.)

516
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,427
(And then...)

517
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:17,457
(there are the Herbivore Sisters, who are trailing behind the others.)

518
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,128
(Sae Rok, Uie)

519
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,968
(They race toward the flags,)

520
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:28,138
(but there are only 18 flags for 19 people.)

521
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,407
(Right in front of Sae Rok,)

522
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:33,878
(the athletes grab the flags.)

523
00:20:36,378 --> 00:20:38,618
(A flag!)

524
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,717
(She came in last,)

525
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:45,557
(but she was still able to take a remaining flag.)

526
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:46,728
Hey, In Ah.

527
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,957
(Uie, the Stamina Queen of Iron Girls,)

528
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,367
(took advantage of two athletes fighting for the flag between them.)

529
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:55,937
(Uie)

530
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,138
(She was able to secure an unnoticed flag.)

531
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,877
(What about In Ah?)

532
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:03,937
(In Ah)

533
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,278
(She was just a split second too late.)

534
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,718
(She lost the flag following a tussle.)

535
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:13,018
(She eventually grabbed the last remaining flag.)

536
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,718
(In Ah captured it with sheer persistence.)

537
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,310
What?

538
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,058
We all got one.

539
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,158
(The entire Iron Girls team survived.)

540
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:25,798
I was so lucky.

541
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:27,698
We can win this thing!

542
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,998
Sung Ki Ra...

543
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:33,108
has been eliminated in Round One.

544
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:36,478
Whoever gets eliminated should come stand next to me.

545
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,648
Ki Ra? I can't believe this.

546
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,447
The people who were on both sides of you grabbed the flags first.

547
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,478
- Right?
- Yes.

548
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:45,788
We'll now begin the second round. Lie down, please.

549
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,718
Please get there quickly and grab your flags,

550
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:50,888
but leave one for me.

551
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,287
I won't come in last. Not this time.

552
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:55,558
(She came in last earlier.)

553
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:56,958
I'm actually honored...

554
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,798
to be doing this with professional athletes.

555
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:01,498
That's why I want to win.

556
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:04,598
Ready.

557
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:07,968
(Who will become the second one to be eliminated?)

558
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:15,417
(She has world-class reflexes.)

559
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,718
(In Ah)

560
00:22:17,948 --> 00:22:20,948
(Her stamina is on par with the athletes.)

561
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,817
Run! Run until the end.

562
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:26,888
(Flag secured)

563
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:29,558
(In Ah secured a flag.)

564
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,428
(Meanwhile, Uie and Sae Rok)

565
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:36,437
(Trying to keep up with the athletes who are charging like wild horses)

566
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,667
(Sae Rok, Uie)

567
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:39,108
(But in reality, still in last place)

568
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:43,807
(Sae Rok is too slow to grab a flag.)

569
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:44,878
(Sae Rok)

570
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:50,518
Yes!

571
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:53,587
(She thought she'd get eliminated,)

572
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,488
(but she ended up taking a flag again.)

573
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:01,628
(I'm Lucky Rocky!)

574
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,928
(Meanwhile, Uie...)

575
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:06,798
(was blocked by formidable athletes.)

576
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:10,198
(There are no flags left.)

577
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:12,768
(One flag remains)

578
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:15,578
(Who seized the last flag?)

579
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,737
(Team Taekwondo's Kim Yu Min reaches out first.)

580
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:19,048
(Misses)

581
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,778
(Uie snatches the flag without missing a beat.)

582
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:23,578
Gosh.

583
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:27,418
Kim Uie! Keum Sae Rok!

584
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,287
(Team Taekwondo's Kim Yu Min)

585
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:31,288
(Eliminated)

586
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,558
(At this point, they're the Lucky Girls.)

587
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:37,028
Stay focused. Calm down. You have to put it back.

588
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:39,098
- Gosh.
- I can do this.

589
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,637
- I'm going to keep going.
- I don't have any energy left.

590
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,437
- Let's do this. We can do it.
- All right.

591
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,538
Get into position.

592
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:47,767
- I can do this.
- Let's do this.

593
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:50,037
Players are getting eliminated 1 by 1.

594
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:51,108
You have to stay focused. Go!

595
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,977
(While the players are off guard,)

596
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,678
(the whistle is blown unexpectedly.)

597
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,588
(Uie fell victim to the sneak start.)

598
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,718
(Will the Herbivores be able to survive this time?)

599
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,717
(In Ah)

600
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:04,787
(Glancing)

601
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:06,628
(Keeping an eye on her competition,)

602
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,698
(In Ah accelerates.)

603
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,068
(She easily grabs a flag.)

604
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:14,297
(Lucky Rocky is always the last one to arrive.)

605
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:15,567
(Sae Rok)

606
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:17,198
(Switching to the inside lane)

607
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,668
(She got herself a flag with her rapid assessment.)

608
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,677
(What about Uie?)

609
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:25,678
(Uie)

610
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,748
(Empty)

611
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:31,247
(Uie is eliminated.)

612
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,388
I can't.

613
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:36,017
(Lucky Rocky did it again.)

614
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,658
Sae Rok is excited.

615
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:41,027
(I'm the world's best...)

616
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,598
(boxer, Lucky Rocky.)

617
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:45,098
Sae Rok!

618
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:47,297
- Keep going!
- Okay!

619
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,237
I'll get mad if you end up here right away.

620
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,268
Okay!

621
00:24:50,538 --> 00:24:53,507
Sae Rok, I thought you'd be here not long after we began.

622
00:24:53,508 --> 00:24:55,008
But you're hanging in there pretty well.

623
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:56,438
I was lucky.

624
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,648
- Sae Rok is doing great.
- Let's see how you do this time.

625
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,177
From now on, I could give the signal at any time.

626
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:05,387
- Okay.
- At any time.

627
00:25:05,388 --> 00:25:07,147
Ready? Yes.

628
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:08,417
Go now!

629
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:09,557
(A surprise start)

630
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,857
Sae Rok, no!

631
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:11,987
Go now!

632
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,027
(Sae Rok was off to a very late start...)

633
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:16,398
(and is now far behind.)

634
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:17,557
Sae Rok!

635
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,828
(Is this the end of Sae Rok's lucky streak?)

636
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:21,737
(In Ah took off with a reaction time...)

637
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:24,198
(rivaling that of a professional athlete.)

638
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:27,707
(The battle for the best spot is intense.)

639
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:32,078
(After shifting course, she is able to capture a flag.)

640
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,207
No!

641
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,878
(The two athletes head toward the same flag.)

642
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:39,018
(Wrestling Team's Hyeon Yeong loses the fight for the flag.)

643
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,788
(There is one flag left.)

644
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,658
What?

645
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,887
(The flag collector showed up from nowhere.)

646
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,727
(It's Sae Rok.)

647
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:49,797
What?

648
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,398
- Hey. What?
- Sae Rok.

649
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:53,027
(I'm Lucky Rocky once again.)

650
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:54,628
What was that?

651
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:56,597
(Wrestling Team's Hyeon Yeong is eliminated.)

652
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,468
Sae Rok was lucky once again.

653
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:00,908
Sae Rok.

654
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:05,147
Sae Rok.

655
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,747
- You were last.
- Yes.

656
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:07,947
How did you climb up?

657
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,017
- For me, - Yes?

658
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:10,247
I was lucky.

659
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:11,377
- Is that so?
- Yes.

660
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,848
You just need to secure the last remaining flag.

661
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:16,417
You are way behind,

662
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:18,217
- compared to the others.
- That's alright.

663
00:26:18,218 --> 00:26:19,857
The flag will wait for me.

664
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,828
That's good. I'll look forward to it.

665
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:23,257
Ready.

666
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:24,258
(Round 5, Ready)

667
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:26,698
Run!

668
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,497
Run!

669
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:31,338
(She is way slower, but she gets to the middle.)

670
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:34,107
(Meanwhile, In Ah...)

671
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:36,808
(secures a flag with her speed.)

672
00:26:37,108 --> 00:26:38,907
(Sae Rok was watching from behind.)

673
00:26:38,908 --> 00:26:40,307
Run, Sae Rok!

674
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,717
(She sees a flag.)

675
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,278
(She quickly switches her route.)

676
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,248
She got one again.

677
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:51,518
(It's fascinating to watch every time.)

678
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,998
(She is fully loyal towards the flag.)

679
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,467
(Team Jiu-jitsu's Choi Hee Ju is eliminated.)

680
00:26:58,468 --> 00:26:59,897
- Sae Rok.
- Yes, sir.

681
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:00,967
You made it again.

682
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:03,067
- Didn't I tell you, sir?
- Yes.

683
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:04,798
The flag waits for me.

684
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:06,808
But the flag really did wait for her.

685
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,438
It was standing tall.

686
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:09,807
The reason she can do this is...

687
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:11,307
because she is way behind,

688
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,678
compared to the others.

689
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:16,047
While the others all run ahead,

690
00:27:16,048 --> 00:27:18,417
she quickly shifts her route after seeing the flag,

691
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:20,318
and gets it.

692
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:23,787
Rocky, running isn't important.

693
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:24,788
Yes.

694
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:26,957
Wait, her shoes...

695
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:28,227
She has a special item.

696
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,498
- What is it?
- Come on.

697
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,098
I just saw it.

698
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:32,297
- What?
- The color is different.

699
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:33,727
- Wait a minute.
- No.

700
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,468
- Isn't this a special item?
- What is that?

701
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,238
- It's flapping around.
- What?

702
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:38,867
The sole came off...

703
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,107
- because it's old.
- Oh, is it...

704
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,037
- I'm sorry.
- What?

705
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,207
- No, it's okay.
- Sorry.

706
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,237
In Ah.

707
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:45,708
(Laughing)

708
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,907
You should gift her shoes next time.

709
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,248
I will buy it for you.

710
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,147
(She felt bad and bought shoes for her.)

711
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:53,717
(Round 6)

712
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:54,948
- Let's go!
- Run!

713
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:56,418
Run!

714
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:00,057
(As soon as the race starts,)

715
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:01,858
(she falls.)

716
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:04,257
(Team Taekwondo's Kim So Hui)

717
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:05,298
- What?
- Run!

718
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,198
Run!

719
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:10,097
Run!

720
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:13,568
(She does a ceremony for surviving.)

721
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:14,737
(The flag is waiting for Sae Rok.)

722
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:16,438
What was that?

723
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:19,048
Come on. What was that?

724
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,778
- Wait a minute.
- Amazing.

725
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,247
- You really are lucky.
- Lucky.

726
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:23,717
(They all agree that she is a lucky girl.)

727
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:24,747
You really are lucky.

728
00:28:24,748 --> 00:28:26,188
Hey, Rocky Keum.

729
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:27,387
Guys.

730
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:28,687
Let's try for first place.

731
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:30,118
- Sae Rok.
- Yes, sir?

732
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:31,317
This time,

733
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,657
did you already know...

734
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:34,427
before you arrived? You were waving your arms.

735
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:35,428
Of course.

736
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:37,698
- Didn't I tell you, sir?
- Yes.

737
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,798
The flag waits for me.

738
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:41,627
You should all be on your toes.

739
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:42,837
What?

740
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:44,037
Your energy is intimidating.

741
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,038
Yes, sir.

742
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,068
(She continues to stay determined.)

743
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,008
Goodness. How is this possible?

744
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,407
This is Round Seven.

745
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,008
(Round 7)

746
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,208
Sae Rok!

747
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,747
This one is going to be hard for her.

748
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:56,148
(Will the flag wait for Sae Rok again this time?)

749
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,347
Sae Rok, run!

750
00:28:58,348 --> 00:28:59,388
(The flag is waiting for Sae Rok again.)

751
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:03,617
(She got the flag again.)

752
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,017
What? No!

753
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,288
No!

754
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,527
What? No!

755
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:09,827
No!

756
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,197
(In Ah)

757
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:12,328
No!

758
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,397
(Just now)

759
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,637
Run!

760
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,197
(In Ah)

761
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:22,407
(She dashes towards the flag,)

762
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:24,908
(but it gets snatched.)

763
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,447
What? No!

764
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:28,877
No!

765
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,048
(She saw that In Ah was out.)

766
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:31,318
No!

767
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:34,547
(In Ah is eliminated.)

768
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:35,758
That was good.

769
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,058
No.

770
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:38,588
In Ah.

771
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:39,828
You're doing great.

772
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:42,628
Sae Rok, you can do it.

773
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,257
Your strategy is great right now.

774
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:46,368
Among our members,

775
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:50,168
I never imagined Sae Rok would be the last player.

776
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,637
It's always unexpected...

777
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,808
when it comes to sports.

778
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,338
That's good.

779
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,208
- That was cool.
- Now...

780
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:00,378
How far up are you going to go?

781
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,918
I'll try to go until the end.

782
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:04,018
- That's amazing.
- Of course, you should.

783
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:06,818
Now, it's Round Eight.

784
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,018
We are up to the last 12 players.

785
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:10,317
Yes.

786
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:11,518
(Actually, Lucky Rocky...)

787
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:12,827
(Sae Rok, Round 1)

788
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:15,527
(Sae Rok, Rounds 2, 3, 4)

789
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:17,898
(Sae Rok, Rounds 5, 6, 7)

790
00:30:18,198 --> 00:30:21,528
(She kept surviving, coming in last every round.)

791
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:23,267
I'm starting to get curious to see how far she will go.

792
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,338
(Will the underdog’s uprising continue?)

793
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:27,008
She's like a child I left by the riverside.

794
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:28,367
I can't stop worrying about her.

795
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,678
Goodness, my baby.

796
00:30:29,878 --> 00:30:31,637
- Let's go, Sae Rok!
- Let's go, Sae Rok!

797
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:32,978
Let's go!

798
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:35,647
(Round 8)

799
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:38,717
Run, Sae Rok!

800
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:39,847
(12 survivors)

801
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:43,088
(And only 11 flags left)

802
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,118
(Their fate is in the hands of Sae Rok.)

803
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,988
(Will she be able to write history again?)

804
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:57,737
(Among the fierce carnivores...)

805
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,668
(is Herbivore Sae Rok.)

806
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,837
(You can feel their deadliness.)

807
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:04,307
(Sae Rok)

808
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:06,948
(What is the fate of the herbivore?)

809
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:09,677
Sae Rok, run!

810
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:10,948
Run!

811
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,547
The remaining one.

812
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:14,748
(Will she be able to secure a flag?)

813
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:15,988
The remaining one.

814
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,618
(Empty)

815
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,628
There aren't any more.

816
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,227
(Keum Sae Rok is eliminated.)

817
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,228
There aren't any more.

818
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:24,958
You did well.

819
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:26,697
You did your best, Sae Rok.

820
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:28,597
- It's such a shame, In Ah.
- Of course.

821
00:31:28,598 --> 00:31:30,138
- You did so well.
- You did so well.

822
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,908
- Sae Rok.
- Yes?

823
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,107
Unfortunately, your luck...

824
00:31:35,108 --> 00:31:37,378
- It ran out.
- It must be that.

825
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,077
- I have no regrets.
- I bet.

826
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,648
I was too lucky.

827
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,247
With Team Special Forces Martial Arts,

828
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:44,778
all members survived, right?

829
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,287
You're right.

830
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:47,617
(They showed their strength in the special martial arts training.)

831
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:49,187
- They are on another level.
- They are on another level.

832
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,618
- How cool.
- Yes.

833
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:52,327
There are ten flags,

834
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,488
and 11 survivors.

835
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:55,698
Let's go on.

836
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:56,897
Ready.

837
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,657
(Round 9)

838
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,528
- Let's go!
- Run!

839
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,568
- Let's go!
- Run!

840
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,537
(They have rough movements like wild horses...)

841
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:14,008
(that run through the Serengeti grasslands.)

842
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:19,388
(This is the model stance for Agility Sprints.)

843
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:21,947
Let's go!

844
00:32:21,948 --> 00:32:23,017
(Explosive speed)

845
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:24,417
Ga Hyun.

846
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:25,428
(They can't help but admire.)

847
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:27,558
(The battle to seize the flag)

848
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:32,398
(Who will be eliminated from this round?)

849
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:33,727
(Taekwondo)

850
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:35,367
(Team Taekwondo's Kim Ga Hyun...)

851
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:36,898
(changes her route after falling behind.)

852
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,298
(Taekwondo)

853
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:40,168
No!

854
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,208
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts gets it.)

855
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:42,338
Ga Hyun.

856
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:43,477
What?

857
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,007
(Team Taekwondo's Kim Ga Hyun is eliminated.)

858
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,148
Yu Lim.

859
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:47,577
Let's go!

860
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,117
(Round 10)

861
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:51,417
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts)

862
00:32:51,418 --> 00:32:53,648
Goodness. That's hard.

863
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,417
(Round 11)

864
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:57,558
Sorry.

865
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:59,027
I grabbed it together with my teammate.

866
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,088
(Sung Won of Team Special Forces Martial Arts is out in Round 11.)

867
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:02,428
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts keeps getting eliminated.)

868
00:33:02,528 --> 00:33:04,358
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts' Yang Hae Ju is out in Round 12.)

869
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:07,128
(The single remaining member of Team Special Forces Martial Arts)

870
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:08,767
- They still got it.
- What?

871
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:09,837
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts' Kim Ji Eun is out in Round 13.)

872
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,208
(Jiu-jitsu)

873
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:13,967
(Team Jiu-jitsu's Kang Na Hyun is eliminated in Round 14.)

874
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:15,477
A player from Team Jiu-jitsu is eliminated.

875
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:16,537
(Jiu-jitsu)

876
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:19,347
(And even the last remaining member of Team Jiu-jitsu.)

877
00:33:19,348 --> 00:33:22,148
(Team Jiu-jitsu's Lee Yu Jin is eliminated in Round 15.)

878
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:23,748
She fell behind.

879
00:33:25,078 --> 00:33:27,548
Now, we have the final four.

880
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,157
Three members from Team Wrestling...

881
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:32,758
and one member from Team Taekwondo survived.

882
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:33,887
How are you feeling?

883
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,388
- I'm very scared.
- Right.

884
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:37,258
You're scared?

885
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:39,897
I think I'll be eaten up.

886
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,028
(I think I'll be eaten up.)

887
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:42,237
(We won't harm you.)

888
00:33:42,238 --> 00:33:43,837
Then, for the positions,

889
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:46,438
which side do you prefer to stand on?

890
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,107
- I will stay here.
- At the end?

891
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,177
- Yes.
- Are you okay with that?

892
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,878
- We'll do it.
- Okay. Great.

893
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:52,348
- There are three flags.
- It doesn't matter.

894
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:53,448
- We have nothing to worry about.
- Let's go!

895
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,047
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

896
00:33:55,048 --> 00:33:57,078
- Great.
- Show us.

897
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:58,617
Let's go, Hyo Rim!

898
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:00,018
(Team Taekwondo cheers for Hyo Rim.)

899
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,717
(There are 3 flags remaining.)

900
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:04,787
She said that she might be eaten up.

901
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:07,427
Let's see if she is eaten up, or if she will eat them up.

902
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:09,498
(Which team will have the champion for Agility Sprints?)

903
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:10,557
I'm nervous for them.

904
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:11,698
(I'm nervous for them!)

905
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:12,867
- Go!
- No.

906
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,067
(They all get up and start at the same time.)

907
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,698
- Hyo Rim.
- Go!

908
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:24,738
(There are 4 people and only 3 flags left.)

909
00:34:25,238 --> 00:34:27,878
(They sprint with explosive speed.)

910
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:32,947
(A battle that tests the pride of athletes)

911
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,888
Hyo Rim, please.

912
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,488
(Which team will be the final winner?)

913
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,987
(The two runners only look at the flag.)

914
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:43,698
(Team Wrestling secures 2 flags.)

915
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:47,228
(Who will take the last remaining flag?)

916
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:48,997
Hyo Rim, please.

917
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:50,167
Hyo Rim.

918
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,537
(After the heated tussle,)

919
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:56,037
(Team Wrestling secures the flag.)

920
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,278
- Yes.
- Nice.

921
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:01,178
(Team Wrestling has the dominant power.)

922
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:03,947
- Yes.
- Nice.

923
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,947
(Team Wrestling's victory ceremony)

924
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:09,058
Team Wrestling is too strong.

925
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:11,517
You did well, Hyo Rim.

926
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:13,027
You're great, Hyo Rim.

927
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,787
- You're the best, Hyo Rim!
- You were cool.

928
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:16,597
- You're crazy.
- That's cool.

929
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,198
You were so cool.

930
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,098
Gosh, they're so fast.

931
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:22,937
Team Wrestling wins.

932
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,467
(Team Wrestling wins again.)

933
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:26,107
- They're so cool.
- They're...

934
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:27,137
Two wins in a row.

935
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:30,378
(Agility Sprints 1st place, Team Wrestling)

936
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:32,278
The third training is...

937
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:33,878
prepared by Team Taekwondo.

938
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,877
Gosh, what could it be?

939
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:37,078
Is it about agility again?

940
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:39,348
Team Taekwondo, how do you normally train?

941
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,248
We train the lower body.

942
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:44,318
Because we need to make a strong kick,

943
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:45,827
we need to train our glutes, thighs,

944
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:47,887
and calves.

945
00:35:47,888 --> 00:35:50,028
We focus on training our lower body mainly.

946
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:52,497
Taekwondo's training is...

947
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,667
highly related to boxing.

948
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,937
Everything is boxing-related.

949
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:59,607
Coach Kim Ji Hoon said your calves are important...

950
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:02,037
- when boxing.
- That's right.

951
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,938
Taekwondo's steps are similar to those of boxing.

952
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:07,777
Your punch comes from your lower body,

953
00:36:07,778 --> 00:36:10,117
and you need to take steps carefully to punch without getting hit.

954
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,588
So our next training is...

955
00:36:12,888 --> 00:36:15,048
Relay Duck Walk.

956
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,518
Wait. On the sand?

957
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:20,687
"Relay Duck Walk?"

958
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:21,858
(The athletes are worried about intensive training.)

959
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:24,057
- Not this long, right?
- I doubt it.

960
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,497
The rule of Relay Duck Walk is...

961
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:29,898
that each member takes turns duck walking while holding their ears,

962
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,308
going to the cone 25m away and back, in relay.

963
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:37,478
The team that arrives first wins.

964
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,348
If you drop your knees on the floor because it's so tough,

965
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,007
that's allowed.

966
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,748
But you can't crawl on your knees.

967
00:36:44,678 --> 00:36:46,817
I'll go as fast as I can when I set off first.

968
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:47,818
(The players go over their strategy before the game begins.)

969
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:49,587
There are no tricks. Just do your best.

970
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,588
Right.

971
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:51,687
Just go there and come back...

972
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:52,828
- at a steady pace.
- We have to come back.

973
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,087
Nice pose.

974
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,498
No.

975
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,098
Why are we all the same?

976
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:00,967
(The Iron Girls are watching.)

977
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,098
- Girls.
- Yes?

978
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:05,037
We can do it. We might not place last.

979
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:06,437
- Right.
- Because I noticed...

980
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:07,907
they're all struggling.

981
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:09,877
- Let's do our best.
- Right.

982
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:11,007
(Burning with enthusiasm)

983
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,578
- I know.
- Just do your best.

984
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:16,518
We'll now begin our third event.

985
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,548
I can't wait to see if Team Wrestling will win again.

986
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:22,518
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

987
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:23,888
Good luck.

988
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:25,828
(Will it be Team Taekwondo who is confident?)

989
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:28,288
(We got this round.)

990
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:30,598
- Good luck, Na Hyun.
- You can do it, Na Hyun.

991
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,797
- Good luck.
- You can do it, In Ah.

992
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:34,068
(We can win one, too!)

993
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:36,537
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

994
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,298
(Who will place 1st in the 3rd event amidst tension?)

995
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,968
- Don't get hurt.
- Right.

996
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,338
- Slow and steady.
- You got this.

997
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,547
What? How do they do that?

998
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:48,908
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

999
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:50,748
- Slow and steady.
- What? How do they do that?

1000
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:52,517
Nice. Good job.

1001
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:53,647
- Oh, you're good.
- Let's go!

1002
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:54,648
(Four teams dash upon the start.)

1003
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:57,388
(How's Team Taekwondo, who's confident in duck walking?)

1004
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,727
(Mad)

1005
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,728
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1006
00:38:01,729 --> 00:38:04,128
(Creating a sandstorm)

1007
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:06,968
- Everyone's moving like that.
- Let's go!

1008
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,498
She's good.

1009
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:10,698
Ji Eun's good.

1010
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:12,838
Go, Na Hyun.

1011
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,767
(I won't lose this time.)

1012
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:16,078
You're doing amazing.

1013
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,338
They're really good.

1014
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:20,277
- Keep it up.
- Let's go!

1015
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:22,917
(Someone's discouraged by their speed.)

1016
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:23,948
Wait. How...

1017
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:27,218
(Let me join you.)

1018
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,418
In Ah, it's okay.

1019
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:31,717
In Ah, take your time.

1020
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:34,088
(While In Ah's struggling...)

1021
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:35,727
Go, Na Hyun.

1022
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:39,098
(An intense fight for the 1st place)

1023
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:40,628
(Widening her stride)

1024
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:41,828
Keep it up, Hyeon Yeong.

1025
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:43,898
- You can do it.
- You're doing great.

1026
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:44,998
Nice.

1027
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:49,678
(Team Wrestling moves forward by striding widely.)

1028
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,948
(How dare you?)

1029
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:56,718
(Speeding up)

1030
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:01,017
Keep it up.

1031
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,018
(Let's go, Team Taekwondo.)

1032
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:05,118
(Between Team Wrestling and Team Taekwondo...)

1033
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:08,058
(Clenching teeth)

1034
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,698
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts moves forward with spirit.)

1035
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,427
- You're almost here.
- You're almost done.

1036
00:39:13,428 --> 00:39:14,697
- You're almost here.
- Good.

1037
00:39:14,698 --> 00:39:15,798
Keep it up.

1038
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,238
Good job.

1039
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,098
Good job.

1040
00:39:19,308 --> 00:39:20,437
- Good job.
- First place!

1041
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,608
- Good job.
- There's no need to hurry.

1042
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:24,737
(Team Taekwondo, Team Special Forces Martial Arts, Team Wrestling)

1043
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,678
(The 2nd players set off almost at the same time.)

1044
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,778
(In Ah)

1045
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:31,478
(How's Iron Girls doing?)

1046
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:34,247
(In Ah hasn't arrived yet.)

1047
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:35,487
This is crazy.

1048
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:36,488
Okay.

1049
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:37,657
Gosh.

1050
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:41,258
(Even In Ah, with iron stamina, struggles to duck walk.)

1051
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:43,898
In Ah, keep going. You can do it.

1052
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:46,767
(She can move forward thanks to her members' support.)

1053
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:48,098
Go, Seol In Ah.

1054
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:51,667
(In Ah does her best to the end.)

1055
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:52,668
Sae Rok.

1056
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,668
(Iron Girls' 1st player In Ah arrives.)

1057
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:58,238
(Her thighs are in pain after completing the race.)

1058
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:02,878
(Iron Girls' 2nd player Sae Rok sets off.)

1059
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:07,088
(Let's go, Energetic Sae Rok.)

1060
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:08,147
(Taekwondo 2, Wrestling 2)

1061
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:10,188
(Meanwhile, Team Wrestling's 2nd player caught up.)

1062
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,228
(She moves forward with crazy speed.)

1063
00:40:15,258 --> 00:40:16,628
No, you can't do that.

1064
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,268
Don't let your knees touch the ground.

1065
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:22,167
You can only lean them when you're resting.

1066
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,998
You can't stride on your knees.

1067
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:28,038
That's the basic posture for wrestlers.

1068
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:30,907
Wrestlers, don't stride on your knees.

1069
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,177
- Okay.
- Don't stride on your knees.

1070
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,208
Okay.

1071
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:37,578
(This time, she only uses the strength of her lower body.)

1072
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,247
Good.

1073
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,248
(She soon reaches the halfway point.)

1074
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,088
(Her speed doesn't decrease even after reaching the halfway point.)

1075
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:47,858
(However, she's chased by...)

1076
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:50,598
(Team Taekwondo's 3rd player.)

1077
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,298
We might have a chance, Ka Hyun.

1078
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:56,398
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

1079
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:58,967
(Team Taekwondo versus Team Wrestling)

1080
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:00,268
(The last players set off.)

1081
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,478
(While the last players set off, how's Iron Girls doing?)

1082
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:07,508
(Now, it's the 3rd player Uie.)

1083
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,878
(She's one lap behind the frontrunner.)

1084
00:41:12,988 --> 00:41:16,488
(But Uie still does her best.)

1085
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:17,758
Go, Uie.

1086
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:20,157
- Good.
- Nice.

1087
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:21,758
(Their pride is on the last lap.)

1088
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,898
For the pride of taekwondo, Ka Hyun!

1089
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:26,297
(We'll win this time no matter what.)

1090
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:28,098
- Oh, look at that.
- No way.

1091
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,768
(Dashing)

1092
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:37,508
(An unprecedented speed)

1093
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:41,248
(Overwhelming)

1094
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,447
- Good.
- Nice.

1095
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:44,918
Lee Han Bit!

1096
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:46,387
Lee Han Bit!

1097
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:47,987
- Good.
- Good job.

1098
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:49,457
(With her strong lower body...)

1099
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,458
(Taekwondo 4, Wrestling 4)

1100
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:52,858
(Team Wrestling instantly widens the gap.)

1101
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:56,098
(The outlaw that dashes through the sand)

1102
00:41:56,698 --> 00:41:59,328
(Team Wrestling who widened the gap since the start...)

1103
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:04,068
(reaches the halfway point before Team Taekwondo.)

1104
00:42:05,468 --> 00:42:06,468
(Groaning)

1105
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:09,678
(Team Taekwondo soon reaches the halfway point.)

1106
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:13,378
(However, due to speeding up in the beginning,)

1107
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,547
(she became slow.)

1108
00:42:15,548 --> 00:42:17,378
- Focus.
- Keep it up.

1109
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:18,878
Keep it up.

1110
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,618
Now is the chance. Hurry up.

1111
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:22,517
Keep it up, Ka Hyun.

1112
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:25,518
(The last spurt)

1113
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,027
Slow down. You're doing great.

1114
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,688
No, they're chasing you. You have to do this.

1115
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:30,597
- You're almost done.
- Good.

1116
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:32,357
- Good.
- You can do it.

1117
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:33,427
You'll make it.

1118
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:34,998
(Will Team Taekwondo get to keep their pride?)

1119
00:42:35,128 --> 00:42:37,137
- Keep it up.
- Hurry.

1120
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,567
(Who's the winner of Round 3?)

1121
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:41,007
- Good. Keep it up.
- Don't give up.

1122
00:42:41,008 --> 00:42:42,307
- Good. Keep it up.
- Nice.

1123
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,378
(Team Wrestling places 1st.)

1124
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:46,147
(Team Taekwondo places 2nd.)

1125
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,647
- Good job.
- Nice.

1126
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,808
Good job.

1127
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:51,017
Keep it up, Hae Ju.

1128
00:42:51,018 --> 00:42:52,418
Make some room for her.

1129
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:54,847
- Nice.
- Nice.

1130
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:55,887
Good job.

1131
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:56,958
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts places 3rd.)

1132
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:59,217
- Go, Iron Girls.
- Go.

1133
00:42:59,218 --> 00:43:00,488
You can do it.

1134
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:02,028
Keep it up.

1135
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,498
(Team Jiu-jitsu versus Iron Girls)

1136
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:05,797
Keep it up.

1137
00:43:05,798 --> 00:43:07,898
Let's not come in last, please.

1138
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,037
Keep it up.

1139
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:11,038
(And Iron Girls)

1140
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:14,908
(My lower body, let's do this.)

1141
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:16,337
- You can do it.
- You're doing great.

1142
00:43:16,338 --> 00:43:17,677
- You're doing great.
- Keep it up.

1143
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,748
(They squeeze out their last stamina.)

1144
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:23,848
(Stopping)

1145
00:43:24,648 --> 00:43:27,388
(Even Uie the Stamina Queen struggles with this training.)

1146
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:29,487
- Let's go.
- You're almost done.

1147
00:43:29,488 --> 00:43:31,258
(Meanwhile, Team Jiu-jitsu arrives first.)

1148
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:34,458
(Team Jiu-jitsu's last player sets off.)

1149
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,527
(Jiu-jitsu 4, Iron Girls 3)

1150
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:38,758
Let's avoid last place.

1151
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:39,968
You can do it.

1152
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,627
Don't give up.

1153
00:43:41,628 --> 00:43:43,998
- Okay. Up to here.
- You got it.

1154
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:47,468
(But don't give up yet.)

1155
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:51,008
(Iron Girls' last player is Captain Kim.)

1156
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:52,877
- We have one more lap left.
- I got it. That's good.

1157
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:54,008
(Will Captain Kim be able to turn the tables?)

1158
00:43:55,048 --> 00:43:56,817
(Captain Kim sets off for Iron Girls' pride.)

1159
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:58,348
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

1160
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:00,717
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

1161
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:03,418
(Speeding up)

1162
00:44:04,118 --> 00:44:05,458
Goodness.

1163
00:44:05,988 --> 00:44:08,358
(That's our captain.)

1164
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,257
(Straining his thighs)

1165
00:44:11,258 --> 00:44:12,767
- Let's go.
- You're almost there.

1166
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:14,768
(Straining his calves)

1167
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:17,638
(Using his UFC-trained lower body)

1168
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:22,438
(Speeding up to turn the tables)

1169
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:26,108
(What is that?)

1170
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:30,977
(He catches up with insane speed.)

1171
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,647
(Jiu-jitsu 4, Iron Girls 4)

1172
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,747
(Captain Kim reduces the gap.)

1173
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:36,687
- Keep it up.
- Keep calm.

1174
00:44:36,688 --> 00:44:37,688
You can do it

1175
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,217
(Captain Kim's crazy speed)

1176
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,558
(Flopping)

1177
00:44:41,928 --> 00:44:43,357
- He's like a machine.
- Keep calm.

1178
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,228
He can't catch you. Take your time.

1179
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,768
(Fast and furious)

1180
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:52,467
(I'll catch up.)

1181
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:54,038
Good.

1182
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,777
- Go, Captain Kim.
- Let's go.

1183
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,007
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

1184
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:00,008
(Don't let him catch you.)

1185
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:01,547
You can do it.

1186
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,248
You're close.

1187
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,717
(Team Iron Girls is catching up.)

1188
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:07,347
You're close.

1189
00:45:07,348 --> 00:45:08,388
Good.

1190
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:10,518
You're doing great. Watch your knees.

1191
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:11,718
Good.

1192
00:45:11,988 --> 00:45:13,427
Good job.

1193
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:15,757
(Team Jiu-jitsu places 4th.)

1194
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:17,328
You had the perfect posture, too.

1195
00:45:18,128 --> 00:45:19,767
(Team Iron Girls places 5th.)

1196
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:20,998
Gosh. I'm so tired.

1197
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:25,837
(He gave his all.)

1198
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:26,968
I'm drained.

1199
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:28,738
That was amazing.

1200
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:31,307
- That was so hard.
- Captain, are you okay?

1201
00:45:31,308 --> 00:45:32,477
- Captain, are your thighs okay?
- That was so hard.

1202
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:33,547
Yes. I'm okay.

1203
00:45:33,548 --> 00:45:35,447
- Good job.
- Without him...

1204
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:36,777
You have strong mental power.

1205
00:45:36,778 --> 00:45:38,978
We have the result.

1206
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,817
Team Wrestling must've won.

1207
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:42,988
- Oh, my gosh.
- Seriously.

1208
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:45,257
(Did Team Wrestling win again?)

1209
00:45:45,258 --> 00:45:47,328
But the wrestlers...

1210
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:49,998
(Is there a problem with Team Wrestling?)

1211
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:51,657
I said your knees could touch the ground...

1212
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:53,097
only when you were resting.

1213
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:55,227
I told you not to stride on your knees.

1214
00:45:55,228 --> 00:45:56,998
But this is how wrestlers...

1215
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:58,298
train.

1216
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:00,338
Because this is how they train,

1217
00:46:00,668 --> 00:46:01,907
they did this without knowing.

1218
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:02,908
(That was one of their tackle training sessions.)

1219
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:06,808
(They used their knees like how they train.)

1220
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:12,947
- Yes.
- He knows it.

1221
00:46:12,948 --> 00:46:13,948
- Right.
- Right.

1222
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:15,947
So this time, Team Wrestling is...

1223
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:17,288
disqualified.

1224
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:18,818
- Okay.
- Okay.

1225
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:22,487
That means Team Taekwondo wins this event.

1226
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,557
(Team Taekwondo places 1st in the Relay Duck Walk.)

1227
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:26,698
And...

1228
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,227
we have sad news.

1229
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:30,238
The next training is our last one.

1230
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:31,597
(Oh, my. The last one?)

1231
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:32,738
That's so sad.

1232
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:35,237
- That's so sad.
- That's so sad.

1233
00:46:35,238 --> 00:46:36,808
- Now...
- That's so sad.

1234
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,207
(Disqualified: Team Wrestling, 4th: Team Iron Girls)

1235
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,207
(3rd: Team Jiu-jitsu, 2nd: Team Special Forces Martial Arts)

1236
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,548
(1st: Team Taekwondo)

1237
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:44,817
Finally, it's the last training.

1238
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:46,147
- Yes.
- First of all,

1239
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:48,447
the last training is related to Team Wrestling.

1240
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:50,258
Team Wrestling, how do you train?

1241
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,488
What could it be?

1242
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:52,836
They scare me the most.

1243
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:56,058
- We do the whole body exercise.
- Okay.

1244
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:59,457
(Strong stamina is the key in wrestling.)

1245
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:02,698
We focus mainly on the upper and lower bodies and the core muscles.

1246
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:06,668
What's the part you don't train in wrestling?

1247
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:08,138
There's none.

1248
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,807
The upper and lower bodies and the core muscles.

1249
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:12,107
Fortunately,

1250
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:14,008
it's highly related to boxing.

1251
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,177
- The upper, lower, and core.
- It's stressing me out.

1252
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,477
You use your punch...

1253
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:19,987
to hit the other player in boxing,

1254
00:47:19,988 --> 00:47:22,548
but that stamina comes from your lower body.

1255
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:24,158
So you need good core muscles.

1256
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:27,157
And the rotation. That's all related to wrestling.

1257
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:28,428
- Right?
- Of course.

1258
00:47:28,658 --> 00:47:30,598
That's what the last training is for.

1259
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,157
It's Tire Flip.

1260
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:33,228
(The last special training, Tire Flip)

1261
00:47:33,428 --> 00:47:34,598
It's Tire Flip.

1262
00:47:36,338 --> 00:47:37,437
(Tire Flip?)

1263
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,897
How are we going to do that?

1264
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,268
(The name itself already sounds scary.)

1265
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:42,908
There it is.

1266
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:44,477
- That's crazy.
- That's probably not it.

1267
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:45,577
- I don't want to do it.
- No.

1268
00:47:45,578 --> 00:47:46,678
That's it.

1269
00:47:48,178 --> 00:47:49,508
Those tires...

1270
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:51,018
weigh 210kg.

1271
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:53,387
(Appalled)

1272
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:54,988
- We have to flip that?
- Is that even related to...

1273
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:56,917
What? What are we supposed to do with that?

1274
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,157
- We have to flip it.
- We have to flip it...

1275
00:47:58,158 --> 00:47:59,187
and move forward.

1276
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:01,428
- Are you sure we're not rolling?
- I wish we were.

1277
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,457
- How are we going to do that?
- I'm getting a headache.

1278
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,527
(Welcome to the tire inferno.)

1279
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:06,567
How are we going to flip that?

1280
00:48:06,568 --> 00:48:07,597
(How are we going to flip that?)

1281
00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:08,897
Didn't you say you wanted to try this?

1282
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:10,267
We're the only ones clapping.

1283
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:11,568
(Already excited)

1284
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:15,208
(The last training of today is Tire Flip.)

1285
00:48:15,568 --> 00:48:19,807
Four people will flip the 210kg tire together.

1286
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:21,148
(The whole team will work together to flip the 210kg tire.)

1287
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:22,307
It's 50m.

1288
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:24,678
(The team that completes the 50m race first wins.)

1289
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:28,918
Before the game,

1290
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:33,288
the wrestlers have done this often in the training center.

1291
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:36,088
Is it okay for me to join this game?

1292
00:48:36,128 --> 00:48:37,558
If I were to join,

1293
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,328
I'd flip the tire easily.

1294
00:48:41,328 --> 00:48:43,197
If I join the team,

1295
00:48:43,198 --> 00:48:44,797
first place is guaranteed.

1296
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:45,837
- Captain Kim.
- Yes.

1297
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:47,707
Can we just win for the first time?

1298
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,137
If you feel confident, let me join.

1299
00:48:49,138 --> 00:48:50,808
- Oh, yes.
- Of course.

1300
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,707
Is it okay for me to place first?

1301
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,947
- Yes.
- Yes.

1302
00:48:53,948 --> 00:48:55,478
- I'm taking first place.
- Yes.

1303
00:48:55,678 --> 00:48:57,678
I mean it. Okay.

1304
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:02,548
(Finally, the last training)

1305
00:49:02,618 --> 00:49:03,857
You need to push it with your body.

1306
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,218
- Press your body to the tire.
- Okay.

1307
00:49:05,288 --> 00:49:07,188
- You have to press your body.
- Okay.

1308
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,288
(Determined)

1309
00:49:09,558 --> 00:49:11,727
- We can do it.
- Good.

1310
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:12,957
- It's the last one.
- The last one.

1311
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,798
(We're going to win anyway.)

1312
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:16,267
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

1313
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:18,068
(Who will win in the last training?)

1314
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:21,138
One, two, three. Lift.

1315
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,468
- Let's do it at once.
- Okay.

1316
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:24,907
One, two, three.

1317
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:26,178
(Groaning)

1318
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:27,808
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1319
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:29,877
This way. Okay.

1320
00:49:29,878 --> 00:49:31,177
- I'll push it this way. Again.
- Let's do this.

1321
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:32,377
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

1322
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:34,818
(They use their lower body to lift it.)

1323
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:36,317
(And they push using their upper body.)

1324
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:37,417
Gosh, it's so heavy.

1325
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:38,487
(And they push using their upper body.)

1326
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:40,227
- Again.
- One, two, three.

1327
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,028
(It exercises the whole body every time they repeat it.)

1328
00:49:42,258 --> 00:49:43,427
One, two, three.

1329
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:45,858
(Using their entire body, this workout is no joke.)

1330
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:48,298
(Groaning)

1331
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:51,597
Gosh.

1332
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:55,967
(The other teams are also struggling with the tire.)

1333
00:49:55,968 --> 00:49:57,078
Let's do it.

1334
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,537
One, two, three. Lift.

1335
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,648
(How's Team Taekwondo that placed 1st in the last training doing?)

1336
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:04,347
(Grunting)

1337
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:05,648
- Again.
- Let's try.

1338
00:50:06,118 --> 00:50:08,018
- One, two, three. Lift.
- One, two, three.

1339
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:09,857
(They brace themselves and try again.)

1340
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:11,017
- It's coming up.
- No.

1341
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:12,688
Lift it up until the end. One, two...

1342
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:13,928
Lift.

1343
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,227
- Lift.
- Lean it on your knees.

1344
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:17,757
(The 210kg tire is too heavy even for Team Taekwondo.)

1345
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:20,567
(Screaming)

1346
00:50:20,568 --> 00:50:23,998
(They did succeed in flipping it, but..)

1347
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:25,167
Help.

1348
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:27,838
(they still have a long way to go.)

1349
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:30,608
It's impossible to lift it.

1350
00:50:30,638 --> 00:50:31,808
One more time?

1351
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:33,348
- Let's take a short break first.
- Let's try one more time.

1352
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:34,847
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1353
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:36,517
(Wrestling)

1354
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:37,678
Keep it up.

1355
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:39,247
Let's do it at once.

1356
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,448
(They're in the lead with overwhelming power.)

1357
00:50:40,648 --> 00:50:41,717
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1358
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:44,217
(Flipping at once)

1359
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:45,287
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1360
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:46,987
(Unlike other teams, they move forward easily...)

1361
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:48,688
(as if they're flipping buchimgae.)

1362
00:50:48,928 --> 00:50:50,227
- The upper body.
- One, two, three.

1363
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:51,627
(The upper body)

1364
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:52,698
Strain your core muscles.

1365
00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:54,198
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1366
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:56,767
- Let's go.
- Go, Team Wrestling.

1367
00:50:56,768 --> 00:50:57,798
(Go, Team Wrestling.)

1368
00:50:58,438 --> 00:51:00,838
(Team Wrestling flips the tire easily.)

1369
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,208
Let's win big.

1370
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,208
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1371
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:05,078
(Wrestling)

1372
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:06,877
- Move it to the side.
- Is this good?

1373
00:51:06,878 --> 00:51:08,407
(How's Team Iron Girls doing with Captain Kim?)

1374
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:09,508
Good. Now, push.

1375
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:11,669
- One, two, three.
- Let's go.

1376
00:51:13,118 --> 00:51:15,318
Strain one more time here. One, two, three.

1377
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,188
Use your knees. One, two, three.

1378
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:19,958
(Applying immediately)

1379
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:21,488
It's fun when we can lift it.

1380
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,028
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1381
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:24,197
(According to Captain Kim's command...)

1382
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:26,057
All right. One, two, three.

1383
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:27,968
Use your knees.

1384
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:29,727
(Special Forces Martial Arts, Jiu-jitsu)

1385
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:30,997
One, two, three.

1386
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:32,898
(The two teams are ahead of Iron Girls.)

1387
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:34,807
One, two, three.

1388
00:51:34,808 --> 00:51:36,338
- It's leaning to this side.
- Yes, it is.

1389
00:51:37,978 --> 00:51:41,577
(They lift the tire again.)

1390
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:43,878
- It keeps moving this way.
- I know. It's moving to the right.

1391
00:51:44,248 --> 00:51:47,117
(Other teams are going straight.)

1392
00:51:47,118 --> 00:51:48,587
(Special Forces Martial Arts)

1393
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:52,818
(They went to the right from the start.)

1394
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,227
- Is it your side?
- I think we need to switch.

1395
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:57,928
Our stamina is not even. Do you want to come here, Hyun Seon?

1396
00:51:58,258 --> 00:51:59,497
- Do you want me to move over there?
- Yes.

1397
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:01,227
(Switching positions)

1398
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:02,427
- Then we need to switch.
- Ji Eun, come to the center.

1399
00:52:02,428 --> 00:52:03,467
- Should I go to the center?
- Yes.

1400
00:52:03,468 --> 00:52:05,268
(At that moment, Team Jiu-jitsu gets ahead.)

1401
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:09,138
One, two...

1402
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,378
(Now is the chance.)

1403
00:52:11,638 --> 00:52:12,738
Push!

1404
00:52:13,378 --> 00:52:14,707
One, two, three.

1405
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:18,578
(Their combat power increases.)

1406
00:52:21,148 --> 00:52:24,588
(Team Jiu-jitsu is on a roll after getting ahead.)

1407
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,357
(Team Jiu-jitsu is in 2nd place.)

1408
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:27,428
Two, three.

1409
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:29,587
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts is in 3rd place.)

1410
00:52:29,588 --> 00:52:31,127
One, two, three.

1411
00:52:31,128 --> 00:52:33,297
(Team Iron Girls is in 4th place.)

1412
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:34,468
It's getting light.

1413
00:52:34,668 --> 00:52:35,697
(Wrestling)

1414
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:39,268
(Meanwhile, how's Team Wrestling doing in the lead?)

1415
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:41,838
Let's use our knees now.

1416
00:52:43,008 --> 00:52:44,108
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1417
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:45,377
(Using their lower bodies)

1418
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:46,877
- Use your knees.
- Okay.

1419
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:47,978
And your core muscles.

1420
00:52:48,108 --> 00:52:49,247
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1421
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:52,177
(Using all their muscles)

1422
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:53,318
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1423
00:52:53,988 --> 00:52:55,188
We're fast.

1424
00:52:55,418 --> 00:52:56,517
It's easy.

1425
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:57,687
Let's do it at once.

1426
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:00,828
(With firm muscles and outstanding power...)

1427
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:01,928
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1428
00:53:02,328 --> 00:53:04,597
That's right. Good job.

1429
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,628
(They move forward like beasts.)

1430
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,198
One more time.

1431
00:53:07,328 --> 00:53:08,367
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1432
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:09,998
(They reached the finish line.)

1433
00:53:10,698 --> 00:53:11,798
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1434
00:53:13,538 --> 00:53:14,538
Push.

1435
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:16,708
(They complete the race easily with their amazing stamina.)

1436
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:19,438
(Team Wrestling places 1st without a twist.)

1437
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:21,948
- Let's root for them.
- You can do it.

1438
00:53:22,248 --> 00:53:24,378
- Good.
- You can do it.

1439
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,077
(Jiu-jitsu)

1440
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:29,118
(How's Team Jiu-jitsu in 2nd place doing?)

1441
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,118
- Team Jiu-jiutsu. You're second.
- One, two, three.

1442
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:33,787
- Good.
- Keep it up.

1443
00:53:33,788 --> 00:53:34,928
Team Jiu-jiutsu, you're good.

1444
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:36,697
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1445
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:37,727
You can do it.

1446
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:38,927
(With doggedness...)

1447
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:39,958
Nice.

1448
00:53:40,198 --> 00:53:41,427
(And determination)

1449
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:42,668
Team Jiu-jiutsu, you're good.

1450
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:47,108
(Moving forward with Team Wrestling's support)

1451
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,667
- Nice.
- One...

1452
00:53:49,668 --> 00:53:50,977
(The finish line is near.)

1453
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:51,978
Last one.

1454
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:55,547
(Team Jiu-jitsu passes the finish line.)

1455
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:56,607
- Good.
- Okay.

1456
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,918
- Thank you.
- Good job.

1457
00:53:58,048 --> 00:53:59,578
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1458
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:01,817
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1459
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:02,818
Nice.

1460
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,817
(Now, it's between the three teams.)

1461
00:54:04,818 --> 00:54:06,288
- You have to push from behind.
- One, two, three.

1462
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,158
Let's do it. We can catch up.

1463
00:54:10,558 --> 00:54:12,358
You have to believe in yourself. One, two, three.

1464
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:15,498
- One, two, three.
- Let's go.

1465
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:17,167
(Iron Girls, Special Forces Martial Arts)

1466
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:18,367
(Team Iron Girls and Team Special Forces Martial Arts are close now.)

1467
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:20,408
- You have to push from behind.
- We're getting close.

1468
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:22,708
I think we can do it.

1469
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,607
One, two, three.

1470
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:25,777
(Let's turn the tables.)

1471
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:27,448
One, two, three.

1472
00:54:29,408 --> 00:54:30,878
One, two, three.

1473
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:32,248
- Lift.
- One second.

1474
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:34,148
Again. They're coming.

1475
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:35,747
One, two, three.

1476
00:54:35,748 --> 00:54:37,717
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts is having a crisis...)

1477
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:39,658
(after failing to go straight in the beginning.)

1478
00:54:40,058 --> 00:54:41,158
- Lift.
- Wait.

1479
00:54:42,628 --> 00:54:44,427
(Team Iron Girls is taking the chance to catch up.)

1480
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:45,558
Let's catch up.

1481
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:48,267
Use your strength. One, two...

1482
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:51,167
(Now is the chance.)

1483
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:52,168
Let's do it.

1484
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:53,368
One, two, three.

1485
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,177
(The gap is slowly decreasing.)

1486
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,178
That's right.

1487
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:00,177
We'll be able to catch up.

1488
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:01,878
- One, two, three.
- We can do it.

1489
00:55:02,108 --> 00:55:03,947
Let's catch up. Again. Let's do it.

1490
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:05,178
One, two... This way.

1491
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:07,448
One, two...

1492
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:09,718
- Good.
- You can do it.

1493
00:55:10,218 --> 00:55:11,387
- Let's do it.
- One, two, three.

1494
00:55:11,388 --> 00:55:12,487
One, two, three.

1495
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:13,927
(Team Iron Girls catches up with Team Special Forces Martial Arts.)

1496
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:14,928
Let's go!

1497
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:16,727
(Neck and neck)

1498
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:18,198
One, two, three.

1499
00:55:18,658 --> 00:55:23,128
(Will it be Team Iron Girls...)

1500
00:55:23,328 --> 00:55:26,068
(or Team Special Forces Martial Arts?)

1501
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:29,468
(The finish line is near.)

1502
00:55:30,108 --> 00:55:33,878
(Who will reach the finish line first?)

1503
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:36,108
- It's the last one.
- One, two, three.

1504
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:40,078
One more. Let's keep it a clean game.

1505
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:42,918
One more. Let's keep it a clean game.

1506
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:45,557
- Do it. One, two, three.
- One...

1507
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:47,288
(Only one more to go.)

1508
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:50,358
(Team Iron Girls versus Team Special Forces Martial Arts)

1509
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:53,498
(Which team will win the final training exercise?)

1510
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:54,628
Two, three.

1511
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:56,797
(As strong Iron Girls who never give up,)

1512
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:59,367
(they successfully came from behind!)

1513
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:00,838
We did it thanks to you, Captain.

1514
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,078
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

1515
00:56:04,108 --> 00:56:05,438
Captain, are you sure you're okay?

1516
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:07,048
- Look at his knees.
- Are you okay, Captain?

1517
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:09,707
Captain, you're the best.

1518
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:11,748
(Captain, you're the best.)

1519
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:20,188
(Utterly exhausted from the tough training)

1520
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:22,928
Captain, are you okay?

1521
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,498
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1522
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:29,698
(We completed the race!)

1523
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:31,138
- One, two, three.
- One, two...

1524
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:35,468
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts crosses the finish line as well.)

1525
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,108
- Nice.
- Don't give up!

1526
00:56:39,738 --> 00:56:41,377
- Okay.
- Nice.

1527
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:42,848
(Team Special Forces Martial Arts is in 4th place.)

1528
00:56:44,048 --> 00:56:45,577
- That was insane.
- Good job.

1529
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:47,847
- Good job, guys.
- Good job.

1530
00:56:47,848 --> 00:56:49,688
(Both teams delivered a fierce yet amazing race.)

1531
00:56:50,618 --> 00:56:51,717
Let's go.

1532
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:52,718
- One...
- One, two, three.

1533
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,728
(One team remains.)

1534
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:56,998
- Are we halfway there?
- Let's go.

1535
00:56:57,298 --> 00:56:58,428
Let's go.

1536
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,968
- Come on.
- Let's go. Don't give up.

1537
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:02,428
One, two, three.

1538
00:57:04,198 --> 00:57:06,268
- Push with your knee.
- I am.

1539
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,838
(We'll never give up.)

1540
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:10,778
You've got this!

1541
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,208
Go, Team Taekwondo!

1542
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,008
Why don't we help?

1543
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:16,347
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1544
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:17,747
(They didn't hesitate to help even though the game was over.)

1545
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:19,218
- You guys are the best!
- Let's go!

1546
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:20,888
- Let's cross the finish line.
- You guys are the best!

1547
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:22,847
- One, two, three.
- Three.

1548
00:57:22,848 --> 00:57:24,987
- All right.
- We're almost there.

1549
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:26,817
(The others gather their remaining energy to help.)

1550
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,028
- We're almost there.
- We're almost at the end.

1551
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:31,457
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1552
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,727
(They push forward, aiming to cross the finish line.)

1553
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:34,098
- Lift it!
- I can't.

1554
00:57:35,028 --> 00:57:36,628
Go, team!

1555
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:38,168
You guys are amazing.

1556
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:39,937
- You've got this.
- You've got this.

1557
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:41,608
- I'm impressed.
- Go, team!

1558
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,207
Push, guys.

1559
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,237
(Even though they were competitors)

1560
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:45,508
- One last time.
- This is the last one.

1561
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:47,877
- Push.
- Come on.

1562
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:49,147
- Push!
- You did it.

1563
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:50,618
(They worked as one during the final moments.)

1564
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:52,218
- You did it.
- Push!

1565
00:57:52,878 --> 00:57:54,187
(They joined forces and finished the race together.)

1566
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:55,247
Thank you.

1567
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:59,188
(They joined forces and finished the race together.)

1568
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:00,988
That was amazing.

1569
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:03,627
- That was so cool.
- Thank you.

1570
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:04,727
(Their special training session is complete.)

1571
00:58:04,728 --> 00:58:05,998
Nice job.

1572
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:08,367
(Tire Flip, 5th: Team Taekwondo,)

1573
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:09,567
(4th: Team Special Forces Martial Arts,)

1574
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:10,737
(3rd: Team Iron Girls, 2nd: Team Jiu-jitsu,)

1575
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:11,898
(1st: Team Wrestling)

1576
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:14,108
- It's finally over!
- That was tough.

1577
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:16,408
Look at that. The sun looks incredible today.

1578
00:58:16,508 --> 00:58:18,408
- It looks like a painting.
- It's like a painting.

1579
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:20,348
We'd remember this for a long time.

1580
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:23,817
Back in high school,

1581
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:26,448
I briefly played sports,

1582
00:58:26,518 --> 00:58:30,317
but these ladies are stars whom I dreamed of becoming.

1583
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,558
I always dreamed of being a national athlete.

1584
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:37,658
I got to spend time with the ladies who made our country proud.

1585
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:40,367
It felt good, and it's making me emotional.

1586
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:42,067
- They gave us a lot of energy.
- Exactly.

1587
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:44,797
We'll channel the energy you gave us...

1588
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:46,198
and win at the event.

1589
00:58:46,868 --> 00:58:47,938
That's so cool.

1590
00:58:48,768 --> 00:58:50,138
Nice.

1591
00:58:51,078 --> 00:58:54,708
I'm competitive by nature and have always wanted to win,

1592
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:58,048
but these ladies humbled me today.

1593
00:58:58,078 --> 00:59:01,947
Training with them alone was a blast,

1594
00:59:01,948 --> 00:59:03,918
and I leave recharged with energy. Thank you.

1595
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:05,058
That's for sure.

1596
00:59:06,218 --> 00:59:10,188
When asked how to overcome the urge to give up,

1597
00:59:10,288 --> 00:59:12,157
they all said the same thing.

1598
00:59:12,158 --> 00:59:14,527
"It all depends on your attitude."

1599
00:59:14,528 --> 00:59:17,367
That's what they all said.

1600
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:20,238
I'll take that to heart and work out even harder...

1601
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:22,007
in my training.

1602
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:23,608
Thank you so much.

1603
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:28,147
We just got back to Korea yesterday...

1604
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,347
- after our match abroad.
- No way.

1605
00:59:30,348 --> 00:59:33,147
I've been feeling a bit burned out lately,

1606
00:59:33,148 --> 00:59:35,047
but being around such passionate people...

1607
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:37,658
helped re-energize me.

1608
00:59:37,718 --> 00:59:39,917
I heard you'd be competing in real matches.

1609
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:41,987
If you get too nervous,

1610
00:59:41,988 --> 00:59:45,728
it's always wise to trust your partner than yourself.

1611
00:59:46,098 --> 00:59:49,097
The people you trained with witnessed your hard work.

1612
00:59:49,098 --> 00:59:50,098
- That's so cool.
- I hope...

1613
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,668
- you achieve the best results.
- That's inspiring.

1614
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:53,708
- Thank you.
- You guys are our partners.

1615
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:55,667
- You're our partners.
- We have so many partners!

1616
00:59:55,668 --> 00:59:56,968
They're all our partners.

1617
00:59:57,408 --> 00:59:58,837
- Go, - Go,

1618
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:00,407
- Iron Girls!
- Iron Girls!

1619
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:02,377
(Go, fearless Iron Girls!)

1620
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:03,948
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1621
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:06,277
Bye!

1622
01:00:06,278 --> 01:00:09,248
(Alongside precious partners with whom they sweated)

1623
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:12,218
(After their special training)

1624
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,958
(How did the Iron Girls spend 2 weeks boxing?)

1625
01:00:16,928 --> 01:00:19,398
(A training app for Iron Girls)

1626
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:22,898
(The members documented their personal training logs.)

1627
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,598
(Park Ju Hyun: Calf rehab and upper body boxing drills)

1628
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:26,338
(Seol In Ah: 2 rounds of jab, one, two, backstep, one, two)

1629
01:00:26,398 --> 01:00:28,068
(Uie: I become a fool when I put boxing gloves on.)

1630
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:29,267
(Keum Sae Rok: A lonely private training session)

1631
01:00:29,268 --> 01:00:30,977
(I trained alone without the others today.)

1632
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:32,308
(I appreciated the drills, but they were exhausting.)

1633
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,177
- Go. One, two, three.
- One.

1634
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:36,908
(Sae Rok's first private training session)

1635
01:00:37,118 --> 01:00:40,117
(Since she's weaker than the others, she focuses on physical training.)

1636
01:00:40,118 --> 01:00:41,548
One, two, three.

1637
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,388
Okay. Now, push-ups.

1638
01:00:44,018 --> 01:00:46,058
(During their last class)

1639
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:47,288
(Groaning)

1640
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:49,587
(Groaning)

1641
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:52,058
(Sae Rok couldn't even do one push-up.)

1642
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:54,327
Give me four push-ups on your knees.

1643
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:55,528
(She takes it slow, from the knees.)

1644
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:57,398
Only go as far as you can.

1645
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:00,738
(Groaning)

1646
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:03,508
(It's hard for her, but she still tries her best.)

1647
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:05,538
Four. You can do it.

1648
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:06,977
Five.

1649
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:08,008
(Groaning)

1650
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:09,547
Okay. Last ten.

1651
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:10,548
(Exhaling)

1652
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:11,917
Okay. Good job.

1653
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,318
(Until she can do push-ups without using her knees)

1654
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:14,448
Give me burpees.

1655
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:18,418
(There are no breaks during physical training.)

1656
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:20,957
Go. One, two, three.

1657
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:25,098
(Even by herself, she takes the training seriously.)

1658
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:27,497
(She does her best to keep up but...)

1659
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:29,167
Coach, why is it...

1660
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:31,168
that I'm so weak?

1661
01:01:33,598 --> 01:01:35,608
You have no idea how upsetting this is.

1662
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,377
The others are so much better than me.

1663
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:40,207
That's probably because...

1664
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:42,948
they got fit while filming Season One.

1665
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:45,917
This is so upsetting.

1666
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:47,588
(She's upset with how weak she feels.)

1667
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:50,117
(But she firmly re-ties her shoelaces.)

1668
01:01:50,118 --> 01:01:52,058
- You'll take it from the top.
- Sure.

1669
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:53,957
(She gets back up.)

1670
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:55,258
Ready, go.

1671
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:57,657
- One, two, three.
- One.

1672
01:01:57,658 --> 01:02:01,798
(Working hard to overcome her weaknesses)

1673
01:02:02,628 --> 01:02:03,628
Three.

1674
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:07,508
Why does it keep catching my feet?

1675
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:11,807
(May 8)

1676
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:13,977
(May 9)

1677
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:16,348
(May 10)

1678
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:19,678
(What a bummer!)

1679
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,217
You kept going for two minutes.

1680
01:02:21,218 --> 01:02:22,387
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1681
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:23,647
(I jumped rope for 2 minutes without it catching my feet.)

1682
01:02:23,648 --> 01:02:24,958
(I felt like I accomplished something for the first time.)

1683
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:27,958
(She's now practicing single-legged jump rope.)

1684
01:02:28,288 --> 01:02:29,457
(May 13)

1685
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,928
(May 14)

1686
01:02:31,158 --> 01:02:33,097
(I did single-legged jump rope for the first time!)

1687
01:02:33,098 --> 01:02:35,328
(How am I doing this? What a blast!)

1688
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:37,768
(From skipping Sae Rok)

1689
01:02:38,098 --> 01:02:39,438
One, two.

1690
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:42,068
(She improved immensely.)

1691
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:43,668
Jab.

1692
01:02:43,878 --> 01:02:45,637
One, two.

1693
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:47,008
Twist on two.

1694
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:49,647
(I feel like I'm growing stronger.)

1695
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:51,677
(I still have a long way to go, but I can make it if I do my best!)

1696
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:55,047
(I didn't sit or lie down even once during my session today.)

1697
01:02:55,048 --> 01:02:56,488
(I said goodbye to the floor. I'm proud of you, Keum Sae Rok.)

1698
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,787
I'm here in Busan right now...

1699
01:02:59,788 --> 01:03:00,958
for my play.

1700
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,558
Before I leave,

1701
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:05,728
I'm going to work out a bit.

1702
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:09,968
(She practices the hook that she hasn't been able to do.)

1703
01:03:11,098 --> 01:03:13,397
(Uie's training log: It's not easy to train alone.)

1704
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:16,568
(I get lonely and can't tell if I'm doing it right.)

1705
01:03:17,538 --> 01:03:19,838
Everyone's looking at me...

1706
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,347
like I'm doing something weird.

1707
01:03:22,348 --> 01:03:24,678
(Embarrassment hits her like a wave.)

1708
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:28,448
(Today, she trains with the coach.)

1709
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,857
(I came to the gym to complete two sessions in one day.)

1710
01:03:30,858 --> 01:03:32,317
(The morning session started at 10am and ended at 12pm.)

1711
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:33,687
(I'm better at physical training than I am with techniques.)

1712
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,327
Your arm should be at this angle.

1713
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:36,757
- Like this?
- Yes, exactly.

1714
01:03:36,758 --> 01:03:37,798
- Got it.
- Good.

1715
01:03:38,028 --> 01:03:41,828
(That afternoon)

1716
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:44,398
- Twist more with the hook.
- Right.

1717
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:46,838
Do I twist more?

1718
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:48,737
(I started training again after 3 hours of rest.)

1719
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:50,137
(I've gotten the hang of the punches.)

1720
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:51,737
(However, I'm still not sure about the hook.)

1721
01:03:51,738 --> 01:03:53,947
(Hard at training, twice a day)

1722
01:03:53,948 --> 01:03:56,347
(Uie's training log: Afternoon training session)

1723
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:58,077
(An hour and 20 minutes of technical training)

1724
01:03:58,078 --> 01:04:00,047
(Afternoon session: Back at it after lunch!)

1725
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:01,818
(My calves hurt. I'd better stretch!)

1726
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:03,447
(I need to find my confidence, which I'm still lacking.)

1727
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:05,017
(The sight of the ring still scares me.)

1728
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:06,757
(I haven't gone up there yet, but I don't want to.)

1729
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:08,258
(Find my confidence!)

1730
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,958
(She trains hard to overcome her fear.)

1731
01:04:12,228 --> 01:04:15,468
(In Ah fell in love with boxing. How is she doing?)

1732
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:17,898
(She does her best with physical training...)

1733
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:22,568
(and technical training!)

1734
01:04:22,908 --> 01:04:24,578
Twist more on the hook.

1735
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:27,548
One, two. That's it.

1736
01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:29,178
Nice.

1737
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:31,147
(Training while still wearing makeup after filming today)

1738
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:32,447
(It's so much fun.)

1739
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:33,817
(Simba becomes the Lion King in the end.)

1740
01:04:33,818 --> 01:04:35,317
(Do I have the makings of a king too?)

1741
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:36,617
Okay!

1742
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:37,988
(She gave it her all.)

1743
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:40,217
(I'll be fine as long as I give it my all.)

1744
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:41,927
(Will I be embarrassed that I lost?)

1745
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:43,327
(Or will I smile even if I lose?)

1746
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:44,398
Right. That's it.

1747
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:46,857
(I have so much work to do,)

1748
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:49,527
(and the blister on my foot still has a burning sensation,)

1749
01:04:49,528 --> 01:04:52,167
(but I should toughen up and concentrate on my training.)

1750
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:53,297
Nice!

1751
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:54,708
(She's proud.)

1752
01:04:54,908 --> 01:04:56,438
I can't wait for what's to come.

1753
01:04:57,678 --> 01:04:58,908
(Boxing is the best.)

1754
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:04,518
(Ju Hyun focuses on strengthening her calf muscles.)

1755
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,918
(Calves, let's see who wins,)

1756
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:12,358
(Is it going to be me or you?)

1757
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,558
(Even during her busy schedule)

1758
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:19,258
(She trains hard even while working abroad.)

1759
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:22,297
(Sometimes alone,)

1760
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:25,538
(and sometimes together, Iron Girls give their best.)

1761
01:05:25,598 --> 01:05:27,168
(May 19)

1762
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:29,237
(Uie, In Ah)

1763
01:05:29,238 --> 01:05:32,408
(Today, Uie and In Ah train together outdoors.)

1764
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,347
Training at maximum heart rate...

1765
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:35,678
improves recovery time.

1766
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:37,647
After each round in boxing, we get 40 seconds of rest.

1767
01:05:37,648 --> 01:05:39,918
You need to recover quickly in order to fight again.

1768
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,547
- This is a must.
- It's a must.

1769
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:42,688
(We can't skip running.)

1770
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:45,887
- Faster.
- Let's go!

1771
01:05:45,888 --> 01:05:47,458
(They run to improve their recovery ability.)

1772
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,458
They're abandoning me. They're abandoning their partner.

1773
01:05:52,558 --> 01:05:53,727
Hurry up!

1774
01:05:53,728 --> 01:05:54,928
Run faster!

1775
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:57,097
(Hurry up)

1776
01:05:57,098 --> 01:05:58,138
All right, then.

1777
01:05:58,198 --> 01:05:59,797
Jab. One, two, hook,

1778
01:05:59,798 --> 01:06:01,207
backstep, one, two.

1779
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,438
- Go.
- Right here?

1780
01:06:02,938 --> 01:06:04,307
Jab.

1781
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:05,738
One, two.

1782
01:06:06,238 --> 01:06:07,307
Jab.

1783
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:09,107
(With Seokchon Lake in the background,)

1784
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:10,177
(they throw passionate punches.)

1785
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:11,347
Jab.

1786
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:12,447
- One, two, hook, two.
- One, two, hook, two,

1787
01:06:12,448 --> 01:06:13,947
- backstep, one, two.
- You'll then run.

1788
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:15,017
- Go.
- Okay, run.

1789
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:18,918
(After technical training, they run again.)

1790
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,987
We're going to do a sprint over there.

1791
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:22,128
The last sprint.

1792
01:06:23,758 --> 01:06:24,827
Faster.

1793
01:06:24,828 --> 01:06:25,997
- Come on.
- Run.

1794
01:06:25,998 --> 01:06:27,328
Faster. That's it.

1795
01:06:27,498 --> 01:06:28,597
Nice.

1796
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:29,598
(Running at top speed)

1797
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:32,997
(In Ah runs like there's no tomorrow.)

1798
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:34,068
Go up the steps.

1799
01:06:37,938 --> 01:06:39,007
That's it.

1800
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:41,077
(Uie's training log: I went for a run with In Ah today.)

1801
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:42,147
(We sprinted at the end,)

1802
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:43,778
(which is something I'm still bad at.)

1803
01:06:44,218 --> 01:06:45,318
Faster.

1804
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:47,987
(The next day, Sae Rok challenges herself to the sprint.)

1805
01:06:47,988 --> 01:06:48,988
That's it.

1806
01:06:50,418 --> 01:06:51,418
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1807
01:06:51,419 --> 01:06:53,417
(I sprinted for the first time at Seokchon Lake today.)

1808
01:06:53,418 --> 01:06:54,827
(I didn't think about anything else...)

1809
01:06:54,828 --> 01:06:56,287
(and just ran as fast as possible.)

1810
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:57,458
(Am I becoming athletic as well?)

1811
01:06:58,628 --> 01:06:59,727
Let's take one like this.

1812
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:00,758
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1813
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,297
(They begin technical training to Sae Rok's chants.)

1814
01:07:05,298 --> 01:07:06,298
- Two.
- That's it.

1815
01:07:06,299 --> 01:07:08,367
Jab. One, two,

1816
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:10,508
- hook, two, backstep, one, two.
- Two.

1817
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:15,108
(Why is she yelling so loudly today?)

1818
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,447
Jab. One, two,

1819
01:07:17,448 --> 01:07:18,578
hook, two.

1820
01:07:18,648 --> 01:07:19,778
(Even she finds it funny.)

1821
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:21,487
One, two, hook, two!

1822
01:07:21,488 --> 01:07:22,948
Let's go again. Get ready.

1823
01:07:23,618 --> 01:07:25,317
(Training together makes them laugh.)

1824
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:26,957
- Okay.
- Ready, go!

1825
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,357
Jab.

1826
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:30,087
(Sae Rok's training log: It got lonely training on my own,)

1827
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,997
(but the group session was so much fun.)

1828
01:07:31,998 --> 01:07:33,027
(Uie: I love it when the 4 of us work out together.)

1829
01:07:33,028 --> 01:07:34,127
(It's a blast to cheer each other along.)

1830
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:35,827
(In Ah: It's a joy to sweat with the others.)

1831
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:37,967
(Ju Hyun: I feel like I'm at a training center for athletes.)

1832
01:07:37,968 --> 01:07:40,197
(With these girls, I know I can make it!)

1833
01:07:40,198 --> 01:07:41,967
(May 21)

1834
01:07:41,968 --> 01:07:43,467
(May 22)

1835
01:07:43,468 --> 01:07:44,977
(May 23)

1836
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:48,108
(They spent all of 2 weeks training how to box every day.)

1837
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:52,517
(How much have the Iron Girls improved?)

1838
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:54,417
Hello.

1839
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,288
(Iron Girls regroup after 2 weeks of hard training.)

1840
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:58,118
Have you all been well?

1841
01:07:58,258 --> 01:08:00,118
What qualifies as being well?

1842
01:08:00,988 --> 01:08:03,688
After waking up in the morning, I bring myself to the gym.

1843
01:08:04,328 --> 01:08:06,697
- I have two separate egos.
- I can't tell what my job is.

1844
01:08:06,698 --> 01:08:08,297
I've been leading a passionate life.

1845
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:09,868
I must say that boxing...

1846
01:08:10,098 --> 01:08:13,067
- is a physically challenging sport.
- That's true.

1847
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:14,867
Ju Hyun, why are you taping yourself already...

1848
01:08:14,868 --> 01:08:16,207
like it's become a habit?

1849
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:18,708
I have to do this right now to feel at ease.

1850
01:08:18,978 --> 01:08:21,248
You never know who'll attack us.

1851
01:08:22,108 --> 01:08:23,878
Wrap it like you mean it.

1852
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:27,618
If you time us, you'll see we've gotten better at this.

1853
01:08:28,388 --> 01:08:30,118
(I'm ready.)

1854
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,788
Hello, everyone.

1855
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:33,657
- Coach.
- Coach, where were you?

1856
01:08:33,658 --> 01:08:34,787
- Coach.
- I was watching you...

1857
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:35,888
wrap tape around your hands.

1858
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:37,227
Having your hands like that...

1859
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:39,397
makes you seem different.

1860
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:40,527
All right, then.

1861
01:08:40,528 --> 01:08:42,227
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

1862
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:43,428
Is it a famous saying?

1863
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:44,767
(He loves his famous sayings.)

1864
01:08:44,768 --> 01:08:46,837
You're only allowed one a day now.

1865
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:48,907
No, it's not a famous saying.

1866
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:50,838
You will be learning a new move that we have not dealt with before.

1867
01:08:51,308 --> 01:08:52,407
- That's right.
- Finally.

1868
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:54,677
You'll learn additional punches...

1869
01:08:54,678 --> 01:08:56,307
- Yes.
- and then learn how to dodge.

1870
01:08:56,308 --> 01:08:57,448
(Today's class: Additional punches and dodging)

1871
01:08:58,148 --> 01:08:59,778
(Jab)

1872
01:09:00,278 --> 01:09:01,618
(Straight)

1873
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:03,518
(Hook)

1874
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:04,687
One, two, upper.

1875
01:09:04,688 --> 01:09:06,757
(New technique: Uppercut)

1876
01:09:06,758 --> 01:09:07,788
That's it.

1877
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,587
(Dodging skills: Ducking and weaving)

1878
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:12,127
Boom. Use your back.

1879
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:13,198
Then your legs.

1880
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,968
Okay. Before we begin, what do we always do?

1881
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,197
- Jump rope.
- That's right.

1882
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,937
You'll jump rope.

1883
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:20,467
Just thinking about this makes me tear up.

1884
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:21,568
Get ready.

1885
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:22,767
Go.

1886
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:23,908
(3 minutes of jump rope, Round 1)

1887
01:09:25,408 --> 01:09:29,508
(They begin with the basic jump.)

1888
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:32,378
(They're now comfortable with it after 2 weeks of training.)

1889
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:35,148
(The rope gets caught.)

1890
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,618
(The rope gets caught.)

1891
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:39,987
Sae Rok's the only one...

1892
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:41,088
whose feet haven't been caught once.

1893
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,988
(Peaceful)

1894
01:09:44,758 --> 01:09:49,098
(Sae Rok has been jumping rope without tripping on it once.)

1895
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:51,597
(2 weeks ago)

1896
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:54,408
(She couldn't last 5 seconds.)

1897
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:59,378
(Sae Rok's feet kept getting caught.)

1898
01:10:01,378 --> 01:10:02,447
(In just 2 weeks,)

1899
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:05,118
(she comes out as the best at jump rope.)

1900
01:10:05,518 --> 01:10:08,088
(2 minutes and 30 seconds have passed.)

1901
01:10:08,588 --> 01:10:09,817
(30 seconds left, Beep)

1902
01:10:09,818 --> 01:10:11,358
You have 30 seconds left.

1903
01:10:12,258 --> 01:10:13,317
Thirty seconds.

1904
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:14,427
(She immediately starts picking up her knees.)

1905
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:15,988
That's it. You're doing great.

1906
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:20,628
(She picks up the intensity even though no one told her to.)

1907
01:10:21,628 --> 01:10:25,498
(I'm still hungry for more.)

1908
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:28,938
(They follow the captain and start dashing.)

1909
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:31,307
(What about Sae Rok who's the best at jump rope?)

1910
01:10:31,308 --> 01:10:33,438
(Creaking)

1911
01:10:35,348 --> 01:10:36,747
(Huffing)

1912
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:38,948
(She can't dash just yet.)

1913
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:43,018
(I'll return as the queen of dashing.)

1914
01:10:43,148 --> 01:10:44,657
(Groaning)

1915
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:45,958
Gosh. I'm exhausted.

1916
01:10:46,818 --> 01:10:49,388
I told you 30 seconds is enough time to change the outcome of the game.

1917
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,258
You can come back from behind...

1918
01:10:51,328 --> 01:10:52,997
and also lose even though you were winning.

1919
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,298
Coach, no more of those sayings.

1920
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:56,727
Five seconds.

1921
01:10:56,728 --> 01:10:58,198
(The last spurt)

1922
01:10:58,668 --> 01:11:00,037
Two, one.

1923
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:02,137
(Round 1 is over.)

1924
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:03,168
Nicely done.

1925
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:05,778
You've all gotten better at this.

1926
01:11:05,838 --> 01:11:08,608
Sae Rok, you barely tripped for the whole three minutes.

1927
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:09,808
You did great.

1928
01:11:10,548 --> 01:11:12,677
Root for yourselves and get back at it.

1929
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:13,978
- Go, team.
- Go, team.

1930
01:11:14,318 --> 01:11:15,617
Goodness.

1931
01:11:15,618 --> 01:11:18,217
(3 rounds of 3-minute jump rope are over.)

1932
01:11:18,218 --> 01:11:19,218
Good job.

1933
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:21,288
Okay, get ready.

1934
01:11:21,558 --> 01:11:22,828
Let's revise.

1935
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,627
Jab. One, two,

1936
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:26,898
backstep, one, two.

1937
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:29,628
That's routine number one.

1938
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:31,997
(A routine?)

1939
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:33,368
Remember that. Got it?

1940
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:36,537
You have learned the hook, straight, and jab.

1941
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:38,308
These are utilized as a combo...

1942
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:40,038
to throw off your opponent.

1943
01:11:40,308 --> 01:11:41,948
That's why we practice these routines.

1944
01:11:42,078 --> 01:11:43,848
It's to find your own rhythm.

1945
01:11:43,948 --> 01:11:46,147
Every gym has different routines.

1946
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:48,147
During fights, I'll be yelling...

1947
01:11:48,148 --> 01:11:50,217
numbers at you.

1948
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:51,857
This is number one for us.

1949
01:11:51,858 --> 01:11:54,858
Jab. One, two, backstep, one, two.

1950
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:57,492
- Jab. One, two, - Jab. One, two,

1951
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:58,857
- backstep, one, two.
- backstep, one, two.

1952
01:11:58,858 --> 01:11:59,927
That's it.

1953
01:11:59,928 --> 01:12:01,098
Here's routine number two.

1954
01:12:01,328 --> 01:12:03,467
Jab. One, two,

1955
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:05,198
hook, two, backstep, one, two.

1956
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:07,297
That's what you learned the last time.

1957
01:12:07,298 --> 01:12:08,638
- Hook, two, backstep...
- Routine number three.

1958
01:12:09,108 --> 01:12:11,177
One, two, hook, backstep, one, two.

1959
01:12:11,178 --> 01:12:13,008
- That's it.
- Yes.

1960
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,978
Let's practice that 50 times like always.

1961
01:12:15,178 --> 01:12:16,407
Get ready.

1962
01:12:16,408 --> 01:12:17,447
Go.

1963
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:21,187
(50 times of routine number 1)

1964
01:12:21,188 --> 01:12:23,587
- Jab. One, two, - One.

1965
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:25,057
- backstep, one, two.
- Two.

1966
01:12:25,058 --> 01:12:26,917
- Jab. One, two, - Rotate your back leg.

1967
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:27,958
- Rotate your waist.
- backstep, one, two.

1968
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:29,427
Jab.

1969
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,228
(Focusing on the rotation of the legs and waist)

1970
01:12:33,258 --> 01:12:34,358
Backstep, one, two.

1971
01:12:34,498 --> 01:12:38,568
(50 times of routine number 2)

1972
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:40,767
- Jab. One, two, - Jab. One, two,

1973
01:12:40,768 --> 01:12:42,708
- hook, two, backstep, one, two.
- hook, two, backstep, one, two.

1974
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:47,307
(Every punch is precise.)

1975
01:12:47,308 --> 01:12:49,248
That's it. Great posture.

1976
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:50,608
Sae Rok, that's great form.

1977
01:12:50,678 --> 01:12:54,617
(The form...)

1978
01:12:54,618 --> 01:12:58,158
(is perfect.)

1979
01:12:58,518 --> 01:13:02,128
(50 times of routine number 3)

1980
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:04,697
- One.
- Jab. One, two,

1981
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:06,797
- hook, backstep, one, two.
- Two.

1982
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:10,368
(So that the moves come naturally to them,)

1983
01:13:10,698 --> 01:13:13,367
(they must practice and practice.)

1984
01:13:13,368 --> 01:13:14,637
- One, two, hook, - Lower your chin.

1985
01:13:14,638 --> 01:13:15,937
backstep, one, two.

1986
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:16,967
(They finish doing 150 punch combos.)

1987
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:18,108
Good job.

1988
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:19,877
(They're exhausted before the class begins.)

1989
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:20,878
Good.

1990
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,207
Make sure to remember these routines.

1991
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:24,307
- Yes, sir.
- Got it?

1992
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:25,978
Nice. Let's learn something new.

1993
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,447
You guys learned the hook.

1994
01:13:28,448 --> 01:13:29,687
- Yes.
- Now,

1995
01:13:29,688 --> 01:13:30,818
you'll learn the uppercut.

1996
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:32,818
- The uppercut.
- That's what you'll learn.

1997
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,957
(The uppercut: A punch delivered vertically...)

1998
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:40,558
(from the bottom, aiming at the opponent's chin)

1999
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:42,197
How do you do the hook?

2000
01:13:42,198 --> 01:13:43,767
- Like this.
- Like this, right?

2001
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:44,838
From here,

2002
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:47,537
you only change the angle.

2003
01:13:47,538 --> 01:13:49,167
(Hook, Uppercut)

2004
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:50,507
In video games,

2005
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:51,807
fighters send their opponents flying like this.

2006
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:53,537
- Exactly.
- They shoot up.

2007
01:13:53,538 --> 01:13:56,507
However, the uppercut...

2008
01:13:56,508 --> 01:13:58,748
must be cut short. Remember the "cut" in uppercut.

2009
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:00,718
- I see.
- Uppercut!

2010
01:14:00,748 --> 01:14:02,487
- Like this?
- With uppercuts,

2011
01:14:02,488 --> 01:14:04,757
you never throw your arm up like so.

2012
01:14:04,758 --> 01:14:06,258
- Right here instead?
- The punch stays at your eyes.

2013
01:14:06,688 --> 01:14:08,028
The movement shouldn't be big.

2014
01:14:08,388 --> 01:14:10,027
After throwing some jabs,

2015
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,028
you go one, two, cut!

2016
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,598
From here. Cut it right here.

2017
01:14:12,758 --> 01:14:14,628
He makes it look good while we look foolish.

2018
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:16,867
One, two, cut. Like that.

2019
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:18,367
- One, two, cut. Like that.
- That's so cool.

2020
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:19,997
- He's so cool.
- Cut!

2021
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,308
(Hearing how he looks good makes him continue.)

2022
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:23,808
Enough!

2023
01:14:24,578 --> 01:14:26,277
- Coach, enough.
- It's not that.

2024
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:27,838
I was only demonstrating.

2025
01:14:27,978 --> 01:14:31,048
I didn't think you'd get it without a demonstration.

2026
01:14:31,478 --> 01:14:32,817
- Coach, I have a question.
- Yes.

2027
01:14:32,818 --> 01:14:36,248
Do you throw uppercuts when the opponent is close?

2028
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:39,258
Yes, that's when you usually strike.

2029
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:40,588
- Yes.
- The uppercut?

2030
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:41,887
You use it when the opponent is close.

2031
01:14:41,888 --> 01:14:43,387
The uppercut alone...

2032
01:14:43,388 --> 01:14:44,897
won't knock out your opponent.

2033
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,457
You add them to your punch combos,

2034
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,097
and mix them up...

2035
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:49,567
with the hook and uppercut...

2036
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:50,898
to strike your opponent.

2037
01:14:51,298 --> 01:14:52,867
You try to trick them...

2038
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:54,197
- and then hook.
- That's it.

2039
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,208
Or you can use hooks to trick them and land an uppercut.

2040
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,208
This is how it's done.

2041
01:14:58,638 --> 01:15:00,877
Here. Jab.

2042
01:15:00,878 --> 01:15:02,508
- One, two.
- One, two.

2043
01:15:03,178 --> 01:15:04,408
- Upper.
- Upper.

2044
01:15:05,318 --> 01:15:06,417
Hook.

2045
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:07,548
- Hook.
- Hook.

2046
01:15:07,848 --> 01:15:09,417
Backstep, one, two.

2047
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:10,717
- Backstep, one, two.
- That's routine...

2048
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:12,117
- number four.
- One, two, upper, hook,

2049
01:15:12,118 --> 01:15:13,557
- Remember that.
- backstep, one, two.

2050
01:15:13,558 --> 01:15:14,788
- There's so much to memorize...
- That's number four.

2051
01:15:15,088 --> 01:15:16,088
- in boxing.
- Okay.

2052
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:17,828
Jab.

2053
01:15:17,858 --> 01:15:19,357
- One, two, - One, two,

2054
01:15:19,358 --> 01:15:21,297
- upper.
- Upper, hook.

2055
01:15:21,298 --> 01:15:22,768
- One, two.
- Upper.

2056
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:24,067
Where do I place the other arm?

2057
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:25,368
Right here. Stick it close to you.

2058
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,437
(The new routine confuses them.)

2059
01:15:27,438 --> 01:15:28,467
- Upper?
- That's it.

2060
01:15:28,468 --> 01:15:30,107
One, two, upper,

2061
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,238
- hook.
- This is getting in the way.

2062
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:33,477
- Upper, hook.
- One, two,

2063
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:35,108
Your hand is coming down too much.

2064
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:37,078
Again.

2065
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,918
Backstep. No.

2066
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:40,378
Jab. No.

2067
01:15:41,588 --> 01:15:44,247
- Jab. One, two, upper.
- Stop.

2068
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,358
Why?

2069
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:46,858
Do "one, two" again.

2070
01:15:47,088 --> 01:15:48,528
One, two, upper.

2071
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:49,728
You saw that, right?

2072
01:15:50,228 --> 01:15:52,498
You did, right? When she did "one, two,"

2073
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:53,727
her hand came down here like taekwondo.

2074
01:15:53,728 --> 01:15:54,828
Where?

2075
01:15:56,228 --> 01:15:58,567
(Her guard is wide open.)

2076
01:15:58,568 --> 01:15:59,767
- At "two." - One, two.

2077
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:02,838
Yes. Your hand needs to be up here.

2078
01:16:02,968 --> 01:16:05,177
- How cute.
- Your hand should be here.

2079
01:16:05,178 --> 01:16:06,907
- One.
- One, two.

2080
01:16:06,908 --> 01:16:08,908
That's it. Upper. Do the next move from here.

2081
01:16:09,808 --> 01:16:10,948
- Like this?
- No.

2082
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:14,118
How? Don't I have to go down first, then up?

2083
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:16,588
Here's how the angle works.

2084
01:16:16,688 --> 01:16:17,718
Like this.

2085
01:16:18,218 --> 01:16:20,018
- It's quick.
- One, two. Like this?

2086
01:16:20,418 --> 01:16:23,157
It's really quick. Only the angle has changed.

2087
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:25,628
- It's confusing.
- But your hand ends up down here.

2088
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:28,567
Good. Keep it up.

2089
01:16:28,568 --> 01:16:30,127
- Your other hand...
- Upper, hook.

2090
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:32,968
That's it. Your other hand must always be guarding.

2091
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:34,337
- Upper, hook.
- Good.

2092
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:35,937
Don't forget about your other hand.

2093
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:37,037
- Okay.
- Okay.

2094
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:39,507
Now then, let's do round 1 of routine 4.

2095
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:40,578
- Get ready.
- Okay.

2096
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:43,647
Coach, can I skip the footwork part of this practice?

2097
01:16:43,648 --> 01:16:44,777
- Sure.
- It hurts too much.

2098
01:16:44,778 --> 01:16:46,878
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

2099
01:16:46,948 --> 01:16:48,048
Your knee isn't well.

2100
01:16:48,348 --> 01:16:50,247
Ready? Go.

2101
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:54,458
(Starting round 1 of routine 4)

2102
01:16:54,658 --> 01:16:56,927
Jab. One, two.

2103
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:58,927
upper, hook, backstep, one, two.

2104
01:16:58,928 --> 01:17:00,498
(I'm watching you.)

2105
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:03,068
(Her arm is down again.)

2106
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,867
(Covering her mistake with her spirit)

2107
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:07,297
- Two.
- How many times did I tell you...

2108
01:17:07,298 --> 01:17:09,407
to keep your arm up?

2109
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:10,467
What did you do?

2110
01:17:10,468 --> 01:17:13,708
(A burst of insanity)

2111
01:17:14,948 --> 01:17:17,108
(Focusing again after coming to her senses)

2112
01:17:17,978 --> 01:17:19,247
(It's only their 2nd lesson,)

2113
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:21,447
(but they're already comfortable with the moves.)

2114
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:22,688
Nice, Uie.

2115
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:28,228
Nice, Sae Rok.

2116
01:17:28,788 --> 01:17:29,827
That's it.

2117
01:17:29,828 --> 01:17:31,228
(She has the eyes of a boxer.)

2118
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,027
(The end of round 1 of routine 4)

2119
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:35,168
Okay. Good job.

2120
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,827
This time, let's do routine five.

2121
01:17:37,828 --> 01:17:39,237
- We're going really fast.
- Yes.

2122
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,567
Routine 5 is Jab. One, two,

2123
01:17:42,568 --> 01:17:45,907
- upper, hook, backstep, one, two.
- Upper, hook, backstep, one, two.

2124
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:47,837
- Upper, hook, backstep, one, two?
- Yes.

2125
01:17:47,838 --> 01:17:49,377
- So...
- This one is confusing.

2126
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:50,748
(The routine is getting longer and longer.)

2127
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:53,117
(They practice right away.)

2128
01:17:53,118 --> 01:17:54,217
Upper.

2129
01:17:54,218 --> 01:17:55,448
(Oh, my.)

2130
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:57,248
It got mixed up.

2131
01:17:58,318 --> 01:18:00,587
She's acting cute when we're boxing.

2132
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:04,288
No. I should always keep my hands here.

2133
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:06,558
From today on, sleep like this.

2134
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:08,398
- Keep them here.
- That's going to be cute.

2135
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:11,637
One, two, upper, upper, hook, backstep, one, two.

2136
01:18:11,638 --> 01:18:12,638
- That's it.
- I did it, right?

2137
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:13,667
- Good job.
- Yes.

2138
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:14,867
- Great job.
- Nice.

2139
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:16,037
- She fixed it right away.
- Upper, hook.

2140
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:17,067
(Her confidence is back.)

2141
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:18,377
- Yes.
- Look at her eyes.

2142
01:18:18,378 --> 01:18:19,737
- That's it.
- Did you kill someone?

2143
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:21,878
(Gwang Bok, the mad boxer)

2144
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:26,517
- How cute.
- She's hilarious.

2145
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:27,678
How are you so adorable?

2146
01:18:27,718 --> 01:18:30,217
I want Ju Hyun to show off her charming showmanship,

2147
01:18:30,218 --> 01:18:32,158
- Yes?
- even in the boxing ring.

2148
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,757
But once she lets her guard down,

2149
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:37,928
it becomes the opponent's moment to shine.

2150
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:40,228
- Keep them up.
- Okay.

2151
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:43,068
Coach, should my bottom be hurting and not my back?

2152
01:18:43,228 --> 01:18:46,197
The pain in your bottom means you're using your back well.

2153
01:18:46,198 --> 01:18:48,268
- Okay.
- You're doing well.

2154
01:18:50,008 --> 01:18:52,637
(She's twisting her back well with strength.)

2155
01:18:52,638 --> 01:18:53,838
Yes. That's it.

2156
01:18:54,038 --> 01:18:55,447
I want to do the uppercut.

2157
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:58,047
- We're using your backs, right?
- Yes.

2158
01:18:58,048 --> 01:19:00,347
In the end, you're landing a powerful punch with it.

2159
01:19:00,348 --> 01:19:03,117
Always put some power into every move.

2160
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,817
Why are we practicing this?

2161
01:19:04,818 --> 01:19:06,957
Your opponent is not a sandbag.

2162
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:08,358
They keep moving.

2163
01:19:08,488 --> 01:19:10,457
Their face might be here, there,

2164
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,227
or suddenly over there.

2165
01:19:12,228 --> 01:19:14,427
Keep your moves short and sharp.

2166
01:19:14,428 --> 01:19:16,898
Always keep them short and sharp.

2167
01:19:16,998 --> 01:19:17,998
(Impressed)

2168
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:19,497
(Impressed)

2169
01:19:19,498 --> 01:19:22,607
Short and sharp.

2170
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:25,677
(The mad boxer's popping)

2171
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,477
We're practicing how to be short and sharp.

2172
01:19:27,478 --> 01:19:29,607
Duck, hit.

2173
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:30,648
(A sudden dance battle)

2174
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:32,478
Someone is excited.

2175
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:36,848
(I always do boxing dancing.)

2176
01:19:37,288 --> 01:19:40,058
Now, here comes the long-awaited dodging technique.

2177
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:41,687
- Ducking. Weaving.
- Weaving.

2178
01:19:41,688 --> 01:19:43,158
- Let's learn them.
- Ducking.

2179
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,098
- Try to dodge my fist.
- Okay.

2180
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:46,397
It's an actual match.

2181
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:47,398
(Eyes wide open to dodge)

2182
01:19:48,928 --> 01:19:51,468
(Closing her eyes instead of dodging)

2183
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:52,798
(Embarrassed)

2184
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:53,968
Is that how I taught you?

2185
01:19:54,268 --> 01:19:55,367
- No.
- Keep your guard up.

2186
01:19:55,368 --> 01:19:56,368
(What about Simba Seol?)

2187
01:19:56,369 --> 01:19:57,808
(Scared)

2188
01:19:58,708 --> 01:19:59,907
(Even the ace gets frightened.)

2189
01:19:59,908 --> 01:20:00,908
She's like a puppy.

2190
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:03,678
What if I fail to dodge and get hit?

2191
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:04,777
(Grabbing)

2192
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:07,148
- Don't grab my hand.
- You'll make his heart pound.

2193
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:08,317
(Dodging as much as she can)

2194
01:20:08,318 --> 01:20:09,918
- She's good.
- Right?

2195
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:11,658
She always keeps her eyes on you.

2196
01:20:13,358 --> 01:20:14,387
(Gwang Bok is back.)

2197
01:20:14,388 --> 01:20:16,228
(Stepping backwards)

2198
01:20:16,788 --> 01:20:18,998
- You're good.
- She doesn't avert her eyes.

2199
01:20:19,028 --> 01:20:21,727
(How will Sae Rok dodge the punches?)

2200
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:22,728
What's that?

2201
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:23,728
(Dodging to the side)

2202
01:20:23,798 --> 01:20:25,837
Not bad. As you saw,

2203
01:20:25,838 --> 01:20:27,638
Sae Rok dodged to the sides.

2204
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,267
That's what ducking is.

2205
01:20:29,268 --> 01:20:30,608
- Like this?
- Yes.

2206
01:20:30,938 --> 01:20:32,638
Dodging to the sides is ducking.

2207
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:36,107
(The technique Captain Kim demonstrated)

2208
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,478
(Dodging)

2209
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:39,317
(Dodging technique 1: Ducking)

2210
01:20:39,318 --> 01:20:41,047
(Avoiding the attack by dropping the body with bent knees)

2211
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:42,888
Is it "the king?"

2212
01:20:42,988 --> 01:20:44,487
Ducking, as in duck.

2213
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:46,058
- Ducking?
- Yes, ducking.

2214
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,958
It's from how ducks move from side to side,

2215
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:50,857
hence why it's called "ducking."

2216
01:20:50,858 --> 01:20:53,858
- One. Two.
- One. Two.

2217
01:20:54,258 --> 01:20:56,497
Everyone has had twisted breadsticks before, right?

2218
01:20:56,498 --> 01:20:58,598
- Yes.
- Imagine the twist...

2219
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:01,138
in the breadstick.

2220
01:21:01,438 --> 01:21:02,807
And twist your body like this.

2221
01:21:02,808 --> 01:21:03,808
(Twisting while lowering the torso)

2222
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:05,678
- You mean the body?
- Yes.

2223
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:08,678
The basic principle of ducking is...

2224
01:21:08,848 --> 01:21:11,007
to duck toward the side you're punching.

2225
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:12,847
Pull back in the direction you punched.

2226
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:14,247
- Pull back...
- Pull back?

2227
01:21:14,248 --> 01:21:16,088
Pull back in the direction I punched.

2228
01:21:16,248 --> 01:21:17,688
Do a jab.

2229
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:19,417
- How will you... Jab.
- Jab.

2230
01:21:19,418 --> 01:21:20,658
How will you pull your jab back?

2231
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:23,358
- Like this.
- Yes. That's it.

2232
01:21:23,488 --> 01:21:24,928
Here's something important.

2233
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:28,058
Keep your eyes on your opponent like so.

2234
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:31,468
When you get the chance, attack right away.

2235
01:21:32,038 --> 01:21:34,537
It's defined as a dodging technique.

2236
01:21:34,538 --> 01:21:37,507
But I describe it as an attack technique.

2237
01:21:37,508 --> 01:21:39,607
- So you dodge, then strike?
- You dodge, then strike.

2238
01:21:39,608 --> 01:21:41,537
Is this how you throw a punch? An uppercut?

2239
01:21:41,538 --> 01:21:43,547
Yes. After ducking,

2240
01:21:43,548 --> 01:21:45,577
- Attack?
- you must throw a punch.

2241
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:47,047
- Okay.
- Got it?

2242
01:21:47,048 --> 01:21:48,748
Keep that in mind as you learn it.

2243
01:21:48,848 --> 01:21:50,648
Have you heard of "slide and hit?"

2244
01:21:51,148 --> 01:21:53,787
- Slide and hit.
- Does that term actually exist?

2245
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:54,818
- Slide and hit?
- Yes.

2246
01:21:55,088 --> 01:21:56,528
(Slide and hit)

2247
01:21:57,088 --> 01:21:59,428
(Slide and hit, the boxer's greatest concern)

2248
01:21:59,558 --> 01:22:01,768
What people usually call "slide and hit..."

2249
01:22:01,798 --> 01:22:03,267
is a duck followed by two.

2250
01:22:03,268 --> 01:22:04,567
- I see.
- Watch me.

2251
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:05,998
One, two, and then...

2252
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,268
bend your knees a little to dodge.

2253
01:22:08,568 --> 01:22:10,568
After that, throw a punch like a spring.

2254
01:22:11,608 --> 01:22:13,277
(Punching using the back)

2255
01:22:13,278 --> 01:22:14,538
The back bounces back.

2256
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:18,047
We must practice ducking...

2257
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:19,747
and come up with combination moves.

2258
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:20,977
- This is routine six.
- Okay.

2259
01:22:20,978 --> 01:22:22,218
- Routine six.
- Correct.

2260
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:25,357
Jab. One, two,

2261
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:29,188
hook, two, slide, hit, backstep, one, two.

2262
01:22:29,228 --> 01:22:30,658
- Slide, hit, backstep, one, two.
- Yes.

2263
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:32,527
Get ready.

2264
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:34,057
(Starting round 1 of routine 6)

2265
01:22:34,058 --> 01:22:36,427
- Jab. One, two, - One, two.

2266
01:22:36,428 --> 01:22:39,268
hook, two, slide, hit, backstep, one, two.

2267
01:22:40,098 --> 01:22:43,838
(Perfectly in sync)

2268
01:22:45,438 --> 01:22:50,008
(They're already used to the increased difficulty.)

2269
01:22:50,848 --> 01:22:55,318
(Imagining the opponent she will face one day)

2270
01:22:56,988 --> 01:23:01,758
(Throwing fierce punches)

2271
01:23:03,188 --> 01:23:05,358
You're all doing a great job.

2272
01:23:05,798 --> 01:23:07,427
(Gritting their teeth and pushing through to the end)

2273
01:23:07,428 --> 01:23:09,068
You're almost done.

2274
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,068
Good. Well done.

2275
01:23:11,368 --> 01:23:12,737
- It hurts.
- Great job.

2276
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:13,738
(Completely exhausted)

2277
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:16,168
Good work.

2278
01:23:17,268 --> 01:23:18,537
(Catching their breath)

2279
01:23:18,538 --> 01:23:19,538
I'm tearing up.

2280
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:21,908
Okay. Here's the second dodging technique.

2281
01:23:22,108 --> 01:23:23,478
- Weaving.
- Weaving.

2282
01:23:24,008 --> 01:23:26,118
- Weaving.
- I wanted to learn it.

2283
01:23:26,578 --> 01:23:29,488
Weaving is when you draw the letter "U."

2284
01:23:29,548 --> 01:23:32,118
The move is bigger than ducking.

2285
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:36,628
This is how you weave.

2286
01:23:37,228 --> 01:23:40,958
It's the same. Bring your shoulder to this side slowly.

2287
01:23:41,298 --> 01:23:44,467
And then bring the other shoulder to the other side slowly.

2288
01:23:44,468 --> 01:23:47,068
Raise your eyes more like this.

2289
01:23:47,568 --> 01:23:48,868
Good. Like that.

2290
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:52,108
You're to use your knees. Mainly use your knees.

2291
01:23:52,338 --> 01:23:55,347
Watch my knees. One, two. Like so.

2292
01:23:55,348 --> 01:23:56,647
(The basic move of weaving:)

2293
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:58,548
(Bend your knees and lightly squat up and down)

2294
01:23:59,178 --> 01:24:02,287
(Moving the upper body from side to side with bent knees)

2295
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:03,887
Let me show you weaving...

2296
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:05,187
and ducking.

2297
01:24:05,188 --> 01:24:07,158
How did we duck earlier?

2298
01:24:07,258 --> 01:24:09,688
- Like this, right?
- Yes.

2299
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:13,198
As for weaving, it's like this.

2300
01:24:14,558 --> 01:24:17,098
(Ducking moves are short and fast.)

2301
01:24:17,298 --> 01:24:18,537
Here's weaving.

2302
01:24:18,538 --> 01:24:20,198
(Weaving moves are long and big.)

2303
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:23,408
(Ducking)

2304
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:24,507
Here's weaving.

2305
01:24:24,508 --> 01:24:25,978
(Weaving)

2306
01:24:26,508 --> 01:24:27,508
Use your feet.

2307
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:29,648
(Getting absorbed)

2308
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:31,877
(Hitting)

2309
01:24:31,878 --> 01:24:33,048
- Here he goes again.
- Weaving.

2310
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:34,777
He's at it again.

2311
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:37,147
- The invisible battle.
- Weaving.

2312
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:39,557
I bet you could turn that into choreography.

2313
01:24:39,558 --> 01:24:40,887
- Ducking.
- Don't stop him.

2314
01:24:40,888 --> 01:24:42,328
- Let's see how far he'll go.
- Okay.

2315
01:24:43,488 --> 01:24:45,058
(Oh, right.)

2316
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:46,558
(Laughing)

2317
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:47,697
- You get it, right?
- Yes.

2318
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:49,827
You must know for sure that...

2319
01:24:49,828 --> 01:24:51,897
weaving and ducking are different.

2320
01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:53,067
- Okay.
- Okay.

2321
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:54,138
All right.

2322
01:24:54,398 --> 01:24:56,767
Let's get a clothesline ready.

2323
01:24:56,768 --> 01:24:57,938
- What?
- Sorry?

2324
01:25:00,338 --> 01:25:02,248
- I'll make the training fun.
- Okay.

2325
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:05,318
We'll use the clothesline to learn weaving.

2326
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:07,648
You can try it...

2327
01:25:08,248 --> 01:25:09,547
at home.

2328
01:25:09,548 --> 01:25:10,717
Who keeps a clothesline at home these days?

2329
01:25:10,718 --> 01:25:12,088
I don't have one.

2330
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,088
Isn't it used in a yard?

2331
01:25:14,388 --> 01:25:16,028
True, but do buy one.

2332
01:25:16,228 --> 01:25:18,258
Hang it up at home and practice.

2333
01:25:18,598 --> 01:25:20,258
- Okay.
- Okay.

2334
01:25:20,758 --> 01:25:24,598
Now then, one, two.

2335
01:25:24,768 --> 01:25:27,138
One, two. Keep going.

2336
01:25:27,298 --> 01:25:29,508
- Gosh.
- How cool.

2337
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,207
- I'm going to add in some footwork.
- Okay.

2338
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,707
How cool.

2339
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,037
(Imagining the clothesline is the punch trajectory)

2340
01:25:35,038 --> 01:25:36,147
One, two.

2341
01:25:36,148 --> 01:25:37,807
(Dodging it with weaving)

2342
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:38,878
Like this.

2343
01:25:39,578 --> 01:25:42,017
(A backstep performance)

2344
01:25:42,018 --> 01:25:43,687
- He's at it again.
- Hit. Like so.

2345
01:25:43,688 --> 01:25:44,987
- Here we go.
- Hit.

2346
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:46,157
He always ends with a hit.

2347
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:48,018
It's become a habit.

2348
01:25:48,058 --> 01:25:50,428
- Shall we each try it out?
- Yes.

2349
01:25:50,488 --> 01:25:51,557
Go slowly.

2350
01:25:51,558 --> 01:25:53,728
- So I weave through?
- Like this?

2351
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:55,098
It's the same footstep.

2352
01:25:55,368 --> 01:25:56,468
- To the side.
- Like this.

2353
01:25:57,168 --> 01:25:58,567
- Like this.
- Yes.

2354
01:25:58,568 --> 01:25:59,968
- Like this.
- That's it.

2355
01:26:00,038 --> 01:26:01,397
- Like this.
- Good.

2356
01:26:01,398 --> 01:26:02,667
- Like this.
- Stop.

2357
01:26:02,668 --> 01:26:05,478
This is you right now, In Ah.

2358
01:26:05,938 --> 01:26:07,907
(It's only her neck that's moving.)

2359
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,778
- Is her neck moving?
- Don't move your neck.

2360
01:26:10,378 --> 01:26:11,907
You must move your whole body.

2361
01:26:11,908 --> 01:26:13,818
(Her head and torso must move together.)

2362
01:26:14,548 --> 01:26:18,218
(Her head and torso are moving separately.)

2363
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:20,787
- Isolation?
- I just did isolation.

2364
01:26:20,788 --> 01:26:22,758
Don't do that.

2365
01:26:23,388 --> 01:26:25,044
Yes. That's how you move.

2366
01:26:25,128 --> 01:26:27,758
- Like this.
- Yes. Good.

2367
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:30,297
Keep moving. Yes.

2368
01:26:30,298 --> 01:26:31,668
Keep going.

2369
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:33,468
Good. Well done.

2370
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:34,998
This time,

2371
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:37,708
you are to throw a punch each time.

2372
01:26:38,008 --> 01:26:39,077
- Sorry?
- Yes.

2373
01:26:39,078 --> 01:26:40,137
Do a hook.

2374
01:26:40,138 --> 01:26:41,307
- A hook?
- Yes.

2375
01:26:41,308 --> 01:26:42,647
A hook after a weave?

2376
01:26:42,648 --> 01:26:44,447
Yes. Watch my demonstration.

2377
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:49,147
To the side and hit.

2378
01:26:49,148 --> 01:26:50,888
Move to the side, then hit.

2379
01:26:51,188 --> 01:26:52,888
Hit, then move to the side.

2380
01:26:54,258 --> 01:26:55,258
And hit.

2381
01:26:56,588 --> 01:26:58,088
Side, and a right hook.

2382
01:26:58,428 --> 01:27:00,097
Side. Go diagonally.

2383
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:01,328
Left hook. Hit.

2384
01:27:01,528 --> 01:27:02,568
Side.

2385
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:04,297
(Slowly but accurately connecting the moves)

2386
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:06,268
When I slide over, I just stand up.

2387
01:27:06,968 --> 01:27:08,497
Hit. Slide.

2388
01:27:08,498 --> 01:27:09,937
Hit. That's it.

2389
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:11,337
(Simba Seol copies the moves easily.)

2390
01:27:11,338 --> 01:27:12,608
Yes.

2391
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:14,837
- It's confusing.
- That's it.

2392
01:27:14,838 --> 01:27:15,878
Like that.

2393
01:27:16,008 --> 01:27:17,077
Hit. Diagonally.

2394
01:27:17,078 --> 01:27:18,447
Slide and hit.

2395
01:27:18,448 --> 01:27:19,617
Yes. Just like that.

2396
01:27:19,618 --> 01:27:20,948
Twist your back.

2397
01:27:21,648 --> 01:27:23,518
Slide and hit. Nice.

2398
01:27:23,848 --> 01:27:25,017
You're doing well.

2399
01:27:25,018 --> 01:27:27,017
(How's Ju Hyun's posture?)

2400
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:28,758
No. Don't mess up the footsteps.

2401
01:27:29,628 --> 01:27:31,827
- No. Don't mess up the footsteps.
- What?

2402
01:27:31,828 --> 01:27:33,598
- This is what happened.
- How did I mess up?

2403
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:39,197
(The rear foot must step to the side first.)

2404
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,867
(But using her lead foot first messed it up.)

2405
01:27:42,868 --> 01:27:44,707
Come to this side. Watch me as you practice.

2406
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:45,878
Okay, go.

2407
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:48,037
Side. Come in diagonally.

2408
01:27:48,038 --> 01:27:49,548
- "Come in?" - Yes.

2409
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:51,448
Two. Side.

2410
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,047
Two. Side.

2411
01:27:53,048 --> 01:27:54,247
- That's it.
- Got it.

2412
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:55,422
(Her footstep is on point.)

2413
01:27:55,524 --> 01:27:56,389
Okay.

2414
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:57,817
Good.

2415
01:27:57,818 --> 01:27:59,488
That's it. You're doing good.

2416
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:00,687
- Okay.
- Hit.

2417
01:28:00,688 --> 01:28:02,387
- I need a person to train me.
- Yes. Hit.

2418
01:28:02,388 --> 01:28:03,788
(Instead of the clothesline)

2419
01:28:04,258 --> 01:28:07,397
(The footstep comes naturally with an opponent.)

2420
01:28:07,398 --> 01:28:09,927
Your legs should never...

2421
01:28:09,928 --> 01:28:11,997
- cross. Got it?
- Yes.

2422
01:28:11,998 --> 01:28:13,637
With that, you've learned...

2423
01:28:13,638 --> 01:28:15,567
ducking and weaving,

2424
01:28:15,568 --> 01:28:18,937
the dodging and attack techniques.

2425
01:28:18,938 --> 01:28:20,677
- We finally learned them.
- And so,

2426
01:28:20,678 --> 01:28:22,307
we'll now hit the mitts.

2427
01:28:22,308 --> 01:28:23,507
(Hitting the mitts with what they've learned)

2428
01:28:23,508 --> 01:28:24,778
We'll use what we've learned.

2429
01:28:24,878 --> 01:28:26,678
Show me the moves I tell you to do.

2430
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:28,648
- Get ready.
- One, two.

2431
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:31,287
Okay. Here we go.

2432
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:32,288
(Hitting the mitts for 3 minutes)

2433
01:28:32,289 --> 01:28:34,057
- You'll each do one round.
- Okay.

2434
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,028
- Good luck.
- Our first boxer.

2435
01:28:36,438 --> 01:28:38,207
Okay. Here we go.

2436
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:39,208
(Hitting the mitts for 3 minutes)

2437
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:41,007
- You'll each do one round.
- Okay.

2438
01:28:41,008 --> 01:28:42,947
- Good luck.
- Our first boxer.

2439
01:28:42,948 --> 01:28:43,620
Park Ju Hyun.

2440
01:28:44,008 --> 01:28:45,078
(The first boxer, Park Ju Hyun)

2441
01:28:45,448 --> 01:28:47,877
(Warming up with on-the-spot footwork)

2442
01:28:47,878 --> 01:28:48,917
- Jab.
- Jab.

2443
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:50,187
- One, two.
- One, two.

2444
01:28:50,188 --> 01:28:51,248
That's it. Move.

2445
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,587
(Even as she's moving,)

2446
01:28:53,588 --> 01:28:54,987
(her guard is up.)

2447
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:56,028
One, two.

2448
01:28:56,128 --> 01:28:57,158
Good.

2449
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:59,027
(Without stopping for even a second,)

2450
01:28:59,028 --> 01:29:00,297
(she takes longer and bigger steps.)

2451
01:29:00,298 --> 01:29:01,298
Move.

2452
01:29:01,928 --> 01:29:03,098
One, two.

2453
01:29:03,268 --> 01:29:06,368
(A tight guard)

2454
01:29:08,268 --> 01:29:11,007
(Unlike 2 weeks ago, her guard is always up.)

2455
01:29:11,008 --> 01:29:12,137
- Your back.
- Nice.

2456
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:13,478
Turn before one, two. Go.

2457
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:14,837
Yes.

2458
01:29:14,838 --> 01:29:15,908
- One, two.
- I'm jealous.

2459
01:29:16,108 --> 01:29:17,108
Jab.

2460
01:29:17,308 --> 01:29:18,447
One, two, hook, two.

2461
01:29:18,448 --> 01:29:19,448
(Hitting)

2462
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:20,547
One, two, hook, two, one, two.

2463
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:22,147
(Her punches have more power in them now.)

2464
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:23,748
Yes. One, two, hook.

2465
01:29:23,888 --> 01:29:25,447
(What about the hook she struggled with?)

2466
01:29:25,448 --> 01:29:26,888
Hit. Yes. Again.

2467
01:29:27,218 --> 01:29:28,457
One, two, hook.

2468
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,488
(Her right hook is on point.)

2469
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,227
(Compared to 2 weeks ago,)

2470
01:29:32,228 --> 01:29:35,228
(her arm turns at an angle.)

2471
01:29:35,258 --> 01:29:36,667
One, two, slide, hit.

2472
01:29:36,668 --> 01:29:37,867
One, two, again.

2473
01:29:37,868 --> 01:29:39,798
(She even perfected slide and hit.)

2474
01:29:40,268 --> 01:29:42,438
(The third boxer, In Ah)

2475
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:45,437
(2 weeks ago, Simba Seol was quick to catch on.)

2476
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:46,778
One, two, upper, hook.

2477
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,907
(Her moves have become quicker.)

2478
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:50,148
Hit, slide.

2479
01:29:50,748 --> 01:29:52,247
(She even picked up the dodging techniques.)

2480
01:29:52,248 --> 01:29:53,347
- Yes.
- Okay.

2481
01:29:53,348 --> 01:29:55,117
- One, two, ducking, one, two. Go.
- Okay.

2482
01:29:55,118 --> 01:29:56,887
One, two, ducking, on-the-spot.

2483
01:29:56,888 --> 01:29:57,987
Ducking, one, two.

2484
01:29:57,988 --> 01:30:01,157
(Perfect execution of advanced techniques)

2485
01:30:01,158 --> 01:30:02,187
That's it.

2486
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:05,528
(What's more, she's moving faster and faster.)

2487
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:08,257
(The last boxer, Keum Sae Rok)

2488
01:30:08,258 --> 01:30:10,267
That was awesome just now. How cool.

2489
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:11,497
One, two, hook, two.

2490
01:30:11,498 --> 01:30:12,837
(She's got good balance and intense punches.)

2491
01:30:12,838 --> 01:30:14,768
Nice. Again.

2492
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,438
Hit.

2493
01:30:16,508 --> 01:30:17,607
And one, two.

2494
01:30:17,608 --> 01:30:18,668
(Her stamina wasn't on par.)

2495
01:30:19,178 --> 01:30:21,007
(However...)

2496
01:30:21,008 --> 01:30:22,037
Good.

2497
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:23,907
Nice.

2498
01:30:23,908 --> 01:30:24,947
(I will not pass out this time.)

2499
01:30:24,948 --> 01:30:27,218
Upper, hook. Nice. Jab.

2500
01:30:27,478 --> 01:30:29,387
(She grits her teeth and lasts for 3 minutes.)

2501
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:31,148
- You can do it.
- One, two.

2502
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:33,357
One, two, backstep, one, two. Again.

2503
01:30:33,358 --> 01:30:34,987
(I won't give up.)

2504
01:30:34,988 --> 01:30:36,087
- Hit. Again.
- You can do it.

2505
01:30:36,088 --> 01:30:37,427
- Hit.
- Okay.

2506
01:30:37,428 --> 01:30:39,627
(She finishes the routine even after the bell rings.)

2507
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:40,628
Good job.

2508
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:42,427
- I didn't do well.
- Great job.

2509
01:30:42,428 --> 01:30:44,168
- Well done.
- You held out well.

2510
01:30:44,798 --> 01:30:45,868
You lasted.

2511
01:30:46,598 --> 01:30:47,667
Great work.

2512
01:30:47,668 --> 01:30:50,408
(Rocky Keum held out until the end.)

2513
01:30:50,868 --> 01:30:52,937
We've learned many techniques...

2514
01:30:52,938 --> 01:30:54,078
and such until now.

2515
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,708
But not once...

2516
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,907
did we fight...

2517
01:30:57,908 --> 01:30:59,117
(Not once did we fight...)

2518
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:00,748
against each other. Right?

2519
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:02,417
(Here it comes.)

2520
01:31:02,418 --> 01:31:04,618
But you must all do it.

2521
01:31:04,888 --> 01:31:07,258
- I guess we must.
- The time has come...

2522
01:31:07,358 --> 01:31:09,328
for you to fight another person.

2523
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:11,758
Say that you must fight someone.

2524
01:31:11,828 --> 01:31:13,598
Do you think you can dodge with your eyes open?

2525
01:31:13,898 --> 01:31:15,837
- No.
- No.

2526
01:31:16,068 --> 01:31:17,997
The moment you see a punch coming,

2527
01:31:17,998 --> 01:31:19,037
you'll flinch.

2528
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:20,168
(Flinching the moment a punch comes in)

2529
01:31:20,298 --> 01:31:22,538
- Right.
- It's a natural response.

2530
01:31:22,738 --> 01:31:24,307
You need training...

2531
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:26,637
that allows you to keep your eyes open...

2532
01:31:26,638 --> 01:31:28,108
and launch a counterattack...

2533
01:31:29,008 --> 01:31:30,447
as soon as a punch comes in.

2534
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:32,417
And it's the promise boxing.

2535
01:31:32,418 --> 01:31:34,217
It's also called method boxing.

2536
01:31:34,218 --> 01:31:37,318
Unlike sparring, where you go all out like a boxing fight,

2537
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:38,848
you make a promise with your partner...

2538
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:41,418
and safely practice attacking and defending.

2539
01:31:42,588 --> 01:31:45,087
(A training session where you get used to boxing...)

2540
01:31:45,088 --> 01:31:48,157
(by blocking punches with your hands and launching counterattacks)

2541
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:49,968
As you're boxing under a promise,

2542
01:31:50,268 --> 01:31:51,697
when you throw punches...

2543
01:31:51,698 --> 01:31:53,167
Throw punches right here.

2544
01:31:53,168 --> 01:31:54,597
- One, two.
- One, two. Like this.

2545
01:31:54,598 --> 01:31:55,837
- Your arm.
- Yes, my arm.

2546
01:31:55,838 --> 01:31:57,967
And just as your opponent throws a punch,

2547
01:31:57,968 --> 01:32:00,178
- defend yourself.
- Okay.

2548
01:32:00,408 --> 01:32:01,637
So keep my guard up,

2549
01:32:01,638 --> 01:32:02,807
- and then defend?
- Exactly.

2550
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:03,977
Defend yourself...

2551
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:05,407
with your lead arm like I just did.

2552
01:32:05,408 --> 01:32:06,877
- Like this?
- Yes.

2553
01:32:06,878 --> 01:32:09,187
Sae Rok and In Ah.

2554
01:32:09,188 --> 01:32:10,417
I'm scared.

2555
01:32:10,418 --> 01:32:11,547
Good luck.

2556
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:14,057
I'm scared. In Ah scares me.

2557
01:32:14,058 --> 01:32:15,688
Sae Rok. Hold out.

2558
01:32:16,288 --> 01:32:18,058
What if Sae Rok becomes a drill instructor again?

2559
01:32:18,758 --> 01:32:19,927
Like this.

2560
01:32:19,928 --> 01:32:21,197
(Great force is what matters in boxing.)

2561
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:23,428
Sae Rok is to start with the punches.

2562
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:24,727
Get ready.

2563
01:32:24,728 --> 01:32:26,867
(The match begins.)

2564
01:32:26,868 --> 01:32:27,938
What...

2565
01:32:29,138 --> 01:32:30,167
(Hitting)

2566
01:32:30,168 --> 01:32:31,207
What...

2567
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,408
(Flinching)

2568
01:32:32,978 --> 01:32:34,008
the...

2569
01:32:34,108 --> 01:32:35,307
Sae Rok is strong.

2570
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:36,377
Why is she so strong?

2571
01:32:36,378 --> 01:32:37,708
- It's your turn now.
- Me?

2572
01:32:38,948 --> 01:32:39,978
(Hitting)

2573
01:32:40,248 --> 01:32:42,117
(Full power punches)

2574
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:43,648
Gosh, this is insane.

2575
01:32:44,018 --> 01:32:45,587
(Heavy hitter Simba Seol)

2576
01:32:45,588 --> 01:32:47,418
(A punch with unmatched power)

2577
01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:50,988
(Sae Rok held out without averting her eyes.)

2578
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,797
You're also strong, Sae Rok.

2579
01:32:53,798 --> 01:32:55,557
She's crazy!

2580
01:32:55,558 --> 01:32:57,227
(The first was light,)

2581
01:32:57,228 --> 01:32:59,968
(while the second was powerful.)

2582
01:33:00,168 --> 01:33:01,938
(Sae Rok doesn't budge at the counterattacks.)

2583
01:33:02,168 --> 01:33:03,237
I'm scared.

2584
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:04,837
(Frightened)

2585
01:33:04,838 --> 01:33:06,007
Good.

2586
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:07,107
(In Ah's weakened punches...)

2587
01:33:07,108 --> 01:33:08,138
(make Sae Rok's stronger.)

2588
01:33:08,908 --> 01:33:12,878
(Staggering)

2589
01:33:13,178 --> 01:33:14,978
I've been overpowered. My pride hurts.

2590
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:16,748
Gosh.

2591
01:33:17,488 --> 01:33:18,647
(Staggering)

2592
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:19,658
Goodness.

2593
01:33:19,818 --> 01:33:20,958
The impact is...

2594
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:23,058
I can feel it in my chest.

2595
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:25,087
(Her eyes change the moment she finishes speaking.)

2596
01:33:25,088 --> 01:33:26,298
Really.

2597
01:33:27,058 --> 01:33:29,227
(Her punches become stronger with time.)

2598
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:30,868
It hurts too much. Hold on.

2599
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,197
Imagine getting hit on the face.

2600
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:35,067
It'll hurt like crazy. The arm is a better sandbag.

2601
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,908
Pull yourself together and see through it.

2602
01:33:37,668 --> 01:33:39,107
Yes, 30 seconds.

2603
01:33:39,108 --> 01:33:40,777
- You have 30 seconds left.
- Yes.

2604
01:33:40,778 --> 01:33:42,647
(In a predictable situation)

2605
01:33:42,648 --> 01:33:44,278
Whose hand will the judge...

2606
01:33:44,408 --> 01:33:46,217
hold up after 30 seconds?

2607
01:33:46,218 --> 01:33:47,748
Yes. Nice. The last punches.

2608
01:33:48,518 --> 01:33:50,188
- Keum Sae Rok versus Seol In Ah.
- Five seconds.

2609
01:33:50,218 --> 01:33:52,147
Keep going. That's it.

2610
01:33:52,148 --> 01:33:53,818
- It's a tight match.
- Yes.

2611
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:56,558
Okay.

2612
01:33:57,128 --> 01:33:58,688
You're really strong, Sae Rok.

2613
01:33:59,088 --> 01:34:00,628
- Sae Rok is...
- It was a good game.

2614
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:02,157
- Sae Rok...
- She's...

2615
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:04,097
has strength from her reach.

2616
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:05,968
You two were great. Well done.

2617
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:07,998
She's a strong girl.

2618
01:34:08,168 --> 01:34:10,807
- Sae Rok uses her back well.
- I was shocked.

2619
01:34:10,808 --> 01:34:12,638
After her jabs, I thought,

2620
01:34:13,178 --> 01:34:14,207
"Not bad."

2621
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,737
And she was like, "Not bad?"

2622
01:34:15,738 --> 01:34:17,107
"What about this?"

2623
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:18,307
That was how I felt.

2624
01:34:18,308 --> 01:34:20,648
That means she's good at controlling her strength.

2625
01:34:21,248 --> 01:34:23,287
When you throw punches in one, two,

2626
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:25,087
the key is two.

2627
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:27,017
The last punch is always the key.

2628
01:34:27,018 --> 01:34:28,517
What if it's one, two, hook, upper?

2629
01:34:28,518 --> 01:34:30,588
- Upper.
- Yes. That's how it is.

2630
01:34:30,758 --> 01:34:33,228
What you did just now was promise boxing.

2631
01:34:33,328 --> 01:34:35,428
Since it's boxing under an agreement...

2632
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:36,797
Right.

2633
01:34:36,798 --> 01:34:38,668
(Pulling up)

2634
01:34:38,768 --> 01:34:41,068
- Right.
- The hat was in my eyes.

2635
01:34:41,398 --> 01:34:43,438
Since it was boxing under an agreement until now,

2636
01:34:43,838 --> 01:34:46,877
we could control our strengths.

2637
01:34:46,878 --> 01:34:48,837
But in a real boxing game, that doesn't happen.

2638
01:34:48,838 --> 01:34:51,107
You've experienced what it feels like.

2639
01:34:51,108 --> 01:34:52,108
- Good job.
- Yes.

2640
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:53,418
- Okay.
- Now, the second round.

2641
01:34:53,548 --> 01:34:55,647
Uie and Ju Hyun.

2642
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:56,918
(Park Gwang Bok versus Captain U)

2643
01:34:57,118 --> 01:34:58,717
Ju Hyun. Hit Uie's...

2644
01:34:58,718 --> 01:35:00,017
- lead arm.
- Okay.

2645
01:35:00,018 --> 01:35:02,057
Don't you dare hit somewhere else.

2646
01:35:02,058 --> 01:35:04,358
- I won't.
- Hit her lead arm.

2647
01:35:04,728 --> 01:35:07,928
(The match begins.)

2648
01:35:08,428 --> 01:35:10,867
(Ju Hyun goes first. The first punches are light.)

2649
01:35:10,868 --> 01:35:12,298
(Flinching)

2650
01:35:12,768 --> 01:35:14,967
- Is it me or you?
- It's you.

2651
01:35:14,968 --> 01:35:17,308
(Hitting)

2652
01:35:17,468 --> 01:35:19,168
Uie is super strong.

2653
01:35:19,408 --> 01:35:21,007
One, two, three, four.

2654
01:35:21,008 --> 01:35:22,078
She's really strong.

2655
01:35:23,248 --> 01:35:24,548
Hold on.

2656
01:35:25,508 --> 01:35:26,977
(Ju Hyun was going easy on her.)

2657
01:35:26,978 --> 01:35:28,517
Uie lost balance.

2658
01:35:28,518 --> 01:35:29,688
- It's okay.
- All right.

2659
01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:31,818
(Hitting)

2660
01:35:31,818 --> 01:35:32,818
Good.

2661
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:35,688
(Unaffected)

2662
01:35:36,358 --> 01:35:37,527
(Each punch is heavy.)

2663
01:35:37,528 --> 01:35:38,528
Nice.

2664
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:40,198
(Flinching)

2665
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:41,797
Don't close your eyes.

2666
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:43,298
Look at her with her eyes wide open.

2667
01:35:44,098 --> 01:35:45,427
Ju Hyun is amazing.

2668
01:35:45,428 --> 01:35:46,667
(The more Uie attacks, the more energetic she becomes.)

2669
01:35:46,668 --> 01:35:47,698
Yes.

2670
01:35:49,438 --> 01:35:51,407
(I'm scared.)

2671
01:35:51,408 --> 01:35:53,008
Yours hurt more.

2672
01:35:53,478 --> 01:35:54,537
(The 3 minutes feel really long.)

2673
01:35:54,538 --> 01:35:55,738
Are we not done yet?

2674
01:35:55,948 --> 01:35:57,478
Hit as you do the footwork.

2675
01:35:57,948 --> 01:35:59,548
- Here.
- Gosh.

2676
01:35:59,648 --> 01:36:01,147
(She's become faster and stronger.)

2677
01:36:01,148 --> 01:36:02,688
- Ju Hyun is fast.
- Good one.

2678
01:36:03,188 --> 01:36:04,188
(A fake move)

2679
01:36:04,788 --> 01:36:05,788
(A fake move)

2680
01:36:06,258 --> 01:36:08,858
(Uie's strategy is to throw a sudden punch after a fake move.)

2681
01:36:09,288 --> 01:36:11,528
(How dare you fool me?)

2682
01:36:11,858 --> 01:36:14,298
(A full power counterattack)

2683
01:36:14,598 --> 01:36:15,997
(Watching them up close is fun.)

2684
01:36:15,998 --> 01:36:17,427
Park Ju Hyun!

2685
01:36:17,428 --> 01:36:19,337
- She's no joke.
- No, she's not.

2686
01:36:19,338 --> 01:36:20,868
You two. Make or break.

2687
01:36:21,098 --> 01:36:23,067
(Make or break)

2688
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:24,108
That's it.

2689
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:26,877
(They go all out like it's an actual fight.)

2690
01:36:26,878 --> 01:36:28,437
What? They're both really good.

2691
01:36:28,438 --> 01:36:29,878
(They go all out like it's an actual fight.)

2692
01:36:30,108 --> 01:36:32,008
(The game is over.)

2693
01:36:32,848 --> 01:36:34,118
- Nice. Good job.
- Okay.

2694
01:36:34,318 --> 01:36:35,677
It was a good game.

2695
01:36:35,678 --> 01:36:37,188
(The two saw it through the end.)

2696
01:36:37,448 --> 01:36:39,487
They were a lot better than I thought.

2697
01:36:39,488 --> 01:36:41,717
Park Ju Hyun. You were incredible.

2698
01:36:41,718 --> 01:36:42,927
We won't dodge now.

2699
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:44,558
(Let me show you again.)

2700
01:36:44,688 --> 01:36:46,057
She's like a Chihuahua.

2701
01:36:46,058 --> 01:36:47,528
We have a Chihuahua here.

2702
01:36:49,028 --> 01:36:50,598
(Laughing)

2703
01:36:51,268 --> 01:36:52,327
It's fun.

2704
01:36:52,328 --> 01:36:53,837
(Calm down.)

2705
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:55,597
- It's fun.
- Please show us...

2706
01:36:55,598 --> 01:36:57,607
such spirit in the boxing ring.

2707
01:36:57,608 --> 01:36:58,837
- Okay? Good.
- Got it.

2708
01:36:58,838 --> 01:37:01,835
Getting punched for the first time was scary.

2709
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:04,477
But once I got used to it,

2710
01:37:04,478 --> 01:37:05,848
I stopped closing my eyes.

2711
01:37:06,778 --> 01:37:11,247
(The Herbivore used to shut her eyes.)

2712
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:14,818
(After exchanging some punches,)

2713
01:37:15,158 --> 01:37:17,658
(her eyes are kept wide open.)

2714
01:37:17,828 --> 01:37:19,697
You feel the threat, right?

2715
01:37:19,698 --> 01:37:21,227
- Yes.
- You do, right?

2716
01:37:21,228 --> 01:37:24,497
- Since we're moving in baby steps, - Right?

2717
01:37:24,498 --> 01:37:27,497
the further we go, the less it will feel...

2718
01:37:27,498 --> 01:37:29,407
intimidating in the end. You did well.

2719
01:37:29,408 --> 01:37:31,308
Now then, don't take it off.

2720
01:37:31,608 --> 01:37:32,855
Keep your gloves on.

2721
01:37:33,138 --> 01:37:34,538
Go to your sandbags.

2722
01:37:34,938 --> 01:37:35,938
What?

2723
01:37:36,508 --> 01:37:38,547
Hit the sandbag for three minutes.

2724
01:37:38,548 --> 01:37:39,578
Watch me.

2725
01:37:39,948 --> 01:37:41,078
It's a core workout.

2726
01:37:41,178 --> 01:37:43,117
Hit it like this. Got it?

2727
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:44,547
- Yes.
- Our goal...

2728
01:37:44,548 --> 01:37:47,458
is to last for three minutes.

2729
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:50,558
Hold out 3 minutes, and you can hold out 1 minute and 30 seconds.

2730
01:37:50,658 --> 01:37:53,158
Let's drain all your energy out.

2731
01:37:53,428 --> 01:37:54,458
Start.

2732
01:37:56,928 --> 01:37:58,128
Bring your guards up.

2733
01:37:58,968 --> 01:38:00,798
Good. Pull your chin down.

2734
01:38:01,038 --> 01:38:02,967
In Ah is doing great. The textbook move.

2735
01:38:02,968 --> 01:38:05,268
(The quick and exact textbook move of burning energy)

2736
01:38:06,038 --> 01:38:08,708
(The perfect stamina, no less than In Ah's)

2737
01:38:09,338 --> 01:38:11,447
Good, Uie. Keep it up until the end.

2738
01:38:11,448 --> 01:38:13,048
(Uie, the one and only stamina queen)

2739
01:38:13,848 --> 01:38:15,118
Nice. Good.

2740
01:38:15,648 --> 01:38:16,818
You can do it.

2741
01:38:17,618 --> 01:38:18,687
(Her upper body is losing all energy.)

2742
01:38:18,688 --> 01:38:20,057
Why do the gloves feel heavy?

2743
01:38:20,058 --> 01:38:21,688
Hang in there. Come on.

2744
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:23,587
(Sae Rok, who showed improvement in techniques)

2745
01:38:23,588 --> 01:38:25,688
Yes. Keep them straight.

2746
01:38:26,028 --> 01:38:27,858
Lift your heels. Use your toes. Like that.

2747
01:38:28,358 --> 01:38:29,798
Don't stop.

2748
01:38:29,968 --> 01:38:30,998
Pull yourself together.

2749
01:38:31,128 --> 01:38:32,328
You're almost done.

2750
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:34,038
You're 1 minute 30 seconds in.

2751
01:38:34,298 --> 01:38:36,038
Hurry up. Pull your knees up.

2752
01:38:36,138 --> 01:38:38,908
Your guards. Keep your guards up.

2753
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:41,707
(Am I hitting the sandbag or is the sandbag hitting me?)

2754
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,478
Yes. Pull your knees up.

2755
01:38:43,808 --> 01:38:46,118
Quickly. Come on.

2756
01:38:46,978 --> 01:38:48,548
- You can do it, Sae Rok.
- I can do it.

2757
01:38:49,018 --> 01:38:51,418
Faster. It's a fight against myself.

2758
01:38:51,848 --> 01:38:54,188
Hold out, and you'll win a boxing match.

2759
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:55,517
(I will endure it.)

2760
01:38:55,518 --> 01:38:56,558
Good.

2761
01:38:57,328 --> 01:38:59,128
Nice. Everyone is doing well.

2762
01:38:59,358 --> 01:39:01,158
Just a little more to go. 30 seconds.

2763
01:39:01,398 --> 01:39:02,868
Thirty seconds.

2764
01:39:02,928 --> 01:39:04,098
That's it.

2765
01:39:04,128 --> 01:39:06,897
(A fierce comeback)

2766
01:39:06,898 --> 01:39:07,937
Nice.

2767
01:39:07,938 --> 01:39:10,868
(Her feet and hands feel extremely heavy.)

2768
01:39:11,038 --> 01:39:12,707
Nice, Sae Rok. That's how you do it.

2769
01:39:12,708 --> 01:39:14,037
Until the end.

2770
01:39:14,038 --> 01:39:15,808
- Come on. Hang in there.
- You can do it.

2771
01:39:15,838 --> 01:39:18,578
(Whether it's a shout or a gasp, she's burning her energy.)

2772
01:39:18,648 --> 01:39:19,948
Yes. You're doing great.

2773
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,748
Keep it up.

2774
01:39:22,048 --> 01:39:23,918
You have five seconds left.

2775
01:39:24,318 --> 01:39:28,918
Five, four, three, two, one.

2776
01:39:29,528 --> 01:39:30,788
Okay.

2777
01:39:31,488 --> 01:39:32,997
That's it for today. Great job.

2778
01:39:32,998 --> 01:39:35,398
(They are completely drained.)

2779
01:39:36,168 --> 01:39:37,267
Good work.

2780
01:39:37,268 --> 01:39:40,468
(The younger sisters are utterly wiped out.)

2781
01:39:43,038 --> 01:39:45,367
(Smiling as if she feels refreshed,)

2782
01:39:45,368 --> 01:39:47,838
(Uie celebrates finishing training with a dance.)

2783
01:39:48,008 --> 01:39:49,177
This is fun.

2784
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:50,277
(Yes, the training is over.)

2785
01:39:50,278 --> 01:39:52,248
You look like a crazy person.

2786
01:39:53,518 --> 01:39:55,577
- Even your hair.
- It's over.

2787
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:56,888
(Either way, the training has ended.)

2788
01:39:57,196 --> 01:39:58,725
(Where is this place...)

2789
01:39:58,726 --> 01:40:00,796
(that reeks of metal?)

2790
01:40:01,236 --> 01:40:04,266
(The hottest place among fitness lovers)

2791
01:40:04,566 --> 01:40:06,706
(An octathlon fitness race)

2792
01:40:07,176 --> 01:40:09,706
(A special treatment plan to increase stamina)

2793
01:40:09,919 --> 01:40:11,119
(My blood is boiling.)

2794
01:40:11,576 --> 01:40:13,876
(Their dopamine is at its peak.)

2795
01:40:14,646 --> 01:40:17,346
(Will they complete the course without a hitch?)

2796
01:40:17,546 --> 01:40:19,116
(I can't do it.)

2797
01:40:19,386 --> 01:40:20,856
(Listen to me!)

2798
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:22,286
(I'll do it!)

2799
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:24,386
(The mood suddenly turned deadly serious?)

2800
01:40:24,862 --> 01:40:27,526
(Will they be able to complete the course?)

2801
01:40:27,926 --> 01:40:30,126
(It's been one month since they started boxing.)

2802
01:40:30,366 --> 01:40:31,766
(The Iron Girls improved drastically in one month.)

2803
01:40:31,866 --> 01:40:33,095
- One, two, dodge.
- One, two, dodge.

2804
01:40:33,096 --> 01:40:34,636
(Even their posture is perfect.)

2805
01:40:35,266 --> 01:40:37,006
(I'm still scared of getting hit.)

2806
01:40:37,266 --> 01:40:39,676
(Practicing how to take hits is a must, too.)

2807
01:40:40,806 --> 01:40:41,806
(Hitting)

2808
01:40:42,006 --> 01:40:43,006
(Hitting)

2809
01:40:43,106 --> 01:40:44,206
(Not going easy on the members)

2810
01:40:44,646 --> 01:40:46,516
(Throwing punches with 200 percent force)

2811
01:40:46,776 --> 01:40:48,775
(Iron Girls versus...)

2812
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:50,746
(Iron Girls)

2813
01:40:50,946 --> 01:40:52,386
