1
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:34,931
Where are we?

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,201
Where are we?

3
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,371
My goodness. What is this place?

4
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,911
Why are we filming at a new place today?

5
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,211
It looks a bit like a movie set.

6
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,781
This place is no joke.

7
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,881
(Ring)

8
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,880
It's my 1st time seeing a place with 2 rings.

9
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,450
This place looks nice.

10
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,920
(A new boxing gym)

11
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,550
I'm overwhelmed by the atmosphere.

12
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:58,091
I feel like we'll have a rough day.

13
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,760
Shall we wrap our hands?

14
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,361
Okay. Let's begin by wrapping our hands.

15
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,700
The moment we wrap our hands, the training begins.

16
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:05,877
(Now, Iron Girls wrap their hands in the most natural way.)

17
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,930
Finally, I have a glorious wound.

18
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:09,400
- What is it?
- My goodness.

19
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:10,700
I heard that such wounds were natural.

20
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:11,771
Really?

21
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:14,370
Does it happen even with the hand wrap?

22
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:15,371
Yes!

23
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:19,310
(With wounds, Iron Girls transform into boxers.)

24
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,081
I need to wrap my wrists well.

25
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,481
(A month ago)

26
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,520
(Serious)

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,790
Hold on. What's going on over here?

28
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:29,990
(I seriously messed it up.)

29
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,861
(They couldn't bend their fingers.)

30
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,461
(It took them ages to wrap their hands.)

31
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,330
(Now, wrapping their hands is a piece of cake.)

32
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,170
The day becomes hard if you don't wrap your hands well.

33
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,051
(Now, wrapping their hands is a piece of cake.)

34
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,770
- Hello.
- Hello.

35
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,370
- Hello.
- Are you guys doing okay?

36
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

37
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,510
Judging by the clothes and other things,

38
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:52,440
you guys seem like professional boxers now.

39
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,950
- It has been a month, right?
- Yes.

40
00:01:54,951 --> 00:01:56,520
When I was preparing for the triathlon,

41
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,280
my marathon time improved.

42
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,850
I could ride my bicycle.

43
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,490
I could see the improvements in my swim time.

44
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,691
Thus, I knew that I was getting better.

45
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,730
But it isn't like that with boxing.

46
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:08,831
"Am I improving at all?"

47
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,130
"Am I doing well?"

48
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,730
- It's so...
- I agree.

49
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:13,900
- I get anxious.
- It's a mystery.

50
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,100
- It's understandable.
- Listen.

51
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,701
You improve when you have such thoughts.

52
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,241
Let me explain.

53
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,410
You guys are running forward with your eyes on the road ahead.

54
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,011
You're wondering if you're doing well...

55
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,310
only because you're exercising a lot.

56
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,350
It means that you're doing well.

57
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:29,450
You move up a level when you have such thoughts.

58
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,550
- That's right.
- That's right.

59
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,881
I think you guys are doing well.

60
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,790
Before we begin the training,

61
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,490
- would it be possible to see...
- Okay.

62
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,320
- what they've done so far?
- Okay.

63
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,060
Show me the routine you've worked on so far.

64
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,091
Get ready.

65
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,901
(Each gym has a different routine number.)

66
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,730
(1. Jab. One, two, backstep, one, two.)

67
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,170
(2. Jab. One, two, hook, two, backstep, one, two.)

68
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,847
(3. Jab. One, two, hook, backstep, one, two, etc.)

69
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,371
(They learned 6 routines over the course of a month.)

70
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,481
(They'll go over the routines before the lesson begins.)

71
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,440
Why don't we do this?

72
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,350
If you don't make a single mistake with the commands and movements...

73
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,227
in 1 minute and 30 seconds, the review will end then and there.

74
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,597
But if you make a mistake, you'll start from the beginning.

75
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,120
You might end up doing this for an hour.

76
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,490
But if you make a mistake, you'll start from the beginning.

77
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,597
(If they don't do well, the review will take forever.)

78
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,060
- The four of us...
- Guys,

79
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,360
- go slowly.
- Except for Routine Four...

80
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,530
- To do this, - Routine Four.

81
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:16,830
Let's do it at this speed.

82
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,300
Jab.

83
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,300
(They plan to do it rhythmically at a consistent speed.)

84
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,030
- Okay.
- We shouldn't do it too fast.

85
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,771
Routine 4 is uppercut, hook, backstep, 1, 2.

86
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,771
- Get ready.
- Don't pick up the speed.

87
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:28,940
Set, go.

88
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,317
(Go through the routines correctly for 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

89
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,610
(1. Jab. One, two, backstep, one, two.)

90
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,611
(Pass)

91
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,780
(2. Jab. One, two, hook, two, backstep, one, two.)

92
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,781
(Pass)

93
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,790
(3. Jab. One, two, hook, backstep, one, two.)

94
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,891
There you go.

95
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,690
Forty seconds have passed.

96
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:44,620
(4. Jab. One, two, uppercut, hook, backstep, one, two.)

97
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:45,790
(Stop!)

98
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,260
(4. Jab. One, two, uppercut, hook, backstep, one, two.)

99
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,131
(Fail)

100
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,730
- No.
- Ju Hyun, do it again.

101
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,430
You're doing well. This is a part of the training.

102
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,701
- Okay.
- Set, go.

103
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:59,101
(They start over from the beginning.)

104
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,611
Forty-five seconds.

105
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,480
(In Ah messes up.)

106
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,041
- Wrong.
- What is it?

107
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,531
- Backstep, 1, 2.
- I messed up.

108
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,851
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,781
- Hook, backstep, 1, 2.
- I'm sorry.

110
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,950
(The 6th attempt)

111
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,190
(The 7th attempt)

112
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,260
No.

113
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,491
(The 8th attempt)

114
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:23,160
It's okay. We can do it.

115
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,930
(The 9th attempt)

116
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,100
(Glancing over)

117
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,370
- Incorrect.
- We got it right, didn't we?

118
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,671
- Who got it wrong?
- Incorrect.

119
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,671
Start over.

120
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:32,741
You're doing well.

121
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,310
The captain...

122
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,070
should take them to the back...

123
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,980
- and talk to them.
- It's just 1 minute and 30 seconds.

124
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,310
It's just 1 minute and 30 seconds.

125
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,050
- We're nearly there, right?
- We were almost done.

126
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,380
We were almost done. What was the matter?

127
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:43,550
I met eyes with the coach.

128
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,250
- Did you meet eyes with the coach?
- Yes.

129
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,320
- I'm sorry, - Okay.

130
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,881
But our baby made a mistake because she met eyes with the coach.

131
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:51,260
- Please go easy on her.
- Okay.

132
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,991
The order of the movements is important,

133
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,230
but your posture...

134
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:55,930
is also very important.

135
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,260
- Turn the legs, waist, and feet.
- Okay.

136
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,661
Get the angle right.

137
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,031
- Understood?
- Okay.

138
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,040
Who starts? Get ready.

139
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,041
(No more failures.)

140
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,301
Watch your guard.

141
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,540
Set, go.

142
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,970
- Jab.
- Jab.

143
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,981
One, two, backstep, one, two.

144
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,450
(Feeling pressured, they pick up the rhythm.)

145
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:15,611
- Good.
- Go slowly.

146
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:19,381
(They go back to the original rhythm thanks to the captain.)

147
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,190
(4. Jab. One, two, uppercut, hook, backstep, one, two.)

148
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,460
(Pass)

149
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,760
(5. Jab. One, two, uppercut, hook, backstep, one, two.)

150
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,790
(Pass)

151
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,600
(6. Jab. One, two, hook, two, slide, hit, backstep, one, two.)

152
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,800
(They move as one.)

153
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,871
(Pass)

154
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,770
(They stay extremely focused...)

155
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,740
(and go through the routines perfectly.)

156
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,771
Keep going.

157
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,310
- Okay.
- Well done.

158
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,480
Well done.

159
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,581
We did it in the end.

160
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:51,780
My calves are about to burst.

161
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,081
How many minutes did it take?

162
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,171
I think we've done it for about 20 minutes.

163
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,860
It was a test,

164
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,360
but you guys completed it...

165
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,691
- like the main training.
- Yes.

166
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,590
I'm sure you'll say the commands in your sleep.

167
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:03,931
- You guys did very well.
- Yes.

168
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:07,230
- Tell us which training comes next.
- Okay.

169
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,931
In the past month,

170
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:11,040
you learned the basic steps and punches.

171
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,770
- Yes.
- Now,

172
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,291
you'll learn the applied techniques...

173
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,310
you can actually use.

174
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,781
Can you give us an example?

175
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,140
The applied footwork techniques,

176
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,480
pivot...

177
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,680
(Advanced footwork, pivot)

178
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,781
and shuffle.

179
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,020
They're like lethal moves.

180
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:27,650
(Advanced punches, up and down)

181
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,920
The best body shot is the left one.

182
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,281
(They'll learn strong body shots!)

183
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:37,500
(They'll have scary practices.)

184
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,731
There are two footwork maneuvers.

185
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,400
They're pivot...

186
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,200
- and shuffle.
- Shuffle?

187
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:46,140
- We'll start with the pivot.
- Pivot.

188
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,310
- Is it "pivot?" - Yes. It's pivot.

189
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,181
It's also called "turn."

190
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,310
- In Korea, people often go, - Turn.

191
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,381
"Turn."

192
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:00,391
(The front foot is locked.)

193
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,761
(You use the other foot to change directions.)

194
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,730
(Pivoting is a technique...)

195
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,590
(where you pivot on one foot to change directions...)

196
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,660
(and dodge your opponent's attack.)

197
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,960
- You know what a compass is.
- Yes.

198
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,370
- You've used it.
- Yes.

199
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,600
The front foot becomes an anchor.

200
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,670
An anchor.

201
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,300
With your back foot, the right foot,

202
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,170
you push a bit and turn...

203
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,240
like this.

204
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,540
You lift your foot and push.

205
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,710
(Push the right leg and turn in a 90° angle.)

206
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,310
- A 90° angle.
- Coach, is this...

207
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,710
for dodging?

208
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:30,780
- Is it for punching?
- Is it for attacking?

209
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:31,980
You dodge as you attack.

210
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:33,621
- You do both.
- You do both.

211
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,227
Let's say there's an opponent in front of you.

212
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,351
From here,

213
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,020
the opponent might throw a 1-2 combo.

214
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,181
You turn your body like this.

215
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,331
(The front foot is locked.)

216
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,230
(The back foot changes the direction.)

217
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,300
Then you throw a hook.

218
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,400
(Hook)

219
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,070
The opponent might throw a 1-2 combo.

220
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,170
You turn your body like this.

221
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,400
Do you throw a hook with your left hand?

222
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,977
Yes, you throw a hook with your left hand.

223
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,001
- You throw a hook.
- Coach.

224
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,810
Will I be able to see a 1-2 combo?

225
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,370
Will I be able to see it?

226
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,440
After the first round,

227
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,640
you'll think, "This boxer tends to attack."

228
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:01,150
"This boxer has a good 1-2 combo." You can make these judgements.

229
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,181
In accordance,

230
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,281
you can use the pivoting technique.

231
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,520
But if you're slower than your opponent,

232
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,950
- it'll be hard to use it.
- Right.

233
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,260
That's why your first step is...

234
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,360
- practicing the footwork quickly.
- I have a question.

235
00:08:13,361 --> 00:08:14,890
- Okay.
- Do you return after a hook?

236
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:15,960
Do you do this?

237
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:17,661
Hit and return.

238
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:19,630
- Hook, return.
- Yes.

239
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,770
- That's right. You do this.
- Yes.

240
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:21,931
- Like this?
- Yes.

241
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:23,130
Get ready.

242
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:24,400
- One.
- One.

243
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,570
- Two.
- Two.

244
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,240
- Pivot.
- Pivot.

245
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,210
(They begin to learn how to pivot.)

246
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,081
- Pivot.
- Pivot.

247
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,081
Again. Back to the start. One.

248
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,181
One.

249
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,750
- Two.
- Two.

250
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,451
- Pivot.
- Pivot.

251
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,451
(Watching carefully)

252
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,191
Pivot.

253
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,060
(The guard goes up after a beat once they throw a hook.)

254
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,230
Do this after pivoting.

255
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,661
- I didn't do it.
- Right.

256
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,131
- You get the hang of it, right?
- Yes.

257
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:56,770
It should come very naturally.

258
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:58,440
When someone approaches you,

259
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,740
(When someone approaches you, do this.)

260
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:00,741
do this.

261
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,171
Don't lie.

262
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,031
(Everyone should know this good technique.)

263
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:05,981
For goodness' sake!

264
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,250
Come on!

265
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:08,380
- Coach!
- You should do that.

266
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,380
You've learned this technique.

267
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,521
When I approach you...

268
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,020
- Yes. Do that.
- Let me try it.

269
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,090
Okay. When I approach you...

270
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,850
- Can I throw a hook as well?
- This is a greeting.

271
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,390
(Greet the other by pivoting!)

272
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,660
This is a greeting.

273
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,461
- Practice.
- Should we do this upon meeting?

274
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:21,931
We'll do it at the same time.

275
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:23,800
(Pivoting)

276
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:24,900
Like this.

277
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,360
Pivot at all times.

278
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:28,800
I'll teach you a routine...

279
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,081
- that involves a pivot.
- Okay.

280
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,370
This is Routine Seven.

281
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,840
Jab.

282
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:34,610
One, two, slide, hit,

283
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,470
pivot, one, two.

284
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:37,680
(7. Jab. One, two, slide, hit, pivot, one, two.)

285
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,081
Shall we do Routine Seven...

286
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,550
for one round?

287
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,781
- Okay.
- Routine Seven.

288
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,181
Set, go.

289
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,620
Jab.

290
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,280
- One, two, slide, hit, - During one, two,

291
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:47,490
- turn your waist.
- pivot.

292
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,520
(Iron Girls have good posture from the start.)

293
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,190
Jab.

294
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,790
One, two, slide, hit,

295
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,931
- pivot, 1, 2.
- Good.

296
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,590
(The front foot is the anchor.)

297
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:57,801
(Perfect)

298
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,400
Jab.

299
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,900
One, two, slide, hit,

300
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,771
- pivot, 1, 2.
- Good.

301
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,570
- Jab.
- Throw a hook properly.

302
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,247
- One, two, slide, hit.
- The angle should be right.

303
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:11,681
(They throw a hook perfectly as they pivot.)

304
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,481
(They become used to the movement they were confused about.)

305
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:21,291
(Their footwork is neat and perfect.)

306
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:23,150
(With 30 seconds remaining, it's booster time.)

307
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:24,790
- Thirty seconds.
- One, two, slide, hit,

308
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,521
pivot, 1, 2.

309
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:28,860
(Sports Genius is happy to learn a new routine.)

310
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,930
- There you go.
- Slide, hit, pivot, 1, 2.

311
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,630
One, two, slide, hit, pivot.

312
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,977
- There you go. Pick up the speed.
- One, two.

313
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,030
(With perfect teamwork, they learn the routine thoroughly.)

314
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:37,140
- There you go.
- Five seconds.

315
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,870
Jab. One, two, slide, hit,

316
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,240
pivot, 1, 2.

317
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:42,510
Jab. One, two, slide, hit,

318
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,610
pivot, 1, 2.

319
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,480
- Okay. You did well.
- There you go.

320
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,151
- Good.
- You did well.

321
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,780
Toward the end, your speed matched...

322
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,821
that of professional boxers at the training center.

323
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,020
It's extremely difficult...

324
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,020
to do the footwork for three minutes with your hands up.

325
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:58,360
Your stamina has improved a lot.

326
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,820
Everyone, try it.

327
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,560
- Yes.
- Try it as you watch the show.

328
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,800
Since we've come a long way, people won't know how hard it is.

329
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,160
You guys have changed. Seriously,

330
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,347
this three-minute workout is hard. You guys did a great job.

331
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:09,270
The next one is...

332
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,501
an advanced footwork maneuver,

333
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,640
the shuffle.

334
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,771
- Shuffle.
- Shuffle.

335
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:16,210
(Shuffling is a footwork maneuver which involves...)

336
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:18,691
(moving the feet quickly from front to back or right to left.)

337
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:23,250
(It's useful for controlling the distance...)

338
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,951
(and holding the position.)

339
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,320
So far, you've learned how to move...

340
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,320
- front and back.
- Yes.

341
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,990
We did the basic footwork...

342
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,121
which went front and back.

343
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,330
But if you keep doing this...

344
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,730
when the opponent is out of reach,

345
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,012
- You'll waste your stamina.
- you'll waste your stamina.

346
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,500
- It won't be effective.
- No.

347
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,700
Thus,

348
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,500
you need to know how to walk.

349
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,771
When the opponent is far,

350
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,070
it's good to move like this.

351
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,140
(Slide front and back.)

352
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,170
Like this.

353
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,580
- You move like this, right?
- Yes.

354
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,280
You close the distance for an attack.

355
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,050
(Save up your stamina and run up.)

356
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:55,051
Do it for an attack.

357
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,221
This is called shuffling.

358
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:00,491
Forward, backward, to the left, to the right.

359
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,350
(Step first with the foot in the direction you're heading.)

360
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,711
- Are you doing the vertex dance?
- Left, right. Like this.

361
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:08,661
So then, when we move sideways like this,

362
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,060
can we do this?

363
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:12,960
(Is it okay if my legs cross?)

364
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:15,431
- Never.
- Sometimes it's possible, but...

365
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,700
When you're trying to trick your opponent.

366
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,270
- When you pretend to go this way, - When I go this way...

367
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,710
- but then go this way, you can.
- Right.

368
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,240
But you'll learn about that later.

369
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,310
But basically, you have to maintain this stance.

370
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,840
So with the right foot... When you go right,

371
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,110
move your right foot first, then your left foot follows.

372
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:31,081
You have to keep maintaining that.

373
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:33,020
If you move the other foot first, your legs will get tangled.

374
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:36,350
That's not good because you won't be able to throw a punch like that.

375
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:38,720
That's why you have to move your front foot first.

376
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:40,790
So you move your left foot first when you're moving left.

377
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,990
- Got it.
- Now,

378
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:45,960
this shuffle step is for offense.

379
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,831
When you move to the left, it's called the pivot.

380
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,370
And when you move to the right, it's called the shuffle.

381
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,700
- Pivot to the left, - Pivot.

382
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:54,310
- shuffle to the right.
- Shuffle.

383
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,710
Pivot to the left, shuffle to the right.

384
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,641
The right side. Throw a jab, please.

385
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,151
You see how I moved my right foot?

386
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:04,621
And then you move this way.

387
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,750
This technique is very difficult.

388
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,871
When you link the steps together, it looks like this.

389
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:11,681
This technique is very difficult.

390
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,760
Even professional boxers struggle with it.

391
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,390
But it's a great technique to use.

392
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,331
All right. Why don't we...

393
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,060
- A routine?
- make a routine with this?

394
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:21,830
- Number eight?
- Yes, this will be number eight.

395
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:23,300
- Gosh.
- That's a lot of moves.

396
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:26,501
Jab. One, two, pivot.

397
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:29,471
One, two, shuffle. One, two.

398
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:33,111
Jab. One, two, pivot.

399
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,911
One, two, shuffle. One, two.

400
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,320
- Let's do 1 round.
- So 3 minutes?

401
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:39,681
Do 1 round of 3 minutes.

402
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,491
Ready. Go.

403
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:45,060
- Jab. One, two, pivot.
- Jab. One, two, pivot.

404
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:47,591
- One, two, shuffle. One, two.
- One, two.

405
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,290
- Jab.
- You're good at this.

406
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,800
- One, two, pivot.
- One, two, pivot.

407
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:53,300
(Full marks for both posture and attitude)

408
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,871
Nice. Great energy.

409
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,870
One, two, pivot.

410
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,370
(Ju Hyun's steps are also clean and precise.)

411
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,540
- One, two.
- She's really good at this.

412
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,340
Jab. One, two, pivot.

413
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,510
(Uie is maintaining a steady pace.)

414
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,180
- She's good.
- She has good rhythm.

415
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,280
- Nice. Uie, your steps are perfect.
- Shuffle.

416
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,450
(Perfect)

417
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:12,181
Jab. One, two, pivot.

418
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,950
- More power.
- One, two, shuffle. One, two.

419
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:16,450
- One, two.
- That's it.

420
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,091
In Ah's got it.

421
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,390
One, two.

422
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,290
- Jab. One, two, pivot.
- Pivot.

423
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,801
- One, two, shuffle. One, two.
- One, two, shuffle. One, two.

424
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:26,507
- Jab. One, two, pivot.
- They're so good.

425
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,031
(Everyone has a steady rhythm.)

426
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,770
(The Iron Girls continue practicing Routine 8.)

427
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,641
- They're good.
- One, two, shuffle.

428
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,440
(Only 30 seconds remain.)

429
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,441
(They pick up the pace.)

430
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,950
- One, two, pivot.
- Nice.

431
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:42,910
One, two, shuffle. One, two.

432
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,150
(The video hasn't been sped up.)

433
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,250
- There are ten seconds left.
- One, two, pivot.

434
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,490
- One, two, shuffle. One, two.
- Nice.

435
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:49,720
Jab. One, two, pivot.

436
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,820
One, two, shuffle. One, two.

437
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:54,160
- Jab. One, two, pivot.
- Last one.

438
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,630
- One, two. Okay.
- That was so fast.

439
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,701
(They completed the routine with the shuffle.)

440
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,231
One, two. Nice.

441
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,670
You're all really good.

442
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,900
(Passionate Rocky Keum wants to practice more.)

443
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:08,711
Seriously. It's only been a month,

444
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:12,380
but you're able to execute this step. That's incredible.

445
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,310
- You did well.
- We did a good job.

446
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:15,381
You did a great job.

447
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,581
The techniques we've learned so far...

448
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:21,491
have been punches to the face.

449
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,491
- What else is there?
- Uppercut?

450
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:24,820
- The body?
- The stomach.

451
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,990
- The stomach.
- The body.

452
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,131
I will now teach you how to hit the body.

453
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:33,121
Let's learn the high-low combination.

454
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,430
The high-low combination?

455
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:36,360
We're face to face with our opponent.

456
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,081
What would I usually start my offense with?

457
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,800
- One, two.
- Yes. One, two.

458
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:41,630
- Or a jab, right?
- One, two.

459
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:44,341
So I'd throw a jab like this.

460
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,101
- Yes.
- And then,

461
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,441
I hit the stomach like this.

462
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,410
(Step 2: Pretend to throw another jab.)

463
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:53,140
(Step 3: Find an opening and go for the body.)

464
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,010
- That must hurt so much.
- No. You go high and low.

465
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,050
That's why this technique is called the high-low combination.

466
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,420
- The high-low combination.
- High, low. High, high, low.

467
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,990
- Yes.
- If your opponent is leading...

468
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,820
and she throws a punch upward,

469
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:06,490
- then your guard ends up here too.
- That's right.

470
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,160
So you'd think your opponent will aim upward again.

471
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:09,960
So instead, she'd throw her punch like this.

472
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,731
High and low. And another thing.

473
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,360
You look at your opponent's stomach with your eyes.

474
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:14,570
I went for the stomach earlier, right?

475
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:15,771
I keep my eyes on the stomach.

476
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:17,740
But then, I aim high.

477
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:20,000
So you keep looking at the stomach as you aim for the face. Yes.

478
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,270
Ju Hyun will be great at this.

479
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,110
You have to keep your eyes on the stomach and punch the face.

480
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:25,480
- Yes. This is...
- That's right.

481
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,850
- an eye feint.
- Yes.

482
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,750
- Eye feints are very important.
- Yes.

483
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,481
High and low. Low and high.

484
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:33,881
You'll realize firsthand that, as you're boxing,

485
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:36,181
you have to deceive your opponent as much as possible.

486
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,860
You have to deceive your opponent as much as possible to hit more.

487
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,230
Every sport comes down to deception.

488
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,630
In soccer, you pretend to kick,

489
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,101
- Right.
- but you don't.

490
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,100
- Since you're actresses, - Right.

491
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,030
- you're all good at acting.
- Right.

492
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:50,147
So you'll probably be good at deceiving too.

493
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:53,370
Lastly, we'll practice the high-low combination.

494
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,241
How do you do high and low and low and high?

495
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:57,010
Throw a jab high.

496
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,840
- And then go high, low. Nice.
- High, high, low.

497
00:16:58,841 --> 00:16:59,940
And then jab low.

498
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:00,980
Jab low.

499
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,311
- Low, high.
- Low, high. Nice.

500
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,480
- Jab, low, high.
- Nice.

501
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,421
- And then jab low.
- High, low. High, low.

502
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:09,050
- High, high, low.
- That's it. Nice.

503
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,621
High, high, high, high, high.

504
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,121
- High, low.
- Low.

505
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,330
- Nice.
- But isn't there...

506
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:16,890
a strong punch for the body?

507
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,200
- A strong one?
- You either throw a jab...

508
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:21,230
or a straight punch to the stomach.

509
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,671
- Yes.
- The highlight of body attacks...

510
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,971
is the left body shot.

511
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:27,440
- The left body shot?
- The left body shot?

512
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,941
- What's that?
- The left body shot?

513
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:33,340
(No matter how strong a boxer is, )

514
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:36,711
(he is knocked out at once...)

515
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,951
(with the deadliest technique in the ring.)

516
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:44,320
(The left body shot)

517
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,990
- You guys love special moves.
- Yes.

518
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,707
- This is a special move.
- It's an ultimate move.

519
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:48,830
If someone is knocked out after getting hit in the stomach,

520
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:49,991
it's always their right side.

521
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,300
People rarely get knocked out after getting punched...

522
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,330
- on the left.
- It's really rare.

523
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:54,200
But we throw the punch with our left hand, not the right?

524
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:57,570
Why? Because the human body stores...

525
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,940
many important organs on the right like the liver.

526
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,110
- That's cruel.
- Yes.

527
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,310
There's a nerve plexus near the liver.

528
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,111
So this liver...

529
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,180
If your opponent throws a straight punch, you do this.

530
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:10,480
Then use the left body shot to aim at the liver.

531
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,750
Aim high the way you would with an uppercut.

532
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,191
Hit like this.

533
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,650
Then I'd fall like this.

534
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,661
Goodness, that must hurt so bad.

535
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,120
That's horrible.

536
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,730
It's called a body shot, but it's really an uppercut.

537
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,131
- Right? Okay.
- Yes, that's right.

538
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,760
But this is a hook.

539
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,160
- This is also an uppercut.
- An uppercut.

540
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:27,870
Just think of all body blows...

541
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,131
as uppercuts.

542
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:31,941
- Uppercut, uppercut, uppercut.
- The upper-half is all hooks.

543
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:35,641
- That's scary. Hook.
- So we have to practice body shots.

544
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,680
You have to...

545
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,540
know what the body shots feel like...

546
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,750
to realize how strong your punches are.

547
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,651
So I'll be your sandbag...

548
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:47,551
and let you hit my body.

549
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,891
Without any gear?

550
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:50,791
- No gear.
- No gear?

551
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,590
I'm good without gears. No problem.

552
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,290
- You guys put on gloves, - Right.

553
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,760
And I'll let you hit my body for three minutes.

554
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,261
This is how professional boxers usually practice.

555
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:04,340
As you hit, you inhale sharply.

556
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:06,000
The skills you need to inhale like this.

557
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,570
That's what we'll be working on. The timing.

558
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,710
Since he was a UFC fighter,

559
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:10,980
he would have been hit in the stomach a lot.

560
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:12,981
Still, it must hurt a lot.

561
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,811
I wonder how it would feel.

562
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,711
Let's put on the gloves.

563
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,151
I'm going to knock out Captain Kim.

564
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:22,321
Please. I hope there's some damage.

565
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,190
(Entering the ring)

566
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:26,961
- Step inside.
- Come on.

567
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,160
Step inside.

568
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,061
You're so cool.

569
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,300
This is the kind of person who makes it to competitions.

570
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,171
You should have looked cooler.

571
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,400
Enter, please.

572
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,800
(They awkwardly enter the ring.)

573
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,000
That was already awkward.

574
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,540
- Coach.
- Yes.

575
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,940
The ring looks bigger than the one in our gym.

576
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:45,580
It feels very open.

577
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,581
- What is this?
- The diameter of this ring is 7m.

578
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:50,580
It's very similar to the ring you four will be competing in.

579
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,180
- Yes, it's very similar.
- This one's big.

580
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,381
It's so big.

581
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:56,672
(The boxing ring of the Summer Games has a side of 7.8m.)

582
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:57,920
(The length of the boxing ring...)

583
00:19:57,921 --> 00:19:59,120
(at the community sports competition they'll be participating in is 7m.)

584
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,960
What you'll be doing today...

585
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,831
will feel similar to a real match.

586
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,801
Treat today as if you're in an actual fight.

587
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:08,170
To help you get in the zone, as your Captain,

588
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:10,071
I'll let you hit me as much as you can.

589
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,340
You're not wearing any protective gear underneath, are you?

590
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,441
Gosh, I'm completely bare.

591
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,810
This is your chance to hit him.

592
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,640
This reminds me of my fighter days.

593
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:22,710
Back then, I had people throw heavy balls on me...

594
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,020
and step on my body for three minutes.

595
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,580
People who weigh 90kg or 100kg used to step on me.

596
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,720
Compared to that, your punches...

597
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,920
are basically as light as a feather.

598
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:32,320
That's a blow to my ego.

599
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,591
I might even doze off.

600
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:36,330
If I do, wake me up.

601
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,600
- Watch what you say.
- Let's make him wince in pain.

602
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,101
To give you a heads-up,

603
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,830
if you wear yourself out while throwing punches,

604
00:20:42,831 --> 00:20:44,031
you don't have what it takes.

605
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,940
If you're the one taking blows and can't stand being hit anymore,

606
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,440
I honestly would understand.

607
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,780
But if you get exhausted just from hitting...

608
00:20:51,781 --> 00:20:53,810
We've tried this when you were new to boxing,

609
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,310
but you've been training for more than a month now.

610
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,210
How much stamina it requires...

611
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,980
to throw punches for the whole match.

612
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,590
You should feel that.

613
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,120
- The time...
- Blue, over there.

614
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,251
Red, over there.

615
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,090
(Body blow for 3 minutes)

616
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,091
(Smirking)

617
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:09,961
Stun Gun?

618
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,731
I'll smash you.

619
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,171
(Dancing)

620
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,041
(The human sandbag is teasing.)

621
00:21:18,271 --> 00:21:20,071
He's so annoying.

622
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:21,740
You're practicing the body shot.

623
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:22,940
Don't hit the face.

624
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:23,941
Captain Kim,

625
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:25,841
- you may move.
- Okay.

626
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:27,040
Ready...

627
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,211
Round One.

628
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:29,711
Box.

629
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,080
Good luck.

630
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,850
Let's go, Park Ju Hyun.

631
00:21:32,851 --> 00:21:34,180
(She dashes forward...)

632
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,521
(and starts punching.)

633
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,861
(Take my body blow.)

634
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,060
(Ju Hyun dashes upon the start.)

635
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:43,231
Take this.

636
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:44,931
You got it.

637
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,761
Good.

638
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:48,301
Gosh.

639
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:49,571
You got it.

640
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,071
(It doesn't hurt?)

641
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:53,971
So tired.

642
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,340
(He slacks off.)

643
00:21:55,341 --> 00:21:57,170
What are you doing?

644
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:58,240
- Not the face.
- Pretend to hit the face...

645
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,311
and go for the body.

646
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,611
(She uses the high-low strategy.)

647
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:04,181
- Nice.
- What was that?

648
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,851
- You got me.
- Go for the left.

649
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,621
(He got hit when he wasn't straining.)

650
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:13,061
(The damage is several times more severe.)

651
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,430
(Ju Hyun continues to rage.)

652
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:15,491
Good.

653
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:17,800
- Good.
- It hasn't even been a minute yet.

654
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:18,860
- Good.
- What?

655
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:20,507
- It hasn't even been a minute yet.
- Keep going.

656
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,071
The second punch is the highlight.

657
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:23,730
- You got it.
- It's only been a minute.

658
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:24,740
(She's been hitting for a while, but it's only been a minute.)

659
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:27,440
(She's been punching nonstop for a minute.)

660
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:28,470
Gosh.

661
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:30,311
- Hurry up.
- I was looking down...

662
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,951
(It's not easy to punch either.)

663
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:36,951
- Thirty seconds.
- Thirty seconds.

664
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,380
You got it.

665
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,727
(She corners Captain Kim who's running away.)

666
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,590
- If you see the spot, punch him.
- It hurts.

667
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:42,690
It hurts.

668
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:44,691
(Captain Kim looks like he's in pain.)

669
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:46,961
Okay. Good job.

670
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,590
- Knock down.
- You beat Captain Kim.

671
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,631
He's down.

672
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:51,931
(Hooray)

673
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,900
(Successfully damaging Captain Kim)

674
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:54,901
He's down.

675
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,701
- He was straining.
- Wait.

676
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:58,641
She's got the stamina.

677
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:00,641
You got the stamina.

678
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,541
Ju Hyun, I approve of your stamina.

679
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,981
Wait. Time out.

680
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:08,181
Look.

681
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,180
I didn't show it,

682
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,621
but she's got a very strong punch.

683
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:13,120
You have a really strong punch.

684
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,161
- It looked painful.
- You were punching lightly...

685
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:20,821
(Just a month ago, Ju Hyun...)

686
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,291
(passed out in 2 minutes.)

687
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,760
That's not someone who learned only for a month.

688
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:26,900
- That was...
- Aiming at your liver.

689
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:28,200
- She's like a lightweight boxer.
- Liver.

690
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,701
Heart, liver, heart.

691
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:31,540
I mean...

692
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,400
A month ago, we tried it.

693
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,670
- For 2 minutes.
- We tried to hit him for 2 minutes.

694
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:37,041
You tried it for three minutes.

695
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,781
I'm less tired.

696
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,750
I can punch more than before.

697
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:43,951
It's not that your stamina improved.

698
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:45,320
You know when to strain and when to loosen.

699
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,250
You know how to control your stamina for boxing.

700
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,090
- That's so cool.
- And...

701
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,420
Perhaps because she acts,

702
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,621
I fell for her trick where she tried to hit my face.

703
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:54,707
Although I knew she wasn't going to punch my face.

704
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,130
I didn't know show it,

705
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:57,607
but I received the damage like three times.

706
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:59,961
Ju Hyun, you're pretty good at the real game.

707
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,001
Next.

708
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,701
Uie's punch is...

709
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:07,241
- stronger than you think.
- Oh, no.

710
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,540
- It's not.
- You're really strong.

711
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,110
- I'm not strong at all.
- She's strong.

712
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:11,410
- You're stronger than you think.
- Wait a minute.

713
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,540
- Are you scared.
- I was shocked.

714
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,381
Why don't you put on the safety gear?

715
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,811
What? I don't need any safety gear.

716
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,421
All right. Round One.

717
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:21,420
Box.

718
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,390
(Uie's round begins.)

719
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,121
Good.

720
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:28,361
(Her look changes from the start.)

721
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:29,990
Good.

722
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:31,661
(Strong punches)

723
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,460
Keep it up.

724
00:24:33,461 --> 00:24:34,701
Keep it up.

725
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,001
You have to hit the right side of his body.

726
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,171
(The coach asks for a left uppercut.)

727
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:40,340
The important organs are on the right.

728
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:41,570
You have to hit his body.

729
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,010
(Impacting the right side instead of the left)

730
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:44,241
With the left hook.

731
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:46,911
Her left uppercut isn't strong enough.

732
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,110
(Light left hook)

733
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,711
(Strong right hook)

734
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,821
(Her left and right punches are clearly different.)

735
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,890
Don't punch like this.

736
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,521
- Punch upward.
- Like an uppercut.

737
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:00,520
- That's right.
- That's right.

738
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,090
(As soon as he fixes her posture, )

739
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:04,230
(her left uppercut changes clearly.)

740
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:05,361
- You got it.
- You got it.

741
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:06,791
- That's sharp.
- You got it.

742
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:08,030
(It hurts to watch.)

743
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,071
Right and left.

744
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,331
You got it.

745
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:11,771
Why is she so strong?

746
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,711
(You can tell how strong she is from his face.)

747
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:17,980
Come here.

748
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,011
(Running away)

749
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,851
Left body. Go for the left body.

750
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,851
Use your right hook to punch.

751
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:24,981
One more time.

752
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:26,380
- Good job.
- Good job.

753
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:28,261
(She didn't take a single break for 3 minutes.)

754
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:30,751
(Exhausted)

755
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,161
- Good job.
- You're so strong.

756
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,191
You're really strong. I mean it.

757
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:36,690
And you have unbelievable stamina.

758
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:38,430
She's running out of breath. Are you tired?

759
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:39,961
- I'm tired.
- Really?

760
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,700
(When she was making soft punches, )

761
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,840
- Two minutes aren't so bad.
- I know, right?

762
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,571
(Uie had stamina left.)

763
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:50,941
(But after throwing uppercuts with an impact, )

764
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:53,410
I'm tired.

765
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:54,610
(she runs out of breath.)

766
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:56,751
Uie, I approve of your stamina.

767
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:58,920
- Good job.
- If you're tired,

768
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:00,180
what am I going to do?

769
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:02,591
- It's okay. You can do it.
- Next is Sae Rok.

770
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:05,191
She's strong.

771
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,560
Your punch comes from your physique.

772
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,860
It's crazy.

773
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,690
- Box.
- Hey.

774
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,731
Let's practice.

775
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:14,461
(Starting with a unique impact sound)

776
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,170
- But...
- Right now,

777
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:17,630
- you're hitting my pelvis.
- You're hitting his pelvis.

778
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,440
- You have to hit up here.
- It's a low blow.

779
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:20,901
- It's a low blow.
- My legs...

780
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,270
You got it.

781
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,510
(Aiming at his stomach as Captain Kim says)

782
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:26,281
She's tenacious.

783
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:28,050
(Making up for her low stamina with her mental strength)

784
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:29,081
Good.

785
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,851
Look at her.

786
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:32,051
You got it.

787
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,951
Chase him.

788
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,591
Hit him right there.

789
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:39,120
- No, you can't do that.
- How...

790
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:40,821
Don't move back. Never.

791
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,531
(Is something wrong with Sae Rok's posture?)

792
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:47,061
(She pulls her arm back to gain momentum.)

793
00:26:47,261 --> 00:26:49,600
- How far are you pulling your arm?
- You were like this.

794
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:50,630
- Keep going.
- You can't do that.

795
00:26:50,631 --> 00:26:52,470
You have to hit with the waist. With the waist.

796
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,040
(Punch his waist?)

797
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,211
Go for his waist. You got it.

798
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,410
(Her punch became stronger after fixing her posture.)

799
00:26:58,411 --> 00:26:59,710
Good. Keep it up.

800
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:00,811
- It's bearable.
- Good.

801
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,951
I think I've improved.

802
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,881
You have to move your waist too. Good job.

803
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:09,091
(He became a chill guy who's not affected by punch.)

804
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,731
Can you get me a cup of coffee?

805
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,661
- Will you get me a cup of coffee?
- You got it.

806
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:17,261
Wait. Your voice is trembling.

807
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,431
That's better.

808
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,961
Keep your guard up.

809
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:22,900
Faster.

810
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:24,071
You hit me in the spot.

811
00:27:24,401 --> 00:27:26,270
- Run.
- Chase him.

812
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,241
Chase him.

813
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,541
- Sae Rok, bear it.
- Good.

814
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,310
Punch. Yes.

815
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:32,741
(Tenacious uppercut until the end)

816
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:34,980
(You can see how strong she is from his face.)

817
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,110
He looks like Larva.

818
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:37,210
(Sae Rok's round ends.)

819
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:38,520
Okay. It's over.

820
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:40,980
- Rocky Keum.
- You didn't pass out.

821
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,251
- You didn't look for Mom.
- Good job.

822
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:45,621
Mom!

823
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,761
(Sae Rok used to shout for Mom.)

824
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,360
(She's become dogged.)

825
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:52,460
Good job.

826
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,301
(Meanwhile, someone's completely drained.)

827
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:57,270
I'm sorry, but can you get Captain Kim safety gear?

828
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:58,371
No.

829
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,041
My pride won't accept it.

830
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,871
Next is In Ah, Captain Kim.

831
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:06,081
(Next is Simba Seol.)

832
00:28:06,681 --> 00:28:08,981
(It's In Ah?)

833
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,811
I think I have to put that on.

834
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,621
I need to put it on for real.

835
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:15,051
This is...

836
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,991
I need to put it on. Or I'll be at risk.

837
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:18,561
- They're so strong.
- Can you do it?

838
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:20,990
- How was the cotton candy?
- What?

839
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,190
Was the cotton candy sweet?

840
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:24,631
I thought it was cotton candy, but there were a lot of rocks.

841
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,830
It was quite crunchy, wasn't it?

842
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,331
I was shocked.

843
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:29,970
- All right. In Ah.
- You're good now.

844
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,377
- You're really good.
- Let's start.

845
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:34,041
This is what it means to be a spectator of a fight.

846
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,670
Round One. Box.

847
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,981
(In Ah's round begins.)

848
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:40,681
(Grunting)

849
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,280
(Exploding with punches from the start)

850
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,481
I'm glad I put it on.

851
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,321
Good.

852
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,621
I'm so glad I put it on.

853
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:49,650
(This is Simba Seol's uppercut.)

854
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,991
Yes. Good.

855
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,321
- Two, punch.
- You got it.

856
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:53,660
- Two, punch.
- Keep it up.

857
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,361
- Don't slide.
- You have to punch.

858
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,660
(Launching a straight uppercut as told)

859
00:28:58,661 --> 00:28:59,730
(An accurate impact)

860
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:01,031
Good. Keep going.

861
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:03,601
(Strong power)

862
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:06,240
(It's not enough. She throws a series of punches.)

863
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,371
- Punch.
- It's crazy.

864
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:09,841
- Yes. Just like that.
- You're so strong.

865
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:11,940
I told you to put it on.

866
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,011
Will that protect him, though?

867
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,750
Keep punching for ten seconds.

868
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:17,910
(Maintaining steady power for 3 minutes)

869
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,281
- Harder.
- Ten seconds.

870
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:21,790
- Three. Punch.
- Punch.

871
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,590
Two, one.

872
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:24,651
(The last one)

873
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:25,821
(The last blow)

874
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,621
Good job.

875
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,090
That was so exhausting.

876
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:30,291
(She gave it her all.)

877
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,130
(Our ace!)

878
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:34,060
(Captain Kim is getting sick.)

879
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,331
Applause for Captain Kim.

880
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,301
Wait.

881
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:38,900
You see,

882
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,100
a month ago, you used up your stamina...

883
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:42,470
and ran out of energy.

884
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,370
But now, you know how to control your stamina.

885
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:45,810
You know how to give an impact.

886
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:48,210
You became more competitive than before.

887
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:50,850
You hit a person for the first time.

888
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:53,621
How did it feel to punch someone?

889
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:54,891
To be honest,

890
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:58,320
we practiced hitting others before.

891
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,760
But I'm worried...

892
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,830
about getting hit.

893
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,930
Me too. I'm worried about getting hit.

894
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:05,401
The more the face gets hit,

895
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,301
the weaker it gets.

896
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,830
The more your body below the neck gets hit,

897
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,201
the stronger it gets.

898
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:12,800
- I'm scared.
- So...

899
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,271
we'll keep this going...

900
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,941
and practice between us.

901
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:17,231
- What?
- Put your gloves on.

902
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:21,510
(What's the training for Iron Girls who are scared of getting hit?)

903
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,111
You'll play promise boxing...

904
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:26,480
to practice hitting and blocking.

905
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:29,050
You know how we blocked with our hands before?

906
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:30,250
Like this?

907
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,320
- Right?
- Yes.

908
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:33,320
You'll practice hitting and blocking...

909
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:34,961
with a promised pattern.

910
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:39,400
(If the last promise boxing was...)

911
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:43,001
(to train hitting above the guard and defending, )

912
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:45,401
(today's promise boxing is...)

913
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:49,471
(The face)

914
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:52,611
(The body)

915
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:57,211
(They'll be attacking and defending the actual areas.)

916
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:00,951
(They must get used to the flying punches.)

917
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,250
You need this training,

918
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:04,520
so you can use it in a spar.

919
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,761
Now, Uie versus In Ah and Ju Hyun versus Sae Rok.

920
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,191
Let's try.

921
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,690
I'll tell you how to do it.

922
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,760
We'll add the attack to what we've learned.

923
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,270
All right. One, two,

924
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:17,471
- and each side.
- Is this right?

925
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:20,240
One, two, hook, hook, and you block.

926
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:24,571
- Yes.
- Then you'll hit each side.

927
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,241
Then how is that person going to block?

928
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:29,980
One, two, hook, hook.

929
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,181
And tap, tap.

930
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:33,051
You have to move your stomach.

931
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:38,320
(Face defense)

932
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:41,991
(Body defense)

933
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:46,300
(Moving the body left and right for defense)

934
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,960
- That's what you do.
- You got it.

935
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,731
Where does it end?

936
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:51,870
Right. Wait. Is it?

937
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:53,900
It ends on the left. Watch.

938
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:57,070
One, two, hook, hook. This is where it ends.

939
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:00,111
Then it's right and left. That's where it ends.

940
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,181
- Okay.
- That's what you do.

941
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:05,681
I'll go first. One, two, hook, hook.

942
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:07,421
No.

943
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,520
(Guarding the other side)

944
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:12,920
- It's too...
- You'll get hit and knocked out.

945
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,491
We'll have one team step forward,

946
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:18,400
watch, and take turns.

947
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,061
- You two first.
- Step forward.

948
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:25,141
- Watch them and follow.
- One, two, both hooks, hit, hit.

949
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:28,301
Including the body blow,

950
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:29,871
go harder.

951
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:32,811
Because the body blows must be intense.

952
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,910
Only that is helpful.

953
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:37,657
If you miss it, you can't help but get punched.

954
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:39,651
Practice like what?

955
00:32:39,851 --> 00:32:41,890
- The real game.
- Yes, practice like the real game.

956
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:43,250
- Yes.
- And fight like a practice.

957
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,451
- Yes.
- Ready.

958
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:46,161
Go.

959
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,560
(Ju Hyun versus Sae Rok)

960
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:49,630
Good.

961
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:51,060
(One, two, hook, hook)

962
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:52,731
Wait. I'm getting punched in the face.

963
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:56,271
(Sae Rok punches hard as the coach said.)

964
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,441
- One, two, hook, hook.
- Yes.

965
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,740
You got it.

966
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:02,570
(Ju Hyun's strong body blow)

967
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,511
- You got it.
- Are you sure you blocked it?

968
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,241
It's okay. It's okay to be down.

969
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:08,380
How can I do that?

970
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,381
Good.

971
00:33:09,382 --> 00:33:10,610
(After attacking and defending for a minute...)

972
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:12,550
- Okay. Stop. Switch.
- Switch.

973
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,280
- Switch. Your turn now.
- Good job.

974
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:15,951
- Ready, set, go.
- Sae Rok.

975
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:17,290
(1st, 2nd)

976
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,661
(One, two, hook hook)

977
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,831
It's the other way. It needs to end on the left.

978
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,001
("One, two, hook, hook" was no problem.)

979
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:30,671
(For the right uppercut, she went with the left first.)

980
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,200
(Due to the direction mistake, Ju Hyun got punched big time.)

981
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,111
It's the other way. It needs to end on the left.

982
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:39,040
(Feeling the pain of a body shot for the first time)

983
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,180
- Sae Rok has a deep punch.
- I'm sorry.

984
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:43,111
- It's okay. Wait. Stop.
- You're so strong.

985
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:45,080
- Stop. It's my fault.
- No.

986
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,320
That happens.

987
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:47,981
But we promised it.

988
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,691
It's true that we promised it, but...

989
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:53,360
Ju Hyun, you need to experience it.

990
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:55,230
Now that she's experienced it, she knows what it's like.

991
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,430
(She can't get up.)

992
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:57,431
I'm sorry.

993
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:58,531
Are you okay?

994
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:00,360
Oh, my gosh.

995
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:02,281
- Ju Hyun, are you okay? I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

996
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,631
- I got the order wrong.
- No.

997
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,440
- Drink some water and rest.
- She's in a lot of pain.

998
00:34:07,441 --> 00:34:08,441
I know.

999
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:10,541
Let's take a break.

1000
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:16,851
(She ends up crying.)

1001
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:19,250
- Let's take a break.
- That's how it feels...

1002
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,451
when you join the competition.

1003
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:21,921
It hurts.

1004
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:26,821
Take a break.

1005
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,391
(The training is stopped.)

1006
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:35,631
I'm sorry.

1007
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,831
- No.
- I should've...

1008
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:41,441
No, it's not your fault.

1009
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,480
I got punched once before during practice.

1010
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,681
It was a light punch, but the pain lasted for two days.

1011
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:53,981
I know I'll get punched in the end.

1012
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,451
It's scary.

1013
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:00,361
I'm scared of it now.

1014
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:03,631
But I have to overcome it.

1015
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:09,131
(After some time to reorganize...)

1016
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:13,341
Ju Hyun, are you okay?

1017
00:35:14,101 --> 00:35:16,171
Are you okay? Come here.

1018
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:18,341
You got your first hit.

1019
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,380
- Ju Hyun.
- We have to be really careful.

1020
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,050
- I'm sorry.
- No, why do you keep apologizing?

1021
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,080
Ju Hyun, here.

1022
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,781
- Are you okay?
- That shouldn't happen.

1023
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:29,890
No. This is how scary boxing is.

1024
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:32,621
(This is how scary boxing is.)

1025
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,290
That hurt so much.

1026
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,731
- It hurt.
- I know it hurts.

1027
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:37,891
I got hit for 12 minutes.

1028
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,401
I'm sorry.

1029
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,230
- But you got hit only once.
- I know.

1030
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:43,930
- You're really amazing.
- I did that for 12 minutes.

1031
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,000
- It's not easy.
- I'm sorry, Captain Kim.

1032
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:48,041
You have to get used to getting punched. Good job.

1033
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,540
- The first to get punched.
- Yes.

1034
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,541
- It must've hurt so much.
- You'll become strong.

1035
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:53,911
I'll become strong.

1036
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:56,180
The more you get punched in the stomach, the stronger you become.

1037
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:58,720
- You'll get stronger.
- Train our abs, okay?

1038
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:02,251
You'll all experience it anyway.

1039
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,450
This is promise boxing.

1040
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:07,160
Even if you get the order wrong, that happens.

1041
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:10,731
- Right.
- So remember the order.

1042
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,001
This time,

1043
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,200
Uie and In Ah.

1044
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,630
- Let's practice first.
- Let's try.

1045
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,930
Let's give it a try.

1046
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:18,001
Ready...

1047
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:19,940
Go.

1048
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,640
(Uie versus In Ah)

1049
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,140
- You got it.
- Good.

1050
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,581
Keep it up. Good.

1051
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:27,711
They're good.

1052
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:31,080
Don't focus on the speed. Focus on the punch.

1053
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:32,950
You have to punch right.

1054
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:35,250
- Only then, blocking works.
- I'm scared.

1055
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,151
I'm sorry.

1056
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:41,021
(In Ah's brutal punches that penetrate Uie's guard)

1057
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:43,861
- That's what you need to do.
- Bring it on. I'm all good now.

1058
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,830
- Uie.
- Your wrist...

1059
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:49,470
(With a speed that's hard to keep up)

1060
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,830
- Yes. Harder.
- No way.

1061
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:52,270
(Uie and In Ah continue to attack and defend.)

1062
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,071
- Good job.
- In Ah, keep your punch up.

1063
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,470
- Harder.
- Yes, harder.

1064
00:36:58,471 --> 00:36:59,640
You're going to say it hurts.

1065
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,880
- It's okay.
- No, it's okay. Come on.

1066
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,250
(Her hairband is off.)

1067
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:05,010
- You got it.
- You're getting pushed.

1068
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:06,350
- Okay. Stop.
- Let's go.

1069
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:07,381
Switch.

1070
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,821
(Uie's turn to attack)

1071
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:13,421
Uie looks like she's in pain.

1072
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,567
You look like you're in pain when you get punched in the stomach.

1073
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:16,861
Why does it hurt so much?

1074
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:19,331
- Why am I...
- Good. You're almost there.

1075
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:22,131
Why do I feel so tired when I spar with you?

1076
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:24,501
Do it right. One.

1077
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:26,740
(Clenching her teeth to punch)

1078
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:27,741
Two.

1079
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:28,940
(Giving her all)

1080
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:30,370
(Uie and In Ah's spar ends.)

1081
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:31,540
- Okay.
- Good.

1082
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,141
- Good job.
- That was amazing.

1083
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,040
Gosh, In Ah...

1084
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,450
(Uie and In Ah did their best...)

1085
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:39,051
(in promise boxing.)

1086
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,520
- You need to do that much.
- It's only the first day.

1087
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:43,751
- Only that helps both of you.
- Okay.

1088
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:48,220
You might say we're not filming a martial arts movie,

1089
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,591
but if you practice a lot,

1090
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,860
when someone throws a punch at you,

1091
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,660
you'll punch back even before you know it.

1092
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:56,770
- That's right.
- That's what you're practicing for.

1093
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,400
That's the point of the practice.

1094
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,941
You should memorize this.

1095
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:03,641
You were practicing to react to the opponent's attack.

1096
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,640
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

1097
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,811
Ju Hyun,

1098
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,551
you grew as much as it hurt.

1099
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:13,880
I'm sure you'll only grow.

1100
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,081
- That's right.
- I mean it.

1101
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:16,550
- That was fun.
- You all need to experience...

1102
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:17,621
the pain in the stomach.

1103
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,720
Well done today.

1104
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,690
- Well done.
- Well done.

1105
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:23,831
(Today's training is completed!)

1106
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:26,631
(A few days later)

1107
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:28,231
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1108
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,301
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1109
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:31,800
(They reached the special stamina training center.)

1110
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:34,401
- Amazing.
- Gosh.

1111
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,311
- Gosh.
- Hold on.

1112
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:39,681
(What's making them exclaim as soon as they enter?)

1113
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:43,150
(Pumped up muscles)

1114
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:44,581
Look at his back.

1115
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,080
He looks like the Terminator.

1116
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,280
(Heavy pull-ups)

1117
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,350
Isn't he the Terminator?

1118
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:51,190
(Who's this man that speaks with his muscles?)

1119
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:52,991
Hello.

1120
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:55,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

1121
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:57,990
(Welcomed by Iron Girls)

1122
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:59,331
Hello.

1123
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:01,860
- It's a celebrity.
- It's a celebrity.

1124
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,030
She kept saying that she was a big fan.

1125
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,400
It's a celebrity.

1126
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:08,341
Can you introduce yourself?

1127
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:09,841
The former special forces soldier.

1128
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,541
The former special forces soldier.

1129
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:14,010
- The former firefighter.
- Okay.

1130
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,951
- He nailed all the fitness races.
- Yes.

1131
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,551
He is Hong Beom Seok.

1132
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,021
- You introduced him.
- I love him.

1133
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:24,851
(The former 707 battalion task force soldier)

1134
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,621
(The most elite special forces soldier)

1135
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,761
(In the World Firefighters Games, )

1136
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:34,161
(he became the first Asian champion.)

1137
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,201
(He also participated in the global fitness race...)

1138
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:41,201
(that's known as the fitness race of death.)

1139
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:44,610
(He's 1st place everywhere.)

1140
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:46,740
(The man with an outstanding physique, Hong Beom Seok)

1141
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:48,580
- I love you.
- Yes.

1142
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,680
(Today's special coach)

1143
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,850
All your training coaches...

1144
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,350
are the best in the country.

1145
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,050
- I know, right?
- You only met the best.

1146
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:58,050
- It's burdensome.
- "Burdensome."

1147
00:39:58,051 --> 00:39:59,561
It really is burdensome.

1148
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:02,961
Let me tell you about...

1149
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,730
the global fitness race...

1150
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:07,230
- that you're going to learn today.
- Yes.

1151
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:08,261
- Yes.
- Yes.

1152
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:10,800
The global fitness race is...

1153
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:12,901
also known as an octathlon.

1154
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:14,641
You run for 1km...

1155
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,011
and complete one event.

1156
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:19,811
You run for another 1km.

1157
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:22,551
And complete one event.

1158
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:26,550
You run a total of 8km...

1159
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,291
and complete eight events in the race.

1160
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,761
This extreme race...

1161
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:35,691
that takes almost two hours...

1162
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:39,201
will help you grow various muscles for boxing.

1163
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:41,260
It's the perfect training for you.

1164
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:42,907
(The compound muscle stamina training for boxing)

1165
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:45,070
The fitness race will take place...

1166
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:46,840
in Incheon in two days.

1167
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:50,141
Iron Girls will also join the race.

1168
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:53,711
What event are you joining?

1169
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:56,281
We'll be doing the doubles.

1170
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:57,650
- Me and Uie.
- Team Big Sisters.

1171
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:59,120
Team Big Sisters and Team Younger Sisters.

1172
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,621
- In Ah and Ju Hyun.
- Okay.

1173
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:02,050
But I can't guess what it's like.

1174
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,750
- You have no idea what it's like.
- Right.

1175
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:06,291
Your basic stamina is important in boxing.

1176
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:07,960
The balance between the upper and the lower bodies.

1177
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:10,130
The muscle stamina, power,

1178
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:11,661
agility, and muscular endurance.

1179
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,661
It'll train all that.

1180
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,100
If you try it,

1181
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:18,270
it'll help you with boxing.

1182
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:20,040
- They're very competitive.
- Right.

1183
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,240
- They'll be good at it.
- Okay.

1184
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,440
- Then let's get started.
- Yes.

1185
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:23,441
Let's start.

1186
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:25,411
- Good.
- Let's go.

1187
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:27,940
First, you'll start...

1188
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:29,210
- with running.
- Okay.

1189
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:30,211
It's running.

1190
00:41:30,451 --> 00:41:33,051
You have to run 1km together.

1191
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:35,181
If you're 8m away,

1192
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,190
you'll get a three-minute penalty.

1193
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,091
- What?
- A three-minute penalty.

1194
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,621
We can't be apart.

1195
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,530
Running fast isn't always good.

1196
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:45,261
Your teamwork is very important.

1197
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,460
I just need to keep up.

1198
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,800
Shall we try running 1km?

1199
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,701
- Yes.
- You need to know what it's like.

1200
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,001
Ready.

1201
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:54,601
Go.

1202
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:58,371
(Running for 1km)

1203
00:41:58,811 --> 00:41:59,940
I like that sound.

1204
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:01,181
That sound of fear.

1205
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,710
- Right?
- They're good at running.

1206
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:03,887
They're good at running, right?

1207
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:05,510
Be aware of the remaining distance...

1208
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:06,950
and keep your pace.

1209
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:08,327
(The highlight of running is the pace control.)

1210
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:09,920
Okay. Fifty completed.

1211
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:11,091
Keep it up.

1212
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,091
Done.

1213
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,291
Done.

1214
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,807
(Uie completed 1km in 5 minutes and 30 seconds.)

1215
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:19,200
(In Ah completed 1km...)

1216
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:20,761
(in 5 minutes and 48 seconds.)

1217
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:22,671
Okay.

1218
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,231
Six minutes and five seconds.

1219
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,040
(What's Sae Rok's record?)

1220
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

1221
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:28,440
Okay. Good.

1222
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:30,117
(Sae Rok completed 1km in 6 minutes and 28 seconds.)

1223
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,411
We need to do that seven more times, right?

1224
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:33,940
The thing is, you do that...

1225
00:42:33,941 --> 00:42:35,241
along with other exercises.

1226
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:37,951
After running 1km, you have to start skiing.

1227
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,721
The first event is the ski machine.

1228
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,351
You have to ski for 1,000m.

1229
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,590
It uses most of the upper body muscles.

1230
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:48,790
It exercises your latissimus dorsi muscles the most.

1231
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:51,430
It's similar to the muscles you use...

1232
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:53,031
to turn your body in boxing.

1233
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:56,431
Keep it close to your chest and pull all the way.

1234
00:42:57,031 --> 00:42:59,001
You have to press it with your body.

1235
00:42:59,071 --> 00:43:00,201
Don't just use your arms.

1236
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:04,070
Get into the rhythm as you push your hip.

1237
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:05,340
(As you push your hip, bend your upper body down.)

1238
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:06,740
When one's done,

1239
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:07,841
the other person goes.

1240
00:43:08,441 --> 00:43:09,750
And you wait here.

1241
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:10,987
(It's important to switch before one is exhausted.)

1242
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:12,421
(Whirring)

1243
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:15,891
(The fan gets louder when more power is applied.)

1244
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:18,520
The first even is already giving me a mental breakdown.

1245
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:20,460
Try 100m each,

1246
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:21,991
and I'll fix your posture.

1247
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,930
Use your blade.

1248
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,461
- Is this right?
- Yes.

1249
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:27,960
(Struggling)

1250
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:29,671
Lift it high.

1251
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:32,101
Pull it close to your body. Okay.

1252
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,401
Move forward.

1253
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:36,110
Make sure not to spread your arms.

1254
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:37,210
- Go straight up.
- It sounds like...

1255
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:39,010
a fan in level one.

1256
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:40,380
- Pull closer.
- No, it's the sleep mode.

1257
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:41,680
- The sleep mode.
- The sleep mode.

1258
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:42,951
It sounds like sleep mode.

1259
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,881
It sounds like the natural breeze.

1260
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:48,621
(Sae Rok's fan's in sleep mode.)

1261
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:50,851
That's not what it should sound like.

1262
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,921
- But...
- She lacks stamina.

1263
00:43:53,191 --> 00:43:54,191
(Whirring)

1264
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,460
(It already sounds strong.)

1265
00:43:55,461 --> 00:43:56,691
Good job.

1266
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:58,530
Look how strong she is.

1267
00:43:58,531 --> 00:43:59,700
(Swooshing)

1268
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,531
She's trying to break the machine.

1269
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,630
Relax. Have composure.

1270
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:05,631
(The famous Strong In Ah)

1271
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,571
Wait. We have to do that for 1,000m?

1272
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,771
- Lift your heels slightly.
- Nice.

1273
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:11,941
You got it.

1274
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:13,581
Keep breathing.

1275
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:15,040
Don't stop breathing.

1276
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:17,880
(Everyone finished practicing skiing including Ju Hyun.)

1277
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,180
After that,

1278
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:20,421
you have to go run again.

1279
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:22,420
- You have to run.
- Let's say we ran.

1280
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:23,490
Let's say you ran.

1281
00:44:23,491 --> 00:44:24,550
Hurry up.

1282
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:25,820
- It's the sled.
- Run.

1283
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:27,691
- What's the slate?
- "Slate."

1284
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:29,531
Next is the sled.

1285
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:31,631
This event uses the sled.

1286
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:33,430
(The sled push)

1287
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:35,061
The sled push...

1288
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,770
strengthens the thighs and the quads...

1289
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:40,501
that help you take steps while boxing.

1290
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,971
It's 102kg.

1291
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,271
Grab the handles...

1292
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,710
and keep your arms to your body.

1293
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:47,941
Grab with your hands.

1294
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,710
It's easier if you take short steps.

1295
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,351
(Take short and quick steps to push.)

1296
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:54,580
Follow him.

1297
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:55,820
(The other partner follows and switches.)

1298
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:56,890
And switch.

1299
00:44:56,891 --> 00:44:58,151
Turn here.

1300
00:44:58,421 --> 00:44:59,661
Let's start.

1301
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:05,091
She's moving easily.

1302
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:06,501
I can't do it.

1303
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,360
Once it begins moving, it's easier.

1304
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:09,901
(Too heavy even for Strong In Ah)

1305
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:11,670
(Sae Rok tries the sled push.)

1306
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:13,440
- Go. Keep it up.
- Okay.

1307
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:14,541
Sae Rok, you can do it.

1308
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:16,570
(Groaning)

1309
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:18,011
- Go.
- Keep going.

1310
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:19,880
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1311
00:45:19,881 --> 00:45:21,281
(Shouting for the momentum)

1312
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:23,851
(Grunting)

1313
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:26,080
Shouting helps.

1314
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:27,721
You still made it halfway.

1315
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:29,991
I gave it my all.

1316
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,461
- How do I grab it? Is this right?
- Yes.

1317
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:34,791
Keep your waist straight.

1318
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:36,090
Gosh.

1319
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,431
- Don't bend your waist.
- Gosh.

1320
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:39,361
- Keep...
- Gosh. This is...

1321
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:41,060
- Keep it low.
- Take short steps.

1322
00:45:41,061 --> 00:45:42,901
- This is...
- Park Ju Hyun, you got it.

1323
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:44,370
Take short steps.

1324
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:46,101
- How are we supposed to move this?
- Gosh.

1325
00:45:47,601 --> 00:45:48,641
Sae Rok.

1326
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,971
You do it.

1327
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,041
Sae Rok. I'm sorry.

1328
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:53,241
I can't do it.

1329
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,281
I can't do it.

1330
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:59,251
(Groaning)

1331
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:01,621
You're good.

1332
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:04,651
(Sae Rok is on a booster.)

1333
00:46:05,151 --> 00:46:07,961
(With an exclamation, she can go anywhere.)

1334
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:10,561
Wait.

1335
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:11,660
(She found her talent in the extreme situation.)

1336
00:46:11,661 --> 00:46:13,801
- You've found your talent.
- That's so funny.

1337
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,971
Just do this, and I'll do the rest, okay?

1338
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,601
You've found your talent.

1339
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:19,701
Rocky.

1340
00:46:19,871 --> 00:46:21,511
You have the determination in your voice.

1341
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,011
I'm sorry, but you have to exclaim, okay?

1342
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:25,811
To discourage others.

1343
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,041
You have to exclaim.

1344
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:28,910
- You just pushed.
- Yes.

1345
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,351
Now, it's time to pull.

1346
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:32,581
(Pull it?)

1347
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,380
Next is the sled pull.

1348
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:36,590
(Sled pull)

1349
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,291
The sled pull will stimulate your forearm muscles.

1350
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:41,990
The forearm muscles...

1351
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:43,737
not only protect your wrists when you punch,

1352
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,301
but they're important muscles for keeping your guard up.

1353
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:49,231
Pull it to deliver your power.

1354
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:50,870
- Use your weight.
- What?

1355
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:51,871
(Don't just pull with your arms.)

1356
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:54,270
It's less heavy. It's 78kg.

1357
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,301
(78kg for women)

1358
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:57,540
- How do I do it?
- Lean back and squat.

1359
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,340
- Okay. You got it.
- Ju Hyun.

1360
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:00,341
- Awesome.
- Good.

1361
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:01,341
Keep pulling.

1362
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:04,811
(In Ah's known for her power.)

1363
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:08,250
(Showing off her explosive power)

1364
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,291
What?

1365
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:11,720
- Get close to it as much as I can.
- You have long arms.

1366
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:12,790
(Sae Rok and Uie pull using their long arms.)

1367
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,061
How close are you getting?

1368
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:15,361
She's like a monkey.

1369
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:17,060
- Okay.
- Good.

1370
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:19,030
- You're doing great.
- You got it.

1371
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:21,061
- It's time for the burpee.
- Pretend that we ran?

1372
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:23,271
- It's getting worse.
- No.

1373
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:25,431
I wish there were one that was less hard.

1374
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:28,041
(Starting the burpee broad jump)

1375
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:29,441
(Groaning)

1376
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:30,811
(Grunting)

1377
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,581
- Okay. Nice.
- Good.

1378
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:33,981
- Jump.
- Good.

1379
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:35,241
(Grunting)

1380
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,311
(Falling down)

1381
00:47:37,551 --> 00:47:38,710
(That's funny.)

1382
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:39,781
Wait.

1383
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:41,751
(Grunting)

1384
00:47:42,021 --> 00:47:43,091
(Grunting)

1385
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,121
I've never seen anyone like her before.

1386
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,161
I can't get up.

1387
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,721
(Grunting)

1388
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:50,730
Yes, at the line.

1389
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:51,830
That's perfect.

1390
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:52,901
Good.

1391
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:54,501
That's good.

1392
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:55,831
But...

1393
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,631
why do you jump...

1394
00:47:58,071 --> 00:47:59,401
like this?

1395
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:02,871
So...

1396
00:48:02,872 --> 00:48:04,611
You jump up instead of forward.

1397
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,811
(Next is the ace Uie from Team Big Sisters.)

1398
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:10,051
- Good job.
- Good job.

1399
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:11,381
That's long.

1400
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,421
That's perfect.

1401
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,451
- Two more steps. Good.
- Done.

1402
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:18,991
Is she a frog?

1403
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:21,160
- In Ah.
- Good.

1404
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,161
(The next frog from Team Younger Sisters appears.)

1405
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:25,490
(Flying)

1406
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:27,161
- She's a frog.
- Good.

1407
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:28,830
She looks like a pro.

1408
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:30,100
(Flying)

1409
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:31,231
She's a frog.

1410
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,531
(Jumping)

1411
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,740
How are you so good at jumping?

1412
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:36,211
I copied the coach.

1413
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:38,171
Next is the Farmer's Carry.

1414
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:39,711
It's simple. Grab them.

1415
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:41,640
All you have to do is walk.

1416
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,751
Or you can run if you want.

1417
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:44,910
Keep the balance...

1418
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:46,421
while using the core muscles.

1419
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:48,081
While using the core muscles.

1420
00:48:48,181 --> 00:48:50,297
The arm muscles, core muscles, and lower body muscles.

1421
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:51,451
All muscles in general.

1422
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:54,020
(Spotting something)

1423
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:55,121
Wait.

1424
00:48:57,961 --> 00:48:59,931
How can someone's arms look like that?

1425
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:02,131
(How do his arms look?)

1426
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:04,301
Can you turn around?

1427
00:49:06,936 --> 00:49:08,966
How can someone's arms look like that?

1428
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:11,206
(How do his arms look?)

1429
00:49:11,336 --> 00:49:13,406
Can you turn around?

1430
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,505
- That's amazing.
- Can I touch it?

1431
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:18,106
- Can I touch it?
- Can you turn around?

1432
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:21,016
- He has chicken breasts on his arm.
- I know.

1433
00:49:21,316 --> 00:49:22,615
Seriously, that...

1434
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:23,785
How did he do that?

1435
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:24,786
(His triceps look as if they're carved.)

1436
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:26,655
I think this is really cool.

1437
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,485
- What's the triceps...
- What's this called?

1438
00:49:28,486 --> 00:49:29,555
- The deltoid muscle?
- An avocado?

1439
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:30,855
- An avocado?
- No.

1440
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:32,326
- A coconut?
- It's a coconut.

1441
00:49:33,526 --> 00:49:34,925
How can they split like that?

1442
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:37,295
(Looking for her hidden muscles)

1443
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:38,866
This is normal.

1444
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,736
- I have it.
- No, you don't.

1445
00:49:42,266 --> 00:49:43,866
Not that. His muscles split.

1446
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:47,776
When you held them, you had something on your arms.

1447
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:49,606
Ready, set, go.

1448
00:49:49,746 --> 00:49:50,806
Go.

1449
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:52,876
Go.

1450
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:54,815
(What?)

1451
00:49:54,816 --> 00:49:55,945
- Wait.
- Come on.

1452
00:49:55,946 --> 00:49:57,115
Don't fake it.

1453
00:49:57,116 --> 00:49:58,415
- No, it's...
- It seems different.

1454
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:00,285
- He carried them so easily.
- Hang on.

1455
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:01,886
We've been swindled.

1456
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:04,255
How did he lift them?

1457
00:50:04,256 --> 00:50:05,496
(Are they stuck to the ground?)

1458
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,396
(Staggering)

1459
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:10,896
It's light once you lift it.

1460
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:12,626
- It's not light.
- Go.

1461
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:14,765
- Keep your back straight.
- In Ah, are you coming?

1462
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:16,366
- Sure.
- In Ah.

1463
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:17,506
(Limping)

1464
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:19,165
Gosh, this is really hard.

1465
00:50:19,166 --> 00:50:20,852
You should step aside, and you should lift them.

1466
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:23,306
- Move along. Let's say you're in.
- My gosh.

1467
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:24,675
- Let's say you're in.
- My gosh.

1468
00:50:24,676 --> 00:50:25,945
- It's heavy, isn't it?
- Turn around like this?

1469
00:50:25,946 --> 00:50:27,046
Keep your back straight.

1470
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:29,515
- Good.
- Walk with your knees straight.

1471
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:31,645
- Walk like this?
- Yes. Walk fast like that.

1472
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:32,745
Good.

1473
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:35,255
- Isn't it heavy?
- It's okay once you lift it.

1474
00:50:35,256 --> 00:50:36,526
It's okay once you lift it.

1475
00:50:36,756 --> 00:50:37,885
(Sae Rocky gives it a try.)

1476
00:50:37,886 --> 00:50:38,926
(Groaning)

1477
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:42,195
(Exclaiming Rok is back.)

1478
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,626
(Biting down)

1479
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:45,366
(Giggling)

1480
00:50:46,096 --> 00:50:47,635
- Sae Rok.
- She's good.

1481
00:50:47,636 --> 00:50:48,996
Will you finish it yourself?

1482
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:50,566
You're good.

1483
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:52,435
Rocky is strong.

1484
00:50:52,436 --> 00:50:53,775
- You think?
- You have good strength.

1485
00:50:53,776 --> 00:50:56,575
All right. Next, you will carry a sandbag that weighs 10kg.

1486
00:50:56,576 --> 00:50:57,605
- What?
- My gosh.

1487
00:50:57,606 --> 00:50:59,406
- You will do a 100m walking lunge.
- What?

1488
00:51:00,776 --> 00:51:02,216
It's 10kg again.

1489
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:03,885
(Sandbag lunge: Performing walking lunges...)

1490
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:04,985
(with a sandbag on the shoulders)

1491
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:06,116
All right.

1492
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,216
- One.
- One, two,

1493
00:51:09,356 --> 00:51:11,125
- Your knee must touch the floor.
- three.

1494
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:12,556
- Change.
- Change?

1495
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,325
Pass it behind your back.

1496
00:51:14,326 --> 00:51:16,726
- I got it.
- Place your head on it.

1497
00:51:17,126 --> 00:51:19,225
- Go.
- Follow her from behind.

1498
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:21,112
(The person to receive the sandbag must not walk ahead.)

1499
00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:23,335
Do you have to carry the sandbag on your shoulders?

1500
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:24,435
It has to stay on your shoulders.

1501
00:51:24,436 --> 00:51:25,865
- Really? Can't I hold it like this?
- No.

1502
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:26,935
- It's not easy.
- No.

1503
00:51:26,936 --> 00:51:28,696
You can't put it down while handing it over.

1504
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:31,175
- If you drop it...
- Once it touches the floor,

1505
00:51:31,176 --> 00:51:32,306
you are disqualified.

1506
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:33,816
Disqualified?

1507
00:51:34,016 --> 00:51:35,545
What you've been doing goes in vain?

1508
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:37,315
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

1509
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:38,385
Let's try a lap.

1510
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,485
(Team Big Sisters goes first.)

1511
00:51:39,486 --> 00:51:41,315
You should go a little more.

1512
00:51:41,316 --> 00:51:43,286
Good. Okay.

1513
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:45,826
- Follow her.
- You're good.

1514
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:47,125
- Where's Sae Rok?
- Here.

1515
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:48,686
- Put your head boldly.
- Here it goes.

1516
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:50,896
Sae Rok.

1517
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:52,466
Sae Rok.

1518
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,496
Let go of it.

1519
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:56,036
Just trust her and let go.

1520
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:57,935
Where are you going, Sae Rok?

1521
00:51:57,936 --> 00:51:58,936
(Groaning)

1522
00:51:59,876 --> 00:52:01,235
(Trembling)

1523
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:02,236
Oh, no.

1524
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:05,246
(Groaning)

1525
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:06,576
(Groaning)

1526
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:09,516
- She's so funny.
- Good.

1527
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,416
You have only one thing left now.

1528
00:52:11,786 --> 00:52:13,486
It's the most difficult one.

1529
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:15,255
- Hitting the wall with a ball.
- Right.

1530
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:16,925
- You do it 100 times.
- Right, 100 times.

1531
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,386
It sounds like fun.

1532
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:20,825
It's called the wall ball shot.

1533
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:22,095
- Wall ball shot?
- Yes.

1534
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,566
(The last event, wall balls)

1535
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,125
How much does this weigh?

1536
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:26,296
You'll use a 4kg ball.

1537
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:29,165
You should hit the line with the ball.

1538
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:30,682
(Throwing a 4kg ball to the target height)

1539
00:52:30,706 --> 00:52:32,165
You should squat down holding the ball.

1540
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:33,335
(Holding the ball, squat deeply and use the momentum...)

1541
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:34,535
(to throw the ball while standing up.)

1542
00:52:34,536 --> 00:52:37,575
When you squat down, your hip joint should be...

1543
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:39,175
positioned lower than your knee.

1544
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:40,892
(The hip joint should be positioned lower than the knee.)

1545
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:41,945
(The correct squat is the key to power.)

1546
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:44,316
This is scary. I'm afraid.

1547
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,285
(Sae Rok tries it first.)

1548
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,516
- Good.
- There you go.

1549
00:52:49,386 --> 00:52:50,386
Okay.

1550
00:52:50,386 --> 00:52:51,386
(Exclaiming)

1551
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:55,025
(The weight of the ball isn't easy to deal with.)

1552
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:56,026
Okay.

1553
00:52:56,396 --> 00:52:58,395
(Her hip joint is positioned higher than her knee.)

1554
00:52:58,396 --> 00:52:59,396
Okay.

1555
00:52:59,966 --> 00:53:02,235
- Squat down, not backward.
- Me?

1556
00:53:02,236 --> 00:53:04,036
- You're squatting like this.
- Right.

1557
00:53:04,366 --> 00:53:05,736
You should do it like this.

1558
00:53:06,906 --> 00:53:08,136
- Is this good?
- Yes.

1559
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:10,445
- Okay.
- It works.

1560
00:53:10,446 --> 00:53:12,175
That's it. You are doing a lot better now.

1561
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:13,816
- Good.
- Nice.

1562
00:53:14,176 --> 00:53:16,275
(It's difficult, but she's trying hard.)

1563
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,716
(Groaning)

1564
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:18,886
(Exclaiming)

1565
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:20,355
(Groaning)

1566
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,856
I feel bad for her.

1567
00:53:22,556 --> 00:53:25,756
(All the energy she prepared has been used up.)

1568
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:27,155
From the bottom up.

1569
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:28,496
(Ju Hyun goes next.)

1570
00:53:29,496 --> 00:53:30,826
(Groaning)

1571
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:33,746
- You can do this.
- You can do this.

1572
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:35,935
(Groaning)

1573
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:37,105
What do I do?

1574
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:38,335
You can do this.

1575
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:40,375
Try to lift the ball from the bottom up.

1576
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:41,905
Don't try to throw it from the side.

1577
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:42,976
Good.

1578
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,216
(She will have to do it 100 times. What is she going to do?)

1579
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:49,886
- Change.
- Okay.

1580
00:53:50,046 --> 00:53:51,415
- Actually, for me...
- Yes?

1581
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:52,845
I tried it once when I played futsal.

1582
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,656
I'm not saying I'm good at it. I just did it.

1583
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:57,755
(A stable pose)

1584
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:58,785
It's smooth.

1585
00:53:58,786 --> 00:54:00,925
- Not with your fingers. Your palms.
- It's smooth.

1586
00:54:00,926 --> 00:54:02,255
Try to throw it up.

1587
00:54:02,256 --> 00:54:03,596
(Throwing the 4kg ball easily)

1588
00:54:04,166 --> 00:54:05,425
- Good.
- Okay.

1589
00:54:05,426 --> 00:54:07,535
- That was good. Okay.
- That's it.

1590
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,636
You've got the hang of it.

1591
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:09,936
- Pass.
- Okay.

1592
00:54:10,236 --> 00:54:12,006
Uie should do it 80 times.

1593
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:14,406
- This is how you should squat.
- Nice.

1594
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:16,675
(This is it.)

1595
00:54:16,676 --> 00:54:18,545
- Gosh.
- She looks experienced.

1596
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,546
What's with her?

1597
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:22,316
The pose looks so stable.

1598
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:26,555
(She succeeded in hitting the target.)

1599
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:29,616
When I see Uie, I want my children to be swimmers.

1600
00:54:30,256 --> 00:54:32,355
(A former swimmer's exceptional athletic ability)

1601
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,695
Okay. Don't worry, Sae Rok.

1602
00:54:34,696 --> 00:54:36,402
If you do it like Uie does, you won't get exhausted.

1603
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,665
Then we will play a mini game...

1604
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,026
with a reduced amount of exercise.

1605
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:42,696
The race is in two days, so you shouldn't overdo yourselves.

1606
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:45,206
- Let's focus and give it a try.
- Okay.

1607
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:47,236
All right. What comes after the skiing?

1608
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,005
(Oatmond)

1609
00:54:49,006 --> 00:54:51,206
Guys, let's have some snacks.

1610
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:53,276
(A quick snack time before the mini game.)

1611
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:55,415
- I was hungry.
- I was thirsty.

1612
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:57,715
This helps replenish protein...

1613
00:54:57,716 --> 00:54:58,915
before and after exercise.

1614
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,086
- That's amazing.
- Really?

1615
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,556
(Savoring)

1616
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:05,385
It tastes good.

1617
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:07,156
- This is really delicious.
- Right.

1618
00:55:07,656 --> 00:55:09,865
- I like it that it's zero sugar.
- I know.

1619
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:12,165
It's still sweet.

1620
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,286
I finished it. What do I do?

1621
00:55:13,496 --> 00:55:14,535
I like the probiotic one.

1622
00:55:14,536 --> 00:55:16,096
It's perfect. That's what I need now.

1623
00:55:16,506 --> 00:55:18,536
This is really tasty.

1624
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:19,736
It's the best.

1625
00:55:19,936 --> 00:55:21,605
All right. Are you ready?

1626
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:22,875
- Yes.
- I'm scared.

1627
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,405
It's the last rehearsal before the race.

1628
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:26,875
Please try your best without getting injured.

1629
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:28,916
You shouldn't run too fast, okay?

1630
00:55:29,216 --> 00:55:31,185
You are good at pacing yourself,

1631
00:55:31,186 --> 00:55:32,246
so I'll match your pace.

1632
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:33,686
Ready.

1633
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:38,926
(The race begins.)

1634
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:40,995
- Good.
- You're running at a good pace.

1635
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:44,126
(The first run begins.)

1636
00:55:44,726 --> 00:55:47,266
- It's 100m already.
- It's a good pace.

1637
00:55:47,796 --> 00:55:48,796
Okay.

1638
00:55:48,796 --> 00:55:49,796
(Team Younger Sisters is running powerfully.)

1639
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:50,866
Good.

1640
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:53,536
(Team Big Sisters' breathing is steady.)

1641
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:57,006
Make sure to pace yourself.

1642
00:55:58,476 --> 00:56:00,315
Almost there.

1643
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,845
If you're done, go to the skiing zone.

1644
00:56:02,846 --> 00:56:04,946
- The first one to go will grab it.
- Move quickly.

1645
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:07,915
Wait behind her.

1646
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,055
(Team Big Sisters follows them right away.)

1647
00:56:09,056 --> 00:56:10,385
Start as soon as you get there.

1648
00:56:10,386 --> 00:56:11,855
(The first event, skiing)

1649
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:13,996
- Make sure to keep breathing.
- Ten.

1650
00:56:15,156 --> 00:56:17,525
Pace yourself.

1651
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:18,895
- It's 50.
- It's too fast.

1652
00:56:18,896 --> 00:56:20,466
It's a good pace.

1653
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:22,136
You have 20m left.

1654
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:25,166
Okay. Get ready to go in.

1655
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:27,576
- Okay.
- Start right away.

1656
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:29,305
Wait behind her.

1657
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,906
Try to get your breath back.

1658
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:32,605
- Okay. Good.
- You're doing well.

1659
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:34,015
Good rhythm.

1660
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,856
- You're strong.
- Sae Rok, you're doing well.

1661
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,186
It's 50.

1662
00:56:37,516 --> 00:56:38,645
Good rhythm, Ju Hyun.

1663
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:41,016
It's 20. Try it 5 more times.

1664
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:43,825
- The last one, and it's over.
- Okay. Go.

1665
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:45,885
Good. You can do this.

1666
00:56:45,886 --> 00:56:48,226
- It's done. Go.
- Okay.

1667
00:56:48,556 --> 00:56:50,595
- Hurry and get on it.
- Go.

1668
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:52,726
Try to match the pace.

1669
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,496
(Checking the pace)

1670
00:56:57,466 --> 00:56:58,835
- Pace yourself.
- Okay.

1671
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:00,306
(Uie paces Sae Rok.)

1672
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:04,106
- Okay. Go.
- Go.

1673
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:05,606
- Go ahead.
- Go, Ju Hyun.

1674
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:09,076
Okay. Start once she stands behind you.

1675
00:57:09,576 --> 00:57:11,785
(The second event, sled push)

1676
00:57:11,786 --> 00:57:12,985
(Moving fast)

1677
00:57:12,986 --> 00:57:14,515
It's fast.

1678
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:16,786
(Pushing 102kg)

1679
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,426
- You got this.
- Go.

1680
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:22,725
(The third event, sled pull)

1681
00:57:22,726 --> 00:57:23,865
She's not exhausted.

1682
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:25,196
Close to your hands here.

1683
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:26,425
That's it. Good.

1684
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:27,695
(The fourth event, burpee jumps)

1685
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:28,996
- One, two.
- Go.

1686
00:57:29,096 --> 00:57:30,305
(The fifth event, rowing)

1687
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:31,436
Pace.

1688
00:57:32,036 --> 00:57:33,536
Uie has great stamina.

1689
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,136
- Follow her.
- Go.

1690
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:38,276
- Don't fall too far behind.
- Follow her.

1691
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:39,406
She hasn't recovered yet.

1692
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:41,116
(Groaning)

1693
00:57:41,846 --> 00:57:42,846
(Sighing)

1694
00:57:44,446 --> 00:57:47,556
(Panting)

1695
00:57:47,886 --> 00:57:49,555
You're doing well.

1696
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:51,056
(The seventh event, sandbag lunge)

1697
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:54,956
(Iron Girls are getting exhausted from the intense physical training.)

1698
00:57:59,066 --> 00:58:00,365
Sae Rok, you're doing a great job.

1699
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,465
(Through this challenge, )

1700
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:07,236
(they have to make up for their lack of stamina.)

1701
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:13,515
Okay.

1702
00:58:13,516 --> 00:58:15,715
(It's finally the last event.)

1703
00:58:15,716 --> 00:58:17,215
It's the wall balls. Ready.

1704
00:58:17,216 --> 00:58:18,545
(The scary wall balls)

1705
00:58:18,546 --> 00:58:19,946
Ready. Focus.

1706
00:58:21,156 --> 00:58:22,556
- Okay. Good. One.
- One.

1707
00:58:23,286 --> 00:58:24,356
- Two.
- Two.

1708
00:58:25,426 --> 00:58:26,866
- In Ah, are you all right?
- Three.

1709
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:28,355
- Do you want me to do it?
- Harder.

1710
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:29,896
- No.
- Harder.

1711
00:58:30,126 --> 00:58:31,925
(Uie maintains a steady pace until the end.)

1712
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,295
Five. Higher.

1713
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:35,096
- Go, Uie!
- Oh, dear.

1714
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:37,605
- Be careful.
- Watch out for your knees.

1715
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:38,635
The last one.

1716
00:58:38,636 --> 00:58:39,865
Okay.

1717
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:41,182
(The fitness race mini game is over.)

1718
00:58:41,206 --> 00:58:44,875
Well done. You did a great job.

1719
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:47,516
They did better throwing wall balls than in practice.

1720
00:58:47,846 --> 00:58:48,916
Both teams.

1721
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,216
(Panting)

1722
00:58:51,846 --> 00:58:53,355
They are completely worn out.

1723
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:56,386
(Can we really do this?)

1724
00:58:58,456 --> 00:58:59,656
Spare me.

1725
00:59:00,856 --> 00:59:02,555
- Earlier...
- Spare me.

1726
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:05,625
Actually, when I talked to Sae Rok, she wouldn't say anything.

1727
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,666
So I thought she was upset with me.

1728
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:09,165
Sae Rok, can you come?

1729
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:11,965
(Groaning)

1730
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,006
Can't you do it now?

1731
00:59:13,206 --> 00:59:16,176
(Groaning)

1732
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:18,806
Shall we run a little faster? What do you think?

1733
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:21,375
(Panting)

1734
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:22,476
Can you do it?

1735
00:59:23,646 --> 00:59:24,686
Can you?

1736
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:28,555
- Answer me.
- You can do it if you run slowly.

1737
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:30,786
(Uie, I just can't talk.)

1738
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:34,296
How could she even talk while doing all that?

1739
00:59:34,596 --> 00:59:36,255
- She kept...
- She didn't answer me.

1740
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:38,865
She kept asking me questions, so it was hard.

1741
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,895
She asked you questions?

1742
00:59:39,896 --> 00:59:41,536
I was really upset...

1743
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,665
because Uie still had some energy left,

1744
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:45,365
but I kept slowing her down.

1745
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:46,936
It was really upsetting.

1746
00:59:47,276 --> 00:59:50,606
Since it's a team match, the one who falls behind...

1747
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:52,905
feels bad for the one who's going ahead.

1748
00:59:52,906 --> 00:59:54,215
So some people overwork themselves...

1749
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,175
and end up failing to finish the race.

1750
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,116
It's important to pace yourselves.

1751
00:59:58,316 --> 01:00:00,815
In Ah is good on this team,

1752
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:02,816
and Uie is good on this team.

1753
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:04,455
We divided you into two teams...

1754
01:00:04,456 --> 01:00:06,255
so the better ones will lead their teammates...

1755
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:08,125
- and build teamwork.
- Okay.

1756
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:09,196
It's okay to go slow.

1757
01:00:09,296 --> 01:00:11,295
Finishing the race itself...

1758
01:00:11,296 --> 01:00:13,566
can be very difficult.

1759
01:00:13,636 --> 01:00:14,996
Let's just try to survive.

1760
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:16,195
Don't get injured.

1761
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:17,206
Right.

1762
01:00:18,966 --> 01:00:20,575
(Two days later)

1763
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:23,336
(Incheon)

1764
01:00:24,946 --> 01:00:27,376
(The day of the global fitness race)

1765
01:00:27,676 --> 01:00:29,776
(6am)

1766
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:34,886
(Thousands of people fill the venue in the morning.)

1767
01:00:35,786 --> 01:00:39,826
(People who love exercise...)

1768
01:00:41,356 --> 01:00:46,726
(have gathered together from all over the world.)

1769
01:00:47,496 --> 01:00:53,576
(The venue is filled with fervent enthusiasm.)

1770
01:00:54,036 --> 01:00:56,275
(3 hours before the race)

1771
01:00:56,276 --> 01:00:58,245
- Hello.
- Hello.

1772
01:00:58,246 --> 01:00:59,845
(Iron Girls join the heated race.)

1773
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:01,076
Hello.

1774
01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:02,815
Are you all feeling good?

1775
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:04,015
It will be easier to find someone who's feeling good.

1776
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:05,685
- You are...
- Me!

1777
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:07,256
Okay.

1778
01:01:07,316 --> 01:01:08,485
By the way,

1779
01:01:08,486 --> 01:01:10,625
on my way here, I saw...

1780
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:12,825
- a lot of people warming up.
- Right.

1781
01:01:12,826 --> 01:01:14,095
And why are they all topless?

1782
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:16,055
I think all the elite athletes,

1783
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:17,525
- former special forces soldiers, - How cool.

1784
01:01:17,526 --> 01:01:18,925
And those who think...

1785
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:21,566
they are athletic and strong are gathered here.

1786
01:01:22,196 --> 01:01:23,905
There's not a single person who is not athletic.

1787
01:01:23,906 --> 01:01:25,735
- Healthy Korea.
- They all are here.

1788
01:01:25,736 --> 01:01:27,535
They want to show something here.

1789
01:01:27,536 --> 01:01:29,606
And they want to beat Hong Beom Seok.

1790
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:31,175
Seriously.

1791
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:32,875
I'm serious. Right?

1792
01:01:32,876 --> 01:01:35,846
I feel a lot of pressure. It's worse when it takes place in Korea.

1793
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:37,385
That's so cool.

1794
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:41,155
First, the venue is incredibly large.

1795
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,215
It's unbelievable.

1796
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:44,685
It's a global fitness race.

1797
01:01:44,686 --> 01:01:45,955
A lot of people came from abroad.

1798
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:46,995
That's amazing.

1799
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:48,696
More than 4,000 people...

1800
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,225
are participating today.

1801
01:01:50,226 --> 01:01:51,325
(The number of participants is over 4,000.)

1802
01:01:51,326 --> 01:01:52,896
For the female double,

1803
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:56,235
a total of 233 teams are participating.

1804
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:57,365
- There are 233 teams.
- A total of 233 teams?

1805
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,335
- That's a lot.
- That's a lot.

1806
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:02,236
Once you get in there, you will probably...

1807
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:04,445
- be overwhelmed by the atmosphere.
- We will be overwhelmed.

1808
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:06,346
And you may feel more competitive.

1809
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:11,115
I came here wanting to play safe,

1810
01:02:11,116 --> 01:02:13,315
but now that I'm seeing a lot of people here,

1811
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,155
that makes me want to try even harder.

1812
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:17,755
I'm instilled with a competitive spirit.

1813
01:02:17,756 --> 01:02:19,225
Since this is your first time...

1814
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:20,525
participating in the race,

1815
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:22,055
- We shouldn't get carried away.
- your goal is to finish it.

1816
01:02:22,056 --> 01:02:23,765
Don't get carried away and remain calm.

1817
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:26,726
You should start slowly to the point where you wonder...

1818
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:28,565
if it is really okay to do so.

1819
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:30,705
And if you feel okay, you can speed up a little.

1820
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,236
That should be your strategy.

1821
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,275
This is a timing chip.

1822
01:02:34,276 --> 01:02:35,705
It has a sensor on it.

1823
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:37,122
This reminds me of the triathlon race.

1824
01:02:37,146 --> 01:02:38,675
I'm scared of timing chips.

1825
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:40,146
I've never done it.

1826
01:02:40,276 --> 01:02:41,276
You're right.

1827
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:43,645
You can wear it inside or outside.

1828
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:45,185
- It won't come off, right?
- Whatever works for you.

1829
01:02:45,186 --> 01:02:46,685
No. It won't come off.

1830
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:48,056
Is this comfortable?

1831
01:02:48,656 --> 01:02:51,226
- You're new, so you don't know.
- No.

1832
01:02:51,326 --> 01:02:53,155
Sae Rok, this is called a timing chip.

1833
01:02:53,156 --> 01:02:54,425
- I see.
- Okay?

1834
01:02:54,426 --> 01:02:55,955
- You have experience.
- Yes, ma'am.

1835
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:57,966
You are my seniors.

1836
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,125
And...

1837
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:01,165
you should write down your number on your arm.

1838
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,295
Write what?

1839
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:03,366
Your number.

1840
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:06,105
Team Younger Sisters is 160001.

1841
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,775
(The coach writes the number on their arms.)

1842
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:10,235
The 1600 means it begins at 4pm.

1843
01:03:10,236 --> 01:03:11,645
(The 1600 means it begins at 4pm.)

1844
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:12,805
Aren't we cool?

1845
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:14,546
Show us your arms.

1846
01:03:14,746 --> 01:03:16,616
That's great.

1847
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,085
Coach Hong Beom Seok...

1848
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,245
- will set a record.
- Okay.

1849
01:03:19,246 --> 01:03:20,615
You should just try to finish the course.

1850
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:22,055
Don't overtax yourselves.

1851
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:23,755
- Good.
- First,

1852
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:24,825
you need to take a look at the course.

1853
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:26,485
The course is quite complicated.

1854
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:28,525
It's important to look around the course.

1855
01:03:28,526 --> 01:03:29,956
- Okay.
- Good.

1856
01:03:30,156 --> 01:03:31,265
Let's go in.

1857
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:34,436
(2 hours before the race)

1858
01:03:36,296 --> 01:03:40,836
(It's crowded with participants and spectators.)

1859
01:03:42,336 --> 01:03:43,505
(Going into the stadium where the race will take place)

1860
01:03:43,506 --> 01:03:45,306
What do we do?

1861
01:03:45,946 --> 01:03:47,676
- Oh, no.
- Is this it?

1862
01:03:48,746 --> 01:03:50,385
Look at all these people.

1863
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:52,385
- My gosh.
- It's so crowded.

1864
01:03:52,386 --> 01:03:54,116
(An enormous crowd and excitement)

1865
01:03:55,286 --> 01:03:57,685
(The place is filled with the energy of the athletes.)

1866
01:03:57,686 --> 01:03:58,856
I'm getting goosebumps.

1867
01:03:59,156 --> 01:04:02,525
(Enjoying the exhilarating muscle pain)

1868
01:04:02,526 --> 01:04:03,696
My goodness.

1869
01:04:04,166 --> 01:04:05,366
I'm so nervous.

1870
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:09,496
(A festival for all muscular people around the world)

1871
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:14,536
(Just watching it makes your blood boil.)

1872
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:16,705
What do we do?

1873
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:18,245
Uie is burning up with passion.

1874
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:19,545
- It will be fun.
- I'm burning up too.

1875
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:21,575
- It will be a lot of fun.
- I'm really excited.

1876
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:23,746
(Iron Girls are extremely excited.)

1877
01:04:24,546 --> 01:04:26,146
This is the start line.

1878
01:04:26,616 --> 01:04:28,315
This is where you start.

1879
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:29,755
When you go in there,

1880
01:04:29,756 --> 01:04:31,185
you should find number one.

1881
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:33,956
You should know where the first event takes place.

1882
01:04:34,026 --> 01:04:36,796
You should know where to go after running.

1883
01:04:37,826 --> 01:04:40,126
(Introducing the global fitness race stadium)

1884
01:04:41,736 --> 01:04:44,106
(The start zone)

1885
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:46,565
(The start zone)

1886
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:47,605
After you start...

1887
01:04:47,606 --> 01:04:49,805
(After running 1km from the start zone)

1888
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:51,606
It's called the In Arch.

1889
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:53,346
You should go in there.

1890
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:56,316
It says number one.

1891
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,545
Go through the arch...

1892
01:04:57,546 --> 01:04:59,246
and start from the innermost part.

1893
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:02,055
Once you enter arch number one,

1894
01:05:02,056 --> 01:05:03,216
you can start right away.

1895
01:05:04,826 --> 01:05:07,696
(Fitness Race Layout)

1896
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:10,326
(After finishing the skiing, )

1897
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:13,796
(they go to the running course again!)

1898
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:17,866
(After running 1km, they move on to the next event.)

1899
01:05:18,636 --> 01:05:20,335
(After each event, )

1900
01:05:20,336 --> 01:05:24,346
(they repeat the 1km run!)

1901
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:26,275
(After running 1km again, )

1902
01:05:26,276 --> 01:05:27,815
(they move on to the 2nd event.)

1903
01:05:27,816 --> 01:05:29,345
(After running 1km again, )

1904
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:31,215
(they move on to the 3rd event.)

1905
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,645
(Burpee jump, rowing)

1906
01:05:32,646 --> 01:05:33,885
(Farmer's carry, sandbag lunges)

1907
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:35,986
(Wall balls)

1908
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:40,695
(It's a competition with 8 events.)

1909
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:41,696
(Iron Girls)

1910
01:05:41,697 --> 01:05:43,195
(After checking the course, they look around the stadium.)

1911
01:05:43,196 --> 01:05:44,966
That's 24kg.

1912
01:05:46,096 --> 01:05:47,196
That's 24kg.

1913
01:05:47,536 --> 01:05:48,595
And they are running.

1914
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:50,076
- None of them are walking.
- I know.

1915
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,735
That's impressive.

1916
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:52,736
(How cool.)

1917
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:55,075
(Mustering up all their energy, )

1918
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,605
Rowing.

1919
01:05:56,606 --> 01:05:58,606
(the athletes focus on the competition.)

1920
01:05:59,076 --> 01:06:01,476
It will be so much fun.

1921
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:03,376
I can't wait to do it.

1922
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:07,255
(Bringing up the stamina)

1923
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:08,756
Good luck!

1924
01:06:10,286 --> 01:06:11,485
They are so cool.

1925
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:13,206
(Things are getting heated in the stadium.)

1926
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:14,495
My blood is boiling.

1927
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:15,625
I'm feeling the same way!

1928
01:06:15,626 --> 01:06:16,795
This is driving me crazy!

1929
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,266
My blood is boiling.

1930
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:20,836
(While Team Younger Sisters' blood is boiling, )

1931
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:24,736
(Sae Rok looks nervous before her first competition.)

1932
01:06:24,936 --> 01:06:26,466
When there's the start line,

1933
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:27,935
should I stay behind the line?

1934
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:29,635
You should do a burpee behind the line...

1935
01:06:29,636 --> 01:06:30,945
and get up.

1936
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:33,305
What if there's no 4kg ball?

1937
01:06:33,306 --> 01:06:34,645
What is there's no 4kg ball?

1938
01:06:34,646 --> 01:06:37,285
There will be a judge behind you.

1939
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:38,386
Look. They are there.

1940
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,186
If there are none, you can ask them for it.

1941
01:06:41,586 --> 01:06:43,162
- The course is really difficult.
- It's so confusing.

1942
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:45,926
Sae Rok, I know you watched the video.

1943
01:06:45,986 --> 01:06:49,196
The innermost lane is for those who run fast.

1944
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:51,095
We won't be running in that lane.

1945
01:06:51,096 --> 01:06:52,265
So, first...

1946
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:54,466
- We just need to run slow together.
- Okay.

1947
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:57,035
Let's warm up and get ready.

1948
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:58,566
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1949
01:06:59,336 --> 01:07:00,675
Keep your legs straight and run forward like this.

1950
01:07:00,676 --> 01:07:01,836
Jump lightly.

1951
01:07:02,336 --> 01:07:03,336
Lightly.

1952
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:06,045
Okay.

1953
01:07:06,046 --> 01:07:07,326
(They warm up with a light jog.)

1954
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,216
Oh, dear.

1955
01:07:09,676 --> 01:07:10,916
I'm tired already.

1956
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:13,415
My lungs aren't supposed to be in pain already, right?

1957
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:14,815
You should get your breathing up...

1958
01:07:14,816 --> 01:07:16,155
so you won't be too tired later.

1959
01:07:16,156 --> 01:07:17,602
(It's tough, but they should get their breathing up now.)

1960
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:18,626
(10 minutes before the race)

1961
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,826
Now it's time.

1962
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:23,755
The coach and I...

1963
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:25,465
can't go in there.

1964
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:26,825
Pull yourselves together.

1965
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:28,395
I'll see you after the race.

1966
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:30,136
We will be outside cheering for you.

1967
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:31,735
Let's cheer together.

1968
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:33,442
- Wishing they'll finish the course.
- To finish the course.

1969
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,075
- Finish!
- Iron!

1970
01:07:35,076 --> 01:07:37,245
- Girls!
- Go!

1971
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:38,306
Guys.

1972
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,075
Don't get hurt.

1973
01:07:40,076 --> 01:07:42,076
- Okay?
- Don't get carried away. Stay calm.

1974
01:07:42,116 --> 01:07:44,115
Talk to your teammate about your pace.

1975
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:45,596
- Don't get injured.
- Let's do this.

1976
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:50,456
(1 minute before the race)

1977
01:07:50,826 --> 01:07:53,286
(Iron Girls are finally standing at the start line.)

1978
01:07:54,056 --> 01:07:55,895
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

1979
01:07:55,896 --> 01:07:57,465
(Bringing up the energy before the start)

1980
01:07:57,466 --> 01:08:00,066
(Feeling nervous alone)

1981
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,536
Don't mind the people behind you.

1982
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,666
We just need to finish the race.

1983
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,675
(Team Younger Sisters is excited already.)

1984
01:08:10,676 --> 01:08:12,375
Teams. Ten,

1985
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:13,475
nine,

1986
01:08:13,476 --> 01:08:14,476
- eight, - Eight,

1987
01:08:14,477 --> 01:08:15,515
- seven, - seven,

1988
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:16,516
- six, - six,

1989
01:08:16,516 --> 01:08:17,516
- five, - five,

1990
01:08:17,516 --> 01:08:18,516
- four, - four,

1991
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:19,545
- three, - three,

1992
01:08:19,546 --> 01:08:21,216
- two, one.
- two, one.

1993
01:08:21,616 --> 01:08:24,356
(The race starts.)

1994
01:08:27,226 --> 01:08:28,696
There they go.

1995
01:08:28,796 --> 01:08:30,765
(Iron Girls)

1996
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:32,295
- Good luck!
- You can do this!

1997
01:08:32,296 --> 01:08:34,295
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

1998
01:08:34,296 --> 01:08:36,335
(They run with a lot of people in the race.)

1999
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:38,405
(Team Younger Sisters, Team Big Sisters)

2000
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:41,036
(This race begins...)

2001
01:08:41,776 --> 01:08:45,076
(with the 1km run before the 1st event.)

2002
01:08:46,076 --> 01:08:48,015
It's not too fast. It's perfect for me.

2003
01:08:48,016 --> 01:08:49,545
- I'm good too.
- Okay.

2004
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,116
(Team Younger Sisters checks the pace.)

2005
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:54,286
(Team Big Sisters is following closely behind.)

2006
01:08:54,586 --> 01:08:56,786
The pace is good now. It's okay.

2007
01:08:57,086 --> 01:08:59,626
It took us 2 minutes to complete 1 lap.

2008
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:01,125
Are you all right?

2009
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:02,126
Yes.

2010
01:09:03,426 --> 01:09:05,925
- Go! You can do this!
- Let's go!

2011
01:09:05,926 --> 01:09:08,035
- Good.
- Good.

2012
01:09:08,036 --> 01:09:10,065
- Three minutes.
- Good pace.

2013
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:11,605
- They're doing well.
- It's a good pace.

2014
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,765
They seem relaxed,

2015
01:09:12,766 --> 01:09:14,436
- but they aren't slow.
- Right.

2016
01:09:15,436 --> 01:09:16,676
Let's go in.

2017
01:09:16,936 --> 01:09:17,976
Good.

2018
01:09:18,976 --> 01:09:22,076
(What's the 1st event after the 1km run?)

2019
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:26,846
(Event 1: Skiing)

2020
01:09:27,786 --> 01:09:30,456
(A feast of burning back muscles)

2021
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:31,785
(Boxing strength tip:)

2022
01:09:31,786 --> 01:09:34,926
(The ski machine helps strengthen back muscles for torso rotation.)

2023
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:37,326
Start.

2024
01:09:37,766 --> 01:09:39,726
(In Ah of Team Younger Sisters starts first.)

2025
01:09:40,196 --> 01:09:42,736
(Whirring)

2026
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:45,005
It's 50.

2027
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:48,535
(Strong In Ah is exploding from the start.)

2028
01:09:48,536 --> 01:09:49,875
It's too fast.

2029
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:51,076
In Ah.

2030
01:09:52,406 --> 01:09:56,316
(She's even smiling.)

2031
01:09:57,146 --> 01:09:59,916
(When her partner Ju Hyun gets tired)

2032
01:10:00,116 --> 01:10:01,416
Let me know if you can't do it.

2033
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,956
(Because I can do it all!)

2034
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:11,296
(Feeling reassured)

2035
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:14,896
(Meanwhile, Team Big Sisters arrives.)

2036
01:10:16,596 --> 01:10:22,036
(Pulling it down in a single motion with their long arms)

2037
01:10:24,046 --> 01:10:27,275
(Saving up stamina by taking short turns)

2038
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:28,316
Switch.

2039
01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:32,145
(While that was happening, )

2040
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:33,685
Done!

2041
01:10:33,686 --> 01:10:35,356
(Team Younger Sisters is done skiing.)

2042
01:10:36,856 --> 01:10:38,686
Done. Let's go.

2043
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:40,856
Shake your arms.

2044
01:10:41,096 --> 01:10:42,855
(Back to running 1km)

2045
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:44,126
Let's do this.

2046
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:47,066
- We're doing well.
- Good.

2047
01:10:49,136 --> 01:10:51,306
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2048
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:55,135
(Motivational claps)

2049
01:10:55,136 --> 01:10:57,545
(Clapping along)

2050
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:58,605
(Cheering)

2051
01:10:58,606 --> 01:11:00,446
(Their dopamine is kicking in.)

2052
01:11:00,846 --> 01:11:02,276
- It's fun.
- This is really fun.

2053
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,245
- Since we're running together, - Right?

2054
01:11:04,246 --> 01:11:06,386
- it's less lonely.
- I like that it's indoors.

2055
01:11:07,286 --> 01:11:08,585
(Team Younger Sisters)

2056
01:11:08,586 --> 01:11:12,326
(Unlike the triathlon that they had to do alone)

2057
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:13,925
- It's fun.
- It's fun.

2058
01:11:13,926 --> 01:11:15,726
- It's fun.
- I know, right?

2059
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,026
- Let's not get excited.
- Okay.

2060
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,866
Keep me under control.

2061
01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:21,566
- We're doing this together.
- Okay.

2062
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,636
(What's the next event they have to do?)

2063
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,336
(Event 2: Sled push)

2064
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:32,046
(Push 102kg with your whole body)

2065
01:11:32,146 --> 01:11:34,976
(Sled push helps develop lower body muscles for better footwork)

2066
01:11:36,216 --> 01:11:39,946
(Strong In Ah starts once again.)

2067
01:11:42,056 --> 01:11:45,155
(Pushing the 102kg sled without a problem)

2068
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:46,525
Let's go!

2069
01:11:46,526 --> 01:11:48,396
(Breathing in and out)

2070
01:11:48,696 --> 01:11:50,055
Nice.

2071
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,266
(I'm a lioness right now.)

2072
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:56,595
One more time? Can you do it?

2073
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:58,236
- One more time? Can you do it?
- Switch.

2074
01:11:58,736 --> 01:11:59,806
Don't overdo it.

2075
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:01,476
She's doing the whole lap.

2076
01:12:02,336 --> 01:12:03,806
We can switch, In Ah.

2077
01:12:04,876 --> 01:12:07,146
(In Ah summons her strength in an instant.)

2078
01:12:08,046 --> 01:12:10,716
(Leave the strength to me.)

2079
01:12:11,346 --> 01:12:13,145
(After giving it her all)

2080
01:12:13,146 --> 01:12:14,216
Switch.

2081
01:12:15,356 --> 01:12:18,456
(Switching as soon as her partner gets tired)

2082
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:24,366
(Each of them is giving her very best.)

2083
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:27,196
Switch, In Ah.

2084
01:12:28,036 --> 01:12:29,095
Let's switch, In Ah.

2085
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:31,736
(They continue to rely on each other.)

2086
01:12:32,466 --> 01:12:34,175
Good. You're doing great.

2087
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:35,416
(One step closer to the finish)

2088
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:39,876
We're done, right?

2089
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:42,475
- You can do it!
- Let's go!

2090
01:12:42,476 --> 01:12:45,616
(Team Younger Sisters is done sled pushing.)

2091
01:12:46,816 --> 01:12:47,856
Oh, gosh.

2092
01:12:50,016 --> 01:12:51,056
Do you want some water?

2093
01:12:51,856 --> 01:12:53,026
I used too much energy.

2094
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:55,925
(Being a big sister)

2095
01:12:55,926 --> 01:12:58,966
(Giving In Ah, who worked hard, water first)

2096
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:02,966
(After catching their breath, they start the next 1km run.)

2097
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,706
(Meanwhile, Team Big Sisters is sled pushing.)

2098
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,706
(It's not easy even for Stamina Queen Uie.)

2099
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:11,106
- Uie.
- Two, one.

2100
01:13:12,246 --> 01:13:14,946
(Why did Sae Rok stop Uie?)

2101
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,515
(During the preview lesson 2 days earlier)

2102
01:13:17,516 --> 01:13:19,515
(Groaning)

2103
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:20,685
You're good.

2104
01:13:20,686 --> 01:13:22,986
(Sae Rok became the ace of sled pushing.)

2105
01:13:23,016 --> 01:13:25,786
(I'll do everything else, so you do this!)

2106
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:31,096
(Moving forward with grunts)

2107
01:13:31,726 --> 01:13:33,665
(Leave the pushing to Exclaiming Rok.)

2108
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:34,866
Just a little bit more.

2109
01:13:36,236 --> 01:13:37,295
Okay.

2110
01:13:37,296 --> 01:13:38,405
(Team Big Sisters is done sled pushing.)

2111
01:13:38,406 --> 01:13:40,105
- Let's go. Are you okay?
- Yes.

2112
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:42,406
(Sae Rok used up all her strength.)

2113
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:44,975
(They move on to the 1km run.)

2114
01:13:44,976 --> 01:13:47,136
Don't worry. All we need to do is complete the course.

2115
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:48,646
I'll also give it my all.

2116
01:13:49,016 --> 01:13:50,146
Are we going too fast?

2117
01:13:50,746 --> 01:13:51,786
Is it okay?

2118
01:13:52,046 --> 01:13:55,016
How can she talk while doing all that?

2119
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,286
Just listen, okay?

2120
01:13:57,726 --> 01:13:59,656
I have enough stamina.

2121
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:02,196
I'll do the pulling twice.

2122
01:14:02,496 --> 01:14:05,326
If you want to walk, let me know. Okay?

2123
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:06,526
Okay.

2124
01:14:06,866 --> 01:14:10,436
You're good at everything except running, right?

2125
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:13,006
- Take long, deep breaths.
- Got it.

2126
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:15,805
Good. We're doing great.

2127
01:14:15,806 --> 01:14:16,905
(Clapping)

2128
01:14:16,906 --> 01:14:19,675
- Let's go.
- Let's enjoy it.

2129
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:21,215
- Let's have fun.
- Yes.

2130
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:22,546
We're almost done.

2131
01:14:22,976 --> 01:14:24,546
Don't give up.

2132
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:26,685
Here they come. In Ah and Ju Hyun.

2133
01:14:26,686 --> 01:14:27,986
(What's the third event?)

2134
01:14:28,456 --> 01:14:31,956
(Event 3: Sled pull)

2135
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:34,496
(This time, they must pull 78kg!)

2136
01:14:34,526 --> 01:14:37,796
(Sled pull helps develop the forearm muscles needed for punching.)

2137
01:14:37,996 --> 01:14:39,966
(Strong In Ah pulls first.)

2138
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,366
(Sliding)

2139
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:47,636
(Pumping her forearm muscles up while gritting her teeth)

2140
01:14:48,506 --> 01:14:49,506
Oh, my.

2141
01:14:50,076 --> 01:14:52,376
Nice.

2142
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,076
Let's go.

2143
01:14:55,077 --> 01:14:56,446
(They run to the other side.)

2144
01:14:56,776 --> 01:14:57,816
Me first?

2145
01:14:58,046 --> 01:14:59,086
One more time?

2146
01:15:03,186 --> 01:15:05,886
(Strong In Ah is on a roll.)

2147
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:07,925
(A face like that of a lioness spotting its prey)

2148
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:10,126
(Amazed)

2149
01:15:10,596 --> 01:15:11,966
We can switch, In Ah.

2150
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:13,495
Switch.

2151
01:15:13,496 --> 01:15:15,266
(Meanwhile)

2152
01:15:16,236 --> 01:15:18,605
(Exclaiming Rok is hard at work again.)

2153
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:19,636
(Grunting)

2154
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:20,806
(Moaning)

2155
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:22,006
(Grunting)

2156
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:23,776
- Shall we switch?
- No.

2157
01:15:25,106 --> 01:15:28,446
(She tries to squeeze out all her strength.)

2158
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:32,546
(Team Younger Sisters is 3m before completion.)

2159
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:35,455
(Team Younger Sisters is done sled pulling.)

2160
01:15:35,456 --> 01:15:37,186
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

2161
01:15:37,786 --> 01:15:39,985
In Ah and Ju Hyun are off.

2162
01:15:39,986 --> 01:15:41,296
(They start the next 1 km run.)

2163
01:15:41,796 --> 01:15:45,396
(Her grunts have weakened.)

2164
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:51,165
Uie. I can't do it.

2165
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,906
- It's okay.
- Why won't it move?

2166
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:54,875
Are you okay?

2167
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:56,906
(Uie takes over.)

2168
01:15:58,376 --> 01:15:59,946
(Flopping down)

2169
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:03,376
(The pushing and pulling has drained her.)

2170
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:07,316
(I'll finish it!)

2171
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:10,885
(Stamina is all I have left.)

2172
01:16:10,886 --> 01:16:12,926
The last pull!

2173
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:18,095
(Team Big Sisters is done sled pulling.)

2174
01:16:18,096 --> 01:16:19,096
Let's do this.

2175
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:23,966
(Meanwhile, Team Younger Sisters)

2176
01:16:25,006 --> 01:16:26,805
My side hurts a bit. Can we walk?

2177
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:28,135
- Yes. Go ahead.
- Just a bit.

2178
01:16:28,136 --> 01:16:30,135
Okay. Breathe slowly.

2179
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:31,336
(In Ah's side suddenly hurts.)

2180
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:33,175
Breathe in with your nose.

2181
01:16:33,176 --> 01:16:34,816
(Being a big sister)

2182
01:16:35,276 --> 01:16:36,346
Hold on.

2183
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:39,985
(Ju Hyun stays with In Ah to keep her patient.)

2184
01:16:39,986 --> 01:16:42,415
Slowly.

2185
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:44,455
All good. Let's run lightly. Thanks.

2186
01:16:44,456 --> 01:16:46,255
(They start running again.)

2187
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:47,626
Go slowly.

2188
01:16:48,026 --> 01:16:49,126
I feel much better.

2189
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:52,295
I'll go first.

2190
01:16:52,296 --> 01:16:53,996
- Catch your breath.
- Okay.

2191
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,295
(What's the fourth event?)

2192
01:16:56,296 --> 01:16:57,396
(Team Younger Sisters)

2193
01:16:57,836 --> 01:17:01,735
(Event 4: Burpee broad jump)

2194
01:17:01,736 --> 01:17:03,875
(Burpee broad jumps, a full-body exercise, )

2195
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:05,516
(helps improve cardiovascular endurance.)

2196
01:17:05,576 --> 01:17:06,905
(Team Younger Sisters)

2197
01:17:06,906 --> 01:17:10,116
(This time, Ju Hyun goes first.)

2198
01:17:12,716 --> 01:17:14,115
Ju Hyun is good at it.

2199
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:15,886
(For In Ah, who kept using her stamina, )

2200
01:17:16,356 --> 01:17:20,086
(Ju Hyun keeps going.)

2201
01:17:20,786 --> 01:17:21,795
Goodness!

2202
01:17:21,796 --> 01:17:24,566
(I'll take care of this one.)

2203
01:17:24,926 --> 01:17:26,066
Enough, Ju Hyun.

2204
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:28,636
(Worried)

2205
01:17:28,966 --> 01:17:31,366
I'm okay. I can do it all.

2206
01:17:34,136 --> 01:17:36,675
This is the toughest one. Finish this, and the rest will be easy.

2207
01:17:36,676 --> 01:17:38,076
The rest is easy.

2208
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:41,515
Ju Hyun is tired, but when she's focused,

2209
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:42,775
she's good.

2210
01:17:42,776 --> 01:17:44,175
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

2211
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:45,985
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

2212
01:17:45,986 --> 01:17:49,555
(A dopamine rush)

2213
01:17:49,556 --> 01:17:50,685
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

2214
01:17:50,686 --> 01:17:54,026
(With Ju Hyun's effort, they're already at the halfway point.)

2215
01:17:54,756 --> 01:17:58,396
(In Ah, having recovered her stamina quickly, takes over.)

2216
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:03,236
(While Team Younger Sisters is halfway through the race)

2217
01:18:04,196 --> 01:18:05,505
(Team Big Sisters)

2218
01:18:05,506 --> 01:18:06,805
You're doing really well.

2219
01:18:06,806 --> 01:18:08,376
(Team Big Sisters)

2220
01:18:09,036 --> 01:18:10,705
Leave the burpee to me.

2221
01:18:10,706 --> 01:18:12,176
I think I can do it.

2222
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,876
I can breathe while running.

2223
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:17,916
Keep breathing behind me, okay?

2224
01:18:18,586 --> 01:18:20,086
I'll do as much as I can.

2225
01:18:22,116 --> 01:18:23,316
- Uie.
- Yes?

2226
01:18:23,586 --> 01:18:25,285
(Sae Rok talks for the first time.)

2227
01:18:25,286 --> 01:18:26,325
I...

2228
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:27,386
(Breathing heavily)

2229
01:18:28,296 --> 01:18:30,995
tied my shoes too tightly.

2230
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:32,526
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

2231
01:18:32,626 --> 01:18:34,306
I didn't know you were in pain. I'm sorry.

2232
01:18:35,466 --> 01:18:36,896
So you tied it too tightly.

2233
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:42,236
(As soon as they finish running, Uie pulls Sae Rok into a corner.)

2234
01:18:42,536 --> 01:18:43,706
How is it now?

2235
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,105
- How does it feel now?
- Much better.

2236
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:47,376
- Much better?
- Yes.

2237
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:49,246
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

2238
01:18:49,846 --> 01:18:50,916
All good?

2239
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,045
Let's go. Okay.

2240
01:18:53,046 --> 01:18:54,046
(Let's go.)

2241
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:58,055
(Team Younger Sisters is almost done with the burpee broad jump.)

2242
01:18:58,056 --> 01:18:59,885
- You can do it!
- You're doing well!

2243
01:18:59,886 --> 01:19:01,855
- Come on!
- Come on!

2244
01:19:01,856 --> 01:19:03,725
(Team Younger Sisters is done with burpee broad jumping.)

2245
01:19:03,726 --> 01:19:04,766
Let's go.

2246
01:19:05,096 --> 01:19:06,996
- We're halfway done.
- Really?

2247
01:19:07,796 --> 01:19:09,936
- Is your side okay?
- I'm totally fine.

2248
01:19:10,196 --> 01:19:11,605
You overdid it just now, Ju Hyun.

2249
01:19:11,606 --> 01:19:12,906
No, I'm okay.

2250
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:14,936
Thanks to you, I'm all better now.

2251
01:19:15,976 --> 01:19:17,176
This is what teamwork is.

2252
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:18,875
Okay. Let's do this!

2253
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:20,006
(This is what teamwork is.)

2254
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:24,116
(Team Big Sisters starts the burpee broad jump.)

2255
01:19:26,786 --> 01:19:30,116
(Uie, who still has stamina, goes first.)

2256
01:19:31,156 --> 01:19:33,256
(Easy)

2257
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:40,196
(Uie completes the long distance by herself without a hitch.)

2258
01:19:41,096 --> 01:19:42,766
Uie. I'll do the rest.

2259
01:19:45,436 --> 01:19:48,506
(For the exhausted Sae Rok, Uie tries to do more.)

2260
01:19:48,806 --> 01:19:50,706
(But she must also be tired.)

2261
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,145
Uie. I'll do the rest, okay?

2262
01:19:56,146 --> 01:19:57,666
No. Let's switch at the halfway point.

2263
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:01,586
(Doing another burpee for Sae Rok)

2264
01:20:02,686 --> 01:20:04,926
(As soon as Uie reaches the halfway point, )

2265
01:20:05,286 --> 01:20:06,525
(Sae Rok takes the lead...)

2266
01:20:06,526 --> 01:20:07,785
(to stop Uie from doing more.)

2267
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:09,255
You're almost done!

2268
01:20:09,256 --> 01:20:11,626
(Uie, leave it to me now.)

2269
01:20:14,466 --> 01:20:15,496
(Grunting)

2270
01:20:15,836 --> 01:20:16,836
(Breathing heavily)

2271
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:21,476
(Doing the burpee broad jumps with grunts)

2272
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:23,606
Let's switch, Sae Rok.

2273
01:20:24,706 --> 01:20:27,446
(Even though Uie suggests switching, )

2274
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:35,786
(Sae Rok gives it her all to do more!)

2275
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:40,856
(Worried)

2276
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:42,455
Let's switch.

2277
01:20:42,456 --> 01:20:43,726
Sae Rok, breathe.

2278
01:20:43,856 --> 01:20:45,295
Breathe, Sae Rok.

2279
01:20:45,296 --> 01:20:47,336
(Worried about Sae Rok overdoing it, Uie switches.)

2280
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:52,366
(She used up all her energy down to her soul.)

2281
01:20:52,636 --> 01:20:55,506
(In the meantime, Uie finishes up.)

2282
01:20:55,736 --> 01:20:59,675
(Team Big Sisters is done with burpee broad jumping.)

2283
01:20:59,676 --> 01:21:00,805
(Uie.)

2284
01:21:00,806 --> 01:21:01,845
(Let's go...)

2285
01:21:01,846 --> 01:21:04,246
(get some water.)

2286
01:21:04,846 --> 01:21:09,855
(They quench their thirst first.)

2287
01:21:09,856 --> 01:21:10,956
Come.

2288
01:21:12,226 --> 01:21:13,286
Are you okay?

2289
01:21:13,456 --> 01:21:14,856
We've done four.

2290
01:21:16,226 --> 01:21:17,796
Listen carefully, Sae Rok.

2291
01:21:18,026 --> 01:21:20,166
I recover while running.

2292
01:21:20,466 --> 01:21:22,136
I'll do as much as possible.

2293
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:24,236
Okay? Don't feel bad about it.

2294
01:21:24,466 --> 01:21:26,005
Switch when I tell you to.

2295
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:27,035
- Got it?
- Yes.

2296
01:21:27,036 --> 01:21:28,652
(Uie wants Sae Rok to stop overdoing it.)

2297
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:29,835
Sixty left.

2298
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:31,546
(Where's Team Younger Sisters?)

2299
01:21:31,576 --> 01:21:32,675
Fifty.

2300
01:21:32,676 --> 01:21:34,346
(Doing event 5, rowing)

2301
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:35,916
(Screaming)

2302
01:21:37,946 --> 01:21:39,145
(Rowing helps strengthen the upper core and improve endurance.)

2303
01:21:39,146 --> 01:21:41,346
You're going too fast. Slow down.

2304
01:21:41,786 --> 01:21:43,815
The last one. Stop.

2305
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,286
(After squeezing out her upper core)

2306
01:21:46,056 --> 01:21:47,186
Don't talk.

2307
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:50,496
(While Ju Hyun catches her breath, )

2308
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,626
(Strong In Ah sets off.)

2309
01:21:54,026 --> 01:21:56,066
(Rowing)

2310
01:21:56,936 --> 01:22:02,076
(Simba Seol's rowing makes a completely different sound.)

2311
01:22:02,636 --> 01:22:05,046
You guys are truly amazing.

2312
01:22:05,806 --> 01:22:07,846
You still have the triathlon stamina in you.

2313
01:22:09,016 --> 01:22:10,375
(Smiling)

2314
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:11,716
You've got 20 left.

2315
01:22:12,216 --> 01:22:13,546
Just a bit more.

2316
01:22:13,746 --> 01:22:14,916
One more.

2317
01:22:15,486 --> 01:22:16,916
Last one. Done.

2318
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,586
(Cheering)

2319
01:22:19,886 --> 01:22:24,196
(Team Younger Sisters is done rowing.)

2320
01:22:25,126 --> 01:22:26,325
(Team Big Sisters appears right after.)

2321
01:22:26,326 --> 01:22:27,626
They're here.

2322
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:29,295
There's not much difference.

2323
01:22:29,296 --> 01:22:30,896
The gap isn't big. Go for it!

2324
01:22:31,506 --> 01:22:34,366
(Plopping down)

2325
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:38,206
(Sae Rok is on the verge of exhaustion.)

2326
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:41,776
(She must recover before they switch.)

2327
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:44,445
(Recharging her stamina 1:)

2328
01:22:44,446 --> 01:22:46,546
(Controlling her breathing while facing down)

2329
01:22:47,346 --> 01:22:49,115
(Recharging her stamina 2:)

2330
01:22:49,116 --> 01:22:51,056
(Lying down)

2331
01:22:51,656 --> 01:22:55,726
(Will Sae Rok be all right?)

2332
01:22:56,496 --> 01:22:57,625
Oh, gosh.

2333
01:22:57,626 --> 01:23:00,526
(No, get up.)

2334
01:23:01,466 --> 01:23:03,235
(Getting up)

2335
01:23:03,236 --> 01:23:04,765
Uie. Switch.

2336
01:23:04,766 --> 01:23:05,936
(Uie! Switch!)

2337
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:07,966
Try it, Sae Rok.

2338
01:23:08,506 --> 01:23:09,936
Let me know if you can't.

2339
01:23:10,776 --> 01:23:13,006
(Sae Rok pulls the rowing machine.)

2340
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:16,176
(Her stamina is somewhat back.)

2341
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:24,556
(Gathering all her energy...)

2342
01:23:24,826 --> 01:23:28,856
(and rowing with all her might)

2343
01:23:29,626 --> 01:23:30,795
Be careful.

2344
01:23:30,796 --> 01:23:31,896
Switch.

2345
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,595
(She can't hear a thing.)

2346
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:35,835
Switch, Sae Rok.

2347
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:38,705
(Sae Rok's fever time has ended.)

2348
01:23:38,706 --> 01:23:40,866
(Crawling)

2349
01:23:41,166 --> 01:23:44,476
(She's on the verge of exhaustion again.)

2350
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:48,276
(Help me.)

2351
01:23:50,516 --> 01:23:54,546
(While Sae Rok is recharging...)

2352
01:23:54,956 --> 01:23:56,215
(Team Younger Sisters)

2353
01:23:56,216 --> 01:23:57,555
One, two, cha.

2354
01:23:57,556 --> 01:23:58,786
Two, two, cha.

2355
01:23:58,956 --> 01:24:01,555
(The dopamine sisters are still having fun.)

2356
01:24:01,556 --> 01:24:02,925
Nice. We're almost done.

2357
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:05,495
(Those who smile through hardship are top class.)

2358
01:24:05,496 --> 01:24:07,296
- My body has warmed up.
- Same here.

2359
01:24:07,796 --> 01:24:09,335
I'm having an adrenaline rush.

2360
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:10,365
(Exploding with adrenaline)

2361
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:11,505
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2362
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:12,942
(Cheers from fellow participants...)

2363
01:24:12,966 --> 01:24:16,476
(give them a dopamine boost.)

2364
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:20,076
(The dopamine sisters fuel their will to finish.)

2365
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:22,276
(What's the next event that awaits them?)

2366
01:24:22,476 --> 01:24:25,486
(Event 6: Farmer's Carry)

2367
01:24:25,786 --> 01:24:28,755
(Carry the 32kg kettlebell!)

2368
01:24:28,756 --> 01:24:30,315
(Farmer's Carry helps build...)

2369
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:31,916
(full-body strength and core stability.)

2370
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:35,926
(Energetic)

2371
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:38,466
(I'm a pro at weightlifting.)

2372
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:41,165
(Farmer's Carry?)

2373
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,736
(I'll carry it!)

2374
01:24:44,066 --> 01:24:45,606
In Ah, don't overdo it.

2375
01:24:46,636 --> 01:24:47,766
I'm fine.

2376
01:24:48,036 --> 01:24:49,305
I'll stop over there.

2377
01:24:49,306 --> 01:24:52,046
(I don't know how not to overdo it.)

2378
01:24:52,506 --> 01:24:54,045
You can put them down, In Ah.

2379
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:55,246
(I'm right behind you, In Ah!)

2380
01:24:55,316 --> 01:24:57,546
(Then I'll take a short break.)

2381
01:24:57,876 --> 01:24:58,916
(Grunting)

2382
01:24:59,346 --> 01:25:00,416
(Grunting)

2383
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:03,816
How can you carry these?

2384
01:25:04,786 --> 01:25:06,785
(Moving 32kg isn't easy.)

2385
01:25:06,786 --> 01:25:07,955
(Ju Hyun is about to die.)

2386
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:09,226
To the left.

2387
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:10,726
(Feeling crushed)

2388
01:25:10,926 --> 01:25:12,496
I can't do it.

2389
01:25:13,726 --> 01:25:15,196
I can't do it.

2390
01:25:15,566 --> 01:25:17,095
(Dropping down)

2391
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:18,196
Well done.

2392
01:25:19,306 --> 01:25:20,866
How do you carry them?

2393
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,676
(Like this!)

2394
01:25:23,136 --> 01:25:26,445
(She carries them with an unchanged expression.)

2395
01:25:26,446 --> 01:25:28,846
(Striding)

2396
01:25:29,346 --> 01:25:32,946
(She powers through to the next event, the sandbag lunge!)

2397
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:35,415
(Overtaking the lead with great speed)

2398
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,655
- In Ah.
- Two.

2399
01:25:36,656 --> 01:25:37,815
Don't push yourself, In Ah.

2400
01:25:37,816 --> 01:25:41,226
(Passing the halfway point in the blink of an eye)

2401
01:25:41,626 --> 01:25:43,596
She's got some real guts.

2402
01:25:43,726 --> 01:25:46,296
Her face is filled with burning spirit.

2403
01:25:46,526 --> 01:25:48,766
She still has the stamina from the triathlon.

2404
01:25:48,966 --> 01:25:52,236
(Staggering)

2405
01:25:53,136 --> 01:25:56,536
(When Ju Hyun, who has a weaker lower body, struggles, )

2406
01:25:56,806 --> 01:26:00,176
(the reliable In Ah steps in to take over.)

2407
01:26:00,576 --> 01:26:01,776
I can do it.

2408
01:26:02,976 --> 01:26:04,045
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

2409
01:26:04,046 --> 01:26:05,246
(You can do it, Strong In Ah!)

2410
01:26:05,316 --> 01:26:06,686
Let's go!

2411
01:26:07,286 --> 01:26:11,055
(She pushed through with unyielding determination.)

2412
01:26:11,056 --> 01:26:13,956
(Team Younger Sisters is done with the sandbag lunge.)

2413
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:16,356
- It's the last one.
- Okay.

2414
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:18,666
- It's already the last one.
- Okay.

2415
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:20,796
Let's walk, Ju Hyun.

2416
01:26:21,066 --> 01:26:23,466
(The earlier events have worn In Ah out.)

2417
01:26:23,866 --> 01:26:25,165
My shoulders feel dead.

2418
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:27,066
(She needs to recharge.)

2419
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:28,906
What?

2420
01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:30,805
What are they doing?

2421
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:32,905
(A group of people rushes up from behind.)

2422
01:26:32,906 --> 01:26:34,276
(Startled)

2423
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,515
- You can do it, Coach!
- You can do it!

2424
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:38,716
It was Hong Beom Seok.

2425
01:26:38,886 --> 01:26:40,286
Let's hurry.

2426
01:26:40,386 --> 01:26:42,715
(Coach Hong Beom Seok, competing in the next time slot, )

2427
01:26:42,716 --> 01:26:43,755
(races ahead.)

2428
01:26:43,756 --> 01:26:44,985
Let's hurry.

2429
01:26:44,986 --> 01:26:46,226
(Recharging with dopamine)

2430
01:26:46,526 --> 01:26:47,685
Nice.

2431
01:26:47,686 --> 01:26:48,696
(Nice!)

2432
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:53,396
(They run, motivated by the coach's passion.)

2433
01:26:54,296 --> 01:26:55,666
How are the others doing?

2434
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:57,835
(Right at that moment)

2435
01:26:57,836 --> 01:26:59,536
I'll do as much as I can.

2436
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:02,605
(Team Big Sisters has started the Farmer's Carry.)

2437
01:27:02,606 --> 01:27:05,146
(Swaying)

2438
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:06,506
My knees hurt.

2439
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:09,916
(Struggling)

2440
01:27:10,146 --> 01:27:12,546
You need to stay closer to her, Sae Rok.

2441
01:27:12,986 --> 01:27:14,415
- Come, Sae Rok.
- Okay.

2442
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:15,885
- Hurry.
- I'm tired.

2443
01:27:15,886 --> 01:27:16,985
(Rushing over to Uie)

2444
01:27:16,986 --> 01:27:17,986
Nice.

2445
01:27:17,987 --> 01:27:19,555
She's struggling to catch up, even without the kettlebells.

2446
01:27:19,556 --> 01:27:21,556
Sae Rok seems worn out right now.

2447
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:24,296
(Limping while trying to catch up to Uie)

2448
01:27:24,726 --> 01:27:25,865
Uie.

2449
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,465
I'll do the next lap.

2450
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:28,796
Put them down here.

2451
01:27:28,896 --> 01:27:30,496
I can do it.

2452
01:27:31,036 --> 01:27:32,235
I'll...

2453
01:27:32,236 --> 01:27:34,466
do it, Uie.

2454
01:27:35,036 --> 01:27:36,136
Change.

2455
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:38,706
Here.

2456
01:27:38,806 --> 01:27:39,806
Go.

2457
01:27:40,306 --> 01:27:42,415
(Grunting)

2458
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:45,216
(Pushing forward with all the energy she has left)

2459
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:48,615
(Uie is worried about Sae Rok.)

2460
01:27:48,616 --> 01:27:50,316
Overdo it, and you can't run.

2461
01:27:50,856 --> 01:27:52,925
Stop at the line. Do it, okay?

2462
01:27:52,926 --> 01:27:54,086
(Following her while nagging)

2463
01:27:54,656 --> 01:27:56,595
- You still have to run.
- Right.

2464
01:27:56,596 --> 01:27:57,625
(I'm worried.)

2465
01:27:57,626 --> 01:28:01,066
(Dedicated attention)

2466
01:28:01,596 --> 01:28:02,895
Put them down there.

2467
01:28:02,896 --> 01:28:04,036
Put them down.

2468
01:28:04,766 --> 01:28:07,065
(Staggering)

2469
01:28:07,066 --> 01:28:08,936
Uie, slow down.

2470
01:28:09,106 --> 01:28:11,376
Sae Rok is struggling. Go slow.

2471
01:28:11,946 --> 01:28:13,006
Hurry.

2472
01:28:13,276 --> 01:28:15,475
(Rushing over)

2473
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:17,746
(Following Uie like a baby bird, )

2474
01:28:17,976 --> 01:28:20,215
(Sae Rok keeps it up in event 7, the sandbag lunge.)

2475
01:28:20,216 --> 01:28:21,586
(Trudging)

2476
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:23,855
Only do five. One.

2477
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:25,985
(But refusing to give up, )

2478
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:29,895
(Sae Rok holds out with willpower.)

2479
01:28:29,896 --> 01:28:31,326
Five. Switch.

2480
01:28:35,766 --> 01:28:40,865
(She doesn't even have the energy to walk.)

2481
01:28:40,866 --> 01:28:44,005
(Completely worn out)

2482
01:28:44,006 --> 01:28:48,716
(Team Big Sisters is done with the sandbag lunge.)

2483
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:51,616
The last one. This is the last one.

2484
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:54,285
The last one.

2485
01:28:54,286 --> 01:28:56,056
(Now, heading toward the very end)

2486
01:28:57,186 --> 01:29:00,856
(Uie continues to check up on Sae Rok.)

2487
01:29:01,386 --> 01:29:06,125
(She's worried about Sae Rok, who is breathing heavily.)

2488
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:07,396
Should we walk?

2489
01:29:07,826 --> 01:29:08,996
You want to keep running?

2490
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:10,336
Okay.

2491
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:16,236
Sae Rok, this is the longest run you've ever done.

2492
01:29:17,306 --> 01:29:18,606
You didn't take a single break.

2493
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:21,105
You're doing great. I'm serious.

2494
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,746
(You didn't take a single break. You're doing great. I'm serious.)

2495
01:29:23,816 --> 01:29:25,945
(In the crowd, )

2496
01:29:25,946 --> 01:29:29,916
(the two hold hands.)

2497
01:29:32,686 --> 01:29:36,325
(Relying on each other, they run for the last time.)

2498
01:29:36,326 --> 01:29:37,556
Be careful. Are you okay?

2499
01:29:37,756 --> 01:29:38,795
Are you okay?

2500
01:29:38,796 --> 01:29:40,966
(Relying on each other, they run for the last time.)

2501
01:29:43,236 --> 01:29:44,296
Sae Rok.

2502
01:29:44,866 --> 01:29:46,065
Let's complete the course, okay?

2503
01:29:46,066 --> 01:29:47,566
- Let's just focus on that.
- Okay.

2504
01:29:47,706 --> 01:29:49,105
Let's go.

2505
01:29:49,106 --> 01:29:51,106
(Let's go!)

2506
01:29:51,906 --> 01:29:53,875
(What's the next event waiting for the Iron Girls?)

2507
01:29:53,876 --> 01:29:55,592
(The last hurdle before completing the fitness race)

2508
01:29:55,616 --> 01:29:58,886
(Event 8: Wall balls)

2509
01:29:59,146 --> 01:30:01,746
(For women, throw the 4kg ball 100 times.)

2510
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:04,655
(Wall ball helps develop the deltoid muscles...)

2511
01:30:04,656 --> 01:30:06,926
(for stronger punches.)

2512
01:30:07,486 --> 01:30:08,925
(Team Younger Sisters starts the wall ball shots.)

2513
01:30:08,926 --> 01:30:11,196
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

2514
01:30:11,926 --> 01:30:14,295
(Simba Seol starts it off.)

2515
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:15,366
One.

2516
01:30:16,066 --> 01:30:17,095
Two.

2517
01:30:17,096 --> 01:30:18,265
(She calmly throws the ball up.)

2518
01:30:18,266 --> 01:30:19,336
Three.

2519
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:23,306
- Four.
- The ball must touch the panel.

2520
01:30:25,006 --> 01:30:26,806
(The ball didn't touch the panel.)

2521
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:30,946
(Focusing again)

2522
01:30:32,516 --> 01:30:33,646
No reps.

2523
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:36,216
(She failed as the ball hit the bottom of the panel.)

2524
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:37,885
(In Ah is losing strength.)

2525
01:30:37,886 --> 01:30:39,186
It's not easy.

2526
01:30:39,626 --> 01:30:41,356
The wall ball isn't easy.

2527
01:30:41,926 --> 01:30:44,425
I was told the wall ball would be the hardest.

2528
01:30:44,426 --> 01:30:46,996
We only had one day of practice. They're struggling.

2529
01:30:47,496 --> 01:30:48,795
It's the last one,

2530
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:51,266
and they've been working out for two hours. It must be tough.

2531
01:30:52,436 --> 01:30:54,765
(After taking a deep breath, )

2532
01:30:54,766 --> 01:30:56,906
(she tries again!)

2533
01:30:57,436 --> 01:31:00,576
(In Ah can't give up when she's come this far!)

2534
01:31:01,346 --> 01:31:03,916
(She keeps going without a break.)

2535
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:07,086
(Gritting her teeth and throwing it high up)

2536
01:31:08,116 --> 01:31:11,185
(Team Younger Sisters has thrown 59 times.)

2537
01:31:11,186 --> 01:31:14,185
Here they come. Uie is here.

2538
01:31:14,186 --> 01:31:15,626
They made it to the final event.

2539
01:31:15,726 --> 01:31:18,026
Sae Rok is indeed amazing.

2540
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:22,836
(Uie, still full of energy, goes first!)

2541
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:26,836
(Making great use of her height and long arms)

2542
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:31,106
(She completes 30 in an instant.)

2543
01:31:31,476 --> 01:31:33,646
(Switching with Sae Rok)

2544
01:31:34,176 --> 01:31:37,416
(However, she's already out of energy.)

2545
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:40,146
(Sae Rok can hardly stretch her arms out.)

2546
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:44,456
(From now on, it's a test of willpower.)

2547
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:49,296
(While Sae Rok is using all the strength she has left, )

2548
01:31:49,756 --> 01:31:52,026
(Team Younger Sisters has done 73.)

2549
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:53,496
(Screaming)

2550
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:54,666
No reps.

2551
01:31:55,296 --> 01:31:57,635
(4kg feels too heavy.)

2552
01:31:57,636 --> 01:31:59,066
(Staggering)

2553
01:32:02,306 --> 01:32:04,675
(Even so, )

2554
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:06,676
(she throws it up again!)

2555
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:11,045
(Even if she falls down...)

2556
01:32:11,046 --> 01:32:13,616
(again and again...)

2557
01:32:14,746 --> 01:32:16,886
(and hits a rough patch, )

2558
01:32:17,456 --> 01:32:21,426
(Ju Hyun holds out with willpower.)

2559
01:32:22,296 --> 01:32:23,556
You're doing great.

2560
01:32:24,396 --> 01:32:25,626
Last ten throws.

2561
01:32:26,926 --> 01:32:29,265
(The finish line is in sight.)

2562
01:32:29,266 --> 01:32:33,566
(But if it gets too hard, )

2563
01:32:34,336 --> 01:32:38,276
(they share the burden.)

2564
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:42,215
(We overcome it together by sharing the pain, )

2565
01:32:42,216 --> 01:32:43,746
The last one!

2566
01:32:45,246 --> 01:32:47,615
(After enduring this time together)

2567
01:32:47,616 --> 01:32:49,686
- Are we done?
- Come.

2568
01:32:50,086 --> 01:32:52,686
(Cheering)

2569
01:32:53,656 --> 01:32:56,156
(Twice the joy awaits.)

2570
01:32:57,796 --> 01:33:01,526
Great job. You're done with the race.

2571
01:33:03,096 --> 01:33:07,265
(Ju Hyun and In Ah have completed the fitness race.)

2572
01:33:07,266 --> 01:33:09,376
(1 hour and 49 minutes)

2573
01:33:09,936 --> 01:33:12,375
(Team Big Sisters has 10 throws left.)

2574
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:13,676
The last five throws.

2575
01:33:14,576 --> 01:33:15,875
(Her eyes already look empty.)

2576
01:33:15,876 --> 01:33:17,446
Five more, and we'll be done.

2577
01:33:17,616 --> 01:33:18,885
The last five.

2578
01:33:18,886 --> 01:33:20,946
(Crawling)

2579
01:33:21,186 --> 01:33:22,456
I'm beat.

2580
01:33:23,086 --> 01:33:24,115
Should I do it?

2581
01:33:24,116 --> 01:33:25,186
(Shaking her head)

2582
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:29,456
(Even though she's seconds away from passing out, )

2583
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:31,925
(Sae Rok goes again for her teammate.)

2584
01:33:31,926 --> 01:33:32,995
One.

2585
01:33:32,996 --> 01:33:34,516
(Sae Rok goes again for her teammate.)

2586
01:33:34,826 --> 01:33:35,835
Two.

2587
01:33:35,836 --> 01:33:37,665
(Stretching her arms with all her might)

2588
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:38,735
Four.

2589
01:33:38,736 --> 01:33:40,366
(Stretching her arms with all her might)

2590
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:41,635
You can do it!

2591
01:33:41,636 --> 01:33:45,705
(Throwing the ball to the final rep, without any regrets)

2592
01:33:45,706 --> 01:33:46,975
I'll do it. Let's switch.

2593
01:33:46,976 --> 01:33:51,376
(Uie wraps it up.)

2594
01:33:52,346 --> 01:33:57,016
(Sae Rok is exhausted.)

2595
01:33:58,186 --> 01:34:01,956
(In the meantime, Uie finishes the wall ball.)

2596
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:12,936
(The two run toward the finish line.)

2597
01:34:22,376 --> 01:34:25,345
(Uie and Sae Rok have completed the fitness race.)

2598
01:34:25,346 --> 01:34:26,746
(1 hour and 55 minutes)

2599
01:34:28,516 --> 01:34:31,916
(The most moved person of all)

2600
01:34:32,656 --> 01:34:36,196
(Today could've been the biggest challenge of her life.)

2601
01:34:36,926 --> 01:34:39,266
(There were times when she wanted to give up.)

2602
01:34:39,996 --> 01:34:43,536
(But Sae Rok pulled through until the end.)

2603
01:34:45,036 --> 01:34:48,635
(Crying tears of relief after finishing the race)

2604
01:34:48,636 --> 01:34:52,806
(Crying tears of relief after finishing the race)

2605
01:34:55,406 --> 01:35:01,286
(All the members of Iron Girls have completed the fitness race.)

2606
01:35:01,486 --> 01:35:04,116
- They're here.
- Great work.

2607
01:35:04,756 --> 01:35:07,386
- Good job.
- You are amazing.

2608
01:35:07,926 --> 01:35:10,325
(Well done.)

2609
01:35:10,326 --> 01:35:13,426
(In Ah rolls over to her big sisters.)

2610
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:15,965
- Great job.
- You guys are incredible.

2611
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,265
It's amazing how you completed the race.

2612
01:35:18,266 --> 01:35:19,505
You've got crazy determination.

2613
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:20,935
(As expected of Determined Sae Rok)

2614
01:35:20,936 --> 01:35:23,606
(Breathing heavily)

2615
01:35:24,106 --> 01:35:25,106
(Grunting)

2616
01:35:25,506 --> 01:35:26,546
(Grunting)

2617
01:35:26,906 --> 01:35:29,616
My legs are done. I can't move.

2618
01:35:29,876 --> 01:35:33,316
(She's still standing.)

2619
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:34,786
Uie is fine.

2620
01:35:34,986 --> 01:35:36,015
She's loosened up now.

2621
01:35:36,016 --> 01:35:37,696
(Stamina Queen Uie still has energy left.)

2622
01:35:37,756 --> 01:35:38,986
We should...

2623
01:35:39,226 --> 01:35:42,325
practice this more.

2624
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:44,125
Why? What's with the scary suggestion?

2625
01:35:44,126 --> 01:35:45,795
Because we don't have the skills, we can't pull...

2626
01:35:45,796 --> 01:35:46,865
Right.

2627
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,966
Or make the wall ball shots.

2628
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:50,336
She scares me.

2629
01:35:51,736 --> 01:35:53,336
Why don't you just become an athlete?

2630
01:35:53,966 --> 01:35:56,275
Should I sign you up again? It's like you need to do more.

2631
01:35:56,276 --> 01:35:57,606
Hurry up and do it.

2632
01:35:57,706 --> 01:35:58,736
Let's go, In Ah.

2633
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:00,706
Me?

2634
01:36:00,876 --> 01:36:03,145
- You two should try.
- Let's make a team.

2635
01:36:03,146 --> 01:36:05,245
I feel terrible for Uie.

2636
01:36:05,246 --> 01:36:06,246
Why?

2637
01:36:06,246 --> 01:36:07,246
She couldn't do anything because of me.

2638
01:36:07,247 --> 01:36:08,745
She couldn't break a sweat.

2639
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:10,285
- She didn't break a sweat?
- No.

2640
01:36:10,286 --> 01:36:11,755
(What is she?)

2641
01:36:11,756 --> 01:36:13,755
She kept up with my pace,

2642
01:36:13,756 --> 01:36:15,695
so Uie didn't sweat at all.

2643
01:36:15,696 --> 01:36:17,655
Spotting you two pumped me up.

2644
01:36:17,656 --> 01:36:19,726
- Really?
- When did you see them?

2645
01:36:20,096 --> 01:36:22,095
I didn't see the two.

2646
01:36:22,096 --> 01:36:23,636
- We cheered each other on.
- When?

2647
01:36:24,266 --> 01:36:25,866
(Let's go, guys!)

2648
01:36:26,336 --> 01:36:27,435
(You can do it, Keum Sae Rok!)

2649
01:36:27,436 --> 01:36:29,906
(She can't hear a thing.)

2650
01:36:30,506 --> 01:36:31,836
I can't recall it.

2651
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:34,276
What can you remember, Sae Rok?

2652
01:36:34,906 --> 01:36:36,876
I don't know what we've done.

2653
01:36:37,516 --> 01:36:39,385
Sae Rok looked out of it.

2654
01:36:39,386 --> 01:36:41,345
- Really?
- When we met halfway.

2655
01:36:41,346 --> 01:36:43,756
She kept going in a daze.

2656
01:36:43,816 --> 01:36:47,085
But what surprised me was that...

2657
01:36:47,086 --> 01:36:48,925
I thought Sae Rok would walk.

2658
01:36:48,926 --> 01:36:50,326
I thought she'd walk while running.

2659
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:52,795
I suggested we walk to Sae Rok.

2660
01:36:52,796 --> 01:36:53,796
"Should we walk?"

2661
01:36:54,326 --> 01:36:56,896
But she wouldn't take a break. She kept running.

2662
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,105
It's impressive that you held back from walking.

2663
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:02,005
It was my first time...

2664
01:37:02,006 --> 01:37:04,705
working out this long in years.

2665
01:37:04,706 --> 01:37:08,405
When my body started feeling heavy and I thought I couldn't keep going,

2666
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:10,175
Uie held my hand.

2667
01:37:10,176 --> 01:37:12,046
I felt both grateful and sorry.

2668
01:37:12,176 --> 01:37:15,015
Since I became...

2669
01:37:15,016 --> 01:37:17,815
a member of Iron Girls,

2670
01:37:17,816 --> 01:37:20,585
I wanted to maintain a strong mental attitude...

2671
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:24,926
and work hard to earn recognition.

2672
01:37:25,056 --> 01:37:27,125
I wanted to be a part of this team.

2673
01:37:27,126 --> 01:37:28,365
(I wanted to become a real Iron Girl.)

2674
01:37:28,366 --> 01:37:30,065
I'm seeing Sae Rok in a new light.

2675
01:37:30,066 --> 01:37:31,766
She pulled through with willpower.

2676
01:37:32,806 --> 01:37:34,466
(Amazing, Keum Sae Rok!)

2677
01:37:34,736 --> 01:37:36,176
Thank you.

2678
01:37:36,636 --> 01:37:39,575
Let's go boxing with this mindset.

2679
01:37:39,576 --> 01:37:40,576
Sorry?

2680
01:37:40,577 --> 01:37:42,276
- Right now?
- No. Not right now.

2681
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,916
Since you've worked hard, let's go eat some meat.

2682
01:37:45,246 --> 01:37:46,246
Let's go.

2683
01:37:46,386 --> 01:37:47,826
Come on. Take a commemorative photo.

2684
01:37:48,616 --> 01:37:51,856
(Done with today's special workout)

2685
01:37:52,426 --> 01:37:53,886
I'm starving.

2686
01:37:53,986 --> 01:37:56,296
- It looks good.
- Sit.

2687
01:37:56,656 --> 01:37:58,356
Great job, everyone.

2688
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:00,295
(Excited)

2689
01:38:00,296 --> 01:38:01,865
What you eat right now won't make you fat.

2690
01:38:01,866 --> 01:38:03,765
- I'm in bliss.
- You worked out for two hours.

2691
01:38:03,766 --> 01:38:05,126
- Eat as much as you want.
- Okay.

2692
01:38:05,396 --> 01:38:07,106
I want pork belly.

2693
01:38:07,336 --> 01:38:08,836
The special plate is good.

2694
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:10,476
So is grilled tripe.

2695
01:38:10,606 --> 01:38:12,135
Grilled tripe sounds good.

2696
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,845
Please give us two kimchi noodles...

2697
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:14,875
and two steamed eggs.

2698
01:38:14,876 --> 01:38:17,115
One doenjang stew and one gochujang stew.

2699
01:38:17,116 --> 01:38:19,385
Guys. We need to get the kimchi fried rice lunchbox.

2700
01:38:19,386 --> 01:38:21,386
- I want one.
- All right.

2701
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:22,755
(Flexing with a spread for 15)

2702
01:38:22,756 --> 01:38:23,886
Thank you.

2703
01:38:24,716 --> 01:38:27,485
Ma'am. Don't you have that red sauce?

2704
01:38:27,486 --> 01:38:28,885
- Do you mean the tripe sauce?
- Yes.

2705
01:38:28,886 --> 01:38:29,955
It'll be served together.

2706
01:38:29,956 --> 01:38:31,955
Dipping meat into that is delicious.

2707
01:38:31,956 --> 01:38:33,465
- Can we get a lot of it?
- You want a lot?

2708
01:38:33,466 --> 01:38:35,065
By any chance, are you an ambassador?

2709
01:38:35,066 --> 01:38:37,335
How do you know this place so well?

2710
01:38:37,336 --> 01:38:39,035
- Did you study this place?
- No.

2711
01:38:39,036 --> 01:38:40,396
(She's simply a regular customer.)

2712
01:38:40,466 --> 01:38:42,876
(The main dish, meat, is served first.)

2713
01:38:43,476 --> 01:38:46,746
(Looking delicious as soon as it arrives)

2714
01:38:48,476 --> 01:38:50,445
- How skilled.
- No joke, right?

2715
01:38:50,446 --> 01:38:51,692
(The pork belly has become bite-sized.)

2716
01:38:51,716 --> 01:38:54,645
The smell of the meat is driving me crazy.

2717
01:38:54,646 --> 01:38:55,786
(While the meat is grilling)

2718
01:38:55,886 --> 01:38:56,985
Here's your gochujang stew.

2719
01:38:56,986 --> 01:38:58,986
- Nice.
- Here's the doenjang stew.

2720
01:38:59,656 --> 01:39:00,785
- It's our favorite.
- Yes.

2721
01:39:00,786 --> 01:39:01,946
- Kimchi noodles.
- What now?

2722
01:39:02,456 --> 01:39:04,455
It's like the old-fashioned boxed lunch.

2723
01:39:04,456 --> 01:39:07,265
(Uie's favorites are kimchi fried rice and grilled tripe.)

2724
01:39:07,266 --> 01:39:08,865
Here's your steamed eggs.

2725
01:39:08,866 --> 01:39:10,395
We ordered quite a lot.

2726
01:39:10,396 --> 01:39:13,036
What? No. We'll devour them all.

2727
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:16,606
Even the kimchi is cut into bite-sized pieces.

2728
01:39:17,506 --> 01:39:19,775
This lovely smell.

2729
01:39:19,776 --> 01:39:21,706
They look amazing.

2730
01:39:22,176 --> 01:39:23,246
Thank you.

2731
01:39:23,476 --> 01:39:25,716
(Hungry Sae Rok eats first.)

2732
01:39:26,516 --> 01:39:27,516
(Impressed)

2733
01:39:30,186 --> 01:39:31,186
(Impressed)

2734
01:39:32,926 --> 01:39:35,656
(Ju Hyun wraps the meat in a garlic leaf.)

2735
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:38,095
(A round of applause)

2736
01:39:38,096 --> 01:39:39,526
- Is it good?
- Yes.

2737
01:39:40,396 --> 01:39:41,526
I could eat it all day long.

2738
01:39:42,096 --> 01:39:43,435
This looks good.

2739
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:44,812
(Captain Kim is charmed by the meat.)

2740
01:39:44,836 --> 01:39:45,866
(Amazed)

2741
01:39:46,236 --> 01:39:48,205
I could eat that all day.

2742
01:39:48,206 --> 01:39:50,275
He keeps going on about eating it all day.

2743
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,036
It's just too good. What do I do?

2744
01:39:52,946 --> 01:39:54,005
It's delicious.

2745
01:39:54,006 --> 01:39:56,275
(He fills his mouth.)

2746
01:39:56,276 --> 01:39:57,315
(Impressed)

2747
01:39:57,316 --> 01:39:58,716
(Highly satisfied)

2748
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:00,422
Please give us one more plate of assorted meat.

2749
01:40:00,446 --> 01:40:02,085
- One more plate of assorted meat?
- Yes.

2750
01:40:02,086 --> 01:40:03,215
(Their appetite flusters an employee.)

2751
01:40:03,216 --> 01:40:04,392
- Of course.
- She's flustered.

2752
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,056
We'll order one more plate afterward.

2753
01:40:07,086 --> 01:40:08,255
(Uncomfortable)

2754
01:40:08,256 --> 01:40:09,256
I want to eat,

2755
01:40:09,257 --> 01:40:11,295
- but my arms won't go up.
- I'll help you.

2756
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:13,176
You trained so hard that your arms won't go up.

2757
01:40:13,566 --> 01:40:15,266
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

2758
01:40:15,796 --> 01:40:17,096
You're the best.

2759
01:40:18,196 --> 01:40:20,806
(In Ah enjoys the food thanks to Ju Hyun.)

2760
01:40:21,236 --> 01:40:22,505
- Uie, eat a lot of eggs.
- Okay.

2761
01:40:22,506 --> 01:40:24,676
It's really tasty if you eat it like this.

2762
01:40:24,776 --> 01:40:26,205
- Thank you.
- Eat up.

2763
01:40:26,206 --> 01:40:27,846
(Uie takes a bite.)

2764
01:40:28,046 --> 01:40:29,845
(Sae Rok takes a bite.)

2765
01:40:29,846 --> 01:40:30,876
(Impressed)

2766
01:40:31,576 --> 01:40:32,686
It's really tasty, right?

2767
01:40:32,716 --> 01:40:33,886
It's tasty.

2768
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:35,956
I'm exhausted.

2769
01:40:36,186 --> 01:40:38,355
- It's hard to eat.
- I know. It's hard to eat.

2770
01:40:38,356 --> 01:40:40,386
Today, everyone will collapse.

2771
01:40:40,786 --> 01:40:42,625
I think I'll fall asleep in the car.

2772
01:40:42,626 --> 01:40:44,555
Are you proud of us today?

2773
01:40:44,556 --> 01:40:46,325
You guys did so well. Seriously.

2774
01:40:46,326 --> 01:40:49,835
When you guys came in to do the last event,

2775
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,035
I was so surprised.

2776
01:40:51,036 --> 01:40:52,235
I thought, "They did it."

2777
01:40:52,236 --> 01:40:53,806
"Gosh, they're incredible."

2778
01:40:53,836 --> 01:40:55,765
Some people prepare for it...

2779
01:40:55,766 --> 01:40:57,905
- four months in advance.
- Really?

2780
01:40:57,906 --> 01:40:59,445
It makes no sense. We did it in a single day.

2781
01:40:59,446 --> 01:41:00,605
Yes. Seriously.

2782
01:41:00,606 --> 01:41:02,245
Seriously, it's incredible.

2783
01:41:02,246 --> 01:41:03,316
It's incredible.

2784
01:41:03,376 --> 01:41:05,276
Watching the people in the race...

2785
01:41:05,746 --> 01:41:07,986
made me want to participate in it with my dad.

2786
01:41:08,016 --> 01:41:09,115
- Really?
- How cool!

2787
01:41:09,116 --> 01:41:10,855
It'll be so cool.

2788
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:12,555
I saw many married couples.

2789
01:41:12,556 --> 01:41:13,855
I saw a mom and a daughter.

2790
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,125
- That's right.
- Yes. I saw a mom and a daughter.

2791
01:41:15,126 --> 01:41:16,126
That's right.

2792
01:41:16,656 --> 01:41:18,795
(Various people such as married couples, )

2793
01:41:18,796 --> 01:41:22,695
(friends, and a mom and a daughter participated in today's race.)

2794
01:41:22,696 --> 01:41:26,005
I also thought, "I'll be sure to do this race with my wife."

2795
01:41:26,006 --> 01:41:29,036
You can help each other in this race.

2796
01:41:29,206 --> 01:41:31,235
- It's really nice.
- Because of that,

2797
01:41:31,236 --> 01:41:33,876
- the race brought us closer...
- That's right.

2798
01:41:34,046 --> 01:41:35,606
- together.
- Seriously.

2799
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:38,015
You did well. You did very well.

2800
01:41:38,016 --> 01:41:39,845
- Yes.
- Thank you so much for today.

2801
01:41:39,846 --> 01:41:41,966
(They had a miraculous day since they were together.)

2802
01:41:42,146 --> 01:41:43,306
Thank you for your hard work.

2803
01:41:43,856 --> 01:41:45,685
Now, we'll acknowledge you as a member of Iron Girls.

2804
01:41:45,686 --> 01:41:47,086
Thank you.

2805
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,126
Who are you to say that?

2806
01:41:49,496 --> 01:41:50,825
She's overly strict with a newbie.

2807
01:41:50,826 --> 01:41:52,495
She's overly strict.

2808
01:41:52,496 --> 01:41:55,195
She said that she worked hard for recognition.

2809
01:41:55,196 --> 01:41:56,795
Thank you.

2810
01:41:56,796 --> 01:41:58,596
- Thank you.
- Who are you to say that?

2811
01:41:59,706 --> 01:42:01,266
(The 4 Iron Girls really became 1.)

2812
01:42:01,428 --> 01:42:03,227
(Iron Girls' first spar)

2813
01:42:03,228 --> 01:42:04,297
Isn't this too sudden?

2814
01:42:04,298 --> 01:42:05,398
Who will be our opponent?

2815
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:07,938
(The first spar is...)

2816
01:42:08,368 --> 01:42:11,168
(scary and nerve-racking.)

2817
01:42:11,638 --> 01:42:13,837
(For the first time in their lives, )

2818
01:42:13,838 --> 01:42:17,147
(they'll throw punches at an opponent...)

2819
01:42:17,148 --> 01:42:19,618
(and brave the punches of an opponent.)

2820
01:42:21,518 --> 01:42:23,748
(The punches are ruthless.)

2821
01:42:24,818 --> 01:42:26,718
(They take a hit after a hit.)

2822
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,457
(They become so exhausted...)

2823
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:31,887
(that they tear up.)

2824
01:42:31,888 --> 01:42:33,858
(But tears won't solve anything!)

2825
01:42:35,558 --> 01:42:39,068
(What will be the result of the first spar?)

2826
01:42:39,268 --> 01:42:41,437
(What awaits Iron Girls is...)

2827
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:44,367
(the special physical training!)

2828
01:42:44,368 --> 01:42:46,507
(They're sadspa, not aespa.)

2829
01:42:46,508 --> 01:42:49,347
(CARRYNA carries the burden with her stamina.)

2830
01:42:49,348 --> 01:42:50,547
You're CHISELLE.

2831
01:42:50,548 --> 01:42:53,717
(CHISELLE is the most peculiar.)

2832
01:42:53,718 --> 01:42:55,347
Then I'll be WINTEL.

2833
01:42:55,348 --> 01:42:57,087
(WINTEL's charm is her easygoing nature.)

2834
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:58,547
- What will you be?
- KNOCKKNOCK.

2835
01:42:58,548 --> 01:42:59,917
(KNOCKKNOCK is the strong youngest member.)

2836
01:42:59,918 --> 01:43:01,387
(They split firewood...)

2837
01:43:01,388 --> 01:43:02,518
(without stopping.)

2838
01:43:02,728 --> 01:43:04,558
(It's sad that so much firewood remains.)

2839
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,258
Do you see how sweaty I am?

2840
01:43:06,498 --> 01:43:08,627
(A girl group that splits firewood)

2841
01:43:08,628 --> 01:43:11,397
(Will the new girl group, sadspa, be able to debut?)

2842
01:43:11,914 --> 01:43:13,914
