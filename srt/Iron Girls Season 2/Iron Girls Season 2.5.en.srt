1
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,460
(Records of 2 weeks of training)

2
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,369
(Sae Rok receives running training to strengthen her stamina.)

3
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,230
That's the way to do it.

4
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,469
Breathe in through your nose.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,369
Raise your thighs higher.

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,640
That's it. Relax your ankles.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,410
(Running 3km while fixing her posture)

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,510
Relax your ankles.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,450
Raise the hipbone and thighs.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,880
There you go.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,450
Breathe.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,489
You have rhinitis,

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,760
so you need to overcome the shortcomings and risks.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,420
(During the previous training)

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
(Sniffling)

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,060
(Sniffling)

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,130
(Sniffling)

18
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,830
(Sae Rok has rhinitis.)

19
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,140
(Breathing in and out)

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,210
(She breathed through her mouth whenever she ran.)

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,780
(Her breath came out ragged, and she became tired very quickly.)

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,580
Okay. Nasal breathing.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,519
Diaphragmatic breathing.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,126
(Breathing training to overcome her weakness)

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,720
Once you're used to it, you'll improve a lot.

26
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,320
You need to keep practicing even if it gets very exhausting.

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,490
(Sae Rok's training log:)

28
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,629
(The first running training in my life)

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,029
(Due to my poor stamina, I needed the running training.)

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,429
(Nasal breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, mouth breathing)

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,006
(Breathing through the nose is hard because I have rhinitis.)

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,499
(May 31)

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,969
(June 1)

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,470
(Today, she runs alone.)

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,809
(She does the breathing training diligently...)

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,670
(to overcome rhinitis.)

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,609
(When I did nasal breathing and diaphragmatic breathing, )

38
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,179
(I didn't run out of breath despite getting a runny nose.)

39
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,379
(I can't believe this worked. This is why I need to learn things.)

40
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,150
I ran 4.4km.

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,279
I ran diligently.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,790
(Sweating)

43
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,260
Seriously, I can do it too.

44
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,220
If I didn't have a runny nose,

45
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,190
I could do better.

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,930
Let's fight on.

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,570
Iron Girls!

48
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,500
Get ready. Set, go.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,270
Faster!

50
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,569
(Sae Rok's training log: 2nd running training)

51
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,909
(Blood, sweat, tears, and snot)

52
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,209
(Rhinitis, I'm on my way to catch you.)

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,339
Keep going.

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,380
(Run before I catch you.)

55
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,250
- One, two. - One, two.

56
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,780
Jab, jab, one, two.

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
(Hook)

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,050
Hold on a second.

59
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,120
- I... - Your hook is too slow.

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
(Keep it short.)

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,730
Hit it.

62
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
There you go. Again.

63
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,206
(She focuses on the movements she can't do.)

64
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,360
One, two, hook, backstep, one, two.

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,300
Keep it simple. Jab, jab.

66
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,969
One, two, hook, backstep,

67
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,000
one, two.

68
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Jab, jab, one, two.

69
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,269
(Sae Rok's training log: I learned a new technique today.)

70
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,369
(Moving footwork seems like a very good technique.)

71
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,039
There you go.

72
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,449
(I'll train hard and make this technique my own.)

73
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,849
(I work out outside of the gym too.)

74
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,179
(3 sets of jump roping, 6 routines)

75
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,449
(I worked out for real. I'm so proud!)

76
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,149
(Uie and I took a lesson together for the first time in a while.)

77
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,819
(There was a lot of sweat and snot.)

78
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,489
(We really gave it our all.)

79
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,719
(She's so diligent.)

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,819
(Instead of training to show people, she does it to overcome herself.)

81
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,140
(I always learn by watching her.)

82
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,029
(It's before her play in the provinces.)

83
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,070
(Despite her busy schedule, Uie trains on her own.)

84
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,699
(Uie's training log:)

85
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,969
(Private training in the morning)

86
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,929
(Thankfully, I got to work out since there was a fitness room.)

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,770
(Exercising alone gets lonely and exhausting.)

88
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,009
(Today, she did technical training with the coach.)

89
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,739
Jab, jab, one, two.

90
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
(Hook)

91
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,209
(One, two, duck)

92
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,210
(Hook)

93
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,779
You need to go back.

94
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,879
(Hooks are still hard for Uie.)

95
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Go back.

96
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,849
It'll be a disaster if you can't do a hook properly.

97
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,866
(She's mad that she can't do as well as she'd like.)

98
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,450
One, two, uppercut.

99
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,790
Uppercut.

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,159
- Uppercut, hook. - Hook.

101
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,890
Hook.

102
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,859
(Uie's training log:)

103
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,629
(Why are uppercuts and hooks so hard for me?)

104
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,769
(I didn't even get to weaving with the coach today.)

105
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,090
(Doing uppercuts and hooks took up 2 hours of the lesson!)

106
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,740
(Hard work doesn't lie.)

107
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,439
(Uie's training log: Morning training)

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,309
(Boxing is an insane workout. Coach doesn't let me rest at all!)

109
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,649
(I'll have my revenge! One, two, focus!)

110
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,620
(Sweaty)

111
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,149
(Uie's training log: I exercised with Ju Hyun.)

112
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,089
(We went over the things we were bad at!)

113
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,820
(Let's work hard! Let's go!)

114
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,599
(Ju Hyun is busy preparing for a play.)

115
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,770
All right.

116
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,300
- Hold on a second. - Go ahead.

117
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,210
(Who is she training with?)

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,580
(A senior boxer who is in a play with her, Actor Lee Sang Yi)

119
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,420
(He came to help with his incredible boxing skills.)

120
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
Hit me!

121
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,290
- Nice. - There you go.

122
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,789
(Thanks to Actor Lee Sang Yi, )

123
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,359
(she got to train despite her busy schedule.)

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,959
(June 2)

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,059
(June 3)

126
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,099
(Ju Hyun's training log:)

127
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,299
(I had intense training with Coach Ji Hoon.)

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,499
(Despite worries over the schedule, I was in good condition.)

129
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Go.

130
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,829
(I'll massage my calves well.)

131
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,276
(After strengthening my legs, I went back to boxing training.)

132
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,640
(She works out diligently to strengthen her calves.)

133
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,509
(How about the ace member, In Ah?)

134
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,910
- Hello. - Welcome.

135
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,579
My condition worsened.

136
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,649
(Not a boxing gym, but a hospital?)

137
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,049
Perhaps my body can't keep up with my passion.

138
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,370
(Why did In Ah visit a hospital?)

139
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,219
I thought, "My knees will be over if I jump once more."

140
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,759
I can't describe that pain.

141
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,206
(Pain so great that she thought that her knees would be over?)

142
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,230
It hurts.

143
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:24,629
(Last year as well, )

144
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:31,100
(In Ah struggled with knee pain.)

145
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,310
(A month of fierce training)

146
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,540
(In the end, )

147
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:47,990
(her knee pain came back.)

148
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,290
It looks like there is a problem with her cartilage.

149
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,589
There is inflammation in her tendons.

150
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,460
There is also a problem with her fat pad.

151
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,299
I think it's a mix of those three issues.

152
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,046
(Footwork is crucial in boxing. Will In Ah be okay?)

153
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,670
I need to win a medal.

154
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,400
Seriously.

155
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,199
This is my challenge.

156
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,109
Forget about the boxing challenge. I want to win a medal myself.

157
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,569
(She is desperate for recovery.)

158
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,940
In my opinion,

159
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,309
we should decide on the treatment after assessing the condition.

160
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,310
Okay.

161
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,649
(Measures for recovery:)

162
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,079
(Don't do any exercises that use the knees for 10 days.)

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,896
(Focus on rehabilitation and treatments only.)

164
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,489
Why do I never get used to it?

165
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,860
You're right. There will be a bit of pain.

166
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,260
Breathe slowly.

167
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,660
- Gosh. - Slowly.

168
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,760
Now, the hips. For ten minutes,

169
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,829
- ice the area before going to bed. - Okay.

170
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,869
(In Ah's training log:)

171
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,110
(Physical therapy and shockwave therapy at the hospital)

172
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,099
(In Ah's training log:)

173
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,409
(I steeled my mind and went to do some aquatic therapy.)

174
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,610
(I thought about boxing even during the therapy.)

175
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,609
(My knees have to get better! Get back up, Seol In Ah!)

176
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,939
(I'll soon go back to training as the youngest one.)

177
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,980
Five seconds.

178
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,780
(In Ah focused on rehabilitation.)

179
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,850
(She went back to exercising after 10 days.)

180
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,249
I missed this.

181
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,860
(I missed exercising.)

182
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,560
(June 7)

183
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,029
(Iron Girls worked hard to become boxing champions.)

184
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,559
(June 9)

185
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,030
(June 10)

186
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,599
(They did their absolute best for 2 weeks.)

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,870
(What will be the result of their hard work?)

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,340
Let's go! Go!

189
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,140
Oh, my gosh. We're back.

190
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,340
Okay.

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
I love the smell of the gym.

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,640
The smell of exercising.

193
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,579
- I want to walk as slowly as I can. - The smell of exercising.

194
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,509
You guys got used to coming to the gym, right?

195
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,579
- Yes. - All right.

196
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,480
- I changed my mindset. - How so?

197
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,620
No boxing, no life.

198
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,120
"No boxing, no life."

199
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,460
Without boxing, there's no life.

200
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,889
- That's cool. - I can see...

201
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,959
- No life. - that you definitely changed...

202
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,530
after the body shot.

203
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,030
(During the promise boxing last time, )

204
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,070
(she received her first body shot.)

205
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,110
(She experienced how scary boxing could be.)

206
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,450
You grow through pain.

207
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,886
How much time do we have left until the first competition?

208
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,919
A month and a half?

209
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,550
That's right. You have a month and a half left.

210
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,149
- Not much time remains. - Not much time remains.

211
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,249
What am I going to do? I'm nervous.

212
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,666
- You need to get better. - We don't have enough time.

213
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,729
Today, you'll train to prepare for the actual situation.

214
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,410
- The actual situation? - Advanced skills?

215
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,459
You need to prepare for entering the ring...

216
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,869
- and participating in a match. - Okay.

217
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,240
Thus, you'll train to apply what you've learned...

218
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,969
to the actual situation.

219
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,050
- Okay. - That sounds good.

220
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,170
(Today's training)

221
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,480
(Training for the actual match 1. Parry)

222
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,350
(Training for the actual match 2. Shoulder hit)

223
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,980
(And)

224
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,420
(A mysterious figure who suits the training will appear!)

225
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,790
To prepare for the actual match, you'll learn two things.

226
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,930
The first thing is a parry.

227
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,730
- A parry? - Yes, a parry.

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
It's a technique of deflecting an opponent's punch.

229
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,070
We'll show you.

230
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,469
At first, you learned how to block...

231
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,069
in case of the one-two.

232
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,110
- Yes. - This time,

233
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,009
you deflect the punch.

234
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,856
(A parry is a defensive technique of deflecting the incoming punch.)

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,710
- It's like throwing the opponent. - A parry.

236
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,120
(Captain Kim also showed a parry.)

237
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,349
(A parry is a defensive technique of deflecting the incoming punch.)

238
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,190
(so that the opponent misses.)

239
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
When there's an incoming jab,

240
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:14,459
send it diagonally to break up the force.

241
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,090
When it comes, deflect it like this.

242
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,200
But when there's an incoming jab, don't send it down this much.

243
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,129
- Just slightly. - Yes.

244
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,290
Don't send it down this much.

245
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,469
Let me explain. If you send it down a lot,

246
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,509
- I'll follow up with a punch. - That's right.

247
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,710
- Your opponent can do that. - It can be a feint.

248
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,339
Keep it light. If you fail,

249
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,439
- you need to guard yourself. - It's important.

250
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,879
If your arms go down, it'll be late.

251
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,720
- You'll get it when you practice. - Slightly.

252
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,549
What should you do after parrying?

253
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,649
You should attack.

254
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,889
Our pattern always goes, block and hit.

255
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:42,919
Dodge and hit.

256
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,019
- It has always been that way. - Yes.

257
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,619
This is the same. After parrying,

258
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,959
counterattack.

259
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,660
(After parrying, a counterattack must follow.)

260
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,030
Punch, punch. Go like this.

261
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,199
Push. Punch, punch.

262
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,529
(Parry, one, two)

263
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,569
Afterward... Push, punch. Do it right away.

264
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,069
(Parry, two)

265
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,139
It'll be two right away.

266
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,839
When you do the two after parrying, your feet don't move.

267
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,440
- You punch with your waist. - Okay.

268
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,139
- Punch. Like this. - Punch.

269
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,179
(The impact from the waist is important.)

270
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,279
Use your waist only.

271
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,379
(Parry, two)

272
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,020
- Do you get it? - Coach,

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
can you parry with your left hand?

274
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,650
- You can. - You can?

275
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,889
(Parry, one, two, Parry, two)

276
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,619
(Unlike the two techniques of attacking after defending)

277
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,490
Let's say the opponent isn't attacking. Then...

278
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,560
Walk and hit.

279
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,699
(Walk, two)

280
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,429
- Let's have them practice on me. - Okay.

281
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,339
You can fix their posture as we go along.

282
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,340
- Okay. - One at a time.

283
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,869
- Put your gloves on. - Put your gloves on.

284
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,710
- Let's try parrying. - Let's go.

285
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,810
One at a time.

286
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,409
- Uie. - Uie.

287
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,970
(Captain Uie practices parrying first.)

288
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,849
- Push, punch. - There you go.

289
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,749
(Parry and attack.)

290
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,919
- There you go. - Hit.

291
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,550
- There you go. - Her reach is long!

292
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,849
There you go.

293
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,219
(Long)

294
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
Good.

295
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,990
- One, two. - That's it.

296
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,130
- Push. Punch, punch. - Good.

297
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,460
- Tap. Lightly. - Good.

298
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,800
Good one-two.

299
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,530
- That's it. Very good. - She's strong.

300
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,099
- Good. That was nice. - Yes!

301
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
- You're so good. - It brushed past me.

302
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,670
This time, parry and puch.

303
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,470
- Push, punch. - Good.

304
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,040
- Push, punch. - Good.

305
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,740
(She doesn't seem satisfied.)

306
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,009
- This is tricky. - Push, punch.

307
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,010
- Okay. Relax your shoulders. - Push, punch.

308
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,131
- Now? - You should do that.

309
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,050
- Push, punch. - My gosh.

310
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,950
(Both the attack and defence don't work.)

311
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,279
- You're doing it too hastily. - Here's why.

312
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,600
- I just can't do this. - Listen.

313
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,319
You already know that the opponent's punch is coming,

314
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,290
so you keep coming forward to parry.

315
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,059
(Her arm moves forward in advance, )

316
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,160
(so her punching distance is shortened.)

317
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,099
(A missed parry)

318
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,399
(A missed straight)

319
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,869
You should parry right here. Tap.

320
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,039
You should do it right in front of your face.

321
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,100
- Try it. - Yes.

322
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,610
- Push, punch. Good. - That's it. Lightly.

323
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,780
- Punch right away. Good. - Punch.

324
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,650
(Her pose changes depending on the position of her hand.)

325
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,779
(Before correction)

326
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,080
(After correction)

327
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,790
- Tap, tap. That's it. Good. - Tap, tap.

328
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,990
- That's the rhythm. - Okay.

329
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,490
It's easier than you think.

330
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,689
- You're good. - You were thinking too much. Good.

331
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,930
Next. First, parry and one-two.

332
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,760
- I'll be fast. Watch out. - Okay.

333
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,129
Jab. One, two.

334
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,900
(Parry, one, two)

335
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,839
You're not rotating your waist at all.

336
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
- Okay. - All right.

337
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,239
- Jab. One, two. - Push. Punch, punch.

338
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
And rotate your waist properly.

339
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,709
When you perform these movements quickly,

340
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,779
- your stance shouldn't collapse. - Okay.

341
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,179
That's why we've been working so hard up until now.

342
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,920
- No boxing, no life. - Okay. I get it.

343
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,819
(She tries again focusing on the waist rotation.)

344
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,089
That's it. Do it like that.

345
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,259
(Before correction)

346
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,929
(Insufficient waist rotation)

347
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,389
(After correction)

348
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,830
(Proper waist rotation)

349
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,130
Push. Punch, punch.

350
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:42,070
Good. You rotated your waist well.

351
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
- Push. Punch, punch. - Good. To the center.

352
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,170
No boxing, no life!

353
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,439
Hey! No boxing, no life!

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,439
- You are different from last week. - Good.

355
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,050
- You changed after getting hit. - Good.

356
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,910
- You have good control. - Good.

357
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,479
Here I come.

358
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,219
Her punch is stronger than I expected.

359
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,749
Tell her to throw away the T-shirt.

360
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,349
- In that shirt, she's... - Good.

361
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,959
Her punch is stronger than I thought.

362
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,059
- Next. - Boxing is my life.

363
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,089
Everyone is doing well.

364
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,829
You all seem to know the rhythm.

365
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,860
Sae Rok.

366
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,400
- Jab. One, two. - Punch, punch. Good.

367
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,059
(Parry, one, two)

368
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,000
- Good. - That was nice.

369
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,170
- Rocky! - Wait.

370
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,600
Listen, Sae Rok.

371
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,140
Both punches of the one-two have to be strong.

372
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,769
Which one is the highlight of one-two?

373
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,780
- Two. - That's it.

374
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,309
- The jab was like a straight. - You're doing well.

375
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,379
I mean, the power.

376
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,949
It's strong, but it needs to be lighter.

377
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,979
And focus on your hand behind.

378
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,220
Otherwise, you will miss both punches.

379
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,789
(Parry, one, two)

380
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,820
That's it.

381
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,419
Punch, punch. That's it.

382
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,589
It must hurt.

383
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,959
Push, punch.

384
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,729
Push, punch. That's right.

385
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,499
(Rocky Keum got the hang of it.)

386
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,899
- That's it. - Good, Sae Rocky.

387
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,969
Push, punch. That's it. One more time.

388
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,299
(Perfect footwork, perfect waist rotation)

389
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,670
- Good job. - She's not scared.

390
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,170
Now, attack. Parry and punch.

391
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,769
- Slightly. Nice. - There you go.

392
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,309
- Punch, punch. Good. - Like this.

393
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,239
- Good, Sae Rocky. - Push, punch. Good.

394
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,080
(She breaks down the opponent's guard and attacks.)

395
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,779
- Good. Do it faster now. - That was really nice.

396
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,180
Go quickly. Good.

397
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,090
Good. Push, punch.

398
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
- Push, punch. - Good. She's like a robot.

399
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,759
(Her stance doesn't collapse even at high speed.)

400
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,419
- Good. Well done. - Nice.

401
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,930
Last. Good.

402
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,129
- Punch. Good. - She's improved a lot.

403
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,659
Nice, Sae Rocky.

404
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,759
- You're really good. - You've become a lot faster.

405
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,129
- You've improved a lot. - Good job.

406
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,930
How are all your punches so strong?

407
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,370
I'm not joking. All your punches are strong.

408
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,700
- Push. Punch, punch. - That's it.

409
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,939
(The punching sound is different from the start.)

410
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,640
That's the rhythm. Good.

411
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,180
- My gosh. - Good.

412
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,550
- Oh, dear. - That's it.

413
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,310
- My gosh. - Yes.

414
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,650
(Chuckling)

415
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,649
- Good. - Can I ask you a question?

416
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,419
Captain Kim, is it okay to do this?

417
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,390
- But, seriously... - He was like this.

418
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,710
- Captain, your body is really... - It's threatening.

419
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,910
(Stepping back the 1st time)

420
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,380
(Stepping back the 2nd time)

421
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,750
(Stepping back the 3rd time)

422
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,806
(Her power makes even Captain Kim, the fighter, step back.)

423
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,800
You know, I've done this a lot.

424
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,800
Her posture is really good.

425
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,340
She punches with her body weight.

426
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,210
Now, parry and punch.

427
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,410
- Push, punch. - With no footwork.

428
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,979
- Good. - Okay.

429
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,479
(Standing still with no footwork)

430
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,510
Good.

431
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,350
(Precise impact with the waist rotation)

432
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,850
(Parry, two)

433
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,789
(The punching sound is as loud as a cannon.)

434
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,330
- Last. - Push, punch. Okay. Good.

435
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,889
Great job.

436
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,899
- You're really good. - Well done.

437
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,300
Here are the three movements you just learned.

438
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,329
How you break the rhythm of your opponent coming at you.

439
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,346
- Break the rhythm. - Yes.

440
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,839
Then you respond.

441
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,239
- Response. - Respond right away and punch.

442
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,409
These are the attacks you can use in a real match.

443
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,139
Let's begin the second training session for a real match.

444
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,209
- I love it. - Yes.

445
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,209
(The next training session for a real match)

446
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,720
This is the second training session.

447
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,580
It's the shoulder hits.

448
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,550
This is the training that boxers do a lot.

449
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,119
Two people face each other and hit each other's shoulders.

450
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,629
(Shoulder hits: You train to hit your opponent's shoulders, )

451
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,890
(not their face or stomach.)

452
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,999
You don't know when or how your opponent will attack,

453
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,769
so you also need to dodge the punches well.

454
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,330
(Dodging is as important as attacking.)

455
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,499
You will hit each other's shoulders...

456
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,670
like this.

457
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,809
You can move your leg like this.

458
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,139
- And you can move your body. - Your back leg?

459
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,609
- Yes. You can move like this. - But not the front leg?

460
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,909
You don't move the front leg.

461
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,979
It's to see how well you can avoid being hit...

462
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,319
and touch your opponent within striking range.

463
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,549
It's too assess your movements.

464
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,050
To train your reflexes and eyes.

465
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,349
"To train my reflexes and eyes."

466
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,789
You will do it in pairs.

467
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,519
- Coach, you should count... - Yes.

468
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,819
The number of shoulder hits.

469
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,859
Okay. I'll do that.

470
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,059
You should train your eyes...

471
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,799
- and time your attack. - Let's go.

472
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,029
(Shoulder hits training)

473
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,699
(1 round: 1 minute and 30 seconds)

474
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,500
(Tournament games)

475
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,440
The first match is between Ju Hyun and Uie.

476
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,739
Let's do that.

477
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
Good luck.

478
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,079
Let's not hit each other's faces.

479
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,160
It's hitting the shoulders.

480
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,410
Ready. Start.

481
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,050
(The match begins.)

482
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,281
Let's not hit each other's faces.

483
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:50,385
It's hitting the shoulders.

484
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:51,605
Ready. Start.

485
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,975
(The match begins.)

486
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,545
(Stretching)

487
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:57,845
(Stretching)

488
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,144
(She attacks first using her long reach.)

489
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,714
It didn't touch the shoulder.

490
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,325
I blocked all your attacks.

491
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:05,485
(Ju Hyun, 1 point)

492
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,395
(Ju Hyun's surprise attack)

493
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,624
It didn't touch.

494
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,064
(Ju Hyun closes the distance instantly.)

495
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,364
Ju Hyun is aggressive.

496
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,695
(Ju Hyun, the in-fighter, fights in close-quarters.)

497
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:16,935
(She closes in, strikes quickly, )

498
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,805
(and then steps back right away.)

499
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:22,205
(She attacks with her eyes wide open.)

500
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,504
- Good. - You both got one point each.

501
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:25,645
You each got hit once.

502
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:30,015
(I can't lose like this.)

503
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:31,784
Okay.

504
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,555
(Increasing the movements not to give the opponent a chance)

505
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:37,014
- Try a feint. - No.

506
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,924
- That was... - Parry.

507
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,625
Good. That was nice.

508
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,924
- Good. - Ju Hyun got hit.

509
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,005
(Moving quickly, flinching)

510
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,134
Okay. Ju Hyun got hit.

511
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,595
- My gosh. - That was a good one.

512
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,935
That's it. Ju Hyun got hit again.

513
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,005
- No, that was my arm. - Good.

514
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,134
That's it.

515
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:57,245
(Ju Hyun closes in to counterattack.)

516
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,105
(She leans back to dodge.)

517
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:06,245
(Her punch doesn't reach her shoulder because of the distance.)

518
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:07,754
(Uie, 1 point)

519
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,554
(She uses her momentum to attack with a long reach.)

520
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,825
Look at her long arms. My gosh.

521
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:14,325
(She scores points slowly.)

522
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:20,465
(They both make their last spurts.)

523
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,734
(The match ends.)

524
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,334
- The winner is... - The winner is...

525
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,074
Who is the winner to advance to the final?

526
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,174
It was like a free fight at the last minute.

527
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,005
- Gosh, that was... - I couldn't count it.

528
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,145
(The first match was fierce.)

529
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,475
(Uie with her long reach?)

530
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,584
(In-fighter Ju Hyun?)

531
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:39,645
The winner...

532
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:41,614
Uie wins by two points.

533
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,285
(The final score: Uie 16, Ju Hyun, 14)

534
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,384
This is unbelievable.

535
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,154
(Uie advances to the final.)

536
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,594
(Shoulder hits training)

All right. Ready.

540
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,204
Ready, start.

541
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,135
I really don't know who will win.

542
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,204
(The two people carefully wait for an opportunity.)

543
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,945
Watch your face.

544
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,975
(Punching)

545
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,045

546
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:13,115

548

She's too strong.

555
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,365
(Right at the moment)

556
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,235
(Sae Rok counters with powerful punches.)

557
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:39,175
(Striking a deep blow using her long arm)

558
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,874
- Sae Rok is not slow. - Right.

559
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,515
I thought she was slow, but she's actually fast.

560
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:47,554
(Sae Rok, 1 point)

561
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:52,125

(Sae Rok, 1 point, defence)

563
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:55,054
She's good.

564
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:56,754
(She strikes 2 punches quickly with her long arms...)

565
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,495
(and then 1 defence.)

566
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,465
(In Ah, 1 point)
That's it.

567
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:02,865
- My gosh. - Defend.
(Getting competitive)

568
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:04,935
Only the shoulders.

569
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,805
Don't fight for real.

570
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:09,734
(They both can't hear anything.)

571
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,905
- Don't fight for real. - Don't hit the face.

572
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,844
This is crazy.

574
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:15,945

(Frightened)

577
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,545
Watch your face.

578
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:22,385
(Hitting her in the face)

579
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:23,854
- Oh, no. - Watch your face.

580
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,755
My gosh. Look at that.

581
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,395
- You have to stop them! - Stop.

582
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,294
(Time-out)

583
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:30,865
- Stop. - You have to stop them.

584
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:32,995
Hang on. Wait.

585
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,164
It's like a lion versus a lion.

586
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:37,335
- You should never hit the face. - Don't hit the face.

587
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,565
Don't punch the face.

588
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:43,505
(Strong In Ah with speed, Determined Sae Rok with long arms)

589
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:47,414
(The current score is 11 to 13.)

590
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,475
- Start. - Start.

591
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,274

(Sae Rok, 1 point, In Ah, 1 point)

594
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:57,355

(A fierce battle)

596
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,424
- They're good. - Goodness...

597
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:04,764
(Just watching it is painful.)

598
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:05,894
I don't want to do this.

599
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:07,165
(The finalist is terrified.)

600
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:08,494
Uie, we should do it again.

601
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:10,095
I know. I don't want to do it with them.

602
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,565
Look how strong they are.

603
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,964

604
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:16,034

In Ah is really...

607
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:24,045
(The match ends.)

608
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:26,915

00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,635
Don't take it easy. Coach can't use one hand.

717
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:04,064
(With a bright face, she keeps throwing punches.)

718
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,935
Sae Rok is pretty good.

719
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:08,234
- Look at that. She's good. - Keep punching him.

720
00:25:08,235 --> 00:25:10,004
That's it! You're doing well, Sae Rok!

721
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:11,774
She's really good.

722
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:12,875
(A desperate struggle)

723
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,515
Hit him everywhere.

724
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:18,515
- Sae Rok, keep going. - You did well.

725
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:20,614
- Good play. - I'll announce the result.

726
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,014
- Sae Rok, you're good. - Okay.

727
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,154
- I'll announce the winner. - My gosh.

728
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,685
I counted it.

729
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:25,924
- I got an accurate count. - Okay.

730
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,124
Sae Rok wins.

731
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,294
(Sae Rok wins.)

732
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,394
- I'm serious. - Sae Rok is good.

733
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,425
- She's no joke. - She landed good punches.

734
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,394
You are really good.

735
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:34,594
(Rediscovery of Rocky Keum)

736
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:36,564
I was really surprised. I thought she'd be slow...

737
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:38,245
- and get hit everywhere. - She's so fast.

738
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:40,364
- But she dodged well. - She doesn't want to lose.

739
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:41,374
- Right. - She's so scary.

740
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,535
When I get hit, I get competitive.

741
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,005
- Seriously. - Too competitive.

742
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,244
I think Sae Rok will do something.

743
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,375
Yes. She was serious when she got ready like this.

744
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,044
- You know, - It's not fake.

745
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:53,444
- she has a dogged spirit. - She was so cool.

746
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:55,615
Considering the time you have been training,

747
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:57,754
- you all did a great job. - Right.

748
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,525
- You have potential. - Yes!

749
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,255
- Great job, today. - Good job.

750
00:26:01,855 --> 00:26:03,954
Let's take a break before moving on to the next session.

751
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,864
Hang on. I'll put some sports spray on you.

752
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,865
- Please. - Please.

753
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:08,994
Which part?

754
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:11,165
- I want it here. - Here and here.

755
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,934
I think I should take a shower with it.

756
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:13,935
Really?

757
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:15,605
- First, spray it on my shoulder. - Okay.

758
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,374
By the way...

759
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,821
- Here, please. - You can spray it anywhere.

760
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,204
Rub it a little with your hand.

761
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,315
- Rub it? - Yes.

762
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:24,584
I also spray it and rub it like this.

763
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,015
You massage the sprayed area.

764
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:28,615
I feel refreshed right away.

765
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:30,614
(Reaching out)

766
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:31,654
Coach, try it.

767
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,185
Yes. I got hit by Sae Rok a lot.

768
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:35,825
- My gosh. - Our ace.

769
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,265
Rub it with your hand.

770
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:43,164
Now that you're recovered, we will move on to the next session.

771
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:44,165
Okay.

772
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,664
You know there are many learning stages.

773
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:48,605
- Yes. - When you've learned this much,

774
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:50,575
you should try sparring.

775
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,674
What exactly is sparring?

776
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:54,915
Sparring is just like a real match.

777
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:56,914
But it's not a real match.

778
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,084
- An actual match. - It's still a match.

779
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,885
Yes. An actual match. That's sparring.

780
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:02,385
- So, today... - What?

781
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,014
You'll try sparring.

782
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,024
- All of a sudden? - Sparring?

783
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,424
Now? Are we sparring now?

784
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,724
But we don't have anything.

785
00:27:08,725 --> 00:27:10,355
Are we wearing only the gloves?

786
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,465
When you spar,

787
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:13,724
- you wear gloves... - Yes.

788
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:15,764
- and boxing shoes. - Shoes.

789
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,434
- Yes. - And when you have a match,

790
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,735
- you need headgear. - Headgear!

791
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,705
There are several types of headgear.

792
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:24,204
Open-face, cheek protector, and bar face.

793
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,804
There are three types.

794
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,074
The advantage of the open-face headgear is...

795
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:28,114
that it doesn't impair your vision.

796
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,474
With an unimpaired vision,

797
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:32,885
it is easier to duck or weave.

798
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,684
But when you are punched in the face,

799
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:37,385
your face is barely protected.

800
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,984
And this is the cheek protector headgear.

801
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:42,325
It protects your cheeks and jaw.

802
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,924
But it doesn't protect your nose.

803
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:47,465
It provides relatively less nose protection.

804
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,764
I see.

805
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,464
Meanwhile, bar face headgear has a bar across the nose...

806
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,434
that offers nose protection.

807
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:54,065
So it minimizes the risk of injury.

808
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,204
But it can obscure your vision,

809
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,205
so you may find it difficult to move around.

810
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,545
You will be wearing this headgear.

811
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,144
You will try sparring in it,

812
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,314
- and you can choose the type... - Yes.

813
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,484
- that's right for you later. - Okay.

814
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:07,014
Just try using it and decide later.

815
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:09,484
And the most important thing...

816
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:11,785
is to protect your teeth and the skin around your mouth.

817
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:13,561
- So you must wear a mouthpiece. - Finally?

818
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,024
- I see. - We will make mouthpieces first...

819
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,194
- before we start. - Can we get it done right away?

820
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,454
It can be made right away.

821
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:18,595
That sounds good.

822
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:19,925
Are we doing it right away?

823
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,294
- That's cute. - They have our faces on them.

824
00:28:22,295 --> 00:28:23,564
(The mouthpiece for Iron Girls)

825
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,335
Here's the mouthpiece.

826
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:27,205
You will shape your mouthpiece now.

827
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,105
Put this in hot water.

828
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,574
(Making your own mouthpiece)

829
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:36,514
(1. Put the mouthpiece in hot water.)

830
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:40,445
(2. Take it out after an appropriate amount of time.)

831
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,331
It's done. This is how it should look.

832
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:44,854
It must be really hot at first. You should cool it down a little.

833
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:45,884
It should look like this.

834
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:47,054
- Blow. - Blow on it a little.

835
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:48,194
It's good now.

836
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,394
Now press it with your tongue in your mouth...

837
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,094
and press it with your hands here.

838
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:53,764
Just bite it once and stop.

839
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,641
Right. Imagine that you're eating a sweet potato.

840
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:56,735
Okay. Do it.

841
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:58,434
- It's hot. - It's too hot.

842
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,564
- It should be hot. - It's really hot.

843
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,081
If you don't do it now, you can't shape it.

844
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:03,574
- It's hot. - Bite it hard. Bite it.

845
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,875
Do I have to put up with it?

846
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:06,405
You have to endure it.

847
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,414
- You should bite it just once. - Okay.

848
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,245
- At once. - All right.

849
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,145
- You shouldn't move. - Stay still.

850
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:13,885
- Stay like that. - Clench your teeth.

851
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,384
She says it's hot.

852
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,031
- How would I do that? - Clench your teeth.

853
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,484
- Press it here. - Yes.

854
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:19,984
- So your lips won't stick out. - He's right.

855
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,224
Press the front.

856
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,225
- Press it. - How do you do that when it's hot?

857
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:24,925
Is it supposed to be hot?

858
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,894
- But you have to do it this way. - We will show you.

859
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:27,934
Okay.

860
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,435
Watch how Coach does it.

861
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,805
- This... - When it's ready...

862
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:33,264
- Watch. - Watch.

863
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:35,605
- Isn't it too soon? - It's hot.

864
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:37,335
(Spitting it out)

865
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,745
Coach.

866
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:42,145
Coach.

867
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,215
Hey.

868
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:44,644
You have to endure it.

869
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:45,915
- Coach. - Hang on.

870
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,715
- What's wrong? - I'll do it again.

871
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,154
- I'll do it again. - Gosh, Coach.

872
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,215
(Trying to cool it down)

873
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,285
Gosh.

874
00:29:52,485 --> 00:29:55,495
He told you to let it cool a bit. Why didn't you listen?

875
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,724
I endured the heat, though.

876
00:29:58,725 --> 00:29:59,795
(I feel wronged.)

877
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,434
- He's tearing up. - It's too much.

878
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,465
Are you okay?

879
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:07,534
He's actually tearing up.

880
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:09,575
- He's crying. - Coach.

881
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:11,074
Coach!

882
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,075
(Kim Ji Hoon's lesson of the day: Too much heat can cause tears.)

883
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,345
You told us to endure it.

884
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:16,074
If it doesn't feel hot anymore, you can take it out.

885
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:18,245
- Can I take it out now? - Yes, you can.

886
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:21,255
- And put it in here. - It worked.

887
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:22,615
It turned out good.

888
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,354
All right. It looks good.

889
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,724
This is nice. We can use this.

890
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:26,884
Ju Hyun did a good job.

891
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:28,431
(The mouthpiece is complete once it hardens in cold water.)

892
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:30,995
Bite down. Press the front part.

893
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,364
Press the front part.

894
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,035
The middle part should be at the center. That's it.

895
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:37,434
- Do you feel that? - Bite down. Press the front part.

896
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,765
- That's good. - Nice.

897
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:41,775
- This is it, right? - Yes, that's it.

898
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:42,975
You look cute.

899
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,404
- I look funny, don't I? - You look cute.

900
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:46,704
You have such a small face.

901
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:47,985
Yes, you have such a small face.

902
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,714
We're going to use them today,

903
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,414
but you can keep them.

904
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,485
Right.

905
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,214
Now that you have your mouthpieces,

906
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:58,084
are you ready to spar?

907
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,184
- Are we sparring with each other? - This is my first time.

908
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,255
I'm scared.

909
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,525
- Who are we sparring? - What?

910
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:02,595
Maybe it's Captain Kim.

911
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:05,024
We have a special guest today.

912
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,195
Really?

913
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:07,565
- Who could it be? - Yes.

914
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,135
Come on out, please.

915
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:10,535
I'm scared.

916
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,635
I don't want to do this.

917
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,605
(Looking around)

918
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,475
Who is it?

919
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,504
Who is it?

920
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,945
(Everyone's in meerkat mode.)

921
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,714
(Dressed in a red uniform...)

922
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,274
(and carrying a big bag)

923
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,344
- Hello. - Hello.

924
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:27,705
(A man approaches the Iron Girls.)

925
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:30,355
(Who are you?)

926
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:34,725
(Their sparring partner for the day makes a shy entrance.)

927
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:36,295
He's a baby.

928
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,065
- He's adorable. - You can come here.

929
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,895
Come over here, please. Hello.

930
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,234
He's a little kid.

931
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,235
(Is he really our sparring partner?)

932
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,805
Please introduce yourself.

933
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:48,375
Hello, my name is Kwon Sung Min, and I'm a third-year student...

934
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,035
at Seoul Physical Education Middle School.

935
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,974
He's adorable.

936
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:55,474
- He's so adorable. - So adorable.

937
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:57,244
- Amazing. - Gosh, no.

938
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,215
(Meanwhile, Uie is seriously concerned.)

939
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,991
Guys, he's a student at a Physical Education Middle School.

940
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:04,015
He goes to Seoul Physical Education Middle School.

941
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,385
Hold on.

942
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,524
Not everyone can get into Seoul Physical Education Middle School.

943
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,525
She's right.

944
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,325
You pretty much always come in first or second at nationals, right?

945
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:12,825
- Yes. - Gosh.

946
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,735
- Yes. - Gosh.

947
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,895
He's a real athlete.

948
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,204
Could you share your achievements?

949
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,834
Recently, I won first place in the under-50kg division...

950
00:32:21,835 --> 00:32:23,751
at the Korea Boxing Association President’s Cup...

951
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,105
National Amateur Boxing Championships.

952
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:28,314
- What? - Exactly.

953
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:29,514
The Korea Boxing Association President’s Cup...

954
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,091
is a tournament comparable to the National Sports Festival.

955
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,115
- Really? - Yes.

956
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,414
See? Guys...

957
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:35,115
He's not an adorable opponent.

958
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:39,185
(Agile moves that penetrate his opponent's defense)

959
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,395
(Strong punches that disorient his opponent)

960
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,634
(His powerful punches stand out even in tournaments.)

961
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,164
Yes, it is true.

962
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,434
(Boys Middle School Division Under-50kg, 2025, 1st place)

963
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:52,534
(Under 15 years old, flyweight, 2025, 3rd place)

964
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,634
(Boys Middle School Division, Under-48 kg, 2024, 2nd place)

965
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:55,611
(The Won Promotion Cup Amateur Boxing Tournament, 2023, Champion)

966
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:58,205
(Kwon Sung Min has dominated various boxing tournaments.)

967
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:00,174
You won first place? That's cool.

968
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,275
That's amazing.

969
00:33:01,305 --> 00:33:03,275
How did you get into boxing?

970
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:06,444
- At first, it was curiosity. - How old were you?

971
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:07,714
When I was a first-year student in middle school.

972
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:09,014
So it hasn't even been two years?

973
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,054
Gosh, but you've claimed all these titles?

974
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,254
That means all of the boxers around his age...

975
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:14,384
know about him.

976
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:17,255
- That's amazing. - I want to see him boxing.

977
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:18,694
Can you show us some moves?

978
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:20,965
Perhaps the one-two or basic shadowboxing drills.

979
00:33:21,595 --> 00:33:24,265
(Incredible speed)

980
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:26,235
(Jaws dropped)

981
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:28,035
He's...

982
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,334
His moves are definitely different.

983
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:31,544
- He's an amazing boxer. - That was so cool.

984
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,044
- Is boxing fun for you? - Is boxing fun for you?

985
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,045
It is.

986
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,614
I have fun both taking and throwing punches.

987
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,674
We're quite similar.

988
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:38,784
Amazing.

989
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,314
This doesn't make any sense. How are we supposed to spar with him?

990
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,795
- They have been training for... - I'm so scared I got chills.

991
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,625
There's no need for you to worry.

992
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:47,824
This will be your first time taking hits...

993
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,324
and throwing punches.

994
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,624
When you're training like that,

995
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,524
a supervised sparring session with an advanced boxer...

996
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:55,371
- will help you improve your skills. - He's right.

997
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,465
- "Supervised sparring." - "Supervised sparring."

998
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,764
To help you put the techniques into use,

999
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,134
the proficient boxer will lead...

1000
00:34:02,135 --> 00:34:03,375
and assist you.

1001
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:07,275
Sparring and getting hit by a boxer who can control his intensity...

1002
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,445
is beneficial for training.

1003
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:09,715
- Yes, sir. - All right.

1004
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,244
Try to use as many techniques as you can...

1005
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,984
from everything you've learned so far,

1006
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,214
including parrying.

1007
00:34:14,215 --> 00:34:15,754
Goodness, I'm nervous.

1008
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:16,784
(This is their chance to use everything they've learned so far.)

1009
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:20,824
You probably don't have a lot of supervised sparring experience.

1010
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,194
I have done it a lot.

1011
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,394
- You've done it a lot? - You've done it a lot?

1012
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,364
He's conducted supervised sparring...

1013
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:26,724
- for his junior boxers... - That's great.

1014
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,264
Who are in their first and second years of middle school.

1015
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:31,534
You're lucky to have such an excellent sparring partner.

1016
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:33,264
We have the star of Seoul Physical Education Middle School here.

1017
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:34,304
He's amazing.

1018
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,734
- Thank you for being here. - He'll be your supervised...

1019
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,504
Sung Min, think of your role today as sparring with boxers...

1020
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,504
who just graduated from elementary school.

1021
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,914
- It's only been a month for them. - Just a month.

1022
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,714
Please be gentle with us.

1023
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,414
- This is our first time. - Please take it easy on us.

1024
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,254
- Please take it easy on us. - They can hit you hard, right?

1025
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,384
- Yes. - This is our first time.

1026
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:50,554
Go lightly on them.

1027
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,854
Just gentle taps.

1028
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,554
Let's decide the order for sparring.

1029
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,894
We'll start with whoever seems the weakest to you...

1030
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,655
and work our way up to the strongest.

1031
00:34:58,365 --> 00:34:59,894
- I don't want to meet his eyes. - Who seems the weakest?

1032
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:00,995
Let's turn around.

1033
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:02,834
Let's turn around and let him choose us.

1034
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,205
Sung Min, you can just push us.

1035
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,405
Why am I so nervous about this?

1036
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:09,481
This is my first time doing anything like this.

1037
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:10,535
Me too.

1038
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,274
This is my first time being chosen.

1039
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:15,674
I feel nervous about getting chosen.

1040
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:17,074
I'm nervous.

1041
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,614
The person who seems weak to Sung Min.

1042
00:35:19,615 --> 00:35:21,061
(It's finally time for the selection.)

1043
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,255
(Who seems the weakest from the boxer's perspective?)

1044
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,425
(Stunned)

1045
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,224
(The 1st one to spar is Stamina Queen Uie.)

1046
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,225
Really?

1047
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,194
She's really good.

1048
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,134
- Now for the second... - Weakest.

1049
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,135
(I'm really strong.)

1050
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,205
(The 2nd one to spar is Gwang Bok Ju Hyun.)

1051
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:40,235
(Thanks, Sung Min.)

1052
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,734
Are you choosing us in order of prettiness?

1053
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:42,805
What? No.

1054
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:44,904
- In order of prettiness, right? - Excuse me? Yes.

1055
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:45,905
- Right? - Yes.
(Mild-mannered)

1056
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:50,315
We only have the two strongest left.

1057
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:51,985
My heart is pounding.

1058
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,684
I'm a lion.

1059
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:54,915
(I'm Simba Seol.)

1060
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:56,285
(I see. Okay.)

1061
00:35:57,415 --> 00:35:58,585
Please make your choice.

1062
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,525
(The second one to spar is Rocky Geum.)

1063
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,725
I'm going to be king.

1064
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,494
All right.

1065
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:08,495
(The sparring lineup for today)

1066
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:11,264
We’ll have 2 rounds of 1 minute and 30 seconds each.

1067
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:14,165
This is according to the rules of the community sports competition.

1068
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,834
(A sport where hitting and being hit are part of the game)

1069
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:17,935
(Boxing)

1070
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,444
(Only by taking real hits...)

1071
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,645
(can you learn how to hit correctly.)

1072
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:25,415
(The goal of today's supervised sparring: Get hit well!)

1073
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:29,155
(Will the Iron Girls make it through their first supervised sparring?)

1074
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,355
We should...

1075
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:34,625
take this more seriously than we would among ourselves.

1076
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:36,354
With the mindset that...

1077
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:38,595
- we're going to try everything. - Right. Seriously.

1078
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:40,524
- That's it. - Everything we've learned...

1079
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:41,564
Let's try it all.

1080
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,294
With the objective of using them in actual fights.

1081
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,105
- Right? - That's exactly it.

1082
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,005
Uie, you'll begin sparring.

1083
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,375
- Okay. - Gosh, Uie.

1084
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:50,775
- Boxer Uie. - Gosh.

1085
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:52,575
- Uie's first-ever sparring. - Boxer Uie.

1086
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,125
This really is my first ever sparring.

1087
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:58,584
(First, she puts on her mouthpiece.)

1088
00:36:58,585 --> 00:36:59,744
(Exhale)

1089
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:02,015
(The thought of having to get into the ring soon...)

1090
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,525
(has her automatically sighing.)

1091
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:07,725
How did you say we should use this, In Ah?

1092
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,925
Wait. I feel like I'm going to throw up.

1093
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,665
I'm way too nervous.

1094
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:17,695
- Really? - Where? Here?

1095
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:19,404
- Come over here. - Really?

1096
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,965
(Nodding)

1097
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,075
(Actually, Uie...)

1098
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,404
(During the pre-production meeting)

1099
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:28,514
(For Uie, boxing felt unfamiliar...)

1100
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:32,985
(and very scary.)

1101
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,584
(Even the rehearsed moves...)

1102
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:41,895
(were overshadowed by fear in the past month.)

1103
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,594
(Now, her first sparring session...)

1104
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,024
(is just around the corner.)

1105
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,165
Just a second, Coach.

1106
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,535
- I really feel nauseous. - You feel nauseous?

1107
00:37:51,595 --> 00:37:53,805
You have to face these situations. It's okay.

1108
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,504
In any case...

1109
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,475
(Uie tries to steady her breathing.)

1110
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,344
(While steadying her breathing, she puts on her mouthpiece...)

1111
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,615
(and a headgear.)

1112
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:07,215
Okay. Perfect.

1113
00:38:08,015 --> 00:38:09,914
How does it feel having a headgear on for the first time?

1114
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:10,985
- I feel ugly. - It hurts.

1115
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,524
Her eyes are smushed.

1116
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,225
Is that the right fit?

1117
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:16,224
Is her face supposed to...

1118
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,795
(She seems upset.)

1119
00:38:17,825 --> 00:38:19,124
Sung Min doesn't look like that.

1120
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,764
- He's adorable. - He looks so cute.

1121
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,335
- His looks different from ours. - Yes.

1122
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,304
Wait, if he's wearing the open-face headgear,

1123
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:26,365
where do we hit?

1124
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:29,075
You hit his face.

1125
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:31,605
Right.

1126
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:33,904
There are open-face headgears like that.

1127
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:35,775
Headgears obstruct boxers' view,

1128
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,515
so advanced boxers choose open-face ones.

1129
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:41,315
How can we hit someone with such a baby face?

1130
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,954
(He has such a young face that they feel bad about hitting him.)

1131
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:46,654
With this on, it's hard for me to breathe,

1132
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,695
so I feel really nauseous.

1133
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,655
- It's like that for some people. - Really?

1134
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,695
Then I might not be able to breathe at all.

1135
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:54,025
That's insane.

1136
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,894
In boxing, you take punches, throw punches,

1137
00:38:56,895 --> 00:38:59,665
and it's a sport that is both emotionally...

1138
00:39:00,235 --> 00:39:01,404
and physically draining.

1139
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,634
- But you need this experience. - Yes.

1140
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,104
- He's right. - As of right now,

1141
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:08,144
the competition is a month and a half away and it's the real deal.

1142
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:11,445
That's why I think today is an important experience.

1143
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:12,585
You're right.

1144
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:14,245
(Exhaling)

1145
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:16,685
Just do your best and leave the ring. Okay?

1146
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:18,625
- Do my best. - Yes.

1147
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:21,055
I'm going in.

1148
00:39:22,255 --> 00:39:23,654
Kim Uie, you got this!

1149
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,025
(Uie is ready.)

1150
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:28,065
(She's the first to step into the ring.)

1151
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:29,765
(Exhaling)

1152
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:34,465
(In a swift motion, Sung Min gets into the ring.)

1153
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,034
- He's so fast. - Kim Uie, you got this!

1154
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:39,674
I'm nervous for her. Goodness.

1155
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:40,975
This is insane.

1156
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,715
(She calmly steadies her breath.)

1157
00:39:43,975 --> 00:39:45,914
Okay. Ready?

1158
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:46,915
- Yes. - Yes.

1159
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,554
All right. Keep your manners.

1160
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,714
Don't hit low or swear.

1161
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:51,254
- Touch gloves. - Good luck.

1162
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,485
Go back to your places.

1163
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,295
Good luck.

1164
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,195
(Uie's first-ever sparring)

1165
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:02,035
- Let's go, Uie! - Let's go!

1166
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,635
The first round.

1167
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,905
Let's go, Uie!

1168
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,304
- Start. - Let's go!

1169
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,575
(Round 1 begins.)

1170
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:11,305
(As soon as the bell rings, )

1171
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,675
(Sung Min advances quickly.)

1172
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,045
(Gosh!)

1173
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,715
This is to take control.

1174
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:19,685
(They start with light jabs.)

1175
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,714
(They watch for the right moment to attack.)

1176
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:23,755
That's it.

1177
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,655
(Uie throws bold one-two punches.)

1178
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:27,955
(Jab, jab)
- That's it. - Gosh.

1179
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,301
(Uie timidly tries to make continuous blows.)

1180
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:31,864
(But then...)

1181
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,665
(He blocked it.)

1182
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:36,434
(Another jab)

1183
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,235
That's it.

1184
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:39,835
Good.

1185
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:41,165
(One)

1186
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,174
(Two)

1187
00:40:42,175 --> 00:40:43,175
(One)

1188
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:44,235
(Two)

1189
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,045
(Back)

1190
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,545
(One)

1191
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,414
(She was able to make a light hit.)

1192
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,415
- Good. - Gosh.

1193
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:52,685
- She did well. - Yes.

1194
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,544
(Jab, jab, one, two, continuously)

1195
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:55,755
Good. Yes.

1196
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:57,085
That's it.

1197
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:58,554
(Consecutive strikes)

1198
00:40:58,555 --> 00:40:59,555
That's it.

1199
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:03,325
(Uie tries putting the skills that she learned to use.)

1200
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:04,725
(High)

1201
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:06,025
(Low)

1202
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,765
(But...)

1203
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,164
That's it.

1204
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:11,434
(Blocking 2 times)

1205
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,435
(Blocking 3 times)
That's it.

1206
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,875
(Sung Min blocks off all the attacks.)

1207
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:17,274
- Gosh. - Good.

1208
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:18,304
Did you see how he just dodged that?

1209
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,305
He's fast.

1210
00:41:19,745 --> 00:41:22,744
(He quickly dodges the attacks...)

1211
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:23,774
(and hits her face.)

1212
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:24,974
- She got a blow. - You got this.

1213
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:27,015
(He quickly dodges the attacks, and hits her face.)

1214
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:28,915
(Jab)

1215
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:31,054
(The punch came for her face.)

1216
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,155
She got a blow.

1217
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:33,225
Go back in.

1218
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:34,324
(Startled)

1219
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,355
Use what you learned. It's okay.

1220
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:37,494
What was the parry?

1221
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,525
Walk and approach him.

1222
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:41,164
(She uses what she learned. Walk and hit!)

1223
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,195
Good. That's it.

1224
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:43,665
Go in with the blows.

1225
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,834
That's it. Again.

1226
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:47,964
(She watched for the right timing.)

1227
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:48,974
(A bold one, two!)

1228
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:50,575
That's it. It's good how you threw them.

1229
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,044
(But)

1230
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,045
(Sung Min's duckings are agile.)

1231
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:54,205
He really dodges them well.

1232
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,374
When you punch, you need it to do it strongly.

1233
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,574
Good. At his waist.

1234
00:41:57,575 --> 00:41:59,321
(She hit him at the waist, but he struck back right away.)

1235
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:02,085
(She boldly went for the body, )

1236
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:06,085
(but got hit in the face since she had no guard.)

1237
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:08,355
That's it.

1238
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:09,424
(Sung Min's blows continue.)

1239
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:10,494
That's it.

1240
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,225
(Sung Min's blows continue.)

1241
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:14,964
That's it.

1242
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,065
(Swaying)

1243
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:17,365
(Panting)

1244
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:18,804
Her nose is red.

1245
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,465
(Her nose became red.)

1246
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:25,774
(Her steps falter as her power drains away.)

1247
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:27,044
Move forward with straight blows.

1248
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,244
(Her straight jabs are slowly losing angle.)

1249
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,285
Don't focus on pushing them away. Focus on hitting.

1250
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,384
(Time left)

1251
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,584
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds left.

1252
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:36,914
(She keeps the opponent in check.)

1253
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:38,554
- Good luck, Uie. - Good luck, Uie.

1254
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:40,325
- Okay. To the corner. - Good.

1255
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:41,954
- You did well. - You did well.

1256
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:43,725
- Control your breathing. - Breathe.

1257
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,124
Breathe.

1258
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,895
(Uie gasps for breath.)

1259
00:42:48,295 --> 00:42:51,595
(Sung Min also catches his breath.)

1260
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:54,365
- Gosh. - Breathe.

1261
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,174
You did well, but...

1262
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,845
remember to use the high-low combination.

1263
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:04,945
(The 40 seconds flew by with just the breathing.)

1264
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:06,744
Let's begin Round Two.

1265
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:07,745
(Round 2 begins.)

1266
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,384
(Sung Min quickly starts off to take control.)

1267
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:10,415
Good luck, Uie.

1268
00:43:10,915 --> 00:43:12,825
He's approaching to take control.

1269
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:15,024
Go with the high-low combination.

1270
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,654
That's it. Good. Yes.

1271
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,501
(Unlike the 1st round, Sung Min pushes forward.)

1272
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:19,924
(Blocking 1 time)

1273
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:21,124
(Blocking 2 times)

1274
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,365
(Attacking 1 time)

1275
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:23,964
(She has no guard.)

1276
00:43:23,965 --> 00:43:26,364
(A valid strike)

1277
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:27,435
Your guard.

1278
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:29,075
Keep your guard up.

1279
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:32,174
(She still has no guard.)

1280
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:33,705
- Your hands. - That's it.

1281
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,644
(She got a proper hit in the face.)

1282
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:37,914
Oh, gosh.

1283
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:38,984
(Gosh, her jaw!)

1284
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:40,285
She got hit in the jaw.

1285
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:42,415
(And after that...)

1286
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:43,954
Look at him.

1287
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,455
(Vicious attacks)

1288
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,754
(He makes a series of hits.)

1289
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:49,895
What was that just now?

1290
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,465
(Hitting)

1291
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:53,965
(Hitting)

1292
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:57,594
(It's not like Round 1 at all.)

1293
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:58,595
(Gosh!)

1294
00:43:58,765 --> 00:43:59,864
(He avoids Uie's jab.)

1295
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:00,965
In and out.

1296
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:03,675
(Parry and jab!)

1297
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:06,444
(Feint, and then...)

1298
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:09,974
(Straight)

1299
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,075
- Gosh. - That's it.

1300
00:44:11,645 --> 00:44:12,714
Sung Min...

1301
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,484
(Please be gentle on Uie, Sung Min.)

1302
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,715
He's so good.

1303
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:17,885
Thirty seconds.

1304
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,795
You can do it, Uie. You have the strength.

1305
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,685
Her movements look way too slow.

1306
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:23,954
Go forward. In and out.

1307
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:26,825
(Her breath is rougher, and her movements are slower.)

1308
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:29,335
(With an opponent who isn't getting tired, )

1309
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,235
(all she can do is endure.)

1310
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:37,405
(He won't stop the mind-draining attacks.)

1311
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:41,305
(And even a body counter.)

1312
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:42,475
(What?)

1313
00:44:42,476 --> 00:44:43,845
Let's go, Uie!

1314
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,815
- Let's go, Uie! - Let's go, Uie!

1315
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,714
(With the members cheering on her, )

1316
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:50,014
(Uie uses her last bit of strength.)

1317
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:51,015
That's it.

1318
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,816
- Make use of your long reach. - Ten seconds.

1319
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,084
Nine seconds. Great. Keep going.

1320
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:56,154
She can keep going.

1321
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,855
- That's it. Keep looking at him. - Nice.

1322
00:44:57,955 --> 00:44:59,024
Keep looking even if you get hit.

1323
00:44:59,025 --> 00:45:00,124
(She doesn't give up even if she gets hit.)

1324
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,865
- Keep going. - Let's go, Uie.

1325
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:03,495
Keep your guard up.

1326
00:45:03,496 --> 00:45:04,834
I think I'm going to cry.

1327
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,781
That was a good throw. You have to keep punching.

1328
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:09,305
- Good. Make use of your reach. - Good.

1329
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:11,735
- She's crying. - That's it. Keep going.

1330
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:14,405
- I can't watch. - Keep going.

1331
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,174
She's pushing through.

1332
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:17,545
Let's cheer her on.

1333
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,444
(While Ju Hyun is holding back tears...)

1334
00:45:20,445 --> 00:45:22,355
Stop. Good job.

1335
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:24,914
Good job.

1336
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:28,684
(She gasps heavily for breath.)

1337
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,795
Good job.

1338
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,025
Yes.

1339
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,994
Good job. You did so well.

1340
00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:38,294
(She finished her first sparring, which she had feared.)

1341
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,864
- Good job. - Come here.

1342
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,264
Thank you so much.

1343
00:45:41,265 --> 00:45:42,274
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

1344
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,205
(She gives her thanks to her opponent.)

1345
00:45:44,805 --> 00:45:47,574
(She got through her first sparring match!)

1346
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:48,874
Uie. How was it?

1347
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:50,014
- That was a minute and 30 seconds. - It's completely different.

1348
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:51,015
In what way?

1349
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:53,014
The minute and 30 seconds that we had been doing...

1350
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,745
We even practiced for three minutes.

1351
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,114
It was different. With the headgear...

1352
00:45:57,115 --> 00:45:59,755
and mouthpiece on, the minute and 30 seconds...

1353
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:01,824
After 30 seconds, my eyes started losing focus...

1354
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,054
- Oh, no. - because I was tired.

1355
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,394
- Really? - And your legs give in, too.

1356
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,395
Yes.

1357
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:06,756
If it's like that for her, then...

1358
00:46:07,395 --> 00:46:09,964
But I think that during the first round,

1359
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:11,935
- he was only learning about me. - Yes.

1360
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,565
- "Let's see how she does." - I see.

1361
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,575
(He was taking in Uie's attacks during Round 1.)

1362
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,475
His eyes changed at the next round.

1363
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:23,514
(Merciless flurry of attacks)

1364
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,215
It was like...

1365
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:28,984
He was all over like this.

1366
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:29,985
(That much?)

1367
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:31,115
He moved like this.

1368
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,385
And I know what I learned,

1369
00:46:33,785 --> 00:46:35,655
and I tried to use them,

1370
00:46:35,695 --> 00:46:37,695
- He was gone, right? - but he was already gone.

1371
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,664
Yes, he was blocking them all, so what could she do?

1372
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:44,034
- And it's so hard to hit the face. - Yes. Right?

1373
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,334
Do you remember how you asked if you could really hit him?

1374
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:47,335
Yes.

1375
00:46:48,365 --> 00:46:51,304
(Wait! How can I hit someone who has no guard?)

1376
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:52,974
(They didn't know their future...)

1377
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:55,405
(and was worried for no reason.)

1378
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,174
- He won't get hit, guys. - He won't get hit.

1379
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:58,774
- He won't get hit. - Hit him as much as you want.

1380
00:46:58,775 --> 00:46:59,845
You're so cool.

1381
00:47:00,015 --> 00:47:02,414
He was doing all the footwork...

1382
00:47:02,415 --> 00:47:03,885
that I kept telling you about.

1383
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,684
- Did you see it? - Yes.

1384
00:47:05,685 --> 00:47:06,954
Do you see why I said it?

1385
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,725
- It's amazing. - He's so cool.

1386
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:11,455
(During both rounds, )

1387
00:47:13,065 --> 00:47:17,295
(his movements did not stop.)

1388
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:19,234
Can you stay put in one place?

1389
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:21,204
- No. - No, right?

1390
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,275
You're the best.

1391
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:23,604
He blocked everything, so she couldn't do anything.

1392
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:24,605
- Right? - Yes.

1393
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:25,874
His footwork is amazing.

1394
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:27,045
Seriously.

1395
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:28,545
You're so cool.

1396
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:32,685
First of all, when we had the relay of attacks,

1397
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:36,214
she didn't avoid my punches, and kept watching me...

1398
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:39,184
to keep fighting, and I think that was good.

1399
00:47:39,185 --> 00:47:40,285
Did I do that?

1400
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:43,425
During the last part, you kept going for it.

1401
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,365
(When they had 10 seconds left during Round 2)

1402
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:51,565
(she didn't avoid him and fought against him.)

1403
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,135
I think she lacks a bit...

1404
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:56,705
in her movements and footwork.

1405
00:47:57,035 --> 00:47:58,374
- You're exactly right. - Yes.

1406
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,674
You need to punch quickly,

1407
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:01,674
but you keep going around and attack hesitantly.

1408
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:03,174
There were a few of those moments.

1409
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:05,214
You need to be bold with them.

1410
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,014
Once you are confident with your one-two,

1411
00:48:07,015 --> 00:48:08,344
you can be bold with your strikes.

1412
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:09,715
After this,

1413
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:12,585
I can see that I need to work on my one-two.

1414
00:48:13,085 --> 00:48:15,354
And this one. I need to do the one we learned.

1415
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:17,695
And I need to control my breathing well.

1416
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:20,494
- My vision got dim in an instant. - Right?

1417
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,271
But considering that it's your first sparring session,

1418
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:23,964
- you had many attacks, - Yes, she was bold.

1419
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:25,434
- so that was great. - You were cool.

1420
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,765
And Sung Min is very experienced,

1421
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:31,274
so he only taps us lightly.

1422
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,574
He won't hit you hard, ever.

1423
00:48:32,575 --> 00:48:34,744
- Didn't it hurt? - No. I was fine.

1424
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,544
- Why are you crying? - I couldn't watch.

1425
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:40,144
Seeing it in person, I really couldn't watch.

1426
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,885
My heart felt heavy.

1427
00:48:42,955 --> 00:48:43,955
Really?

1428
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,825
- Oh, no. - What's wrong with you?

1429
00:48:46,285 --> 00:48:47,425
What is it?

1430
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:50,124
I think it will be okay when I do it,

1431
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:51,524
- but watching her was... - She is being real.

1432
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:52,594
Since she was getting hit?

1433
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,824
And when we did the triathlon,

1434
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:57,465
she had a hard time, and we overcame a lot of things.

1435
00:48:57,735 --> 00:49:01,604
But watching her fight all alone...

1436
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,775
was so...

1437
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:05,004
Did I get hit a lot?

1438
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:06,045
I thought...

1439
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:08,375
I didn't think I got hit a lot.

1440
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:10,814
(Uie's 1st sparring session results:)

1441
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:13,744
(Strengths: She tried to apply the skills she learned...)

1442
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:16,414
(and showed an attitude of refusing to give up, )

1443
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:18,015
(backed by her endless stamina.)

1444
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:22,354
(Weaknesses: Her weak footwork...)

1445
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:26,125
(and slow movements need to be improved!)

1446
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:28,085
I feel much better now that it's over.

1447
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,834
- You were so cool, though. - I really feel much better.

1448
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,504
It's like after jumping off the bungee platform...

1449
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:34,835
after standing there for so long.

1450
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,135
It's my turn next.

1451
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,175
I don't think I can ever let my family box.

1452
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,174
But today's match will be the weakest ever.

1453
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:46,314
- I know. - You need to...

1454
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:47,584
- That's true. - toughen up mentally.

1455
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,485
We'll be hitting and getting hit by our colleagues.

1456
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,685
- You need to brace yourselves. - Okay.

1457
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:54,784
I don't think I can do this.

1458
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,095
It's okay. You can do it.

1459
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:58,854
You're good.

1460
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:00,264
- I know you can do it. - You just have to do it.

1461
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:01,795
- Just as you've done. - You're good.

1462
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:04,234
It's not that I'm scared.

1463
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:07,064
- Ju Hyun, he can avoid everything. - I can't watch him.

1464
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:08,835
He's strong. He's really strong.

1465
00:50:09,035 --> 00:50:12,374
I think Ju Hyun needs more sparring than others.

1466
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:15,405
(Ju Hyun needs more sparring to strengthen her mind.)

1467
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:16,714
Good luck.

1468
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:19,115
(Sung Min is ready.)

1469
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:21,514
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

1470
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:22,585
You can do it.

1471
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:27,524
(She overcomes her fear and enters the ring.)

1472
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,624
Park Ju Hyun, brace yourself.

1473
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:31,255
Don't be emotional.

1474
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,495
- Be cold. - Let's go!

1475
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:33,995
Be cool.

1476
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,495
Round One.

1477
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,294
(The woman who's good at real games...)

1478
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:39,264
(will show you.)

1479
00:50:39,265 --> 00:50:40,265
- Go. - You can do it.

1480
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:42,035
(Round 1 begins.)

1481
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,141
Be cool.

1482
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,152
Round One.

1483
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,951
(The woman who's good at real games...)

1484
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:49,821
(will show you.)

1485
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:50,881
- Go. - You can do it.

1486
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,022
(Round 1 begins.)

1487
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,221
(The two suddenly flare up.)

1488
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:58,222
Yes.

1489
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,331
(Sung Min attacks first.)

1490
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:00,932
(Hook)

1491
00:51:01,832 --> 00:51:03,131
(Hitting the face)

1492
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:05,031
Keep moving with your footwork. Don't just rush in.

1493
00:51:05,032 --> 00:51:06,531
Ju Hyun, you can go stronger.

1494
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:07,572
(Her wild side is on.)

1495
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:10,172
(Ju Hyun gets so close...)

1496
00:51:10,342 --> 00:51:12,342
(that it's scary.)

1497
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:14,641
(Dashing in)

1498
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:16,041
Keep moving with your footwork. Don't just rush in.

1499
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:17,312
(Sung Min, 1 valid strike)

1500
00:51:17,612 --> 00:51:18,612
(Guarding)

1501
00:51:18,613 --> 00:51:20,811
(Attacking)

1502
00:51:20,812 --> 00:51:21,952
(However)

1503
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,852
(Gwang Bok won't let go once she bites.)

1504
00:51:25,222 --> 00:51:26,322
(One, two)

1505
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,321
(She dashes without running away.)

1506
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:29,391
There she goes.

1507
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:30,522
(Punching)

1508
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:34,931
(Attacking 1 time)

1509
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:38,262
(Attacking 2 times)

1510
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:40,762
(Ju Hyun keeps throwing punches without falling back.)

1511
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,141
(Attacking the body)

1512
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,342
(Counterattack right away)

1513
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:45,902
(Groaning)

1514
00:51:46,012 --> 00:51:47,671
Guard up.

1515
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:48,672
(Surprised)

1516
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:51,041
- Keep your guard up. - She keeps barging in.

1517
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:52,712
- She keeps going forward, right? - Yes.

1518
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:55,812
(Burning with madness)

1519
00:51:56,022 --> 00:51:58,382
- Keep looking. - Punch hard.

1520
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,491
- Harder. - Keep punching.

1521
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,591
- Duck. - Go stronger!

1522
00:52:01,592 --> 00:52:04,722
(She pushes her head forward and dashes like a bull.)

1523
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,491
(Sung Min who was looking...)

1524
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:08,531
(looks for his chance and attacks.)

1525
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:09,931
- It's not easy to hit the face. - That's it.

1526
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,362
(He turns even before you know it.)

1527
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:13,772
(A punch in the face)

1528
00:52:13,872 --> 00:52:16,002
(Getting faint)

1529
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:18,042
(Sung Min read Ju Hyun's pattern.)

1530
00:52:18,072 --> 00:52:19,912
(He waits for the timing.)

1531
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:21,512
- Keep it up. - Bend down.

1532
00:52:21,812 --> 00:52:24,582
(He steals Ju Hyun's chance to attack...)

1533
00:52:24,882 --> 00:52:28,712
(and attacks quickly.)

1534
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:29,852
(Panting)

1535
00:52:29,853 --> 00:52:32,322
(After getting attacked, she immediately becomes drained.)

1536
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:33,591
(Remaining time)

1537
00:52:33,592 --> 00:52:35,152
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

1538
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,722
(Bowing, panting)

1539
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:39,992
Keep going straight. Don't stop punching.

1540
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:41,261
- Look at him. Stop. - Stop.

1541
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:42,701
(Round 1 ends.)

1542
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:44,532
- That was really hard. - Okay. Good job.

1543
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,732
- He's so fast. - What?

1544
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:49,002
It ends so fast. That was a minute and 30 seconds.

1545
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:50,701
He's so fast.

1546
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:51,702
Him?

1547
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:52,972
(I know how that feels.)

1548
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,371
(Embarrassed)

1549
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,971
- I can't keep up with him. - Right?

1550
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,782
That's why someone fast is picky.

1551
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:02,111
And you don't look at him. You have to look at him.

1552
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,651
(Round 2 begins.)

1553
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:05,122
You can do it.

1554
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,722
- You can do it. - The last round.

1555
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:11,222
Get closer. Keep punching. That's right.

1556
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:15,392
(Her wild side is on.)

1557
00:53:15,762 --> 00:53:19,532
(She gets close and keeps throwing a series of punches.)

1558
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:20,802
Keep your guard up and punch.

1559
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:23,241
(She blocks...)

1560
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,542
(and attacks.)

1561
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:27,612
(Blocking)

1562
00:53:28,512 --> 00:53:29,741
(Blocking)

1563
00:53:29,742 --> 00:53:31,042
(A valid strike)

1564
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:33,552
- You got it. - Keep your stance.

1565
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:35,151
Keep going.

1566
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:36,622
(But she soon runs out of breath.)

1567
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:38,952
(Ju Hyun hesitates for a second.)

1568
00:53:39,222 --> 00:53:42,222
(Sung Min takes his chance to get closer.)

1569
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:46,462
(Punching endlessly)

1570
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:48,391
- Gosh. What's wrong with you? - Look at him!

1571
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,931
(Gosh. What's wrong with you?)

1572
00:53:49,932 --> 00:53:51,731
(He avoids Ju Hyun's jab...)

1573
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,701
(and hits her body.)

1574
00:53:53,702 --> 00:53:55,832
(Blocking)

1575
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:58,601
(His series of attacks makes Ju Hyun go crazy.)

1576
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,202
- Keep looking. - What's wrong with you?

1577
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,981
(Her heavy body becomes a target.)

1578
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:07,382
Do punch, punch. Try one-two!

1579
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:09,182
(She throws one-two punches.)

1580
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:11,251
It's do or die. There isn't much time left.

1581
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:12,581
(Punching in the air)

1582
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,698
(Because she bent down, she didn't see the opponent.)

1583
00:54:14,722 --> 00:54:15,791
(10 seconds left.)

1584
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:16,952
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

1585
00:54:17,022 --> 00:54:19,121
- Keep going. You got it. - Keep hitting him.

1586
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,461
- You can do it. - Keep going.

1587
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:22,332
- Gosh. - You can do it.

1588
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:24,731
- Stop. - Good job.

1589
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:26,002
This is so tiring.

1590
00:54:26,502 --> 00:54:27,932
This is so tiring.

1591
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,702
Gosh, this is so tiring.

1592
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,042
- Good job. - Gosh. How can he be so fast?

1593
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:39,382
(Ju Hyun is exhausted after two rounds.)

1594
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:41,511
(On the other hand, the young boxer is fine.)

1595
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:43,422
You're good. You're amazing.

1596
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,021
How are you so good at it?

1597
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:48,551
- How can he not get one? - It's amazing.

1598
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,161
Ju Hyun, what was it like to try?

1599
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,242
It was your first sparring.

1600
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,202
I couldn't do anything because I couldn't see.

1601
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,962
Because he kept moving to the left and the right,

1602
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:58,962
Ju Hyun threw punches when there was no one in front.

1603
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,271
(While sparring)

1604
00:55:01,272 --> 00:55:02,531
Keep going.

1605
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,672
(Ju Hyun punched the air many times.)

1606
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:08,941
When I got exhausted later,

1607
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:10,242
I couldn't retrieve my arm.

1608
00:55:11,012 --> 00:55:12,952
Because it felt so heavy,

1609
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:15,312
I couldn't retrieve my arm quickly after punching.

1610
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:18,221
I was like, "If I get punched here, I'll be dead."

1611
00:55:18,222 --> 00:55:19,451
Oh, my.

1612
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:20,492
(Nervous)

1613
00:55:20,622 --> 00:55:22,621
Was I right? Did you see his face?

1614
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:24,391
He seems faster when you're in the ring with him...

1615
00:55:24,392 --> 00:55:25,591
than when you're watching from outside.

1616
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:26,592
Really?

1617
00:55:26,593 --> 00:55:27,992
Sung Min, how was it?

1618
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:31,031
You were close to me and were doing good at first.

1619
00:55:31,032 --> 00:55:32,601
You kept getting close to me.

1620
00:55:32,602 --> 00:55:35,802
But when you lost balance, you hit me with your head first.

1621
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:37,641
You lost balance.

1622
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:39,912
I think I pushed you with my head a few times.

1623
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:43,542
(She was nice and close at first.)

1624
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:47,782
(But after she got drained in Round 2)

1625
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:51,552
(Ju Hyun dropped her head and kept dashing.)

1626
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,321
I couldn't see him anyway.

1627
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:54,551
So I gave up on looking at him.

1628
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:55,622
You can't do that.

1629
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,421
- I couldn't see him at all. - That's too dangerous.

1630
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,691
Even if you get punched, keep your eyes on him.

1631
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,432
You have to watch where he goes.

1632
00:56:03,302 --> 00:56:05,631
The way I saw it was that you didn't strain your waist.

1633
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,872
You were just tapping him with your fists.

1634
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:10,141
- But... - Were you able to hit him hard?

1635
00:56:10,142 --> 00:56:11,601
- it took too long to get ready. - Because...

1636
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:13,141
you were afraid of getting punched if you were to do this, right?

1637
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:14,541
- Yes. - That's why.

1638
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,311
That's what happens in the real game.

1639
00:56:16,312 --> 00:56:18,382
That's your punch.

1640
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,152
That's what your punch is like right now.

1641
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,451
(Ju Hyun's first sparring session results:)

1642
00:56:22,452 --> 00:56:24,751
(Strengths: She has a strong will to get close.)

1643
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:27,022
(The mad boxer flusters the opponent.)

1644
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:30,891
(Weaknesses: It is dangerous to swing the arms...)

1645
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:33,631
(without looking forward.)

1646
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:36,661
(She needs to practice punching with stamina...)

1647
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:38,632
(without dropping her head.)

1648
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:41,171
I think you guys are cool.

1649
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:43,071
- I know. You're cool. - You're cool.

1650
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:45,171
- It's cool. I know that. - You have to memorize the moves.

1651
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:46,372
But after I got punched...

1652
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:48,912
Your head gets pushed when you get hit.

1653
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:52,041
It takes a while for me to get ready again.

1654
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,051
- Right. - That's true.

1655
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,211
- If he hit me twice in a row, - Right.

1656
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,751
- I would've been knocked down. - You couldn't see him, right?

1657
00:56:57,752 --> 00:56:58,852
I couldn't see him at all.

1658
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:00,151
This is really necessary...

1659
00:57:00,152 --> 00:57:02,591
- now that I see it. - You guys need to practice a lot.

1660
00:57:02,592 --> 00:57:03,661
He is so cool.

1661
00:57:03,662 --> 00:57:05,491
(The third player is Keum Sae Rok.)

1662
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:06,562
Yes.

1663
00:57:08,392 --> 00:57:10,102
- Is it comfortable? Are you okay? - Yes.

1664
00:57:10,362 --> 00:57:12,232
Tighter. Yes.

1665
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:14,932
Tighter. Thank you.

1666
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:16,901
- Let's go. - Is it okay?

1667
00:57:16,902 --> 00:57:17,942
Yes.

1668
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:19,971
The player comes in.

1669
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:21,311
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1670
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,082
- Go, Keum Sae Rok. - Let's go.

1671
00:57:23,282 --> 00:57:24,282
Wake your beast instinct up.

1672
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:25,611
- All right. Round One. - Let's go.

1673
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:26,882
Be dogged.

1674
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:29,152
- Go. - Let's go.

1675
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:30,222
Good luck.

1676
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:32,682
(Sung Min quickly gets close upon the start.)

1677
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:34,752
Yes. Keep looking.

1678
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,861
(Sae Rok watches him first while throwing light punches.)

1679
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:38,922
Yes.

1680
00:57:38,992 --> 00:57:40,632
(A strong one-two)

1681
00:57:40,932 --> 00:57:43,762
(Throwing punches with her all)

1682
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:45,901
Good. She's different.

1683
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:47,342
(She puts her guard up immediately.)

1684
00:57:47,472 --> 00:57:49,031
(She slowly spins around the opponent.)

1685
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,042
(Jab)

1686
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:51,601
(Slowly. Jab, high, low)

1687
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,311
Yes. Faster.

1688
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:54,441
(Jab, high, low)

1689
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:56,342
(One, two)

1690
00:57:56,482 --> 00:58:00,282
(Sung Min watches Sae Rok.)

1691
00:58:00,552 --> 00:58:01,781
(He attacks her body even before you know it.)

1692
00:58:01,782 --> 00:58:02,852
He's good.

1693
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:04,882
(A fake upward punch)

1694
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,022
(Then he attacks below.)

1695
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:10,162
(Showing a real high-low combination)

1696
00:58:10,462 --> 00:58:12,762
(While everyone's surprised...)

1697
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:13,992
Hit me.

1698
00:58:14,392 --> 00:58:17,002
(Sae Rok becomes more militant.)

1699
00:58:17,362 --> 00:58:18,432
Get in there.

1700
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,602
Try another uppercut.

1701
00:58:20,632 --> 00:58:22,971
(She looks forward and throws a series of punches.)

1702
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:24,842
- Keep it up. - You got it.

1703
00:58:25,942 --> 00:58:28,742
(She looks straight at the target...)

1704
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:31,281
(and throws the one-two with her long arms.)

1705
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:32,712
Good job. Corner him even more.

1706
00:58:34,182 --> 00:58:35,452
Good. Nice block.

1707
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:38,152
- Try high and low. - Try high.

1708
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:40,291
Don't try to hit hard. Keep punching.

1709
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:42,852
(It consumes a lot of energy.)

1710
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:43,991
Try to punch high.

1711
00:58:43,992 --> 00:58:45,338
(Sung Min doesn't miss that chance.)

1712
00:58:45,362 --> 00:58:47,361
(He pretends to enter slowly.)

1713
00:58:47,362 --> 00:58:51,132
(Then he quickly switches to attack.)

1714
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:52,332
(I will show you what speed is.)

1715
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,672
Sae Rocky.

1716
00:58:53,802 --> 00:58:54,802
Yes.

1717
00:58:54,803 --> 00:58:56,172
Try to punch more.

1718
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:57,701
- Keep your eyes on him. - Your legs.

1719
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:01,642
(Sae Rok moves big and slow.)

1720
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:04,712
- He's so good at avoiding. - Try again. Yes.

1721
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:06,012
Sae Rocky.

1722
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:09,511
Don't just hit.

1723
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,181
Yes. Ten seconds.

1724
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:13,451
- Do everything you want! - Don't just hit.

1725
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:16,092
(She keeps throwing punches.)

1726
00:59:16,192 --> 00:59:18,161
(At that moment)

1727
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:22,162
(Sung Min punches at a crazy speed.)

1728
00:59:23,802 --> 00:59:25,842
- What was that just now? - What was that just now?

1729
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,671
(As soon as Sae Rok stops punching, )

1730
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:30,541
Let's go.

1731
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:32,102
(he turns quickly.)

1732
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:39,082
(Sae Rok was helpless to his series of punches.)

1733
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:42,311
(Not only the one who got attacked...)

1734
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,522
What was that just now?

1735
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,381
(Shocked)

1736
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:46,951
- What was that just now? - What was that just now?

1737
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:48,692
She looked like Sha Wujing just now.

1738
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:49,821
"Sha Wujing?"

1739
00:59:49,822 --> 00:59:51,362
(Calm)

1740
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:53,161
He was here.

1741
00:59:53,162 --> 00:59:54,862
When I looked up, he was here.

1742
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,502
If I were there, I would've been frightened.

1743
00:59:58,002 --> 01:00:00,972
(Shaking her head)

1744
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:02,771
Good job. Keep breathing.

1745
01:00:02,772 --> 01:00:04,502
(Stunned)

1746
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:07,971
Use all your energy this time. Okay?

1747
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,371
(She'll use all her energy in Round 2.)

1748
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:10,782
And try the parry.

1749
01:00:11,242 --> 01:00:12,242
- Ready. - Give it a try.

1750
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:15,611
(Round 2 begins.)

1751
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,922
(Striding)

1752
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,421
He's taking control.

1753
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:19,581
(Sung Min jabs without hesitation.)

1754
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:20,591
You can do it.

1755
01:00:20,592 --> 01:00:22,191
(Blocking with a parry)

1756
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:23,192
Yes.

1757
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:24,992
(Jab)
(Parry)

1758
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:27,892
(Jab, parry)

1759
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:30,801
(She gets ready...)

1760
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:33,061
(and throws a straight punch.)

1761
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,202
Yes. Good job.

1762
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,672
(They keep attacking and defending.)

1763
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:39,812
(Then she attacks right in his face.)

1764
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,211
(Shocked)

1765
01:00:44,212 --> 01:00:45,542
Yes. You got it.

1766
01:00:46,082 --> 01:00:47,111
She hit him.

1767
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,112
(Sae Rok did it!)

1768
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,852
(Without getting worked up...)

1769
01:00:50,122 --> 01:00:51,181
(One, two)

1770
01:00:51,182 --> 01:00:52,328
- Yes. Good job. - Very good.

1771
01:00:52,352 --> 01:00:53,491
That was nice.

1772
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:54,891
(One)

1773
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:55,922
(Two)

1774
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,191
Yes. Good job.

1775
01:00:58,192 --> 01:01:00,432
- To the end. - I saw it too.

1776
01:01:01,062 --> 01:01:02,161
Nice.

1777
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:03,162
(However)
Yes.

1778
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:06,601
- Yes. - Where did he go?

1779
01:01:06,602 --> 01:01:09,032
To the end. Keep punching. Hook.

1780
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,542
Straight. Keep punching.

1781
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:14,771
(She swings her arms without a plan.)

1782
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:17,012
(She ends up punching the air.)

1783
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,742
What are you doing? Get your act up!

1784
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:22,812
Turn around. Yes.

1785
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,181
- What are you doing? - Keep looking.

1786
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:25,482
Turn around. Keep looking.

1787
01:01:25,652 --> 01:01:27,292
Sae Rok, keep your eyes on him. Yes.

1788
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:28,852
Good job, Sae Rok.

1789
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,561
- Keep your eyes on him. - You're almost there.

1790
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,321
(Faint)

1791
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:33,392
Go, Sae Rok.

1792
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,791
- Watch him. - Keep your eyes on him.

1793
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:35,792
It's almost over.

1794
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:37,762
You're losing. Hurry up.

1795
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:39,702
- Don't give up. - Don't give up.

1796
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:41,401
- Keep punching Sung Min. - Ten seconds.

1797
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:42,642
- Ten seconds. - Keep punching.

1798
01:01:42,772 --> 01:01:44,801
- Keep trying. - Ten seconds.

1799
01:01:44,802 --> 01:01:46,001
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

1800
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,211
- Ten seconds. - Yes.

1801
01:01:47,212 --> 01:01:48,272
Keep going.

1802
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:50,681
Five seconds. Don't give up.

1803
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:51,782
- Yes. - Block.

1804
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:55,352
(Round 2 ends.)

1805
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,722
(Polite)

1806
01:01:58,152 --> 01:01:59,381
Still, you were pretty good.

1807
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,322
(Thanks to the boxer who fought with his best.)

1808
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:05,222
(Trudging)

1809
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:06,462
Good job.

1810
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,032
This is how you'll feel after the game.

1811
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,462
Good job.

1812
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,602
(Somebody help Sae Rok.)

1813
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:17,241
(He's panting more than before.)

1814
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:21,242
Sae Rok, you learned boxing for only a month,

1815
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:23,042
yet you still threw punches.

1816
01:02:23,942 --> 01:02:25,882
Seriously,

1817
01:02:26,312 --> 01:02:27,712
when he punches me in a row,

1818
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:29,552
I'm like, "What?"

1819
01:02:30,482 --> 01:02:31,782
Everything stops.

1820
01:02:32,122 --> 01:02:34,552
Near the end, I ran out of energy.

1821
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,562
- You couldn't attack, right? - I couldn't...

1822
01:02:38,362 --> 01:02:39,821
- do anything. - Right?

1823
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,061
- I'm not overwhelmed. - Breathe.

1824
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:42,791
- I just can't breathe. - Exactly.

1825
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,531
That's what happened in just three minutes.

1826
01:02:45,532 --> 01:02:48,001
You see how much energy boxing requires?

1827
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:50,571
At first, you were passionate.

1828
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:52,442
You also had a nice posture.

1829
01:02:52,942 --> 01:02:55,248
(At first, she stuck to the basic jab-jab-one-two routine.)

1830
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:58,082
(Sae Rok played calmly.)

1831
01:02:58,182 --> 01:02:59,281
(But after the second half, )

1832
01:02:59,282 --> 01:03:02,681
You had only one pattern. I was able to read you easily.

1833
01:03:02,682 --> 01:03:06,252
(Sae Rok's attack pattern was read, so she was attacked helplessly.)

1834
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:09,452
Oh, you read my pattern.

1835
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:12,122
That's why I always tell you...

1836
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,332
to keep your attack patterns diverse.

1837
01:03:15,432 --> 01:03:16,901
After a couple of times, they read it.

1838
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,161
(The number of weapons will determine your victory.)

1839
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,861
Seriously, my stamina...

1840
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,171
(She felt the limit of her stamina again.)

1841
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,232
can't keep up.

1842
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:24,101
Sung Min controlled his punches...

1843
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:25,662
because this was a supervised sparring.

1844
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,441
If the opponent was determined,

1845
01:03:28,442 --> 01:03:30,141
- it was game over. - Right.

1846
01:03:30,142 --> 01:03:32,181
I would've got hit in a row...

1847
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:33,651
- and knocked out. - You would've got hit...

1848
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:34,812
and passed out.

1849
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:37,121
Do you realize how important your stamina is?

1850
01:03:37,122 --> 01:03:39,151
You've been practicing for three-minute rounds.

1851
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:41,272
But you're already exhausted for a minute and a half.

1852
01:03:41,592 --> 01:03:42,721
(Sae Rok once again realized the limit of stamina.)

1853
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:44,492
- It means you can't keep up yet. - Gosh.

1854
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,261
(Sae Rok's first sparring session results:)

1855
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:49,591
(Strengths: She was calm enough to try the techniques she learned.)

1856
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,952
(She blocked just as she learned.)

1857
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:53,331
(Weaknesses: She lacks diverse attack patterns.)

1858
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:55,431
(Due to her lack of stamina, )

1859
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,042
(she needs training to strengthen her stamina.)

1860
01:03:58,372 --> 01:03:59,941
I have a question.

1861
01:03:59,942 --> 01:04:03,612
When she brushed past your face, you smiled.

1862
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,242
Why did you smile?

1863
01:04:06,112 --> 01:04:08,451
(When Sae Rok punched him during the sparring...)

1864
01:04:08,452 --> 01:04:10,252
(Punching)

1865
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,022
(Grinning)

1866
01:04:13,522 --> 01:04:15,692
- It was scary. - I didn't expect her to hit me.

1867
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:19,391
Did you smile because it was unexpected?

1868
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:20,561
That means you're good.

1869
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:21,761
- It's all about confidence. - Right?

1870
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:24,731
You got punched when you didn't expect that.

1871
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:26,261
(Dazed)

1872
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,331
(On the other hand)

1873
01:04:27,332 --> 01:04:29,632
I'm so nervous. I've been nervous for so long.

1874
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:32,401
This is to test whether you're able to use...

1875
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:34,372
what you've learned until now.

1876
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:36,882
So focus on that. Okay?

1877
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:39,082
What did I learn?

1878
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:41,312
I don't remember what I learned.

1879
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,421
- What you need to do is jab. - Let's go!

1880
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:44,751
Jab, jab, high, low. Punch, punch.

1881
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:46,381
And keep throwing jabs...

1882
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,491
and keep your eyes high and low.

1883
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:50,092
- Try that. Okay? - Yes.

1884
01:04:51,122 --> 01:04:53,591
(The ace comes forward.)

1885
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:54,731
Go, In Ah.

1886
01:04:54,732 --> 01:04:56,932
She's the strongest, Sung Min.

1887
01:04:57,162 --> 01:04:59,261
Blue versus red.

1888
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,778
(Sung Min's fine even though this is his fourth sparring.)

1889
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:01,972
- Focus. - Glove touch.

1890
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:03,131
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1891
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:04,572
- Don't get hurt. - To your corners.

1892
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:06,842
Round One.

1893
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:08,612
Go.

1894
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,012
(Round 1 begins.)

1895
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:15,452
(Blocking with parry as soon as she begins)

1896
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:18,351
(They keep each other in check.)

1897
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:20,251
(Then she tries the low jab.)

1898
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:21,752
(Low)

1899
01:05:24,762 --> 01:05:26,992
(While Sung Min throws a punch...)

1900
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:29,092
(Low again)

1901
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:30,901
(Low)

1902
01:05:30,902 --> 01:05:31,902
(High)

1903
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,932
She did it.

1904
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:35,302
(Trying high and low as she learned)

1905
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,801
(Sung Min jabs at ease like a veteran.)

1906
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:38,972
(Body jab)

1907
01:05:41,172 --> 01:05:42,512
It's not easy to hit.

1908
01:05:43,142 --> 01:05:44,242
It's not easy to hit.

1909
01:05:45,082 --> 01:05:46,882
She's avoiding. Good job, Seol In Ah.

1910
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:47,982
(One-two in return)

1911
01:05:49,352 --> 01:05:53,222
(Applying the shuffle)

1912
01:05:53,752 --> 01:05:55,122
(One, two)

1913
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:57,362
Nice.

1914
01:05:57,962 --> 01:06:01,191
(Shuffling and punching freely)

1915
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,362
(In Ah throws one-two punches without breaks.)

1916
01:06:03,732 --> 01:06:05,061
(Exclaiming)

1917
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:07,001
You need to throw longer punches. He's too good at dodging.

1918
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:08,002
(Low, 2nd time)

1919
01:06:08,232 --> 01:06:09,931
- He's flustered. - Yes.

1920
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,642
Yes. Good job.

1921
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:15,841
(Low)

1922
01:06:15,842 --> 01:06:16,842
(Feint)

1923
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:18,441
(One, two)

1924
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,402
Even if you missed him, you still did a good job.

1925
01:06:20,612 --> 01:06:22,251
(In Ah takes back steps and looks for her chance again.)

1926
01:06:22,252 --> 01:06:23,281
Good job.

1927
01:06:23,282 --> 01:06:24,282
(Shuffling)

1928
01:06:24,283 --> 01:06:25,352
(Pivoting)

1929
01:06:25,622 --> 01:06:26,622
- Yes. - Punch.

1930
01:06:26,623 --> 01:06:28,991
(Shuffling by stepping back)

1931
01:06:28,992 --> 01:06:30,992
(Pivoting by turning sides)

1932
01:06:31,222 --> 01:06:33,391
(After taking left and right steps by doing turning-jab-jab-two, )

1933
01:06:33,392 --> 01:06:34,931
(she succeeds in attacking him.)

1934
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:36,062
(Attacking)

1935
01:06:36,732 --> 01:06:37,862
Yes. Good job.

1936
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:43,772
(Her strong straight punch attacked Sung Min in the spot.)

1937
01:06:44,242 --> 01:06:45,371
Yes. Good job.

1938
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,242
Keep going and get his abdomen. Yes. Good.

1939
01:06:48,512 --> 01:06:50,812
(A series of punches)

1940
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:53,212
Keep going and get his abdomen. Yes. Good.

1941
01:06:53,582 --> 01:06:54,612
Good job.

1942
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:56,481
(After a series of punches, )

1943
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:58,152
(she catches her breath.)

1944
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:02,621
(Chasing)

1945
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:04,062
Now, she's in it for real.

1946
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,132
Now, she's in it for real.

1947
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:09,462
That's scary.

1948
01:07:10,232 --> 01:07:11,362
But...

1949
01:07:12,132 --> 01:07:13,832
(Jab)

1950
01:07:14,772 --> 01:07:16,672
Sung Min's serious right now.

1951
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:20,071
(When In Ah attacks, he grins.)

1952
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:21,112
He grinned.

1953
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:24,081
(Training level 1)

1954
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,282
(Training level 2)

1955
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:28,412
Yes.

1956
01:07:29,052 --> 01:07:30,081
(Shuffling)

1957
01:07:30,082 --> 01:07:31,251
Yes. One more time.

1958
01:07:31,252 --> 01:07:32,751
(He begins to use footwork.)

1959
01:07:32,752 --> 01:07:35,021
(After securing the attack position, he throws the one-two punch.)

1960
01:07:35,022 --> 01:07:36,022
Yes. One more time.

1961
01:07:36,023 --> 01:07:37,362
(A series of attacks in no time)

1962
01:07:38,662 --> 01:07:42,631
(In Ah showed her side due to his continuous attacks.)

1963
01:07:42,632 --> 01:07:43,762
More.

1964
01:07:44,362 --> 01:07:45,362
(She strikes a pose again.)
That's right.

1965
01:07:47,872 --> 01:07:48,872
That's right.

1966
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:50,971
- To the side. - Yes.

1967
01:07:50,972 --> 01:07:51,972
She's...

1968
01:07:53,942 --> 01:07:56,211
(After the cross punch she threw while getting hit...)

1969
01:07:56,212 --> 01:07:57,212
(Body)
(Hook)

1970
01:07:58,213 --> 01:07:59,342
Yes. Good job.

1971
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:00,811
- Yes. - Good job.

1972
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:02,212
(Returning as much as she received)

1973
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,021
She's using everything she practiced.

1974
01:08:05,022 --> 01:08:06,051
(Sung Min throws a counter instead of getting hit.)

1975
01:08:06,052 --> 01:08:07,292
Nice right punch.

1976
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,572
She's using everything she practiced.

1977
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,522
(Feeling dizzy)

1978
01:08:11,762 --> 01:08:12,922
Breathe.

1979
01:08:13,162 --> 01:08:14,931
(Remaining time)

1980
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:16,461
- Ten seconds. - More.

1981
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:18,461
- Punch. - Endure it.

1982
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:19,531
(She chases him to the end.)

1983
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:21,432
Yes. Good job. Keep your eyes on him.

1984
01:08:23,002 --> 01:08:24,571
(She loses balance due to fatigue.)

1985
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:25,671
- Good. - Yes.

1986
01:08:25,672 --> 01:08:27,272
It's okay. Watch him again.

1987
01:08:27,342 --> 01:08:30,112
Yes. Good job. Low and high.

1988
01:08:30,282 --> 01:08:31,282
Stop.

1989
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,982
(Round 1 ends.)

1990
01:08:36,482 --> 01:08:38,082
- I can't breathe. - Catch your breath.

1991
01:08:38,752 --> 01:08:42,222
(The mouthpiece makes her run out of breath even more.)

1992
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,161
In Ah's good.

1993
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,562
Sung Min didn't show it,

1994
01:08:45,662 --> 01:08:47,561
but he felt she was different.

1995
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:50,132
- Weren't you taken aback? - She's the strongest, right?

1996
01:08:50,162 --> 01:08:51,431
(Yes.)

1997
01:08:51,432 --> 01:08:54,802
Nice. Good job. Keep it up, okay?

1998
01:08:55,902 --> 01:08:57,742
- I can't reach him. - Right.

1999
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:01,242
(Round 2 begins.)

2000
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:03,912
Nice one.

2001
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:05,612
(A tight game from the start)

2002
01:09:05,882 --> 01:09:07,181
(Sizing each other up)

2003
01:09:07,182 --> 01:09:08,582
(A fake low)

2004
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:12,151
(Low)

2005
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:13,521
(Low, high)

2006
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:14,592
That's it.

2007
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:17,362
(High, low)

2008
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:22,462
(Trying high and then low this time)

2009
01:09:23,432 --> 01:09:24,462
(Punching)

2010
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:27,301
Attack Sung Min when he attacks you.

2011
01:09:27,302 --> 01:09:28,502
(An uppercut)

2012
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,442
(Simba Seol is in hunting mode.)

2013
01:09:33,642 --> 01:09:34,642
Yes.

2014
01:09:34,643 --> 01:09:36,612
(Attacking and dodging with all her might)

2015
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,911
(One, two, )

2016
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:41,782
(dodge, and hit)

2017
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:46,582
(In Ah uses everything she's learned.)

2018
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:48,921
- Hang in there. Yes. That's it. - Good.

2019
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:50,421
(A body shot)

2020
01:09:50,422 --> 01:09:51,892
(A left hook)

2021
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,032
(Shifting her weight with a back step)

2022
01:09:54,262 --> 01:09:58,632
(A straight punch with a hip turn right away)

2023
01:09:58,802 --> 01:10:01,631
I'm not tearing up. You're doing great.

2024
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,631
Yes.

2025
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:06,442
(In Ah keeps going until the end.)

2026
01:10:07,272 --> 01:10:09,141
(Training level 2)

2027
01:10:09,142 --> 01:10:11,642
(Training level 3)

2028
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,388
(Because she is tired, In Ah keeps her eyes on the ground.)

2029
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:15,412
(A body shot in that opening)

2030
01:10:15,413 --> 01:10:16,711
(A left hook)

2031
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,022
(In Ah gets hit by a left hook-two-one.)

2032
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:22,592
- Keep going. - She's getting beaten up.

2033
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:25,121
(A split-second accurate hit)

2034
01:10:25,122 --> 01:10:27,021
It's okay.

2035
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,568
(In Ah is experiencing punches from a veteran.)

2036
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:31,102
Since she's good, Sung Min is going hard on her.

2037
01:10:31,132 --> 01:10:33,001
Do everything you can before it ends.

2038
01:10:33,002 --> 01:10:34,031
Go.

2039
01:10:34,032 --> 01:10:36,701
(Sung Min punches relentlessly.)

2040
01:10:36,702 --> 01:10:38,301
- Keep going. - Ten seconds.

2041
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:40,772
It's almost over. Keep going, In Ah.

2042
01:10:40,842 --> 01:10:42,342
(Seconds before losing focus)

2043
01:10:42,442 --> 01:10:43,472
The last punch.

2044
01:10:44,012 --> 01:10:45,281
(After landing one punch, )

2045
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,312
(In Ah is hit twice.)

2046
01:10:46,812 --> 01:10:48,152
(Hook, hook, body)

2047
01:10:48,552 --> 01:10:49,682
(Screaming)

2048
01:10:50,682 --> 01:10:51,981
(Amazed)

2049
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:53,721
- Ten seconds. - In Ah.

2050
01:10:53,722 --> 01:10:55,521
You're almost done, In Ah.

2051
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,682
(In Ah endured it until the end with fighting spirit.)

2052
01:10:58,362 --> 01:10:59,691
Good.

2053
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:01,092
(Round 2 ends.)

2054
01:11:01,392 --> 01:11:02,492
Great job.

2055
01:11:03,432 --> 01:11:04,732
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2056
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,102
You're truly different.

2057
01:11:07,932 --> 01:11:10,031
(In Ah has gone all out.)

2058
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,942
All right. What was it like, In Ah?

2059
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:14,172
I've witnessed my madness.

2060
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:17,582
You came to your senses when you got angry because he kept hitting you.

2061
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:19,282
That was why you went crazy.

2062
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:22,181
It happened throughout the match.

2063
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:23,821
- I saw chaos. - Honestly, I don't remember much.

2064
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:25,482
- Your match was entertaining. - In Ah...

2065
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:28,521
Sung Min didn't expect us to be that good.

2066
01:11:28,522 --> 01:11:29,851
But when fighting you,

2067
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,891
- Yes. - he bumped up the intensity.

2068
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:33,622
- He punched me loads. - No, he...

2069
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:35,491
- You stepped up the level. - I did.

2070
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,808
- He's good. - Why did you do that?

2071
01:11:36,832 --> 01:11:38,731
She was good.

2072
01:11:38,732 --> 01:11:40,162
I didn't want to lose.

2073
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:42,732
So as not to lose? You did it so as not to lose.

2074
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:46,101
In Ah has a great form.

2075
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:49,341
And she can hit both when we're apart and close to each other.

2076
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:50,712
Everything she did was good.

2077
01:11:50,812 --> 01:11:53,541
Can you tell us what In Ah can...

2078
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,688
- improve on? - I've got tons.

2079
01:11:54,712 --> 01:11:57,181
In the beginning, her guard...

2080
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,621
- Was it bad? - should've been up here,

2081
01:11:58,622 --> 01:12:00,421
but it was actually down here.

2082
01:12:00,422 --> 01:12:01,652
(Her guard was down.)

2083
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:05,662
(Her guard was down from the start.)

2084
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:09,332
(That allowed the opponent to punch her jaw.)

2085
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:12,802
If you take a hit there, you'll probably fall.

2086
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:15,531
(Realizing the importance of the guard again)

2087
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:16,772
- I'll drop down? - Right away.

2088
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,172
But still, In Ah launched a series of blows.

2089
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:21,811
You calmly used your footwork...

2090
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:23,071
- to practice your skills. - Yes.

2091
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,472
You did very well in the beginning.

2092
01:12:24,782 --> 01:12:26,711
(In Ah's 1st sparring session results:)

2093
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:30,311
(Strengths: She maintained distance by using footwork.)

2094
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:34,892
(She showed good follow-up attempts with the combinations.)

2095
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:37,622
But you kept your head too high.

2096
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:41,791
(Weakness: She lowered her guard and lifted her head while striking.)

2097
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,161
(There was a risk of exposing vital parts.)

2098
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:46,601
It's better to keep your head down.

2099
01:12:46,602 --> 01:12:47,602
Got it.

2100
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:49,971
(After the sparring sessions are over)

2101
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:52,042
Great work today.

2102
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:53,672
- Thank you. - You were amazing.

2103
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,512
If we hadn't had the sparring sessions today,

2104
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,881
we would've been more flustered. But we have enough time.

2105
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:01,312
Today was, in a way,

2106
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:03,811
your first-ever fight inside the ring.

2107
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,351
Little did I expect it to be this intense.

2108
01:13:05,352 --> 01:13:06,782
You did great.

2109
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,591
Nobody gave up and threw punches with fighting spirit.

2110
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:10,621
It got me excited.

2111
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:13,961
In a month and a half, they will be taking part...

2112
01:13:13,962 --> 01:13:15,162
in a boxing competition.

2113
01:13:16,462 --> 01:13:19,001
Did you ever compete in a community sports competition?

2114
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:20,631
- I did once in the past. - Right?

2115
01:13:20,632 --> 01:13:21,871
- You know how it is, right? - Yes.

2116
01:13:21,872 --> 01:13:24,671
Have you seen the women's open division...

2117
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:26,071
- boxing match? - Yes.

2118
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:28,192
Do you think they can be ready in a month and a half?

2119
01:13:28,442 --> 01:13:31,382
(Secretly hopeful)

2120
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:36,252
With a bit more effort,

2121
01:13:36,282 --> 01:13:38,822
- We must put in a bit more effort. - they could be on par.

2122
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:40,522
This is bad. What should we do?

2123
01:13:40,692 --> 01:13:44,291
We've watched all of your sparring sessions.

2124
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,562
I'm sure you felt it yourself.

2125
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:48,561
To put it bluntly,

2126
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:51,232
none of you successfully completed the second round.

2127
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:53,301
- That's true. - You're right.

2128
01:13:53,302 --> 01:13:56,602
At this rate, you won't make it to the community sports competition.

2129
01:13:57,372 --> 01:13:58,702
This is me being honest.

2130
01:13:59,402 --> 01:14:01,371
I know you've worked hard.

2131
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:03,218
(The first sparring session is full of regrets.)

2132
01:14:03,242 --> 01:14:05,912
What did you feel after our sparring today?

2133
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,512
- We should definitely step up... - Yes?

2134
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:09,951
- our stamina training. - Stamina training?

2135
01:14:09,952 --> 01:14:12,222
- Stamina. - We need stamina to throw...

2136
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:14,091
another punch...

2137
01:14:14,092 --> 01:14:16,292
- or make a quick footstep. - That's a valuable lesson.

2138
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:19,162
To bring your stamina up, you need to do that exercise.

2139
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:20,561
(What exercise?)

2140
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:23,591
In order to build your stamina,

2141
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,832
we're taking part in a trail run race.

2142
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:26,901
(A trail run?)

2143
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:30,431
All athletes of the Korea National Training Center climb Mount Buram.

2144
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:31,901
The boxing team always comes in first place.

2145
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:34,712
If you can, it's best to hike whenever you can.

2146
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:37,241
(To improve their stamina, )

2147
01:14:37,242 --> 01:14:41,552
(the Iron Girls head to the mountains?)

2148
01:14:41,952 --> 01:14:44,081
(Muddy terrains)

2149
01:14:44,082 --> 01:14:45,522
(What is this? A public bath?)

2150
01:14:45,622 --> 01:14:48,692
(Uphill paths)

2151
01:14:49,092 --> 01:14:51,092
(Downhill paths)

2152
01:14:51,562 --> 01:14:53,261
(The real...)

2153
01:14:53,262 --> 01:14:55,591
(stamina training...)

2154
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:57,832
(pushing limits)

2155
01:14:58,132 --> 01:15:00,502
(A brutal trail run to build their stamina)

2156
01:15:01,202 --> 01:15:05,872
(Can the Iron Girls complete the course?)

2157
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:07,411
Let's go.

2158
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:10,271
I have no idea what kind of day awaits us,

2159
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:11,512
but let's go.

2160
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:14,012
- Gosh. - What? This is nice.

2161
01:15:14,112 --> 01:15:16,311
I feel like we need to do a photoshoot.

2162
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,652
Let's walk in a straight line with style.

2163
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,122
- Go. - Go.

2164
01:15:20,322 --> 01:15:22,752
(Entering the green runway)

2165
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:25,092
(Walking with light steps)

2166
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:29,432
(A picture-perfect place where your footsteps feel light)

2167
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:34,531
(A garden full of greenery, )

2168
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:37,132
(a clear blue sea brimming with freshness, )

2169
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:45,082
(and a natural training ground sure to be soaked in pure sweat)

2170
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,982
(Jeju Island)

2171
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:52,882
(They're on Jeju Island to participate in the race.)

2172
01:15:53,182 --> 01:15:54,992
(A sudden change of song)

2173
01:15:56,422 --> 01:15:57,492
(Boxing)

2174
01:15:57,862 --> 01:15:59,892
(The legendary boxers navigating the forest)

2175
01:15:59,962 --> 01:16:01,232
Hi.

2176
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:02,791
This path is beautiful.

2177
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,301
Seeing you again here on Jeju Island feels great.

2178
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,801
- I'm so glad to see you. - Hey.

2179
01:16:07,802 --> 01:16:09,901
Had I known we were filming inside a forest,

2180
01:16:09,902 --> 01:16:11,572
I wouldn't have worn brown.

2181
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:13,302
- Same here. - What?

2182
01:16:13,303 --> 01:16:15,042
(A tree, a leaf)

2183
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,541
What are we doing here today?

2184
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:18,888
Someone is here to tell you what you'll be doing here today.

2185
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:19,982
- Who will? - Who?

2186
01:16:20,682 --> 01:16:21,682
Captain Kim?

2187
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:23,851
We didn't even look for Captain Kim.

2188
01:16:23,852 --> 01:16:25,882
- He scared me. - Hold on. I saw who it is.

2189
01:16:26,152 --> 01:16:28,752
I didn't want to see him all the way out here.

2190
01:16:29,222 --> 01:16:31,421
- Hi, Coach. - Hi.

2191
01:16:31,422 --> 01:16:33,391
- You followed us? - You came all the way...

2192
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:34,561
to Jeju Island?

2193
01:16:34,562 --> 01:16:36,191
- In the scenic Jeju Island, - Yes?

2194
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,752
We'll be doing a very special training.

2195
01:16:37,902 --> 01:16:40,161
- What training? - What kind of training?

2196
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,501
Today's special training will strengthen...

2197
01:16:42,502 --> 01:16:45,872
your core and upper body muscles.

2198
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:48,611
- In Ah's favorite Mayweather... - Boxing?

2199
01:16:48,612 --> 01:16:50,341
- did this workout. - Mayweather.

2200
01:16:50,342 --> 01:16:53,542
So did my favorite Mike Tyson.

2201
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,182
- Really? - For real?

2202
01:16:55,382 --> 01:16:56,981
- What could it be? - What is it?

2203
01:16:56,982 --> 01:16:58,222
We won't be running.

2204
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,052
Shall we head to the place first?

2205
01:17:00,252 --> 01:17:01,852
- We have to walk more? - It's not here?

2206
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:04,162
You'll see once you get there. Let's go. Follow me.

2207
01:17:04,592 --> 01:17:06,192
Do you guys feel okay?

2208
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,831
Being on Jeju Island makes me happy, right?

2209
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:08,832
- Yes. - Right?

2210
01:17:10,662 --> 01:17:11,762
What?

2211
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,362
Are we doing yoga?

2212
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,332
- Over there. - What are those?

2213
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:16,831
What is this?

2214
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,071
- What? What is that? - Come.

2215
01:17:18,072 --> 01:17:19,371
- For real? - What's going on?

2216
01:17:19,372 --> 01:17:20,942
(What are those?)

2217
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:23,971
I don't want to go inside, Uie.

2218
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,372
(The jaw-dropping special training)

2219
01:17:26,382 --> 01:17:29,252
(A chilling ax welcomes the Iron Girls.)

2220
01:17:31,422 --> 01:17:33,852
(Stacked tightly without any gaps)

2221
01:17:34,652 --> 01:17:37,592
(80 logs)

2222
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:39,762
As you can tell, today's exercise...

2223
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:43,162
will strengthen the upper body, core,

2224
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,201
and body coordination.

2225
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,302
It's chopping firewood.

2226
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:50,372
In Ah looks like she's been chopping up until now.

2227
01:17:51,242 --> 01:17:52,471
Are you sure you didn't chop these?

2228
01:17:52,472 --> 01:17:54,542
All the chopping I did turned me into this color.

2229
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:57,811
Did Mayweather and Tyson really train by chopping firewood?

2230
01:17:57,812 --> 01:17:59,081
Yes. World-famous boxers,

2231
01:17:59,082 --> 01:18:01,711
including Mayweather and Tyson, have undergone this training.

2232
01:18:01,712 --> 01:18:03,282
(Mayweather)

2233
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:06,922
(Chopping firewood is an essential training for world-famous boxers.)

2234
01:18:07,422 --> 01:18:09,451
(Using tires instead of firewood, )

2235
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:13,162
(it's an upper body workout that's even done at gyms.)

2236
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:18,102
- To lift up the heavy ax, we use... - Yes?

2237
01:18:18,362 --> 01:18:20,901
- our forearm muscles, shoulders, - Yes.

2238
01:18:20,902 --> 01:18:23,432
And core to support it.

2239
01:18:23,972 --> 01:18:26,901
To hit the target, we focus.

2240
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:29,712
And the moment we bring the ax down, we apply force...

2241
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:30,942
to chop the firewood.

2242
01:18:31,242 --> 01:18:32,342
In short, impact.

2243
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:34,012
- "Impact." - Yes.

2244
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:37,252
You'll be using all three skills.

2245
01:18:37,722 --> 01:18:40,222
You will all chop firewood at the same time.

2246
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:43,322
If a piece of wood comes flying in your direction,

2247
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,892
dodge and hit.

2248
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:46,792
- Really? - "Dodge and punch?"

2249
01:18:46,793 --> 01:18:47,861
Dodge it.

2250
01:18:47,862 --> 01:18:49,262
- Really? - Unbelievable.

2251
01:18:49,362 --> 01:18:50,462
That's going too far.

2252
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:51,831
- I love the fresh air. - Here's a demonstration.

2253
01:18:51,832 --> 01:18:52,838
- "A demonstration?" - Yes.

2254
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:56,302
Stand with your feet parallel to each other.

2255
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,842
Bend your knees slightly.

2256
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:01,041
Holding the ax with your hands close together makes it feel heavier.

2257
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:03,018
To distribute your strength evenly, keep your hands far apart.

2258
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,682
When you bring the ax down, slide your upper hand down.

2259
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,952
The centrifugal force will cause it to split.

2260
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,882
Just bring it down straight. Chop.

2261
01:19:11,522 --> 01:19:13,282
Just bring it down straight. Chop.

2262
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:15,921
(In 1 powerful swing, the firewood splits into 2.)

2263
01:19:15,922 --> 01:19:16,952
Like so.

2264
01:19:17,722 --> 01:19:19,022
Split it into fours.

2265
01:19:19,962 --> 01:19:21,492
Do we have to do all 80 by today?

2266
01:19:21,662 --> 01:19:22,761
Yes. You can do it.

2267
01:19:22,762 --> 01:19:24,632
This training is quite novel.

2268
01:19:24,702 --> 01:19:26,101
Let's try and chop them.

2269
01:19:26,102 --> 01:19:28,502
All right. Safety is the top priority.

2270
01:19:29,002 --> 01:19:30,501
(Wearing hand protection, )

2271
01:19:30,502 --> 01:19:32,242
(along with somehow stylish goggles.)

2272
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,672
(Bulletproof defense)

2273
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:36,612
(Wink)

2274
01:19:36,812 --> 01:19:38,512
(They're ready.)

2275
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:40,952
- Do we actually look cool? - Are we cool?

2276
01:19:41,682 --> 01:19:43,282
- Now then. - I'll go first.

2277
01:19:43,682 --> 01:19:44,682
Okay.

2278
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,422
Get into position, Ju Hyun.

2279
01:19:46,522 --> 01:19:48,021
- The ax is incredibly heavy. - Right?

2280
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,191
- It's heavy. - It is indeed heavy.

2281
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:51,092
(With her forearm muscles, she lifts...)

2282
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:55,461
(the heavy ax up.)

2283
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:56,491
- Go down. - Chop.

2284
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:58,602
That's it. Well done.

2285
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:00,861
(Nice one.)

2286
01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,102
Get the hang of it, and everyone can pick it up quickly.

2287
01:20:03,272 --> 01:20:06,072
(One more time, just like earlier.)

2288
01:20:06,442 --> 01:20:08,571
(Lifting with her forearm muscles...)

2289
01:20:08,572 --> 01:20:10,612
(and chopping with her deltoid muscles)

2290
01:20:11,342 --> 01:20:12,411
That's it.

2291
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:13,711
(A round of applause)

2292
01:20:13,712 --> 01:20:15,311
- Good job. - Nice, Park Ju.

2293
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:16,982
- Park Ju Hyun! - Yes!

2294
01:20:17,182 --> 01:20:18,221
- Park Ju! - Well done.

2295
01:20:18,222 --> 01:20:19,981
- You're good. - You did well, Park Ju.

2296
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,522
- Like this. - Yes, like that.

2297
01:20:22,052 --> 01:20:23,921
- Lift it up. - "Lift it up."

2298
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:25,661
- Lift it. - My shoulders hurt.

2299
01:20:25,662 --> 01:20:27,421
Come down and chop.

2300
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,062
- Hold on. - But don't keep it down here.

2301
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,132
Maybe In Ah will split it in one go.

2302
01:20:31,432 --> 01:20:32,601
Be careful, In Ah.

2303
01:20:32,602 --> 01:20:34,402
(Will Strong In Ah succeed in one swing?)

2304
01:20:35,172 --> 01:20:36,531
- Chop. - Yes. Good job.

2305
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:37,812
- I couldn't do it. - Well done.

2306
01:20:38,142 --> 01:20:39,142
Again.

2307
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:40,802
(Another try, nervous)

2308
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:44,742
Chop. Again. It's okay.

2309
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,042
Chop. That's it.

2310
01:20:47,412 --> 01:20:48,582
Chop. Yes.

2311
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:50,052
Chop. Nice.

2312
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,022
- Good. - I can't do it.

2313
01:20:52,482 --> 01:20:54,368
- You're really good at it, Ju Hyun. - It's harder than it looks.

2314
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:55,921
Don't try to hit it hard.

2315
01:20:55,922 --> 01:20:57,621
Use the ax's weight to cut.

2316
01:20:57,622 --> 01:20:58,791
Put it on the floor.

2317
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:00,091
Can I get it done today?

2318
01:21:00,092 --> 01:21:01,261
- You can. - Yes.

2319
01:21:01,262 --> 01:21:02,738
- You can do everything. - Trust yourself.

2320
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:04,291
You can do anything, In Ah.

2321
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,161
- Trust yourself. - Good.

2322
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,971
- Up. - Chop. That's it.

2323
01:21:07,972 --> 01:21:09,478
(With Lucky Rocy's support, she finally split it in half.)

2324
01:21:09,502 --> 01:21:11,471
- Sae Rocky, it's not easy. - Nice, but I'll fail.

2325
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,242
- This is a pass. - I'll fail.

2326
01:21:13,372 --> 01:21:15,742
- I don't think I can do it. - No, you can.

2327
01:21:16,612 --> 01:21:18,681
(Uie is the 3rd to try for the firewood chopping.)

2328
01:21:18,682 --> 01:21:20,382
- Here. - Let's go.

2329
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,451
(Read the room, Firewood.)

2330
01:21:22,452 --> 01:21:23,581
Did you just threaten it?

2331
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:24,582
(Reliable)

2332
01:21:25,122 --> 01:21:27,722
(Her forearms are too thin to lift the 4kg ax.)

2333
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:29,422
Lift.

2334
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:30,722
(Will Uie succeed?)

2335
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:31,861
- Yes. - Uie.

2336
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:33,421
Your whole body wobbles when you lift the ax up.

2337
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:34,502
- Exactly. - Is this right?

2338
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:35,632
Lift.

2339
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:37,132
(Wobbling)

2340
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:40,302
Just now, you put some strength into your arms.

2341
01:21:40,832 --> 01:21:43,172
Don't do that. Use the ax's weight.

2342
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:44,541
Use your body when you bring it down.

2343
01:21:44,542 --> 01:21:46,242
Swing your upper body down.

2344
01:21:47,172 --> 01:21:48,641
(Trying again while paying attention to her waist's motion)

2345
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:49,642
Chop. Yes.

2346
01:21:50,642 --> 01:21:51,712
Chop. Yes.

2347
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:53,542
Nice. You're doing well.

2348
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:55,852
That's it.

2349
01:21:57,252 --> 01:21:58,282
Like that.

2350
01:21:58,422 --> 01:21:59,521
- Good. - That was great.

2351
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:00,842
- She's very accurate, no? - Yes.

2352
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,822
- Uie's swing is spot on. - Right?

2353
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:04,221
She's a sniper.

2354
01:22:04,222 --> 01:22:06,691
- She hit the exact same spot. - Right?

2355
01:22:06,692 --> 01:22:07,762
(As accurate as a sniper)

2356
01:22:08,892 --> 01:22:10,231
(I'll chop you up for sure this time.)

2357
01:22:10,232 --> 01:22:11,232
(Screaming)

2358
01:22:12,862 --> 01:22:14,261
She hit the same spot again.

2359
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,602
That was a clean cut.

2360
01:22:16,302 --> 01:22:17,531
Yes. Okay.

2361
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,741
(She successfully hit the same spot.)

2362
01:22:18,742 --> 01:22:20,842
- Well done. - You're really accurate, Uie.

2363
01:22:21,372 --> 01:22:23,512
We're taking ages to chop one firewood.

2364
01:22:23,742 --> 01:22:25,041
- But 80? - But 80?

2365
01:22:25,042 --> 01:22:26,211
(We can get 80 done, right?)

2366
01:22:26,212 --> 01:22:27,511
Done. You're turn, Sae Rok.

2367
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:29,581
- I'm sweating. - Doesn't it make you sweat a lot?

2368
01:22:29,582 --> 01:22:30,682
But that was my first try.

2369
01:22:31,282 --> 01:22:33,322
Go ahead, Sae Rok.

2370
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,851
Be careful. You should watch out.

2371
01:22:35,852 --> 01:22:36,852
Be careful, Sae Rok.

2372
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:38,391
I don't know how to do it.

2373
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:39,392
I don't trust myself.
(Far away)

2374
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:41,832
Slowly. Bring it down.

2375
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:43,262
That's it.

2376
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:45,562
That's it.

2377
01:22:46,902 --> 01:22:48,801
(She split it in one go.)

2378
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:50,602
Great job.

2379
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,171
- Doesn't it feel great? - Well done.

2380
01:22:52,172 --> 01:22:53,542
- Just like that. - I'm good.

2381
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,272
She's happy.

2382
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:56,472
Again.

2383
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,011
(Again to feel that same thrill)

2384
01:22:58,012 --> 01:22:59,042
Let's go.

2385
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:03,781
(Lifting it with her forearm muscles)

2386
01:23:03,782 --> 01:23:05,652
(Swinging down with her deltoid muscles)

2387
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:08,652
- That's it. Okay. - Nice one.

2388
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:10,322
Sae Rok is incredible.

2389
01:23:11,822 --> 01:23:14,262
(Wiggling)

2390
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:16,992
Something looks a little funny.

2391
01:23:17,662 --> 01:23:21,061
(Her posture is slightly off.)

2392
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,972
No. Sae Rok is using her lower body.

2393
01:23:24,172 --> 01:23:26,042
(Gathering her lower body strength)

2394
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,911
- Oh, dear. Well done. - Goodness.

2395
01:23:28,912 --> 01:23:30,911
(What? I'm actually good at it.)

2396
01:23:30,912 --> 01:23:32,711
Sae Rok is super cool.

2397
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:34,152
(A fairy's face, a woodsman's skill)

2398
01:23:34,312 --> 01:23:36,512
(Sae Rok rides the momentum.)

2399
01:23:36,852 --> 01:23:38,681
- Yes. - You're so cool, Keum Sae Rok.

2400
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:40,282
- Nice, Rocky. - That's it.

2401
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:41,991
Nice.

2402
01:23:41,992 --> 01:23:43,792
Just like that. Unbelievable.

2403
01:23:44,492 --> 01:23:46,191
(I'm the more excited one.)

2404
01:23:46,192 --> 01:23:48,292
How pretty. Do you see the grain of the wood?

2405
01:23:48,662 --> 01:23:50,592
- Gosh. I love it. - It's so pretty.

2406
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,831
- It's actually beautiful. - Really, it's pretty.

2407
01:23:52,832 --> 01:23:53,832
Let's do this.

2408
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,008
(Another fairy woodsman is fired up.)

2409
01:23:55,032 --> 01:23:56,101
(Getting into position)

2410
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:57,331
Go. Try it.

2411
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,742
(Lifting it effortlessly)

2412
01:23:58,972 --> 01:24:00,171
- Okay. - Yes.

2413
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:01,471
(One shot, one kill)

2414
01:24:01,472 --> 01:24:02,472
Yes.

2415
01:24:03,212 --> 01:24:04,241
- Okay. - Well done.

2416
01:24:04,242 --> 01:24:05,282
Okay.

2417
01:24:05,512 --> 01:24:07,041
(Let me handle what comes after.)

2418
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,581
- Next. - Okay.

2419
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:09,882
- Give me a second. - Next.

2420
01:24:10,152 --> 01:24:11,851
I must protect my player. Warm up your arms.

2421
01:24:11,852 --> 01:24:13,582
Hold on. Wait, okay?

2422
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:15,751
- Get ready. - I've found my calling.

2423
01:24:15,752 --> 01:24:17,322
(I'll crush you.)

2424
01:24:18,022 --> 01:24:19,561
(She might appear to do it effortlessly.)

2425
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:20,762
Okay.

2426
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:22,331
My forearm muscles.

2427
01:24:22,332 --> 01:24:23,792
(Working the upper body muscles)

2428
01:24:24,062 --> 01:24:25,062
- Yes. - Nice.

2429
01:24:25,402 --> 01:24:26,931
- The next one. - This feels so refreshing.

2430
01:24:26,932 --> 01:24:27,932
The next one.

2431
01:24:29,002 --> 01:24:30,132
- Okay. - That's it.

2432
01:24:30,472 --> 01:24:31,941
(Her heart skipped a beat.)

2433
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,341
A testosterone queen.

2434
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:35,871
(She's the Iron Girls' testosterone queen.)

2435
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:37,611
We can finish 80 by today, right?

2436
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:39,242
(But they have a mountain of logs left.)

2437
01:24:39,642 --> 01:24:40,981
I haven't gotten the hang of it yet.

2438
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:41,982
That's okay.

2439
01:24:42,412 --> 01:24:44,182
Use your whole weight. Look.

2440
01:24:44,382 --> 01:24:46,352
Don't just let your body weight flow.

2441
01:24:46,452 --> 01:24:48,392
When you swing down, make sure to drive it down.

2442
01:24:48,752 --> 01:24:50,152
- Something like that. - Okay.

2443
01:24:51,492 --> 01:24:53,091
(Tightening her forearm muscles)

2444
01:24:53,092 --> 01:24:54,221
Let it flow first.

2445
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,561
(Lifting up with the flow)

2446
01:24:56,562 --> 01:24:57,632
Sting like a bee.

2447
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:59,132
That's it.

2448
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:01,601
(One shot, one kill)

2449
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:02,631
- Okay. - Good job.

2450
01:25:02,632 --> 01:25:03,671
That's it.

2451
01:25:03,672 --> 01:25:05,642
- I finally get it. - Here.

2452
01:25:05,972 --> 01:25:07,472
Float like a butterfly,

2453
01:25:08,112 --> 01:25:10,142
- sting like a bee. - With your glutes. That's it.

2454
01:25:10,312 --> 01:25:12,011
- You get it now, right, Uie? - Yes.

2455
01:25:12,012 --> 01:25:13,111
Keep that going.

2456
01:25:13,112 --> 01:25:16,382
I love my instructor. Her quick tips are on point.

2457
01:25:16,652 --> 01:25:19,322
You and the ax are one.

2458
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:22,752
My body and the ax become one.

2459
01:25:23,692 --> 01:25:26,022
- That's it. Just like that. - Goodness.

2460
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:27,321
She's amazing.

2461
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,842
(Motivated by Uie, In Ah tries again.)

2462
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,632
- Yes. - You did it.

2463
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:34,461
(She hit the edge. She has a strong impact but poor accuracy.)

2464
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:36,148
- You're good. - I didn't hit the center, did I?

2465
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:37,432
No, but don't worry about it.

2466
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:38,701
In Ah.

2467
01:25:38,702 --> 01:25:41,171
From here, swing down and squat a little.

2468
01:25:41,172 --> 01:25:43,512
Think of it like doing a squat.

2469
01:25:44,242 --> 01:25:46,112
(Think of it like doing a squat.)

2470
01:25:51,882 --> 01:25:53,382
That's it.

2471
01:25:53,752 --> 01:25:55,991
- I did it! - That's it. Nice job.

2472
01:25:55,992 --> 01:25:57,592
Sae Rok gave me a great tip.

2473
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,622
(Swinging again after getting the feel)

2474
01:26:04,932 --> 01:26:06,201
(Exploding with wildness)

2475
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:08,172
How sexy of you, In Ah.

2476
01:26:08,802 --> 01:26:10,402
In Ah. You're looking beautiful.

2477
01:26:11,502 --> 01:26:13,071
(Creating gorgeous forearm muscles)

2478
01:26:13,072 --> 01:26:14,142
She's good.

2479
01:26:14,442 --> 01:26:16,212
(A masterpiece)

2480
01:26:17,512 --> 01:26:18,718
(Masterpiece created 1 more time)

2481
01:26:18,742 --> 01:26:20,102
(Masterpiece created 2 more times)

2482
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:22,952
Sae Rok. Let's create a masterpiece.

2483
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:25,321
I'm in. But they sure look beautiful.

2484
01:26:25,322 --> 01:26:26,781
Right? It's looking pretty.

2485
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:28,122
Are they here for the gemstones?

2486
01:26:28,622 --> 01:26:30,692
Didn't our log split into beautiful pieces?

2487
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:33,162
It's gorgeous, In Ah.

2488
01:26:33,492 --> 01:26:35,232
- She's hilarious. - I'm serious.

2489
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:38,401
(Here's Sae Rok. And here's In Ah.)

2490
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:39,432
Yes.

2491
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,431
(The Seol-Rok Duo destroys the logs.)

2492
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,531
- I should wear this, right? - Yes, let's do that.

2493
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,602
It's cool.

2494
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:48,512
Wearing it makes you sexy, like aespa.

2495
01:26:48,642 --> 01:26:50,612
We're just ae-pitiful.

2496
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:52,681
You be CARRYNA.

2497
01:26:52,682 --> 01:26:54,441
(CARRYNA, carrying with stamina)

2498
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:55,951
I'll be WINTEL.

2499
01:26:55,952 --> 01:26:57,381
(WINTEL, the laid-back testosterone queen)

2500
01:26:57,382 --> 01:26:58,481
She's CHISELLE.

2501
01:26:58,482 --> 01:26:59,651
(CHISELLE, guaranteed to hit)

2502
01:26:59,652 --> 01:27:01,221
- What will you be? - KNOCKKNOCK.

2503
01:27:01,222 --> 01:27:02,582
(KNOCKKNOCK, knocking with energy)

2504
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:09,492
That's it. Yes.

2505
01:27:09,862 --> 01:27:12,002
- We've got it. - Good job.

2506
01:27:13,402 --> 01:27:14,662
We still have a lot left.

2507
01:27:15,072 --> 01:27:16,831
(ae-pitiful is only halfway through.)

2508
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:17,832
Focus.

2509
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,572
If you lose your concentration, you lose your accuracy.

2510
01:27:20,972 --> 01:27:22,111
This is round two.

2511
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,171
It's a battle of stamina and mental strength.

2512
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:25,212
Clean them up.

2513
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:27,242
- It's heavy. - Be careful.

2514
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:29,512
(No impact)

2515
01:27:29,752 --> 01:27:30,851
You've lost strength.

2516
01:27:30,852 --> 01:27:32,282
- Are you okay? - Focus.

2517
01:27:32,822 --> 01:27:35,151
(Compared to the beginning, )

2518
01:27:35,152 --> 01:27:36,622
(her chops show less impact.)

2519
01:27:37,292 --> 01:27:38,292
(Focusing again)

2520
01:27:38,293 --> 01:27:40,291
I can tell you're out of energy.

2521
01:27:40,292 --> 01:27:41,561
(Focusing and swinging down again)

2522
01:27:41,562 --> 01:27:42,562
That's it.

2523
01:27:42,563 --> 01:27:45,102
I've hit the same place three times, but...

2524
01:27:46,002 --> 01:27:48,031
To be intact when I've hit the same spot three times?

2525
01:27:48,032 --> 01:27:49,432
(Staggering)

2526
01:27:49,902 --> 01:27:51,331
(Likewise, Sae Rok, who started off strong, )

2527
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,971
- Sae Rok, we're in round two. - Got it.

2528
01:27:52,972 --> 01:27:54,042
(staggers.)

2529
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:55,441
She's worn out.

2530
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:57,942
(The 2 aces have no strength left.)

2531
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:00,482
As for me, I'm just getting started.

2532
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,682
- Athletes with great stamina... - Seriously.

2533
01:28:04,152 --> 01:28:05,312
Do better in the second half.

2534
01:28:05,582 --> 01:28:06,652
- Yes. - Goodness.

2535
01:28:07,052 --> 01:28:09,022
- One more. - Hurry.

2536
01:28:09,892 --> 01:28:11,191
(The next opponent)

2537
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:12,272
- Here you go. - Well done.

2538
01:28:15,992 --> 01:28:18,092
Good. One shot, one kill.

2539
01:28:18,302 --> 01:28:19,361
(The helper is busy. There is no time to breathe before each refill.)

2540
01:28:19,362 --> 01:28:20,501
You can do it, ma'am.

2541
01:28:20,502 --> 01:28:23,302
Look at Uie. She's still full of energy.

2542
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:25,172
- With force. - That's it.

2543
01:28:25,972 --> 01:28:27,572
Gosh, I'm in awe.

2544
01:28:28,872 --> 01:28:31,271
(Her trembling arms...)

2545
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,812
(are now firmly steady.)

2546
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:34,081
You've got it.

2547
01:28:34,082 --> 01:28:35,842
This is wild. Look at how much she improved.

2548
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,721
- Oh, gosh. - Ma'am?

2549
01:28:38,722 --> 01:28:40,282
Gosh, I can't.

2550
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:41,792
Gosh.

2551
01:28:42,292 --> 01:28:44,022
- Will I get it by today? - Hold on, ma'am.

2552
01:28:44,222 --> 01:28:46,392
- I've lost all strength. - Will I get it by today?

2553
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:48,122
All set.

2554
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:50,338
(The helper is even more worn out than the woodchopper.)

2555
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:52,201
(But even after that...)

2556
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:53,202
Ma'am!

2557
01:28:55,232 --> 01:28:56,272
Ma'am!

2558
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:58,441
Can't you go slowly, ma'am?

2559
01:28:58,442 --> 01:29:00,472
All right. Got it.

2560
01:29:01,942 --> 01:29:02,972
Ma'am.

2561
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:07,412
(About to pass out)

2562
01:29:08,252 --> 01:29:10,912
- That's it. - Nice job, Kim Uie.

2563
01:29:12,752 --> 01:29:15,751
(Finishing strong)

2564
01:29:15,752 --> 01:29:18,762
Gosh, In Ah. Do you still have energy left?

2565
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:21,092
- Chopping them warmed my body up. - Right.

2566
01:29:22,092 --> 01:29:23,461
Let's finish them, In Ah.

2567
01:29:23,462 --> 01:29:24,792
- Okay. Let's do that. - Good.

2568
01:29:27,402 --> 01:29:28,431
That's it.

2569
01:29:28,432 --> 01:29:29,602
(Chopping...)

2570
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,372
(in harmony)

2571
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:33,072
(Chopping)

2572
01:29:33,402 --> 01:29:36,442
(Smashing the logs in rhythm)

2573
01:29:36,612 --> 01:29:38,582
- You've only got those left. - Yes.

2574
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,212
- You're almost done. - We're done.

2575
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:41,772
- Here. - Let's stay strong, guys.

2576
01:29:42,352 --> 01:29:43,782
Stay calm and finish them.

2577
01:29:44,352 --> 01:29:45,821
(Remaining logs: 3)

2578
01:29:45,822 --> 01:29:47,781
(Remaining logs: 2)

2579
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:48,921
(Remaining logs: 1)

2580
01:29:48,922 --> 01:29:50,192
- Done. - Done.

2581
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:51,292
Great work.

2582
01:29:52,322 --> 01:29:54,191
Here I go. This is the last one.

2583
01:29:54,192 --> 01:29:55,232
Go for it.

2584
01:29:56,432 --> 01:29:59,162
(A clean wrap-up)

2585
01:30:00,732 --> 01:30:03,072
(The training has ended.)

2586
01:30:03,132 --> 01:30:05,141
- Good. - I'm drained and can't do a thing.

2587
01:30:05,142 --> 01:30:06,541
- Well done. - Great job.

2588
01:30:06,542 --> 01:30:07,602
You did well.

2589
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:08,911
I love you. Good work.

2590
01:30:08,912 --> 01:30:10,842
- You were amazing. - Can you see my sweat?

2591
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:12,832
Can you see how much I've sweated?

2592
01:30:13,012 --> 01:30:14,241
- Ju Hyun is soaked. - Right?

2593
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,281
Ju Hyun did all the work in the beginning...

2594
01:30:16,282 --> 01:30:17,352
because I was bad at it.

2595
01:30:17,882 --> 01:30:19,421
The second half was more tiresome.

2596
01:30:19,422 --> 01:30:22,122
Matching the log's speed with Uie's was...

2597
01:30:22,222 --> 01:30:24,251
(Clearing the last firewood)

2598
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,561
You can really see our personalities.

2599
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,692
- All done? - I threw our firewood.

2600
01:30:29,032 --> 01:30:30,491
- Those are for sale. - For business.

2601
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:31,962
Right. Firewood for sale.

2602
01:30:32,232 --> 01:30:34,602
- Those are for us. - See the personality gap.

2603
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:36,332
I'm glad you and I were a team.

2604
01:30:36,572 --> 01:30:37,631
Had we switched...

2605
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,542
I would've been stressed out if I were told to tidy up like that.

2606
01:30:40,842 --> 01:30:42,612
How was the wood-chopping training?

2607
01:30:42,772 --> 01:30:44,812
- As you know, I warm up quite late. - Right.

2608
01:30:45,182 --> 01:30:48,111
Once I got the hang of it, I got faster.

2609
01:30:48,112 --> 01:30:50,411
Ever since then, you've been on a roll.

2610
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:53,252
I learn the ropes quickly at the beginning,

2611
01:30:53,422 --> 01:30:54,582
but I wear out easily.

2612
01:30:55,392 --> 01:30:57,552
No. Once I lost my posture,

2613
01:30:57,622 --> 01:30:59,691
I had to swing ten times to chop the log,

2614
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:02,191
whereas before I could do it in just one swing.

2615
01:31:02,192 --> 01:31:03,391
That was how it went.

2616
01:31:03,392 --> 01:31:04,791
I had my doubts about this training.

2617
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,501
It's frustrating that I realized why it was necessary.

2618
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:10,101
You're right. Why are we realizing things?

2619
01:31:10,102 --> 01:31:13,001
I was like, "I can't learn anything from wood chopping." Yet I did.

2620
01:31:13,002 --> 01:31:15,112
Since we're done, do we get food now?

2621
01:31:15,172 --> 01:31:16,641
Yes. What would you like?

2622
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:17,771
- Meat. - "Meat?"

2623
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,842
- Let's go. - Let's go eat!

2624
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:25,082
(The sun has set.)

2625
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:29,622
(A sudden heavy rain falls.)

2626
01:31:30,022 --> 01:31:32,922
It's a relief that the rain started after our training.

2627
01:31:33,962 --> 01:31:36,632
- We've finally arrived. - It's our home.

2628
01:31:36,762 --> 01:31:37,962
(Gosh)

2629
01:31:43,002 --> 01:31:44,132
How is it?

2630
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,741
- It's huge. - Why is it so roomy?

2631
01:31:45,742 --> 01:31:47,442
- My goodness. - Look at that meat.

2632
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:48,942
- Oh, gosh. - Seriously?

2633
01:31:49,342 --> 01:31:51,572
(Specially prepared for the exhausted Iron Girls)

2634
01:31:52,142 --> 01:31:54,842
(A barbecue set of Jeju Island black pork)

2635
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:57,351
Gosh, check out how thick the meat is.

2636
01:31:57,352 --> 01:31:59,052
We're eating indoors this time.

2637
01:31:59,282 --> 01:32:01,691
Ju Hyun grills meat to perfection.

2638
01:32:01,692 --> 01:32:03,722
Step away. We're still filthy.

2639
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:06,191
You're right. I want to wash my hands.

2640
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:07,422
- Let's go. - Okay.

2641
01:32:07,662 --> 01:32:09,992
(Washing up quickly before dinner)

2642
01:32:10,392 --> 01:32:12,862
(Uie gets out of the shower first and dries her hair.)

2643
01:32:15,502 --> 01:32:17,202
My hair is drying out fast.

2644
01:32:18,372 --> 01:32:20,442
(Ju Hyun is done with her shower.)

2645
01:32:22,442 --> 01:32:24,212
Ju Hyun, use this.

2646
01:32:24,442 --> 01:32:26,841
It dries well without damaging the hair.

2647
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:28,011
- Are you done? - Yes.

2648
01:32:28,012 --> 01:32:29,652
(They share what's good.)

2649
01:32:32,052 --> 01:32:33,682
- The airflow is gentle. - Right?

2650
01:32:33,782 --> 01:32:34,852
Isn't it light?

2651
01:32:36,322 --> 01:32:38,192
I think this one will do.

2652
01:32:39,222 --> 01:32:42,431
My mom and sister love this dryer.

2653
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,592
It makes the hair voluminous, which is great.

2654
01:32:44,632 --> 01:32:46,861
Finish it with cool air.

2655
01:32:46,862 --> 01:32:47,932
(Dolling up before dinner)

2656
01:32:48,532 --> 01:32:49,772
How cute.

2657
01:32:51,172 --> 01:32:53,502
Shall we get cooking now?

2658
01:32:53,742 --> 01:32:55,372
Are you going to grill the meat?

2659
01:32:55,542 --> 01:32:57,112
Of course I will.

2660
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,242
Ju Hyun, let me help.

2661
01:32:59,382 --> 01:33:01,781
- Please follow me with that meat. - Yes, ma'am.

2662
01:33:01,782 --> 01:33:03,512
(Heading to the deck with the meat)

2663
01:33:03,812 --> 01:33:05,582
(Reunited with the charcoal grill)

2664
01:33:05,722 --> 01:33:06,921
It's been a while.

2665
01:33:06,922 --> 01:33:07,982
(She's happy to see it.)

2666
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:10,151
(Actually, Ju Hyun...)

2667
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:12,962
(controls both the charcoal fire and the meat.)

2668
01:33:13,862 --> 01:33:16,392
(The acclaimed charcoal master)

2669
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:20,632
- Gosh. - Finally, Ju Hyun.

2670
01:33:21,532 --> 01:33:22,931
We finally get to eat Ju Hyun's meat.

2671
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:24,932
"The firewood crushed by the Iron Girls."

2672
01:33:26,472 --> 01:33:28,041
To grill meat with those?

2673
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:30,141
What? "The firewood crushed by the Iron Girls?"

2674
01:33:30,142 --> 01:33:32,282
Those are the logs we chopped into firewood.

2675
01:33:32,912 --> 01:33:35,351
(The firewood crushed by the Iron Girls)

2676
01:33:35,352 --> 01:33:37,432
(Firewood chopped with your blood, sweat, and tears)

2677
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:39,252
With the firewood I chopped...

2678
01:33:40,022 --> 01:33:41,992
I wonder how that'll feel.

2679
01:33:43,522 --> 01:33:44,621
I'll grill them for you quickly.

2680
01:33:44,622 --> 01:33:46,822
(The meat is grilled over burning firewood.)

2681
01:33:47,162 --> 01:33:48,891
(The charcoal master is back.)

2682
01:33:48,892 --> 01:33:50,761
It's flame-grilled.

2683
01:33:50,762 --> 01:33:52,931
(The charcoal master goes all out, grilling the meat.)

2684
01:33:52,932 --> 01:33:54,302
You're looking really cool.

2685
01:33:54,402 --> 01:33:55,972
I told you she was cool.

2686
01:33:56,732 --> 01:33:58,842
(Dead serious)

2687
01:33:59,002 --> 01:34:00,571
Who eats grilled green onions?

2688
01:34:00,572 --> 01:34:01,812
- Me. - Okay.

2689
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,312
Wait. What is that?

2690
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:05,042
Isn't that a bat?

2691
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:06,911
Wasn't that a bird just now?

2692
01:34:06,912 --> 01:34:08,042
"A bird?"

2693
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,711
What is that? For real.

2694
01:34:09,712 --> 01:34:12,381
- Look. I told you, didn't I? - It's a bat, right?

2695
01:34:12,382 --> 01:34:13,421
(Screaming)

2696
01:34:13,422 --> 01:34:14,952
- Go away. - Please.

2697
01:34:15,152 --> 01:34:17,451
- It's huge. - Stop lying.

2698
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:18,491
- Is it a bat? - Look how big the shadow is.

2699
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:19,521
It's not a bat, is it?

2700
01:34:19,522 --> 01:34:20,522
- Is it a moth or what? - I don't know.

2701
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:22,531
- What is it? Where did it go? - Where is it?

2702
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:23,991
- Where? - Oh, no!

2703
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,661
- This is no joke. - Isn't it huge?

2704
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:26,901
Did someone see it?

2705
01:34:26,902 --> 01:34:28,461
- Did you see it or not? - The meat.

2706
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:30,701
I did, but I have zero idea what it is.

2707
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:32,642
(Putting her fear aside, she grills the meat.)

2708
01:34:33,072 --> 01:34:34,702
How was that even possible?

2709
01:34:35,872 --> 01:34:38,212
(What is Sae Rok doing during the chaos?)

2710
01:34:38,642 --> 01:34:41,642
(She's busy in the kitchen alone.)

2711
01:34:42,212 --> 01:34:46,082
- I'm going to make olive kimchi. - Okay.

2712
01:34:50,392 --> 01:34:51,752
These olives.

2713
01:34:52,892 --> 01:34:54,721
(Who is she talking to?)

2714
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:56,691
- Put them in here... - Hey!

2715
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:58,392
And draw out the saltiness.

2716
01:35:00,832 --> 01:35:02,032
What are you doing alone?

2717
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:03,671
I'm shooting a cooking class.

2718
01:35:03,672 --> 01:35:04,932
Keum Sae Rok's Cooking Class.

2719
01:35:05,102 --> 01:35:07,372
(Sae Rok's Cooking Class: Making olive kimchi)

2720
01:35:07,842 --> 01:35:09,412
Did you come up with it yourself?

2721
01:35:09,472 --> 01:35:12,841
No. It's a trending recipe.

2722
01:35:12,842 --> 01:35:14,512
- Olive kimchi? - Yes.

2723
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,612
It's simple yet delicious.

2724
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,622
Are you saying the olives will turn into kimchi?

2725
01:35:20,852 --> 01:35:22,292
Yes, it will.

2726
01:35:22,892 --> 01:35:24,722
I've never had olive kimchi before.

2727
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:28,062
Really? It's a quick recipe.

2728
01:35:28,362 --> 01:35:29,562
Do you usually cook?

2729
01:35:29,732 --> 01:35:31,162
Me? I make...

2730
01:35:31,332 --> 01:35:34,131
simple meals...

2731
01:35:34,132 --> 01:35:35,271
- You do? - at home.

2732
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,272
That's amazing.

2733
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:39,671
(Making olive kimchi)

2734
01:35:39,672 --> 01:35:42,612
(1. Draw out the saltiness of the olives under running water.)

2735
01:35:42,942 --> 01:35:45,382
(Next is to prep the vegetables!)

2736
01:35:45,842 --> 01:35:48,752
(2. Chop up an onion.)

2737
01:35:49,282 --> 01:35:51,481
You need to chop it finely.

2738
01:35:51,482 --> 01:35:54,182
Or else, it can cause your breath to stink.

2739
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:58,792
Because raw onions have a strong smell,

2740
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:02,162
chopping them into fine pieces is key.

2741
01:36:02,262 --> 01:36:03,331
That's the point.

2742
01:36:03,332 --> 01:36:05,862
(Sae Rok's practical cooking class)

2743
01:36:05,932 --> 01:36:09,471
Can you slice the cucumber chili for me?

2744
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,472
- You won't regret it, right? - Of course not.

2745
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:15,611
(3. Cut the cucumber chili into bite-sized pieces.)

2746
01:36:15,612 --> 01:36:18,142
- Bite-sized? - Yes, that's good.

2747
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,341
Wait. I've got a great teacher.

2748
01:36:20,342 --> 01:36:22,481
You're generous with your compliments.

2749
01:36:22,482 --> 01:36:24,651
Really? But you're good at everything.

2750
01:36:24,652 --> 01:36:25,652
(2nd compliment: You're good at everything.)

2751
01:36:25,653 --> 01:36:28,221
At times, Sae Rok says things that make your heart flutter.

2752
01:36:28,222 --> 01:36:29,392
- I do? - Yes.

2753
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:30,952
Like just now.

2754
01:36:31,522 --> 01:36:32,821
It's true that you're good at things.

2755
01:36:32,822 --> 01:36:33,992
You don't hold back.

2756
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:35,492
And then...

2757
01:36:36,532 --> 01:36:37,691
I will add...

2758
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:38,701
Is there a big bowl here?

2759
01:36:38,702 --> 01:36:40,532
The onions in.

2760
01:36:40,602 --> 01:36:41,801
In they go.

2761
01:36:41,802 --> 01:36:43,872
(Adding the onions)

2762
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:46,842
The cucumber chili goes in next.

2763
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:49,842
After that, chili powder.

2764
01:36:49,972 --> 01:36:52,542
One teaspoon of minced garlic.

2765
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:55,082
Half a teaspoon.

2766
01:36:55,652 --> 01:36:58,052
One big teaspoon of olive oil.

2767
01:36:58,582 --> 01:37:00,552
Mix them together.

2768
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:02,992
(With her touch, it is getting delicious.)

2769
01:37:03,492 --> 01:37:04,622
It looks okay.

2770
01:37:05,422 --> 01:37:07,222
- What do you think? - It looks good.

2771
01:37:08,262 --> 01:37:10,562
(It's visually appetizing.)

2772
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:15,132
(Sae Rok has a taste of it.)

2773
01:37:15,232 --> 01:37:17,302
(Impressed)

2774
01:37:17,502 --> 01:37:18,571
It's good.

2775
01:37:18,572 --> 01:37:19,772
Nice.

2776
01:37:20,772 --> 01:37:22,011
Very good.

2777
01:37:22,012 --> 01:37:23,972
(Finishing it off with sesame seeds)

2778
01:37:24,812 --> 01:37:27,712
(Serving it in a pretty bowl)

2779
01:37:28,512 --> 01:37:29,652
It looks pretty.

2780
01:37:30,152 --> 01:37:31,952
The unique flavor makes it good.

2781
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,222
(Screaming)

2782
01:37:34,422 --> 01:37:36,151
What is it? What's wrong this time?

2783
01:37:36,152 --> 01:37:37,192
What's going on?

2784
01:37:37,252 --> 01:37:38,391
That was Ju Hyun, right?

2785
01:37:38,392 --> 01:37:39,392
Oh, gosh.

2786
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:41,392
(The deck is filled with smoke.)

2787
01:37:41,462 --> 01:37:42,762
I can't see a thing.

2788
01:37:44,362 --> 01:37:45,732
That piece is in danger.

2789
01:37:46,062 --> 01:37:47,832
Gosh. The fat is dripping down.

2790
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,202
Oh, no.

2791
01:37:49,502 --> 01:37:51,332
(The charcoal master is flustered.)

2792
01:37:51,972 --> 01:37:53,602
Isn't this a CBR training?

2793
01:37:54,102 --> 01:37:55,712
(Help me.)

2794
01:37:55,842 --> 01:37:56,941
This is...

2795
01:37:56,942 --> 01:37:58,212
(The fire isn't dying down.)

2796
01:37:58,242 --> 01:38:02,152
This is the toughest day I've ever had grilling meat.

2797
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:04,151
Should I take some charcoal out?

2798
01:38:04,152 --> 01:38:05,288
(In Ah helps put out the fire.)

2799
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:06,621
No, stay...

2800
01:38:06,622 --> 01:38:09,292
Stay still. Stop. What do I do?

2801
01:38:09,892 --> 01:38:11,668
- No, it's okay. Calm down. - What about taking some wood out?

2802
01:38:11,692 --> 01:38:14,562
(She calmly moves the meat to another grill.)

2803
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:16,191
Cut off the oxygen.

2804
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,992
(The oxygen is cut off immediately.)

2805
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:20,362
Let me wipe off the excess oil.

2806
01:38:20,802 --> 01:38:22,332
- Shall we check, chef? - Open it.

2807
01:38:24,602 --> 01:38:26,002
It looks calm now.

2808
01:38:26,302 --> 01:38:29,042
(Placing foil over the weakened flames)

2809
01:38:29,742 --> 01:38:33,142
(She tries grilling the meat again.)

2810
01:38:33,342 --> 01:38:35,912
(Turning over a new leaf)

2811
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:37,651
(She knows no failure.)

2812
01:38:37,652 --> 01:38:38,652
It's cooking well.

2813
01:38:39,452 --> 01:38:42,352
(Carefully seasoning the meat with salt)

2814
01:38:43,052 --> 01:38:44,492
That looks so good.

2815
01:38:45,662 --> 01:38:48,361
(The smoky black pork barbecue is complete.)

2816
01:38:48,362 --> 01:38:49,592
It looks tasty.

2817
01:38:51,362 --> 01:38:53,262
- I'll put it here for now. - Okay.

2818
01:38:56,272 --> 01:38:57,901
(Making handles for the tomahawk pork chops...)

2819
01:38:57,902 --> 01:38:59,742
(so that they can hold them and gnaw on them.)

2820
01:39:00,342 --> 01:39:03,312
(Careful touches)

2821
01:39:03,742 --> 01:39:06,442
(She finished making the handles for the tomahawk pork chops.)

2822
01:39:07,282 --> 01:39:11,411
(In Ah plates the food so that it looks good.)

2823
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:12,881
It's our first time eating meat that was cooked...

2824
01:39:12,882 --> 01:39:14,121
by the firewood we chopped.

2825
01:39:14,122 --> 01:39:15,122
Seriously.

2826
01:39:15,123 --> 01:39:17,122
When would we do this again in our lives?

2827
01:39:17,652 --> 01:39:18,891
Let's not do this again.

2828
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:21,192
(Let's not do this again.)

2829
01:39:22,592 --> 01:39:24,962
It looks tasty when there are bell pepper pieces.

2830
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:26,801
- Good. - All done.

2831
01:39:26,802 --> 01:39:28,231
- All done. - All done.

2832
01:39:28,232 --> 01:39:29,271
We're done.

2833
01:39:29,272 --> 01:39:30,371
(Here comes the meat.)

2834
01:39:30,372 --> 01:39:31,471
(Glancing over)

2835
01:39:31,472 --> 01:39:33,272
- Look at this. - Isn't this restaurant food?

2836
01:39:35,842 --> 01:39:37,602
- What's this? - Do you want to take a look?

2837
01:39:37,642 --> 01:39:39,182
What's this?

2838
01:39:39,412 --> 01:39:41,141
In Ah, the presentation is so pretty.

2839
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,082
Thanks. I copied what I saw.

2840
01:39:43,452 --> 01:39:45,952
(Olive kimchi)

2841
01:39:46,322 --> 01:39:47,552
- I made it. - Ju Hyun.

2842
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:51,122
- It's olive kimchi. - It looks so tasty.

2843
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:52,812
Thank you for your hard work.

2844
01:39:52,892 --> 01:39:54,261
Let's hurry up and eat.

2845
01:39:54,262 --> 01:39:55,762
- Yes. - Let's hurry up.

2846
01:39:56,732 --> 01:39:59,562
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2847
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:02,672
Ju Hyun, what's this?

2848
01:40:02,732 --> 01:40:04,632
It was cooked using the wood we chopped.

2849
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:06,701
- The wood we chopped. - Really?

2850
01:40:06,702 --> 01:40:07,772
It was written there.

2851
01:40:07,802 --> 01:40:10,411
Then we should've had so much firewood.

2852
01:40:10,412 --> 01:40:12,388
- It's tasty. Hurry up and eat it. - We worked so hard for...

2853
01:40:12,412 --> 01:40:13,682
She's so good at grilling meat.

2854
01:40:14,282 --> 01:40:15,611
I enjoyed it so much last year.

2855
01:40:15,612 --> 01:40:17,128
(She takes a bite of the tomahawk pork chop.)

2856
01:40:17,152 --> 01:40:19,152
While there were some hardships...

2857
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:21,182
(This is incredible.)

2858
01:40:21,422 --> 01:40:23,192
(Hurry up and eat it.)

2859
01:40:23,652 --> 01:40:24,721
(It's Sae Rok's first time tasting the meat...)

2860
01:40:24,722 --> 01:40:26,402
(that was grilled by the charcoal master.)

2861
01:40:27,362 --> 01:40:28,422
It isn't tough, right?

2862
01:40:28,992 --> 01:40:30,361
(Pausing)

2863
01:40:30,362 --> 01:40:32,282
- What do you think? - It's really tasty, right?

2864
01:40:32,362 --> 01:40:34,302
What's this? I've never had anything like it.

2865
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,731
- Really? - Isn't it a tomahawk pork chop?

2866
01:40:35,732 --> 01:40:37,532
- What's this? - A tomahawk pork chop, right?

2867
01:40:37,702 --> 01:40:39,672
(In Ah takes a big bite as well.)

2868
01:40:40,172 --> 01:40:41,272
Do we have sauce?

2869
01:40:41,642 --> 01:40:44,012
Ju Hyun, thank you so much.

2870
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:46,081
(The charcoal master takes a big bite as well.)

2871
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:47,311
- It's tasty. - I only had the fat,

2872
01:40:47,312 --> 01:40:48,342
and it's still good.

2873
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:49,752
It's so tasty.

2874
01:40:51,082 --> 01:40:52,982
- It's insane. - What are we going to do?

2875
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:56,522
(Uie is very proud of her.)

2876
01:40:56,892 --> 01:40:58,752
Dip it in sesame oil and salt.

2877
01:40:58,992 --> 01:40:59,992
(Impressed)

2878
01:40:59,993 --> 01:41:02,662
It's crispy outside and moist inside.

2879
01:41:02,832 --> 01:41:03,861
- Right? - Yes.

2880
01:41:03,862 --> 01:41:04,862
(Proud)

2881
01:41:05,432 --> 01:41:07,461
(They eat...)

2882
01:41:07,462 --> 01:41:09,571
(in earnest.)

2883
01:41:09,572 --> 01:41:11,031
How are the edges so tender?

2884
01:41:11,032 --> 01:41:12,741
(Try the mushroom as well.)

2885
01:41:12,742 --> 01:41:13,872
The mushroom is tasty.

2886
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:15,612
(Impressed)

2887
01:41:16,572 --> 01:41:19,041
(They share the tasty mushroom.)

2888
01:41:19,042 --> 01:41:20,042
(Impressed)

2889
01:41:20,712 --> 01:41:21,741
(Impressed)

2890
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:22,912
It's so tasty.

2891
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:25,432
The olive kimchi is really tasty too.

2892
01:41:26,082 --> 01:41:28,181
- I want to eat it in one bite. - Here. The oil sauce.

2893
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:29,622
(Uie eats a big spoonful.)

2894
01:41:31,822 --> 01:41:33,398
- It's tasty, right? - It's tasty, right?

2895
01:41:33,422 --> 01:41:34,422
(Eating the first piece)

2896
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:36,292
(Eating the second piece)

2897
01:41:36,532 --> 01:41:38,732
- It isn't tough, right? - It goes well with the meat.

2898
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:40,732
- Right? It does, right? - Seriously.

2899
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:43,031
(It's the perfect match for meat.)

2900
01:41:43,032 --> 01:41:44,431
- When we exercise, - In Ah.

2901
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:45,742
We need to eat like animals.

2902
01:41:47,372 --> 01:41:48,971
(It's a taste they'll never get tired of.)

2903
01:41:48,972 --> 01:41:51,341
Ssamjang. Gochujang. I want gochujang.

2904
01:41:51,342 --> 01:41:54,142
(It's a taste they'll never get tired of.)

2905
01:41:54,512 --> 01:41:56,152
If this is our payment for a day of work,

2906
01:41:56,852 --> 01:41:58,152
- I'm satisfied. - Same here.

2907
01:41:58,882 --> 01:42:01,522
Ju Hyun, please make this every day. It's so tasty.

2908
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:03,121
She can't make it every day.

2909
01:42:03,122 --> 01:42:04,251
- How about once a week? - What if...

2910
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:06,091
Then you'll need to split wood every day.

2911
01:42:06,092 --> 01:42:08,491
- What will it be? It's up to you. - I can do it with ease now.

2912
01:42:08,492 --> 01:42:09,592
- Really? - Yes.

2913
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:13,301
(The woman who has an experience with an axe is relaxed.)

2914
01:42:13,302 --> 01:42:15,161
Let's split firewood for a part-time job someday.

2915
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:17,071
- All four of us can do that. - Let's enter a competition.

2916
01:42:17,072 --> 01:42:18,371
A wood-chopping competition.

2917
01:42:18,372 --> 01:42:20,492
(Grand Opening Event: 30 Percent Discount, Axe Girls)

2918
01:42:22,372 --> 01:42:23,412
It's so tasty.

2919
01:42:23,672 --> 01:42:26,812
Let's eat this meat only when we do Iron Girls.

2920
01:42:27,442 --> 01:42:29,028
- It'll be a good memory. - Season Three?

2921
01:42:29,052 --> 01:42:30,281
I won't eat it again in my life.

2922
01:42:30,282 --> 01:42:31,512
(What? In that case...)

2923
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:33,521
(Announcing that she won't eat another tomahawk pork chop)

2924
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:34,682
This will be the last time.

2925
01:42:36,952 --> 01:42:38,422
You know,

2926
01:42:38,922 --> 01:42:40,862
Season Two is no joke.

2927
01:42:41,022 --> 01:42:43,422
To be honest, I thought that it'd be easier than Season One.

2928
01:42:43,632 --> 01:42:45,161
Me too. We had done a triathlon.

2929
01:42:45,162 --> 01:42:46,162
Exactly.

2930
01:42:46,163 --> 01:42:47,562
But boxing is just as hard.

2931
01:42:48,032 --> 01:42:50,702
Rocky, how is it for you? I'm curious.

2932
01:42:52,372 --> 01:42:53,572
It's extremely hard.

2933
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:56,142
- My goodness. - It's extremely hard.

2934
01:42:56,442 --> 01:42:58,511
But I think, "I need to do it."

2935
01:42:58,512 --> 01:43:00,642
"I'll make it work."

2936
01:43:01,382 --> 01:43:03,052
The problem is that it's fun.

2937
01:43:03,152 --> 01:43:04,281
When I'm done, I think that it's fun.

2938
01:43:04,282 --> 01:43:05,721
- But it's extremely hard. - That's right.

2939
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:07,452
We still remember...

2940
01:43:08,452 --> 01:43:10,691
the time you entered the ring for the first time...

2941
01:43:10,692 --> 01:43:12,622
and lasted three minutes.

2942
01:43:13,892 --> 01:43:19,432
(It seems just like yesterday that she looked for her mom.)

2943
01:43:20,532 --> 01:43:24,072
(She endured intense training with the members.)

2944
01:43:25,502 --> 01:43:30,012
(She overcame her limits.)

2945
01:43:30,342 --> 01:43:31,342
(Hit it!)

2946
01:43:32,142 --> 01:43:34,811
(Rocky Keum is becoming stronger.)

2947
01:43:34,812 --> 01:43:36,911
- She's becoming an iron girl. - That's right.

2948
01:43:36,912 --> 01:43:37,912
It's fun.

2949
01:43:38,052 --> 01:43:40,121
At first, when we asked Rocky...

2950
01:43:40,122 --> 01:43:41,351
to wash up with us,

2951
01:43:41,352 --> 01:43:42,551
she was like, "Why would we wash up together?"

2952
01:43:42,552 --> 01:43:43,792
She was like this at first.

2953
01:43:44,052 --> 01:43:46,492
Now, she's like, "Who cares? Let's go!"

2954
01:43:46,522 --> 01:43:47,691
"A bathhouse sounds nice. Let's go."

2955
01:43:47,692 --> 01:43:49,891
"A bathhouse sounds nice. Let's go." She does that.

2956
01:43:49,892 --> 01:43:51,461
During the course of a month,

2957
01:43:51,462 --> 01:43:53,361
- we became much closer. - That's right.

2958
01:43:53,362 --> 01:43:55,131
It doesn't feel like she's a new member.

2959
01:43:55,132 --> 01:43:56,132
Same here.

2960
01:43:56,133 --> 01:43:57,931
I wasn't familiar...

2961
01:43:57,932 --> 01:43:59,701
- with the environment. - That's right.

2962
01:43:59,702 --> 01:44:02,141
- I didn't know anyone. - Right.

2963
01:44:02,142 --> 01:44:04,971
But you guys treated me with ease.

2964
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:06,881
You guys talked to me.

2965
01:44:06,882 --> 01:44:08,241
"Do you want to do this? Do you want to do that?"

2966
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:12,452
Each member approached me in a different style.

2967
01:44:12,552 --> 01:44:14,581
- That's right. - I could become a part of the team.

2968
01:44:14,582 --> 01:44:16,451
It's so nice. Seriously.

2969
01:44:16,452 --> 01:44:17,951
It really looks like you're at ease. I'm so relieved.

2970
01:44:17,952 --> 01:44:18,952
Same here.

2971
01:44:19,092 --> 01:44:20,292
At times,

2972
01:44:20,822 --> 01:44:22,392
I think of you guys when I'm home.

2973
01:44:23,192 --> 01:44:25,352
- We're charming, right? - Yes, you guys are charming.

2974
01:44:26,032 --> 01:44:30,071
The thing is, I still think that boxing really doesn't suit me...

2975
01:44:30,072 --> 01:44:32,002
if I'm being perfectly honest.

2976
01:44:32,402 --> 01:44:37,042
But I feel like I've improved somewhat.

2977
01:44:37,442 --> 01:44:39,142
I've gotten a good taste.

2978
01:44:40,112 --> 01:44:42,081
"Is this why people box?"

2979
01:44:42,082 --> 01:44:44,382
To be honest, I felt it today.

2980
01:44:44,752 --> 01:44:46,881
I think I'm pretty okay with getting punched.

2981
01:44:46,882 --> 01:44:47,882
I see.

2982
01:44:47,883 --> 01:44:50,622
I know. I think I enjoy it at times.

2983
01:44:51,492 --> 01:44:54,392
Hey, let's win and cry together.

2984
01:44:54,522 --> 01:44:55,562
That's right.

2985
01:44:55,762 --> 01:44:56,961
No. Maybe winning won't be possible.

2986
01:44:56,962 --> 01:44:58,808
- That's right. - Let's win at least one round.

2987
01:44:58,832 --> 01:45:00,431
Will we have two rounds in a competition?

2988
01:45:00,432 --> 01:45:01,538
Will we be done in three minutes?

2989
01:45:01,562 --> 01:45:03,632
- That's right. - One minute and thirty seconds.

2990
01:45:03,702 --> 01:45:06,272
Won't there be preliminaries and finals?

2991
01:45:06,442 --> 01:45:07,701
We'll need to advance from the preliminaries...

2992
01:45:07,702 --> 01:45:08,902
- to enter the finals. - Yes.

2993
01:45:09,042 --> 01:45:11,072
If we fail to advance, this journey will be...

2994
01:45:11,312 --> 01:45:12,541
- Seriously. - for three minutes.

2995
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:13,582
Six minutes.

2996
01:45:14,142 --> 01:45:15,211
We'll have three minutes.

2997
01:45:15,212 --> 01:45:16,551
If we get eliminated, we'll have three minutes.

2998
01:45:16,552 --> 01:45:17,928
- Right. - Three minutes and forty seconds.

2999
01:45:17,952 --> 01:45:19,982
Don't even think about getting eliminated.

3000
01:45:20,622 --> 01:45:22,862
- I'm under so much pressure. - You'll have six minutes.

3001
01:45:23,392 --> 01:45:25,321
- All of us should get 6 minutes. - I'll get 6 minutes as well.

3002
01:45:25,322 --> 01:45:26,521
Everyone will get six minutes.

3003
01:45:26,522 --> 01:45:27,562
- Okay. - Okay.

3004
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:28,722
Everyone will do that.

3005
01:45:28,723 --> 01:45:31,032
Three months of training for six minutes.

3006
01:45:31,832 --> 01:45:33,161
Let's do our best.

3007
01:45:33,162 --> 01:45:34,501
- Don't get hurt, okay? - Okay.

3008
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:36,369
(The night of the training deepens on Jeju Island.)

3009
01:45:36,393 --> 01:45:37,693
(Running in nature)

3010
01:45:38,163 --> 01:45:40,633
(Trail running)

3011
01:45:41,193 --> 01:45:42,903
(In this weather?)

3012
01:45:43,363 --> 01:45:46,203
(Rain falls like crazy.)

3013
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:49,233
(The muddy trail slows them down.)

3014
01:45:49,443 --> 01:45:51,083
(The running course turns into a jungle.)

3015
01:45:51,243 --> 01:45:52,503
(I can't make it.)

3016
01:45:52,713 --> 01:45:53,873
(My knees hurt so much.)

3017
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:55,073
(I can't go down.)

3018
01:45:55,643 --> 01:45:58,083
(Trail running in the worst situation)

3019
01:45:58,343 --> 01:46:00,059
(Will they be able to finish the race safely?)

3020
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:01,583
(After the first sparring session, )

3021
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:05,552
(will they spar a female adult?)

3022
01:46:05,553 --> 01:46:06,553
(Gasping)

3023
01:46:06,554 --> 01:46:08,129
(The opponent has a familiar silhouette!)

3024
01:46:08,153 --> 01:46:09,492
(Although they're happy to see her, )

3025
01:46:09,493 --> 01:46:11,039
(the situation makes them unhappy to see her.)

3026
01:46:11,063 --> 01:46:13,733
(The sparring finally came to be.)

3027
01:46:14,093 --> 01:46:15,733
(They face her in the ring.)

3028
01:46:16,003 --> 01:46:17,702
- Hook. - Punch, punch.

3029
01:46:17,703 --> 01:46:20,473
(Her punches are scary.)

3030
01:46:20,873 --> 01:46:22,633
(She's on another level in terms of skills.)

3031
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:24,143
(She's too strong.)

3032
01:46:24,403 --> 01:46:25,903
(I can't do a hook at all.)

3033
01:46:26,273 --> 01:46:27,989
(Will the sparring end with them getting punched?)

3034
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:29,612
(The counterattack...)

3035
01:46:29,613 --> 01:46:32,953
(begins.)

3036
01:46:33,313 --> 01:46:35,352
(Compared to the first sparring, )

3037
01:46:35,353 --> 01:46:37,853
(their boxing skills are different!)

3038
01:46:38,283 --> 01:46:41,193
(What will be the result of the second sparring?)
