1
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:20,403
(Uie)

2
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,772
(Keum Sae Rok)

3
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,593
(Park Ju Hyun)

4
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,409
(Seol In Ah)

5
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:32,181
(Iron Girls 2)

6
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:34,153
(The journey to become boxing champions finally began!)

7
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,063
(They watched a boxing game for the first time ever.)

8
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:40,633
(They faced the fear of boxing in the very beginning.)

9
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:42,833
(For someone, it was excitement!)

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:48,073
(They tried boxing right away.)

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,403
(Boxing raised their dopamine level to the max.)

12
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:53,973
(But they got knocked out right away.)

13
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,213
(My goodness)

14
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:58,083
(They lacked the stamina to hold out in the ring.)

15
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,583
(What they need is the stamina training of death.)

16
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,282
(Total length: 400m)

17
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:04,783
(Go up the ski jump ramp that's like a cliff.)

18
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:06,022
(Why are we going up the ramp?)

19
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,893
(It was made to go down!)

20
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,522
(The crazy and intense training...)

21
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:11,693
(began on the first day.)

22
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,133
(The iron flavor of Iron Girls, the show that's back with spite, )

23
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,463
(made them feel faint.)

24
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,733
(Their batteries got drained.)

25
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,973
(Let me go home.)

26
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:23,243
(The intensity of training got a major upgrade!)

27
00:01:23,673 --> 00:01:26,203
(What kind of training awaits them today?)

28
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:29,912
Today, we'll train with seriousness.

29
00:01:29,913 --> 00:01:31,142
- What?
- What's this sound?

30
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:32,913
(Punching sound)

31
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:34,553
I can hear it.

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,152
- What?
- Boxing.

33
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:37,183
- Goodness.
- What's this?

34
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:42,423
(Someone is training in the ring.)

35
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:46,832
(Insane power and speed)

36
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,292
Getting hit by him would kill me.

37
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,393
Gosh, he's so cool.

38
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:50,703
It's no joke.

39
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,342
That's incredible.

40
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,702
(Who is the man with skills...)

41
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,412
(that captivate attention?)

42
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,513
Seriously.

43
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,382
- Hello.
- Hello.

44
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:05,042
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,012
He's the coach who will be in charge of the Iron Girls.

46
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,713
(Iron Girls' boxing coach, Kim Ji Hoon)

47
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,452
Coach Kim Ji Hoon is a former national boxer...

48
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:12,623
of the lightweight division.

49
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,422
The President's Cup Tournament, Korean National Sports Festival,

50
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:16,963
Association Chair's Cup Tournament, and so on.

51
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:19,323
He swept the three competitions in Korea.

52
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,463
He even won the Top Excellence in Coaching Award...

53
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,333
in the past.

54
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,102
I'm Coach Kim Ji Hoon, and I'll be with you guys...

55
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,632
for four months.

56
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,102
- We're in your care.
- He's Coach Kim Ji Hoon.

57
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:30,103
It's nice to meet you.

58
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:32,572
Doesn't he look a bit familiar?

59
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:34,242
Yes, he does. He looks very familiar.

60
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,882
In "The Roundup: Punishment,"

61
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,313
he fought against Ma Dong Seok in a plane.

62
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,783
That's incredible.

63
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,882
(Kim Ji Hoon threw punches at Ma Dong Seok...)

64
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:50,523
(and showed fancy action moves.)

65
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:53,793
(He's also Actor Ma Dong Seok's boxing coach.)

66
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:57,632
(He's a boxing coach who represents the nation.)

67
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,402
- I see.
- That's incredible.

68
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:01,072
All you need to do is exercise diligently.

69
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:02,572
- Okay.
- There's something...

70
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,372
I want to tell you.

71
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:07,013
Once you enter the ring, no one can help you.

72
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:09,442
In the ring, you must survive on your own.

73
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,182
- That's scary.
- That's so scary.

74
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,283
I'm trembling.

75
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,313
I think he's a bit strange.

76
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,013
You know the rule of 80 to 20, right?

77
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:17,583
Only 20 percent will survive.

78
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,922
I don't know who'll be in that 20 percent,

79
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:21,393
but please focus.

80
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:22,723
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

81
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,863
Now, I'll assess your physical ability...

82
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,092
through a test.

83
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,863
(A physical test)

84
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,533
- A physical test?
- Like I said earlier,

85
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,473
I have no data whatsoever.

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,050
I'm running this test to set a standard.

87
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,259
The test is mostly made up of bodyweight exercises.

88
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,960
Let's start with a full-body and weight exercise,

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,990
push-ups.

90
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,399
(Physical test 1, Push-up)

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,660
Boxers keep their arms up at all times.

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,229
You'll build muscles that'll be the foundation.

93
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,570
(Checking the arm muscles, the foundation)

94
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,809
I can't do any push-ups.

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,839
Can I do it? I don't think I can.

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,340
(Can we do push-ups?)

97
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,810
In the world of competition...

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,850
(The fiery coach reappears.)

99
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,819
age and gender don't exist.

100
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,849
Even if you fight an elementary schooler,

101
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,850
you must do your best.

102
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,389
He's coldhearted.

103
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,890
- What should we do?
- He's cold.

104
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,620
He's so cold.

105
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,519
You know that I wrote a book on push-ups, right?

106
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,730
Goodness. Really?

107
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,130
It's my first time hearing about it.

108
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,929
It became an Amazon bestseller.

109
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,729
- Really?
- Yes.

110
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,799
A book on push-ups?

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,569
It's titled "Just 100 Push-Ups."

112
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,839
We'll get better at push-ups.

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,669
- Now, I want to learn it too.
- Same here.

114
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,209
He even wrote a book on the matter.

115
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,140
- How does he do it?
- Please show us once.

116
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,310
I'll make sure you feel the change...

117
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,350
- after the test.
- Okay.

118
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,049
Your hands should be directed inward a bit.

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,320
And your bottom shouldn't go up high.

120
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,849
Keep your body straight.

121
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,519
Like this, go down slowly. Breathe out as you go up.

122
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,589
(Breathe in as you go down and breathe out as you go up.)

123
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,489
Go down. Breathe out.

124
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,299
(The bestselling author's perfect form)

125
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
This is incredible.

126
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
It's such a nice form.

127
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,439
It's such a nice form.

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,710
Go down.

129
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,240
You know,

130
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,309
when we had a physical test back in school,

131
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,180
women could put their knees...

132
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,109
on the ground.

133
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,379
In the world of competition, gender and age...

134
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,519
- don't mean anything.
- I just remembered it.

135
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,320
I was just saying. I just remembered that.

136
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,689
Let's see if you can do it.

137
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,589
Let's try doing a push-up in proper form.

138
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,029
- We would love that.
- We are curious if we can do it.

139
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,889
- I don't know if I can do it.
- Shall we try it now?

140
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,030
Yes, let's try it.

141
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,700
The time limit is two minutes.

142
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,629
I'll count and see how many push-ups you can do...

143
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,199
in two minutes.

144
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,740
(The test will count the number of push-ups in 2 minutes.)

145
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,270
(Sae Rok goes first.)

146
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,439
(She exercises day and night.)

147
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,680
Shall I do this?

148
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,379
Get into the position. Okay.

149
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,350
(Sae Rok is ready to go.)

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,690
(I've never thought that I was bad at exercising.)

151
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,149
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

152
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,190
Go.

153
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,260
(- Gosh! - Oh, my!)

154
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,929
- Oh, my!
- My goodness.

155
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Go.

156
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,060
You've done weight exercises for many years.

157
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,070
(Shouting)

158
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,569
- I shouldn't laugh.
- Haven't you done weight exercises?

159
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,339
Hold on a second. Haven't you done weight exercises?

160
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,970
You said yesterday that you worked out for three hours.

161
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,680
Go up.

162
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,079
(Twitching)

163
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,279
How are we supposed to count?

164
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,109
I never say never.

165
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,209
(Tragedy)

166
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,480
- This is tragic.
- Try pushing yourself up.

167
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,750
(However, after Sae Rok, )

168
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,919
(both Ju Hyun...)

169
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,790
(and Uie struggle.)

170
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,360
The lion. The lion is up.

171
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,070
- She's good.
- That's incredible.

172
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,370
- She goes down so much.
- Like that...

173
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,770
- That's totally...
- Three.

174
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,609
(She goes down with her bottom in a straight line.)

175
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,239
She bends her arms at a 90-degree angle.

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,539
(Her arms make a 90-degree angle.)

177
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,580
- That's the proper way.
- That's incredible.

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,379
- Four.
- That's the proper way.

179
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,080
Yes. How is her form so nice?

180
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,050
That's the proper way.

181
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,490
- My goodness.
- She's really good.

182
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,019
She's doing it the most properly.

183
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,060
- Seriously, she's amazing.
- Twelve.

184
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,559
How is her form so nice?

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,089
- Good.
- That's the pose he showed us.

186
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,100
I know.

187
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,570
(Her form is no less than the coach's.)

188
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,799
(She does multiple push-ups...)

189
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
(without resting!)

190
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,170
(She's killing the push-ups.)

191
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,410
I can't believe it.

192
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,440
She's incredible. She's really incredible.

193
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
(Screaming)

194
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
She got up.

195
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,149
(She perseveres even when she's exhausted.)

196
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,320
Good.

197
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,119
She has so much mental strength.

198
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,690
- Okay. Well done.
- Okay.

199
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,659
(She didn't rest until 2 minutes were up.)

200
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,020
(She did 24 push-ups.)

201
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,589
- She's incredible.
- She was born with muscles.

202
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,630
It was a form you'd see in the coach's book. Right?

203
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,400
Her form was textbook.

204
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,729
(Push-ups: Uie, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun: 0)

205
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,269
(In Ah: 24)

206
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,009
It's time for the exercise that comes with push-ups as a set.

207
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,510
- Sit-ups?
- Sit-ups.

208
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,480
- Gosh.
- I'm really bad at it.

209
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
(Physical test 2, Sit-ups)

210
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,880
To box, you need a very strong core.

211
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
When you take a crucial hit,

212
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,689
your abs need to withstand the impact.

213
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,149
- That's right.
- When you get hit...

214
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,260
(Checking the ab muscles that'll hold up upon taking a hit)

215
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,190
The time limit is two minutes.

216
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,359
Get ready. Set, go.

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
(They begin to do the sit-ups.)

218
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
Set, go.

219
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,100
(Gosh!)

220
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,179
(In Ah gets ahead from the start.)

221
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,240
She's good.

222
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,680
(Her form and speed are steady.)

223
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,120
(Sae Rok maintains the speed as well.)

224
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,619
(Iron Girls have no problem with sit-ups.)

225
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,630
(Groaning)

226
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,990
(Screaming)

227
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,460
(Making a fuss)

228
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,599
(Screaming)

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I want to put my hands on my neck.

230
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,900
My hands keep coming off.

231
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,200
(Screaming)

232
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
(Uie barely manages to come up.)

233
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
(Screaming)

234
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,380
All right. Forty seconds.

235
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,909
(Sae Rok and In Ah get tired after 1 minute and 20 seconds.)

236
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,609
That's good.

237
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,879
It's natural to scream as you work out.

238
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,379
(Screams erupt.)

239
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,749
My hair. I want to grab my hair.

240
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,819
That's right. It's easier...

241
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,389
if you pull your head with your hands.

242
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,960
Grab your head and pull it.

243
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,690
Grab your head and pull it.

244
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,490
That's right. It's easier if you do that.

245
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,659
(Toward the end, everyone is screaming.)

246
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,400
- What's this?
- One more.

247
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,570
One more!

248
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,069
Three,

249
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,139
two,

250
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,470
- one.
- I can't do more.

251
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,709
(2 minutes are up.)

252
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,070
I don't think this is right.

253
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,909
Look at her hair.

254
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,380
You guys will have cramps all over the body tomorrow.

255
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,849
(Sit-ups:)

256
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,449
(Uie and Sae Rok: 27, Ju Hyun: 25,)

257
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,320
(In Ah: 38)

258
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,179
Everyone worked hard.

259
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,749
But all of you guys are lacking to become boxers.

260
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,549
(They're lacking to become boxers.)

261
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,019
His words are so hurtful.

262
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,089
- He's a total thinker.
- It's a dagger to the heart.

263
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,559
In any case,

264
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,659
this is the first day.

265
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,260
- The count will go up from here.
- Yes.

266
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,529
Don't be discouraged.

267
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,669
This is where you start.

268
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,669
To become boxing champions in four months,

269
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,800
you must do this physical training every day.

270
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,539
- Just follow me.
- Okay.

271
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,809
I sent you a bandage video.

272
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,810
- Did you watch it?
- Yes.

273
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,850
(What's a hand wrap?)

274
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,650
(Gloves are the symbol of boxing.)

275
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,749
(Inside them, )

276
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,750
(the hand wrap is hidden.)

277
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,589
A hand wrap refers to the act of bandaging your hands...

278
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,290
to protect the wrists and bones.

279
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,159
Boxers have various ways of bandaging their hands.

280
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,260
(Boxers have various ways of bandaging their hands.)

281
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,499
I'll show you how I do it.

282
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,659
- Okay.
- I'll do this.

283
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,769
Use the spacing that suits your hands.

284
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,830
One.

285
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,240
Two.

286
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,000
Three.

287
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,170
I do this and tuck in the end, right?

288
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,439
Why are we wrapping our hands one at a time?

289
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,009
They sell these products.

290
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,879
They're ready-made products.

291
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,379
Each person has different hands,

292
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,679
so it's better to make something that suits your hands...

293
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,819
in order to protect them.

294
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,249
The bandage needs to press the hands.

295
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,889
The ready-made ones have elasticity,

296
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:52,989
so they don't apply pressure.

297
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,460
- Are you done?
- Yes.

298
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,320
There's a bit of elasticity.

299
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,259
It feels totally different.

300
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
(They're ready to learn how to box.)

301
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,629
You'll wrap your hands...

302
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,359
- and enter the ring.
- Okay.

303
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,829
Later on, you'll be able to...

304
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,629
do it naturally while doing something else...

305
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,940
with your eyes closed.

306
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,369
Which training comes next?

307
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,840
- Shall we get started in earnest?
- Yes.

308
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,870
What do you think the first training will be?

309
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,179
- Gloves.
- Jump rope.

310
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Jump rope.

311
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,240
- Jump rope.
- Jump rope.

312
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,749
Many people do this when it comes to boxing.

313
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,620
They say, "They only make you jump rope," and quit.

314
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,750
(Jump rope training comes first no matter which gym you go to.)

315
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,260
(Since you must keep doing steps for boxing, )

316
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,389
(the leg muscles are very important.)

317
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,060
(The calves of a professional boxer)

318
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,229
(Even the world-renowned boxers jump rope to train their legs.)

319
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,300
(Mayweather Jr.)

320
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,270
(You must overcome the pain of jump roping to be the champion.)

321
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,599
You need to do the footwork very well.

322
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,669
When you watch a boxing match,

323
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,409
you might focus on the fists.

324
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,180
But they say that you box with your legs.

325
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,039
Footwork is very important.

326
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,879
Your feet must keep moving so that you can avoid getting hit...

327
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,079
and hit the opponent well.

328
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,519
So jump roping is a must.

329
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,749
It's something you need to do.

330
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,119
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,549
I'll show you.

332
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,650
- Okay.
- All right.

333
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,020
(Expectant)

334
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,659
- A professional's jump roping.
- Watch.

335
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,030
This is how you do single unders.

336
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,460
- Okay.
- Jump rope like this.

337
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,629
Now, do it to the rhythm.

338
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,259
One, two.

339
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,760
(2. Rhythmic jump roping)

340
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,970
Do it to the rhythm like this.

341
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,869
Do it to the rhythm.

342
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,469
I really wanted to try it.

343
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,299
When you're used to it...

344
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,109
- What?
- One, two. Do it like this.

345
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
(3. High knees)

346
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:20,339
- His calves...
- He must've done this a lot.

347
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,379
- Like this.
- It must be exhausting.

348
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,480
The most important thing is that your knees...

349
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,879
- need to come up high.
- They need to come up.

350
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,180
It looks so hard.

351
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,249
Then comes the double unders.

352
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,249
(4. Double unders)

353
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,520
Do double unders like this.

354
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,860
Gosh, what's this?

355
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,559
It looks like he's doing single unders.

356
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,899
(He moves his feet gently as if he's doing single unders.)

357
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,470
(Her jaw drops.)

358
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,229
Since he has done this every day...

359
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,569
Now, you'll begin to jump rope.

360
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,669
The time limit is three minutes.

361
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,169
- Is three minutes all I need to do?
- Yes.

362
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,179
In a boxing match, a round is 1 minute and 30 seconds long.

363
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,540
From my experience,

364
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,480
I can say that only half of what you can do during practice...

365
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,080
comes out during the match.

366
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,080
Thus, each round will be three minutes long.

367
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,449
Three minutes per round?

368
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,519
There'll be three rounds.

369
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,589
Okay.

370
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,689
Get ready.

371
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,790
This is Round One.

372
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,359
Go.

373
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,429
(Round 1, Single unders)

374
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,590
Looks good.

375
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,799
Uie, you're doing great.

376
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,960
You're doing it steadily.

377
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,269
You're very good.

378
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,270
(You're good.)

379
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,040
In Ah, you're doing it very steadily.

380
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,310
(A model example of jump roping without any flaws)

381
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,579
(Ju Hyun has weak calves.)

382
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,679
My calves. What am I going to do?

383
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,019
(The jump rope keeps getting caught in her feet.)

384
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,549
Your heels shouldn't touch the ground.

385
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,519
(Standing next to her, )

386
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,489
(Sae Rok keeps tripping over the rope.)

387
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,829
Sae Rok,

388
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,089
jump a bit higher.

389
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,859
Jump a bit higher.

390
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,159
You keep tripping because of your jump.

391
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,799
Jump a bit higher.

392
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,930
Use the front of the feet.

393
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,869
(They jump rope for 3 minutes without stopping...)

394
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,809
(to strengthen their legs.)

395
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,239
- Gosh, why...
- My calves.

396
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,370
What's the problem?

397
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,210
Okay. At ease.

398
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,910
Well done.

399
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,909
(Deep breaths)

400
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,050
I mean... My goodness.

401
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,950
(Hanging her head)

402
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:12,089
I don't know what the problem is.

403
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,090
(Why do I keep tripping?)

404
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,719
(It wasn't easy to jump rope for 3 minutes.)

405
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,659
All right, Everyone, get ready. Five seconds remain.

406
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,159
Everyone, get ready. Five seconds remain.

407
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,229
- What?
- What?

408
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,560
Thirty seconds pass quickly.

409
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,169
Go.

410
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,400
(The 30-second break is over!)

411
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,529
The rhythm.

412
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,869
Jump to the rhythm.

413
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,870
One, two.

414
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,339
(Round 2, Rhythmic jump roping)

415
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,569
One, two.

416
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,409
(Jumping on one foot twice at a time)

417
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,579
In Ah, you're doing great.

418
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,650
Your entire foot should touch the floor.

419
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,480
There you go. Your feet should touch the floor.

420
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,820
Your feet should touch the floor.

421
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,089
That's good. Uie, you're doing great.

422
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,420
In Ah, you're doing great too.

423
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,520
Uie and In Ah are doing great.

424
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,890
(They jump in a stable way.)

425
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,800
One, two.

426
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,229
(Her counting is thorough, but her movements aren't.)

427
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,539
Hold on. The one next to me is doing something strange.

428
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,040
Do what you can do. It's okay.

429
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,839
- Everyone learns differently.
- One, two.

430
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,439
(Like a newborn giraffe, )

431
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,709
(she takes one step at a time.)

432
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,740
- One, two.
- There you go.

433
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,339
- One, two.
- Okay. Good.

434
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,650
One, two.

435
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,279
- I'm fascinated...
- One, two.

436
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,949
- that Sae Rok isn't tripping.
- Right.

437
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,989
Have you seen anyone jump rope like that?

438
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,550
No, it's my first time too.

439
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,789
I'm fascinated that she isn't tripping.

440
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,159
(An extraordinary talent)

441
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,629
It's time to do high knees.

442
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,660
Oh, no.

443
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,029
- How do I raise my knees?
- Do this with your knees.

444
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,359
(The key is raising the knees.)

445
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,659
- Do we keep going?
- Yes. Like this.

446
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,169
- High knees. Ten seconds.
- Get ready.

447
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,230
High knees.

448
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,940
- High knees.
- High knees.

449
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,869
(She goes at full speed as soon as she begins.)

450
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,140
There you go.

451
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,569
That's good.

452
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,140
(She raises her knees as much as she can.)

453
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,910
Okay. That's good.

454
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,340
(Let me do it too!)

455
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,010
(Big steps)

456
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,619
It's my first time seeing someone do high knees like that.

457
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,549
(The baby giraffe's steps became bigger.)

458
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,750
(Grunting)

459
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,289
(Remaining time: 5 seconds)

460
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,019
High knees. Keep going until the end.

461
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,359
Keep going until the end.

462
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,390
(Remaining time: 1 second)

463
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,660
Okay. Well done.

464
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,130
Can they lie down now?

465
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,170
I've spent nearly 20 years in the gym.

466
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,669
I can't even copy the moves.

467
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,739
This is...

468
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,769
- Who did that?
- What?

469
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,770
(Sae Rok did.)

470
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,639
Get ready. Two seconds remain.

471
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,679
- Let's go.
- Right away.

472
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,780
Round Three is the last one.

473
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,010
The last one.

474
00:16:18,137 --> 00:16:19,836
Round Three is double unders. Let's go.

475
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,436
- I can't do double unders.
- Seriously.

476
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,776
Do double unders rhythmically.

477
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:24,207
- In Ah, you're good.
- There you go.

478
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:25,646
Okay. That's good.

479
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:26,906
In Ah is incredible.

480
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:27,916
(Passing 1 time)

481
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,177
(Passing 2 times)

482
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,986
(She succeeds in it repeatedly after getting the hang of it.)

483
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:32,117
Have you done it before?

484
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,257
In Ah, you did an amazing job.

485
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:35,817
That was great.

486
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,857
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun and Uie also succeed in it.)

487
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,157
I can't do them consecutively.

488
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,097
(She still jumps diligently.)

489
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,466
They're improving in no time.

490
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,996
They're improving in no time during practice.

491
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:48,196
Everyone is doing well.

492
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,337
- Wrap up with high knees.
- High knees.

493
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,807
My goodness.

494
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:56,507
(They jump rope in their own creative ways.)

495
00:16:56,777 --> 00:16:58,777
Okay. Well done.

496
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:00,207
Seriously.

497
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:02,946
There were various poses.

498
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,787
(Everyone is exhausted.)

499
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,687
(Standing tall by herself)

500
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,087
I saw a variety of things.

501
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:10,617
By the way,

502
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:13,386
In Ah, do you jump rope often?

503
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:14,526
I've done it in elementary school.

504
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:15,796
(Sports Genius, Seol In Ah)

505
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:17,496
- She has athletic ability.
- It's so nice.

506
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,697
- It's no joke, right?
- Yes.

507
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,597
Why is everyone good at it?

508
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:23,197
Why is everyone good at it except for me?

509
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,367
Sae Rok, who are you mad at?

510
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:26,906
(Smiling)

511
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,136
Are you mad at yourself...

512
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:29,376
- or us?
- Me.

513
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,647
I know how you feel.

514
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,576
- No one has done boxing before.
- That's right.

515
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:35,916
It's natural to struggle with this training.

516
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,547
But people did better than expected.

517
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:39,946
You could think, "I'm the only one who's bad at this."

518
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:41,486
- It's natural to do badly.
- That's right.

519
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:42,516
Don't worry about your jump roping skills.

520
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:44,086
- They'll improve the fastest.
- Okay.

521
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:46,256
Now, the warmup is over.

522
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:47,957
Let's begin boxing in earnest.

523
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,456
What's the most important thing?

524
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:51,897
(What's the most important thing in boxing?)

525
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:53,967
They are covering and footwork.

526
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:58,207
Covering and footwork are the basic moves in boxing.

527
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:01,406
It may seem like you're fighting with your hands,

528
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,337
but boxing is all about footwork.

529
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:04,976
Now that's a quote.

530
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:08,747
It's because you take a step to hit your opponent,

531
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:11,747
and your opponent takes a step back to avoid getting hit.

532
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:14,116
It's a constant battle of stepping in and stepping back.

533
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,117
- I see.
- Right.

534
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,627
First, position your feet diagonally...

535
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:19,327
and shoulder-width apart.

536
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:23,056
And make sure your right heel is always lifted.

537
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:25,397
(Keep the heel of your back foot off the ground at all times.)

538
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,927
If you lift it like this,

539
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,497
your weight will naturally shift forward.

540
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,467
So push it back again.

541
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,607
- You'll keep feeling tension here.
- Yes.

542
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,406
Then turn your head like this.

543
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,606
(Keep facing forward.)

544
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,977
Yes. That's it.

545
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,247
Now raise your arm like this.

546
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,317
And lift your other arm like this. Make sure they are parallel.

547
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,147
Keep your elbows close to your body.

548
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:50,316
Don't let your arms spread out like this.

549
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,826
They shouldn't form a triangular shape.

550
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,256
(Make sure your arms don't spread out.)

551
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,527
They should never look like this.

552
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,227
The moment a triangle is shaped,

553
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,496
your opponent can hit you here like this.

554
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:00,597
Goodness.

555
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,297
That's how you get taken by surprise.

556
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:05,166
And if you look at my arm, my fist isn't here.

557
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,566
- It's out here.
- Yes.

558
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:07,907
It's spaced out.

559
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,036
- Practice putting your fist here.
- Out here.

560
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:11,346
Train your arm to look like this.

561
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,576
So our arms should look like this for the basic position?

562
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:16,046
Yes. That way, when you're sparring,

563
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,247
your opponent wouldn't be able to attack you easily.

564
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,256
Let me explain. When you're fighting,

565
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,416
If you have your hands inside, it's convenient for me to attack.

566
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,556
- It's easier.
- But...

567
00:19:24,557 --> 00:19:25,986
if my opponent has his hand out here,

568
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,357
I become wary that he could attack me as I move about,

569
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,026
- which doesn't help my focus.
- And even when you're attacked,

570
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,896
you can defend yourself like this.

571
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:34,097
You can defend yourself and attack right away, too.

572
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,436
So this lead hand is very important.

573
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,807
(You can go from blocking to attacking instantly.)

574
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,767
When it comes to the fundamentals,

575
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,537
footwork plays a crucial role.

576
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:44,647
But when it comes to striking, the one-two is essential.

577
00:19:45,347 --> 00:19:47,006
You've probably heard people say "one-two."

578
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:48,976
That's "one-two."

579
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,847
(A basic striking technique involving a cross-arm punch.)

580
00:19:51,947 --> 00:19:53,646
(The highlight of boxing)

581
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:57,057
(The one-two punch)

582
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,587
- One-two.
- That was his chance!

583
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,096
He's going in hard again.

584
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,126
(Where boxing ends and begins)

585
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,767
(The one-two punch)

586
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,967
Now, it's time to practice the jab.

587
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,737
Let's begin with some footwork. We'll start with stationary steps.

588
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:13,707
Bring your guard up.

589
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,037
Yes, step like this.

590
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:18,977
On the downward motion of the step,

591
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:25,687
jab.

592
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:27,757
Tuck your chin slightly...

593
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,317
and keep your eyes on your opponent.

594
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,417
Jab.

595
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:32,026
(Practicing the fundamentals thoroughly)

596
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,127
That's it.

597
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:34,827
Good.

598
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,127
Nice posture.

599
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:38,927
Close to your face. That's right.

600
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,797
(Captain Kim is helping them get the hang of it.)

601
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:45,407
You have a strong punch.

602
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,267
Try hitting here.

603
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:49,777
Move forward. Hit as you step forward.

604
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:53,776
Stop.

605
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,677
Coach, we forgot something.

606
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:58,587
I think we should teach them how to make a fist first.

607
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:01,656
This is how Ju Hyun makes a fist.

608
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,356
I was taken aback when I saw her.

609
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,157
- Her thumb kept hitting my palm.
- I see.

610
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,326
- That could injure her thumb.
- Okay.

611
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,327
Yes, you're right.

612
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,826
You shouldn't put your thumb like this.

613
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:12,096
- Like this?
- Don't do this.

614
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:13,597
You have to do this.

615
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:16,266
Curl your thumb in like this.

616
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,467
- Curl the thumb in?
- Yes, curl your thumb in.

617
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:21,607
When you hit someone, which part of your fist should you use?

618
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,276
The middle finger? Or here?

619
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:24,277
The third one?

620
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,107
- The first and second ones.
- I got it right.

621
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,146
These two are called knuckles.

622
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,946
(Using these two nodules is called a "knuckle punch.")

623
00:21:30,947 --> 00:21:32,586
In the beginning,

624
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,087
you'll probably be using these ones in the back.

625
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:38,187
So we'll start with the back and move your strike point to the front.

626
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,996
When you punch the opponent, depending on which knuckle,

627
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,727
it's a 1-week immobilization, 2 weeks, serious injury, and death.

628
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:47,467
- Gosh.
- Practice moving your strike point.

629
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:48,767
You've got a lot more wise quotes...

630
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,537
than I expected you to have.

631
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:54,236
I've never heard of that before.

632
00:21:54,237 --> 00:21:55,576
- "One week, two weeks," - "Two weeks."

633
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:57,877
- "serious injury, and death." - "serious injury, and death."

634
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,277
(Thinking)

635
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,446
- I have a question. When I jab, - Yes.

636
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,246
Do I just lower my arm like this?

637
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:05,646
That's a good question.

638
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:07,687
- That move resembles an axe chop.
- Yes.

639
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:10,387
You extend your arm and retract it slightly like this.

640
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,027
Then you extend it back out.

641
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:13,687
So it feels more like extending the arm.

642
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:16,196
There's a saying. "You can conquer the world with a single jab."

643
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:17,826
- That's how important it is.
- Wait.

644
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,526
- Stop.
- Wait.

645
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,196
Stop. Even I can't take it seriously now.

646
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:23,166
- I'm serious.
- And I'm a person who likes quotes.

647
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:25,436
There's a saying that goes "Start with a jab, end with a jab."

648
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:27,207
- It's a famous quote.
- He's taking it up a notch.

649
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:28,637
He gave us one more.

650
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:31,076
(In Ah is knocked down from the barrage of wise quotes.)

651
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:32,676
I'm not making this up.

652
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:35,047
Coach, you really love your quotes.

653
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:38,147
What he said is really important, though.

654
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,346
Jabbing is how you control your distance with the opponent.

655
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,387
And you have to jab first to punch with the other hand.

656
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,826
- You can't strike without the jab.
- That's how essential it is.

657
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:46,226
- Okay.
- The jab.

658
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:48,527
We've covered the jab. Now for the right hand.

659
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:51,266
You throw a straight with your right hand.

660
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,466
That's called the straight punch.

661
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,796
Coach, do I just extend my arm here too?

662
00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:55,936
- Look at me.
- Like this?

663
00:22:55,937 --> 00:22:58,907
Look at my legs and right hand.

664
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:02,937
- You twist your body.
- Yes.

665
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,076
Straighten both your front and back legs,

666
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,107
then rotate your hips.

667
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:08,976
Boxing involves cross-body movements.

668
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,816
Each punch crosses over the other.

669
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,446
He's giving you important pointers.

670
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,816
You keep stressing how important it is, and that's helping me focus.

671
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:16,657
Now, let's move on to the hook.

672
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,927
You know the hooks used in fishing?

673
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,226
- That's where the term comes from.
- The hooks?

674
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:25,427
This is the most basic angle of the hook.

675
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:27,936
And you can extend your arm more like this.

676
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:29,336
(Sometimes, fighters use a long hook.)

677
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:31,036
- Depends on where the opponent is.
- Depends on where the opponent is.

678
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,666
Your chin should always be tucked close to your punching arm.

679
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,006
You don't have to tuck your chin too deep. Just slightly.

680
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,037
You have to protect your chin.

681
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:39,347
Critical nerves are concentrated in the chin.

682
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,976
- Over here.
- Yes. So when people get hit here,

683
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:43,676
most of them can't get back up.

684
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:44,747
Would that be a KO?

685
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:47,617
(During a real match)

686
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,557
(The fighter got knocked out after getting punched in his chin.)

687
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:57,297
(That's how powerful a hook can be.)

688
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:00,427
(Like this?)

689
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:02,966
This is what it looks like to me.

690
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,606
It looks like it comes upward from below.

691
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:07,136
It's not meant to swing like this, right?

692
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:08,637
In Ah, what you're asking is...

693
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:11,146
if you're supposed to swing like this, right?

694
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:12,206
Your swing has to be as short as possible.

695
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,777
You have to keep it short.

696
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:16,747
Keep it tight. Even your uppercut.

697
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,047
Every punch should be short.

698
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,947
Keep all of them short.

699
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:22,686
That's scary.

700
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:23,687
(Goodness)

701
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:25,757
That's scary.

702
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,626
That's how you throw fast, sudden punches...

703
00:24:28,627 --> 00:24:30,526
- and knock out your opponent.
- You'll get there too.

704
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:31,527
He said we could do it too.

705
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,267
I'll teach you the footwork now.

706
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:34,837
Watch.

707
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:39,307
Jab. One, two, hook, two.

708
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,507
Backstep. One, two.

709
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:46,147
- Jab. One, two.
- Jab. One, two.

710
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,216
- Hook, two.
- Hook, two.

711
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:49,247
Backstep.

712
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,687
As you move back... As you step back out, one-two.

713
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:53,287
Step back out and one-two.

714
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,417
One, two. That's right.

715
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,257
(Got it.)

716
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:59,927
- Jab. One, two.
- Jab. One, two.

717
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:01,997
- Hook, two.
- Hook, two. Jab. One, two.

718
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,097
Jab. One, two. Gosh.

719
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:06,766
It would be even better if you hunched your body a bit.

720
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,637
(Mirror image)

721
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,506
Gosh, In Ah.

722
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:15,776
(Simba Seol instantly got the hang of it.)

723
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:16,777
Jab.

724
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:20,677
(Rocky Keum is all set too.)

725
00:25:21,247 --> 00:25:26,817
(Jab. One, two, hook, two, backstep, one, two.)

726
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:28,817
Did I skip something?

727
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:31,256
One, two. That's it. You're doing good.

728
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:34,126
Jab. One, two, hook.

729
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,897
Jab, one, two, hook.

730
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:38,597
- Backstep. One, two.
- One, two. Hook.

731
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:41,797
(Being new to this, her hands and words aren't quite in sync yet.)

732
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:44,937
Simba Seol, you've gotten even better already.

733
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,836
This is incredible.

734
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,476
Remember when you started earlier.

735
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:50,676
You didn't know any of the steps.

736
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:52,246
(They're cramming in 2 weeks of learning into 1 day.)

737
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,547
Ju Hyun, your posture is...

738
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:57,676
(Though it's tough, each of the Iron Girls...)

739
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,287
You're doing good. You've got 30 seconds left.

740
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:02,056
(train diligently in their own ways.)

741
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:04,827
One, two. Extend your arms.

742
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:07,187
(The moment the round bell rings)

743
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:08,257
Nice.

744
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:09,797
Good job.

745
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:10,827
(Falling to the floor)

746
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:13,567
(Panting)

747
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,537
I don't have the energy to step back out again.

748
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,707
(The Iron Girls are worn out because...)

749
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:23,076
(they did 1 hour of various physical tests, )

750
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:25,906
(3 rounds of 3-minute jump rope, )

751
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:27,576
(3 rounds of 3-minute basic step training, )

752
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:28,916
(3 rounds of 3-minute jab training, )

753
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,346
(3 rounds of 3-minute straight punch training, )

754
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:31,787
(and 3 rounds of 3-minute hook training.)

755
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:36,657
(And the hardcore coach tirelessly spoke of wise quotes.)

756
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:39,887
(They've been exercising for four hours.)

757
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:42,826
- We'll end with the hook.
- All right.

758
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:44,357
Great job, everyone. Seriously.

759
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:46,067
Thank you for your hard work.

760
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,137
Thank you for your hard work.

761
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,236
- Thank you for your hard work.
- So today, you guys...

762
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:52,937
will play a bonus game.

763
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:54,637
A bonus game.

764
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:57,737
You guys did so well that you've learned so much today.

765
00:26:57,937 --> 00:26:59,506
But we need clear results.

766
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,447
- Who wants that bonus?
- Me.

767
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:04,077
- Can we not take the bonus?
- Who doesn't want the bonus?

768
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,946
- Let's go home.
- Who doesn't want the bonus?

769
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,457
You have to consider this.

770
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:13,056
While you're doing this, your opponents are training hard.

771
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,086
(Coach Kim Ji Hoon's Quote Number 5)

772
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,296
(While we're taking a break, our opponents are still training.)

773
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:17,326
- Coach, our opponents...
- Your opponents...

774
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:18,626
are already done.

775
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,396
I'm serious. Then...

776
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:21,766
The coach is far from ordinary.

777
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,466
(I can't believe all of this was our first training.)

778
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,107
I want to go home.

779
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:28,276
- We don't have time.
- That's right.

780
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:30,077
You may be exhausted and struggling now,

781
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,146
but when you're gloved up and working the mitts,

782
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:33,907
you'll feel your passion coming back.

783
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,577
(A bonus session...)

784
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:37,617
(will unfold in the ring.)

785
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:40,016
You can experience how long...

786
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:41,987
three minutes can feel.

787
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:44,457
(Jabbing)

788
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,757
- It feels different.
- First,

789
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:49,656
you'll each get a round with the coach,

790
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:50,726
so make the most of it.

791
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:51,996
You throw the jab here,

792
00:27:51,997 --> 00:27:53,327
and the straight here.

793
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:57,237
(Will the rookie be able to last 3 minutes in the ring?)

794
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:58,967
- You got this!
- I got this!

795
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:00,606
You got this!

796
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:02,036
Jab.

797
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,137
One, two.

798
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:05,577
(Straight punch, check!)

799
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,747
- Jab. One, two.
- Nice eyes.

800
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:12,546
(She's got the eyes of a professional boxer already.)

801
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:14,046
One, two, hook, two. Backstep. One, two.

802
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:16,186
(Now, it's time to show off her hook.)

803
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,986
- Backstep. One, two. Nice.
- You're doing great!

804
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,586
Jab. One, two, hook, two,

805
00:28:20,587 --> 00:28:22,127
backstep, one, two.

806
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:23,397
Finish off the one-two. Come on.

807
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,167
Come on. Let's go.

808
00:28:26,867 --> 00:28:28,896
(The hardcore coach is back at it again.)

809
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:29,897
No breaks.

810
00:28:30,097 --> 00:28:31,097
- Go ahead.
- She only...

811
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:34,566
- has one minute left.
- Jab. One, two, hook...

812
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,836
(Non-stop mitt work)

813
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:36,876
- One, two. Hook.
- You're doing great.

814
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:38,946
Nice. Show the hook precisely.

815
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:40,406
One, two. Hook. Nice.

816
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:41,876
- Nice.
- One, two.

817
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,316
One, two. Hook.

818
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:44,476
(Both hands landed clean and precise.)

819
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:45,746
Nice. Keep going!

820
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:47,246
- You got ten seconds left.
- Ten seconds. Give it your all.

821
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,286
- Give it your all.
- Ten seconds.

822
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:49,487
You're almost there.

823
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:52,356
Jab. One, two, hook, two. That's it.

824
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,627
(She's pouring all her remaining strength into this.)

825
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:56,957
You got this!

826
00:28:57,057 --> 00:28:58,967
You got this!

827
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,426
One, two.

828
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:01,636
Knockout!

829
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:02,937
One, two.

830
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:06,436
(After throwing her final punch, )

831
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:09,606
(Sae Rok goes down gloriously.)

832
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:10,976
If you collapse like that at the end,

833
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,446
it gives your opponent a boost of energy. You can't.

834
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,846
He's right. That's why you can't show that kind of weakness.

835
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,316
If you act like this after a round,

836
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:18,486
your opponent would think,

837
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:19,716
- "She's totally worn out." - Right.

838
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,987
- "She's completely exhausted." - "Keep pushing."

839
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,256
Our goal from now on...

840
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:25,587
will be working the mitt for three minutes without resting.

841
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:26,787
- Okay.
- Good.

842
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:27,887
All right. Next.

843
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,227
Last three minutes!

844
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:31,226
- This is the last session.
- Come on, Park Ju Hyun.

845
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,726
- You can do this. Okay.
- You're a fighter.

846
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,197
Jab. One, two. Begin.

847
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:37,096
(Will Ju Hyun be able to last 3 minutes?)

848
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:39,307
Jab. One, two.

849
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:41,807
(Steady steps)

850
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,076
Yes. Nice footwork.

851
00:29:43,077 --> 00:29:44,537
One, two. Good. Hit harder.

852
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:46,907
- Imagine my face on the mitts.
- Jab. One, two.

853
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,517
- Jab. One, two.
- Ju Hyun's footwork is great.

854
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,786
(It's been 1 minute.)

855
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,287
Now, one, two, hook, two. Jab.

856
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:56,517
(Sighing)

857
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:58,626
- One, two, hook, two.
- One minute down.

858
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,687
Backstep. One, two. Finish the one-two.

859
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:02,896
(She musters her strength and throws a hook.)

860
00:30:02,897 --> 00:30:04,427
- One, two. Nice.
- Nice!

861
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,597
- Okay. You should...
- You got this!

862
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:07,967
(Come on, left arm!)

863
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,436
- You got this.
- You should practice the footwork.

864
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:11,396
- You got this!
- You got this!

865
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:12,936
Ju Hyun, keep going!

866
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,066
One, two. That's good.

867
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:15,607
Now, one, two. Hook. Jab.

868
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:17,276
- Jab. One, two.
- Jab.

869
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:18,746
Hook. Nice.

870
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:19,747
One, two.

871
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:22,076
- Jab.
- Jab. One, two, hook.

872
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,447
- Nice one.
- That hook was amazing.

873
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:24,886
She has the best look.

874
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:26,417
(She's exhausted but still throws a precise hook.)

875
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:27,786
Jab.

876
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:30,657
(Ju Hyun remains focused until the very end.)

877
00:30:30,757 --> 00:30:32,526
- One last set.
- One last set.

878
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:36,297
(Ju Hyun's 3 minutes are over.)

879
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,126
One, two. Nice.

880
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,127
(Even though the round bell rang, )

881
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,196
Good job.

882
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,667
(she kept going.)

883
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,436
One, two. Nice.

884
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,437
(Worn out)

885
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:48,376
Your opponent is watching you.

886
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,477
(Bluffing)

887
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:54,247
Your opponent is watching you.

888
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:56,017
- Act like you're fine.
- Good job.

889
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,946
She's so funny.

890
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,687
I love her.

891
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,917
- Good job.
- Catch your breath.

892
00:31:04,387 --> 00:31:06,156
Good. You did great, but...

893
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:09,057
What did you think of Ju Hyun's round?

894
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:10,657
- First...
- Her hook was...

895
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,326
She didn't guard her face well.

896
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:14,366
You're right.

897
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:15,996
She was too exhausted.

898
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,966
And because her energy was running low, her guard dropped.

899
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,067
She was like, "Hit me."

900
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,576
- This was...
- She did well.

901
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:24,876
Just holding my fists up felt heavy.

902
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,346
- So...
- My hands kept falling like this.

903
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:28,317
In Ju Hyun's case,

904
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,346
she has good technique but low stamina,

905
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,717
- so she couldn't use them.
- Right.

906
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:34,646
Let's keep doing the physical training...

907
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:36,616
until you can use...

908
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:37,756
- all the techniques you have.
- Okay.

909
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:39,087
Mitt work...

910
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:40,587
is fun.

911
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:42,196
It kind of fires me up.

912
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,256
Look at her eyes.

913
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,296
I keep wanting to hear that sound.

914
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:46,766
- The slapping sound.
- Right.

915
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:49,097
The way the mitts feel against my fists.

916
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:51,566
- If you...
- I'll stay in the ring from now on.

917
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:53,636
- If you improve from here and...
- I'll train down there and...

918
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,976
reach the level where the person holding the mitts starts sweating,

919
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:57,776
- it feels even more amazing.
- Look at my hands shaking.

920
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,806
Okay, next. Are you ready?

921
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,007
- Yes.
- Let's begin.

922
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:02,546
Jab. One, two.

923
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,816
(How will Uie endure the full 3 minutes?)

924
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:06,116
- She's amazing.
- One, two.

925
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,916
- Her arms are so long.
- Jab.

926
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,056
- One, two.
- She's good.

927
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,016
- Jab. One, two.
- What?

928
00:32:11,017 --> 00:32:12,226
She has a long reach.

929
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:13,427
(She has a long reach.)

930
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:15,126
- Hit him in the side.
- Jab.

931
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:16,156
One, two.

932
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,856
- Uie, one minute down.
- Nice.

933
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:18,926
Now, one, two, hook, two.

934
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,126
(She now practices the hook.)

935
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:21,567
One, two, hook, two.

936
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:25,606
(Her arm wasn't bent properly.)

937
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,436
One, two, hook, two.

938
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:28,706
It's not about moving fast.

939
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:30,037
- Jab.
- Jab.

940
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:32,076
(Retry)

941
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,246
Hook.

942
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:34,707
One, two. Hook.

943
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:36,646
Why aren't your hooks working?

944
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:37,677
(Uie's arm is still not bending at all.)

945
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:39,086
- One, two. Hook.
- Gosh, my hooks are way off.

946
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,386
- This is your last minute.
- Jab.

947
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:41,756
One, two, hook, two.

948
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:42,987
(Uie is not turning her waist as she punches.)

949
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:44,416
One, two, hook, two.

950
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,227
(Sae Rok's waist turned fully.)

951
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:47,826
- Hook.
- Nice.

952
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,226
- Jab.
- See?

953
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,626
- One, two. Hook.
- I told you...

954
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:51,826
that you won't be able to...

955
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,366
- perform the way you practiced.
- Jab.

956
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:54,497
- That's how it usually is.
- One, two.

957
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:57,596
Jab. One, two, hook, two.

958
00:32:57,597 --> 00:32:58,936
(She clenches her jaw and keeps trying.)

959
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,007
You've got ten seconds left.

960
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,107
Jab. One, two, hook, two.

961
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:05,406
One, two. Okay.

962
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:06,446
(Like the Stamina Queen she is, )

963
00:33:06,447 --> 00:33:07,477
(she lasted 3 minutes without a break.)

964
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,177
Gosh, I can't throw a proper hook.

965
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:10,346
No, you can't.

966
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:11,616
- Your arms don't bend.
- I can't do a hook.

967
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:12,946
- I can't figure it out.
- That's why...

968
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,287
you have to practice the hook a lot.

969
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,056
- The lion.
- You've got this, Simba Seol.

970
00:33:17,057 --> 00:33:18,187
- You got this!
- You got this!

971
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,327
This is going to be fun!

972
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:22,596
Begin. Jab.

973
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:23,756
One, two.

974
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,197
- Goodness.
- Jab. One, two.

975
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:29,666
(Strong In Ah is here for you. Her punches sound different.)

976
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,067
She's so strong.

977
00:33:31,437 --> 00:33:33,166
- One, two, hook, two.
- How is this her first day?

978
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,007
(It's time for the hook.)

979
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:36,577
- One, two.
- Now.

980
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,677
- How is this her first day?
- Jab. One, two, hook, two.

981
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:41,046
One, two, hook, two.

982
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:43,417
(A hook with a perfect 90-degree angle)

983
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:44,576
This is your last minute.

984
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:46,617
Now, it's time for one, two. Hook. Jab.

985
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,756
(You got this, In Ah!)

986
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:50,086
Jab.

987
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:51,456
- One, two. Hook.
- You've got 40 seconds.

988
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:53,187
- That's it.
- Gosh.

989
00:33:53,987 --> 00:33:55,556
(Her left hook is perfect.)

990
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:57,296
(Her right hook is also perfect.)

991
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:58,697
- That's it.
- Gosh.

992
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,306
(She mastered it in just one day.)

993
00:34:05,307 --> 00:34:06,637
One, two. Nice.

994
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,307
Her hook is amazing.

995
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:10,406
(Simba Seol is a boxing ace.)

996
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:11,946
- One, two. Nice.
- Your opponent's worn out.

997
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,706
- Your opponent's worn out!
- He's worn out!

998
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:15,246
- Jab.
- Harder!

999
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:16,717
One, two. Hook.

1000
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,887
- One, two.
- Okay.

1001
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:20,687
Your opponent's watching.

1002
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:21,987
Your opponent's watching!

1003
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,857
Your opponent's watching right now.

1004
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:25,386
Okay. You got this.

1005
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:27,057
- "I can go for more rounds easily." - Good job.

1006
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:30,157
- Gosh, her hook.
- That was really sexy.

1007
00:34:30,227 --> 00:34:32,467
- Give me your gloves.
- I'm exhausted.

1008
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:34,366
- Great job.
- Now,

1009
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,566
let's hear a few words from you and we'll wrap up.

1010
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,337
I've found my talent.

1011
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:40,666
This is so fun for me.

1012
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:44,637
My parents should have sent me to boxing class, not taekwondo.

1013
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:47,846
- That's what made you who you are.
- Of course.

1014
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:50,616
Today, I've realized that...

1015
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:52,946
I have to find ways...

1016
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,246
to strengthen...

1017
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:56,657
my legs and lower body muscles.

1018
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:58,756
(Groaning)

1019
00:34:58,757 --> 00:35:00,087
Gosh, my calves.

1020
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:02,827
I can't lift my heels.

1021
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:05,626
(Ju Hyun was struggling with leg pain...)

1022
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:07,197
(all throughout today's lesson.)

1023
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,267
(Strengthening her lower body is a must for her.)

1024
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:14,267
First, we started with the footwork.

1025
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:15,776
If you keep practicing your footwork,

1026
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:16,876
you'll get better.

1027
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,906
You'll get better, the more you practice.

1028
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:19,946
I realized...

1029
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:23,617
I won't be going down before my opponent does.

1030
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:25,286
- I agree.
- So,

1031
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:27,386
if I keep practicing the techniques,

1032
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,986
I think I'll have hope.

1033
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:32,787
People with strong stamina are the scariest of all.

1034
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:34,526
- All you need now is technique.
- Yes.

1035
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,826
- I'm looking forward to seeing it.
- Me too.

1036
00:35:35,827 --> 00:35:37,657
- Sae Rok?
- It was such a long day.

1037
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:39,696
- It was.
- It really was.

1038
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:41,696
- It was so long.
- Yes, six hours.

1039
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,236
Tomorrow, we begin training...

1040
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,266
(They'll be training again tomorrow.)

1041
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,066
at 11am again.

1042
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:47,367
We got this.

1043
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:49,437
She has given in.

1044
00:35:50,307 --> 00:35:53,576
I'm looking forward to seeing you grow.

1045
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:55,146
Yes, I'll show you.

1046
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:56,876
- Good.
- Okay. We got this!

1047
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,116
Whenever we finish a training session,

1048
00:35:58,117 --> 00:36:00,117
- we chant our slogan to wrap up.
- Sure.

1049
00:36:00,387 --> 00:36:01,416
- KO!
- KO!

1050
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,056
- Iron Girls!
- Iron Girls!

1051
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:05,116
(About 5 hours of training has ended.)

1052
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:07,357
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1053
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,957
- Let's get out of here!
- Hurry.

1054
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:11,257
I want to go home.

1055
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:12,366
(I want to go home.)

1056
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,367
Let's go.

1057
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:15,066
(One bright summer day)

1058
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:16,566
Let's go.

1059
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,307
- Today, what...
- It is going to be a brutal track.

1060
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:20,506
Do you remember this track?

1061
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:21,936
Yes, it was horrible.

1062
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:23,977
- We've run this track before.
- Right.

1063
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:25,646
- It was raining that day.
- Yes.

1064
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:26,907
(A sudden memory of last season's rainy run)

1065
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:29,777
Please help me. I'm scared already.

1066
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:31,747
This is huge.

1067
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:33,916
This is huge.

1068
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,047
(They hum their own background music.)

1069
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:38,157
- One, one, two. One, one, two.
- One.

1070
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:39,526
- What's up with you?
- Hook, two. Hook.

1071
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:40,587
(As boxers, they shadow box their way onto the field.)

1072
00:36:41,087 --> 00:36:43,056
Training outside is so nice, isn't it?

1073
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,326
Yes, it's refreshing.

1074
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,067
It's our first outdoor training in a while.

1075
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:48,267
- Did you put on sunscreen?
- Right, sunscreen.

1076
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:49,567
Sunscreen.

1077
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:50,937
Ta-da.

1078
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,666
- Do you remember this?
- I do.

1079
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,206
- Sae Rok, you might not know.
- I finished mine.

1080
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:57,836
We wore this last season,

1081
00:36:57,837 --> 00:36:59,747
- It's so convenient.
- It's very convenient,

1082
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:01,346
and it's not sticky.

1083
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:02,777
- Try it.
- It's so pretty.

1084
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,616
It doesn't get sticky at all,

1085
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,387
- even if you put on layers of this.
- Really?

1086
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:07,687
Yes, even your hair doesn't stick to your face.

1087
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,586
- Gosh, this is nice.
- It's really nice.

1088
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:11,257
- There is no stickiness left.
- None.

1089
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,256
It's so pretty.

1090
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:14,926
- Since we're outdoors a lot, - Thank you, Uie.

1091
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:17,457
We have to carry it around and reapply it throughout the day.

1092
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:18,696
- Thank you!
- All right?

1093
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:19,727
- Yes.
- Yes.

1094
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,066
We're outdoors for the first time in a while.

1095
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,706
But something feels missing.

1096
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,207
Why are there only the four of us?

1097
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:30,706
- Who are we training with today?
- Right.

1098
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:31,737
Why is there no one here?

1099
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:34,377
Gosh, let me head out.

1100
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,747
(Just then, someone approaches the Iron Girls.)

1101
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:42,287
(There's something familiar about the mysterious man.)

1102
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:43,857
There's a speaker.

1103
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:45,557
Are you going to play music?

1104
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:48,027
That would be great.

1105
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,096
(The secret guest tries to hide a little too late.)

1106
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:53,797
(What?)

1107
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:56,697
It's Heo Min Ho!

1108
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:01,867
(It's Heo Min Ho!)

1109
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,077
- Who’s feeling low on energy?
- Hi!

1110
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,877
- It's Heo Min Ho!
- Coach!

1111
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:10,847
(Today's guest coach, Heo Min Ho, whom the girls love)

1112
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:13,587
(He led them to complete the triathlon last season.)

1113
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,257
(He is the only triathlon Olympian representing Korea.)

1114
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:19,487
(He is the girls' best supporter.)

1115
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:22,297
(At times, he was harsh and intense.)

1116
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,497
(He was their first coach, who is sweet and tough.)

1117
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,466
- Hello.
- Hello.

1118
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,666
It's been so long.

1119
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:30,466
- Heo Min Ho!
- I can't believe it.

1120
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,607
- This is crazy.
- It's been so long.

1121
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:33,736
It's so good to see you.

1122
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:35,206
- How did you get more handsome?
- This is great.

1123
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:36,936
- Me?
- Yes, and you got a perm.

1124
00:38:36,937 --> 00:38:38,507
This? Don't get me wrong.

1125
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:40,977
I got this done first, and then I was invited.

1126
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:43,746
Have you all been well?

1127
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:45,386
It's been such a long time, Coach.

1128
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,046
Oh, this is our new member.

1129
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:49,757
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

1130
00:38:49,817 --> 00:38:50,856
I am Keum Sae Rok.

1131
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:52,687
- I am Heo Min Ho.
- You know him from the show, right?

1132
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:54,987
Why are you being shy? Which way are you looking?

1133
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:57,056
She just feels awkward.

1134
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:58,557
(They are still in the awkward stage.)

1135
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,097
- But Coach...
- Why did you...

1136
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:02,296
Why are you here when we're not doing the triathlon anymore?

1137
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,936
- Why did you come?
- What?

1138
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:04,937
Why did you come?

1139
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:06,466
Captain Kim asked me...

1140
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:09,236
to bring up your physical strength,

1141
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,376
so I was specially invited...

1142
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:12,406
- It's so nice to see you.
- over here.

1143
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:13,607
What we're doing today is...

1144
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:15,817
Have you heard of the shuttle run?

1145
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:17,846
- "Shuttle run?" - The shuttle run is...

1146
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:18,986
(What is the shuttle run?)

1147
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:22,157
when you run back and forth over a set distance...

1148
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,416
until you reach your limit.

1149
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,256
It's a back-and-forth long-distance running.

1150
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:28,686
- Also called BLR for short.
- BLR.

1151
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:30,896
Our national players do the shuttle run...

1152
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:32,667
in order to bring up their physical strength.

1153
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,467
(A must-do workout that the national soccer players do.)

1154
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,867
(As the levels increase, the time limit gets shorter, )

1155
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:41,607
(so it's also known for its dreaded beeping sound.)

1156
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:45,406
Shuttle runs are a mandatory part of the physical fitness exams...

1157
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:48,277
for fire and correctional officers these days.

1158
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:51,476
It's also in the physical fitness exams...

1159
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:53,086
of middle and high school students.

1160
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:54,786
Shuttle runs engage...

1161
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:57,716
various physical abilities,

1162
00:39:57,717 --> 00:39:59,886
so they’re really good for you.

1163
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:00,887
Like what?

1164
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:01,986
(In what aspect are they helpful?)

1165
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:05,196
With shuttle runs, when you run or box,

1166
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,197
lactic acid builds up in the body, causing fatigue.

1167
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:12,467
More lactic acid builds up when you do intense workouts.

1168
00:40:12,837 --> 00:40:14,866
If lactic acid builds up without being cleared,

1169
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,607
it reduces muscle contraction,

1170
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:18,977
which causes muscle pain and fatigue.

1171
00:40:19,147 --> 00:40:21,706
Do you know when you want to make one last punch, but you can't?

1172
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:23,716
- Yes.
- That's what this training is for.

1173
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:25,616
It's lactic acid tolerance training.

1174
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:28,517
We will do a training that will help withstand...

1175
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,816
lactic acid buildup.

1176
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:33,056
You will need to try to run one more lap.

1177
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,286
If you give up and say, "That's enough,"

1178
00:40:35,287 --> 00:40:36,826
then today's training won't have any effect.

1179
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:39,266
Okay, then why do you need to be the one...

1180
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:41,497
to teach us the shuttle runs? Are you good at it?

1181
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:42,966
- At shuttle runs?
- Yes.

1182
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,137
- You must not know.
- Coach.

1183
00:40:45,907 --> 00:40:46,907
(What is it?)

1184
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:48,907
Have you not seen it?

1185
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:52,676
I mean, I guess maybe...

1186
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,907
With Olympic medalists,

1187
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,377
national team players of various sports,

1188
00:40:57,547 --> 00:40:59,147
and Captain Kim,

1189
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,987
we had a shuttle run match, and I won first place,

1190
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,456
- Really?
- Yes.

1191
00:41:03,457 --> 00:41:04,687
Don't play the reference video.

1192
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:06,687
Just play it, so we can watch it together.

1193
00:41:07,557 --> 00:41:09,757
(Since he wanted it...)

1194
00:41:10,497 --> 00:41:12,627
(Among 44 leading athletes, )

1195
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:16,097
(he showed exceptional cardiovascular endurance...)

1196
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:18,567
(and won 1st place in the shuttle run.)

1197
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:21,966
- Come on. Why did you play it?
- He's so good.

1198
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:23,637
He's a complete entertainer now.

1199
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,646
Let's try and run today.

1200
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:26,676
- Great.
- Okay?

1201
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:27,906
- Are you confident?
- Yes.

1202
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,217
First of all,

1203
00:41:29,747 --> 00:41:32,717
we will try the firefighter style of shuttle run.

1204
00:41:33,047 --> 00:41:36,687
You will run 20m one way, not round-trip.

1205
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,387
(The first shuttle run that the Iron Girls will try)

1206
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:44,257
(Running 20m straight one way, paced by the beep)

1207
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:48,796
(Beep)

1208
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,837
Then you start.

1209
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:52,637
You will have to run to the other side.

1210
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:57,177
(If they get to the other line within the 3 beeps, )

1211
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,777
(they succeed the 1st lap.)

1212
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:01,407
Start right away.

1213
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,486
(When they return, they complete the 2nd lap.)

1214
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:09,216
Time will decrease as the level goes up.

1215
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:11,017
(The speed will get faster as the level goes up.)

1216
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:13,756
As the seconds shorten, you have to use more power,

1217
00:42:13,757 --> 00:42:15,287
so the lactic acid builds up faster.

1218
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:17,856
You have to push through that.

1219
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:20,426
(By pushing through, the body enhances its lactic acid tolerance.)

1220
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:22,236
(Firefighter Shuttle Run, Level 1:9 seconds, Level 2:8 seconds)

1221
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:23,897
(Level 3:7.5 seconds, Level 4:7 seconds, Level 5:6.7 seconds)

1222
00:42:23,997 --> 00:42:26,237
If you get over 43 laps, you get a perfect score.

1223
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:29,276
- 43 laps?
- If you get over 43 laps,

1224
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:31,437
then you get the perfect score on the firefighter fitness exam.

1225
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:33,706
- If you run 43 laps, - That means we can't do it.

1226
00:42:33,707 --> 00:42:34,877
It's 5 minutes and 40 seconds.

1227
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:36,746
You can get the perfect score.

1228
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:38,577
- No, I can't run fast.
- She can do it.

1229
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,286
Let me give you a tip.

1230
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:42,957
Shuttle runs are all about keeping the pace.

1231
00:42:43,157 --> 00:42:44,256
- Okay?
- Okay.

1232
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,387
- Okay?
- Okay.

1233
00:42:46,387 --> 00:42:48,087
- Do we start right away?
- Yes.

1234
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,726
It will be a problem when the time shortens.

1235
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:52,097
Yes, I'm worried about that.

1236
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:55,266
For the first lap, you need to run...

1237
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:57,066
and see how it goes.

1238
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:58,297
- Okay.
- Get a grasp of how it feels.

1239
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,106
You need to go all the way today...

1240
00:43:01,107 --> 00:43:03,436
in order to assess your physical fitness,

1241
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:04,806
- Yes, sir.
- so you need to do your best.

1242
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:06,546
Yes, sir!

1243
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:07,746
Okay, Ju Hyun?

1244
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:08,747
Yes, sir!

1245
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,077
(Even Childish Park gets pumped up.)

1246
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:12,487
On your marks...

1247
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:17,186
(The first shuttle run training)

1248
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:18,917
Start. That's it.

1249
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:21,526
(1st lap, 9 seconds)

1250
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:24,757
(Uie, In Ah, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

1251
00:43:27,497 --> 00:43:29,467
- What?
- Stand there.

1252
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,696
Start. That's it.

1253
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:34,837
(2nd lap, 9 seconds)

1254
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,537
- We need to run fast.
- It's a bit slow at first.

1255
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:39,606
It's quite fast.

1256
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:40,907
No, we're running quite fast.

1257
00:43:41,477 --> 00:43:42,816
(They only rest for a second.)

1258
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:43,977
(3rd lap, 9 seconds)

1259
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:46,887
(4th lap, 9 seconds, start again)

1260
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:48,087
Good posture.

1261
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:50,486
(The four members still have time to spare.)

1262
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:51,687
(4th lap, 9 seconds)

1263
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:52,956
(Uie, In Ah, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

1264
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:54,027
Great.

1265
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:56,527
You're going to be speaking less.

1266
00:43:57,097 --> 00:43:58,897
Start after you hear the signal.

1267
00:43:59,397 --> 00:44:02,697
(6th lap, 9 seconds)

1268
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:06,667
(They need to go all the way to improve their strength!)

1269
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,867
The time will shorten, now.

1270
00:44:09,307 --> 00:44:11,137
You ran seven laps now, and the time will shorten.

1271
00:44:11,437 --> 00:44:12,846
You need to speed up a bit.

1272
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:14,506
A bit faster than the last one.

1273
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:15,546
(They need to match the time, which is 1 second shorter!)

1274
00:44:15,547 --> 00:44:16,616
(8th lap, 8 seconds)

1275
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:17,646
That's it.

1276
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:19,716
(They all made the 8th lap.)

1277
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:22,617
(9th lap, 8 seconds)

1278
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:24,387
Gosh.

1279
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:27,957
Okay.

1280
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:29,296
Focus.

1281
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:30,597
(Their breathing gets heavier.)

1282
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:33,826
(10th lap, 8 seconds)

1283
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:34,966
(11th lap, 8 seconds)

1284
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,997
Great. Go until you can.

1285
00:44:37,437 --> 00:44:38,596
Keep going.

1286
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:40,566
(11th lap, 8 seconds)

1287
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,577
(They all barely pass, with 1 second left.)

1288
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,806
Okay. Mind your tempo.

1289
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,506
(Uie, In Ah, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

1290
00:44:46,507 --> 00:44:48,247
Don’t use too much strength at once.

1291
00:44:49,117 --> 00:44:51,317
(The buzzer keeps going non-stop.)

1292
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:53,546
(Sae Rok starts to fall behind.)

1293
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:55,286
You need to speed up, Sae Rok.

1294
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:57,016
(13th lap, 8 seconds)

1295
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:59,857
(They have to start again as soon as they come in.)

1296
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:01,156
Good job, Uie.

1297
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,496
(This is an important drill for Sae Rok, who is the weakest.)

1298
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:04,526
The time will shorten again, everyone.

1299
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:05,557
Gosh.

1300
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,226
(The time shortens on the 16th lap.)

1301
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,467
You need to get in fast.

1302
00:45:09,737 --> 00:45:11,896
(They need to bring up the pace.)

1303
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:13,136
(15th lap, 8 seconds)

1304
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:14,166
(Level 3 with 7.5 seconds begins)

1305
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,307
It's Level Three.

1306
00:45:15,637 --> 00:45:17,236
(Uie, In Ah, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun, 16th lap, 7.5 seconds)

1307
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:19,647
Level Three is 7.5 seconds. You need to hurry up.

1308
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:22,207
That's it.

1309
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:23,647
Faster.

1310
00:45:24,317 --> 00:45:27,747
(Sae Rok and Ju Hyun fall behind.)

1311
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,387
Start right away.

1312
00:45:30,257 --> 00:45:31,386
As much as you can.

1313
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:32,456
Just try one more.

1314
00:45:32,457 --> 00:45:33,526
Sae Rok, just one more.

1315
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:34,586
(Sae Rok begins the battle with herself.)

1316
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:36,257
(17th lap, 7.5 seconds)

1317
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:38,597
(She barely succeeded the 17th lap.)

1318
00:45:38,657 --> 00:45:40,727
Just one more.

1319
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:42,296
(Sae Rok shuts her eyes and tries to go on.)

1320
00:45:42,297 --> 00:45:43,466
Try to run one more.

1321
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:45,396
(Her breath sounds out of air.)

1322
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,436
(18th lap, 7.5 seconds, Sae Rok)

1323
00:45:47,437 --> 00:45:48,467
Step on the line.

1324
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,507
That's it. Just more last lap. It's the last one.

1325
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:53,446
(They have to start again without having time to catch their breath.)

1326
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:55,777
(Let's do just one more!)

1327
00:45:56,277 --> 00:45:58,547
(They can pass if they arrive.)

1328
00:45:58,677 --> 00:46:00,146
(Sae Rok, 19th lap, 7.5 seconds)

1329
00:46:00,147 --> 00:46:01,217
Focus.

1330
00:46:01,517 --> 00:46:03,917
(She barely passes the 19th lap.)

1331
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,287
Sae Rok, you're out.

1332
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:09,127
(Sae Rok's final record: 19 laps)

1333
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:12,827
(Her legs give out and she falls on the ground...)

1334
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,997
(She feels the sting of the BLR.)

1335
00:46:16,737 --> 00:46:19,267
(Still, Sae Rok didn't give up and she set her record.)

1336
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,567
Good job, Ju Hyun.

1337
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:22,837
Good job, In Ah.

1338
00:46:24,737 --> 00:46:27,046
Okay, this is Level 4. It's 7 seconds.

1339
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,147
The time is shorter. You need to run faster, Ju Hyun.

1340
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:30,716
My calves...

1341
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:31,846
(24th lap, 7 seconds)

1342
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:34,346
Okay, more. You need to focus.

1343
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:35,917
One more, Ju Hyun. Two more.

1344
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:38,687
(She's starting to struggle...)

1345
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:39,987
Okay.

1346
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:42,356
Good. Keep going as long as you can.

1347
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:43,526
(She puts all her energy into her legs.)

1348
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,856
Keep going as long as you can.

1349
00:46:44,857 --> 00:46:46,727
(Ju Hyun, 25th lap, 7 seconds)

1350
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:50,067
You need to do one more.

1351
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,166
(Ju Hyun, 27th lap, 7 seconds)

1352
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,337
You can do it.

1353
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,006
Start right away. That's it.

1354
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:56,076
(28th lap, Ju Hyun)

1355
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:57,206
Good.

1356
00:46:57,207 --> 00:46:58,376
(28th lap, 7 seconds)

1357
00:46:58,377 --> 00:46:59,907
In Ah and Uie, great tempo.

1358
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:03,246
(The death race rages.)

1359
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:04,547
One more. Run as fast as you can.

1360
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,946
Ju Hyun, one more.

1361
00:47:06,947 --> 00:47:08,047
(I will do one more.)

1362
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:09,387
Gosh, they are amazing.

1363
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,116
That's it, one more.

1364
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:13,287
(29th lap, 7 seconds)

1365
00:47:14,257 --> 00:47:16,696
One more. That's it. Good.

1366
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,957
(Keep going!)

1367
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:21,467
You can do it.

1368
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:23,767
That's it, one more. Go right away.

1369
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:27,367
(Go again!)

1370
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:28,606
(31st lap, 7 seconds, Ju Hyun)

1371
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:29,776
Listen to the sound.

1372
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:31,107
(Ju Hyun)

1373
00:47:31,637 --> 00:47:32,806
Ju Hyun, you're out.

1374
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:34,647
(Unfortunately, Ju Hyun did not pass.)

1375
00:47:35,877 --> 00:47:39,047
(Ju Hyun's final record: 30 laps)

1376
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,216
- You're amazing.
- Gosh.

1377
00:47:40,217 --> 00:47:41,687
(Ju Hyun did well, despite the pain in her calves.)

1378
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:44,586
(Beaten up)

1379
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:45,817
Even my bottom hurts.

1380
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:48,287
Nice job, Uie. Great tempo.

1381
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:51,227
(Simba Seol with determination)

1382
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,767
Now, the next level.

1383
00:47:52,927 --> 00:47:54,426
It's 6.7 seconds.

1384
00:47:54,427 --> 00:47:57,497
(Level 5 is 6.7 seconds.)

1385
00:47:57,537 --> 00:47:58,696
Okay.

1386
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:00,267
Good.

1387
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:01,867
You must endure it.

1388
00:48:02,537 --> 00:48:03,537
That's what this training is about.

1389
00:48:03,538 --> 00:48:04,576
That's right.

1390
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,207
(The real training begins now.)

1391
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:07,547
Focus.

1392
00:48:07,577 --> 00:48:08,976
Uie, focus.

1393
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:09,977
Okay.

1394
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:11,247
(Uie continues forward steadily.)

1395
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:13,146
- Nice.
- Nice pace. Good job.

1396
00:48:13,147 --> 00:48:15,587
(37th lap)

1397
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,556
Let's go. Let's get the perfect score.

1398
00:48:17,557 --> 00:48:19,156
- For the perfect score. One more.
- You can do it.

1399
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:21,057
You're guaranteed to pass.

1400
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:22,957
One more.

1401
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,627
- Uie's completely fine.
- Yes.

1402
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,327
One more. You got it.

1403
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:28,326
- Seol In Ah, you can do it.
- Right now,

1404
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,036
you've done 39.

1405
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:31,896
(39th lap, 6.7 seconds)

1406
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:33,237
If you do four more, it's the perfect score.

1407
00:48:33,337 --> 00:48:34,466
That's right. In Ah, one more.

1408
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:35,637
One more, In Ah.

1409
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:37,106
One more, In Ah.

1410
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:38,236
(Only 4 more for the perfect score)

1411
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:39,676
(Turning on the booster)

1412
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:40,906
Two more, In Ah.

1413
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:42,646
(Giving her all until the end)

1414
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:43,817
One more and it's over.

1415
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:46,117
Begin. Go.

1416
00:48:46,217 --> 00:48:48,317
(Only 3 more for the perfect score)

1417
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:49,986
In Ah. You can do it.

1418
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,417
In Ah, two more.

1419
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:53,727
(But she can't keep up as she wants.)

1420
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:55,427
- In Ah, two more.
- Go.

1421
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:58,727
(41st lap, 6.7 seconds, In Ah)

1422
00:48:59,057 --> 00:49:00,727
Okay. In Ah, you're out.

1423
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:03,837
(In Ah ran out of stamina.)

1424
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:08,037
(Exhausted)

1425
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:09,576
That's right.

1426
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,906
(Uie began her 43rd shuttle run.)

1427
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,577
Now, it's Level Six.

1428
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:14,977
She doesn't look tired at all.

1429
00:49:15,807 --> 00:49:18,147
(The queen of cardiovascular endurance looks fine.)

1430
00:49:18,617 --> 00:49:20,686
(3 seconds remain.)

1431
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:22,217
(43rd lap, 6.5 seconds, Uie)

1432
00:49:22,817 --> 00:49:24,487
Now, Level Six.

1433
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:28,056
(A perfect score for a firefighter)

1434
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:30,327
- Let's go.
- You're awesome.

1435
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:31,726
Level Six.

1436
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:32,997
(I still have stamina left.)

1437
00:49:33,267 --> 00:49:34,397
For 6.5 seconds.

1438
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:36,366
She's getting faster. She's focusing.

1439
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:37,636
That's right. You need to go faster.

1440
00:49:37,637 --> 00:49:38,736
Speed up.

1441
00:49:38,737 --> 00:49:40,037
(Uie's race isn't over yet.)

1442
00:49:41,307 --> 00:49:42,406
You can do it.

1443
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:43,476
Go.

1444
00:49:43,477 --> 00:49:44,836
One more.

1445
00:49:44,837 --> 00:49:47,077
- Uie, you can do it.
- One more.

1446
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:49,346
- Go, Uie.
- One more.

1447
00:49:49,347 --> 00:49:50,846
- You can do it.
- Yes. One more.

1448
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,147
Go, Kim Yu Jin.

1449
00:49:52,247 --> 00:49:54,386
- Keep it up.
- You can do one more.

1450
00:49:54,387 --> 00:49:56,187
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1451
00:49:56,257 --> 00:49:57,957
Let's do just one more.

1452
00:49:58,257 --> 00:49:59,827
Let's do one more for the last time.

1453
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,286
- Let's do one more.
- That's really amazing.

1454
00:50:02,287 --> 00:50:04,257
That's crazy. How is that possible?

1455
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:05,926
- You have plenty of time.
- I know you can do it.

1456
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:07,927
Try two more. You can do it.

1457
00:50:07,997 --> 00:50:09,396
- Uie, you're awesome.
- Ready. Go.

1458
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,696
Go. You can do it.

1459
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:11,896
Nice mentality.

1460
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:13,037
- Oh, my gosh.
- Good job.

1461
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:16,637
(The oldest gives her all to the end.)

1462
00:50:19,677 --> 00:50:21,606
(51st lap, success)

1463
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,716
(Now, Level 7 for 6.2 seconds)

1464
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:24,846
Level Seven.

1465
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:26,347
(52nd lap, 6.2 seconds)

1466
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:28,887
(She keeps running without a break.)

1467
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:31,717
(The ace of cardiovascular endurance is in pain.)

1468
00:50:31,817 --> 00:50:34,587
(52nd lap, 6.2 seconds)

1469
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:36,327
Okay.

1470
00:50:37,697 --> 00:50:38,926
Okay.

1471
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:40,766
(Uie's final record: 51 laps)

1472
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,326
You're amazing.

1473
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:44,296
(The oldest showed extreme mental strength and stamina.)

1474
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:45,666
You're so sexy.

1475
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,836
Wasn't that hard?

1476
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:48,207
You must be exhausted.

1477
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:50,036
That was really amazing.

1478
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:51,736
(The first shuttle run training ends.)

1479
00:50:51,737 --> 00:50:53,007
- Nice.
- That was crazy.

1480
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:54,746
In Ah, you were so close.

1481
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:55,776
It's okay.

1482
00:50:55,777 --> 00:50:56,846
Good job.

1483
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,047
You're awesome.

1484
00:50:58,247 --> 00:51:01,487
(Look up Iron Girls Timer and run together.)

1485
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:03,657
How was it?

1486
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:06,187
Don't you taste blood in your mouth?

1487
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:07,657
- Yes.
- Don't you feel like throwing up?

1488
00:51:07,757 --> 00:51:09,356
I feel like my glutes are about to explode.

1489
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,927
- Right?
- The time...

1490
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:13,166
- was against my will.
- True.

1491
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:15,727
She hasn't recovered yet.

1492
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,296
- I can't recover.
- I've never seen you...

1493
00:51:17,297 --> 00:51:19,266
- struggling that much before.
- It hurts.

1494
00:51:19,267 --> 00:51:20,866
Enduring that is part of this training.

1495
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:22,806
Imagine you're getting trained to get used to it.

1496
00:51:22,807 --> 00:51:24,636
- It's really painful.
- Uie.

1497
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:27,006
You're still good. Fifty-one laps.

1498
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,607
That's insane.

1499
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:30,016
We have someone...

1500
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:31,546
- who got the perfect score...
- She's amazing.

1501
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:34,217
- on the firefighter test.
- She was on Level Six.

1502
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:37,117
The number one firefighter is on Iron Girls.

1503
00:51:37,187 --> 00:51:39,626
Everyone, please send us lots of support.

1504
00:51:39,627 --> 00:51:40,887
(Look forward to their boxing challenge.)

1505
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:43,697
Uie got the perfect score.

1506
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:45,096
Unfortunately,

1507
00:51:45,097 --> 00:51:47,697
I have bad news.

1508
00:51:47,797 --> 00:51:48,966
You have one more.

1509
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,396
(One more shuttle run to go)

1510
00:51:50,397 --> 00:51:51,467
- What?
- This one?

1511
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:53,137
- This one?
- You're lying.

1512
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:54,636
We're doomed.

1513
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:56,736
This is a different shuttle run.

1514
00:51:56,737 --> 00:51:58,536
This is an interval shuttle run.

1515
00:51:58,537 --> 00:51:59,607
What's that?

1516
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:03,576
If you run 20m within the given time,

1517
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:05,076
(Run 20m on time)

1518
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,187
That counts as one lap.

1519
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:09,316
You have ten seconds to rest here.

1520
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:10,317
(10 seconds to rest and recover will be given.)

1521
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:11,856
After plenty of rest,

1522
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:13,827
you set off again after the beep.

1523
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:16,926
Control your pace and run 20m.

1524
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:18,057
And that counts as two laps.

1525
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:21,467
Rest for ten seconds and run for the third lap.

1526
00:52:21,567 --> 00:52:23,936
You'll run and rest for ten seconds...

1527
00:52:23,937 --> 00:52:25,137
repeatedly.

1528
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,606
For laps 1 through 10, you have 9 seconds.

1529
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:30,337
For laps 11 through 20, you have 8.5 seconds.

1530
00:52:30,437 --> 00:52:33,246
For every ten laps, your time will decrease...

1531
00:52:33,247 --> 00:52:34,776
until it is only six seconds.

1532
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,047
(They will continue until they run out of their stamina.)

1533
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:38,246
You must recover fast...

1534
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,286
- in ten seconds. Okay?
- Yes.

1535
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:42,516
Instead of standing there,

1536
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:44,186
you need to keep moving,

1537
00:52:44,187 --> 00:52:45,187
catch your breath,

1538
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:46,286
release lactic acid,

1539
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,587
and set off again.

1540
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:53,297
(In the actual match, boxers throw explosive punches.)

1541
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:57,336
(When the round ends, )

1542
00:52:57,337 --> 00:53:01,667
(they must recover in a short time.)

1543
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:04,677
You must run at least one more time to increase your stamina.

1544
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,306
Let's try. We're also given a break.

1545
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:07,406
- Let's go.
- Do your best.

1546
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,306
To win, you must run one more than you have in mind.

1547
00:53:09,307 --> 00:53:11,076
- Let's do this.
- We can do it.

1548
00:53:11,077 --> 00:53:12,246
Ready.

1549
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:13,487
Please sound the buzzer.

1550
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:20,126
(1st lap, 9 seconds)

1551
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:21,657
This is more than enough time.

1552
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,156
Take it easy.

1553
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:24,627
Nine seconds are more than enough.

1554
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:26,266
That's right.

1555
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:27,697
(1st lap, 9 seconds)

1556
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:29,636
- Good job.
- Nine seconds...

1557
00:53:29,637 --> 00:53:31,167
- isn't that long.
- No.

1558
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:32,967
Focus.

1559
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,207
Pay attention.

1560
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,567
Take a deep breath.

1561
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,776
(10 seconds to rest)

1562
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:43,146
(2nd lap, 9 seconds)

1563
00:53:43,147 --> 00:53:44,316
That's right.

1564
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,746
(2nd lap, 9 seconds)

1565
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:47,916
(10 seconds to rest)

1566
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:49,716
(Running in place)

1567
00:53:49,717 --> 00:53:51,087
Sae Rok, that's good.

1568
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,256
Don't just stand there.

1569
00:53:53,257 --> 00:53:54,527
Try to recover.

1570
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:57,956
Lactic acid builds faster than you think.

1571
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:59,056
(It's important to keep running so the lactic acid doesn't build.)

1572
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:00,367
That's right. Good job.

1573
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:02,497
Good.

1574
00:54:06,437 --> 00:54:07,836
Yes. Keep moving.

1575
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,006
(Keep moving.)

1576
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:14,377
(The Iron Girls move lightly to recover.)

1577
00:54:14,477 --> 00:54:15,677
Okay.

1578
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:17,847
Focus. That's right.

1579
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:23,187
Focus.

1580
00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:25,056
Take a deep breath.

1581
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:26,727
(There's no issue yet because there's a break.)

1582
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:30,257
That's right. Run lightly.

1583
00:54:30,697 --> 00:54:35,426
(Managing their stamina by controlling their pace)

1584
00:54:35,427 --> 00:54:36,537
Okay.

1585
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:41,836
Now, it'll get 0.5 seconds faster.

1586
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:43,976
(Level 2 of 8.5 seconds begins.)

1587
00:54:43,977 --> 00:54:45,036
When the time decreases,

1588
00:54:45,037 --> 00:54:48,706
you need to check how much you can keep up.

1589
00:54:48,707 --> 00:54:50,517
(Getting faster as the time decreases)

1590
00:54:51,677 --> 00:54:52,677
Good.

1591
00:54:52,678 --> 00:54:54,546
(Relaxed)

1592
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:55,816
Learn to control it.

1593
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:58,056
You've done 20. Now, it's getting faster.

1594
00:54:58,057 --> 00:54:59,657
This time, it's eight seconds.

1595
00:54:59,957 --> 00:55:01,087
Good.

1596
00:55:01,157 --> 00:55:02,586
You have the composure.

1597
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:03,656
(Sae Rok, who was out after 19 laps, is still energetic.)

1598
00:55:03,657 --> 00:55:05,726
After the 30th lap, the time gets 0.5 seconds shorter.

1599
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,067
Now, it's 7.5 seconds.

1600
00:55:07,297 --> 00:55:08,397
That's right.

1601
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:11,137
Now, it's seven seconds one-way.

1602
00:55:11,197 --> 00:55:14,166
Now, it's 6.5 seconds.

1603
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:16,536
After 60 laps, it's down to 6 seconds.

1604
00:55:16,537 --> 00:55:17,676
(Keeping the average pace of 6 minutes and 15 seconds)

1605
00:55:17,677 --> 00:55:19,476
The time won't decrease anymore,

1606
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:21,277
so do as much as you can from here.

1607
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,717
Let's go.

1608
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:29,447
(It's 3 seconds shorter than the beginning.)

1609
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:32,257
You've done 70 laps.

1610
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:36,496
Okay. 80 laps.

1611
00:55:36,497 --> 00:55:38,427
(81st lap, 6 seconds)

1612
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:41,026
(Sae Rok's running out of breath.)

1613
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:42,397
Don't lose control.

1614
00:55:43,497 --> 00:55:44,767
You have to endure it.

1615
00:55:45,337 --> 00:55:46,667
(Hesitant)

1616
00:55:48,507 --> 00:55:49,777
(Hesitant)

1617
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,677
Focus.

1618
00:55:54,007 --> 00:55:56,646
(Sae Rok's exhausted after running for over 20 minutes.)

1619
00:55:56,647 --> 00:55:58,246
Sae Rok, you need to focus.

1620
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:00,287
You're falling behind because you hesitate before the start.

1621
00:56:00,887 --> 00:56:03,056
Take a deep breath. Control your breathing.

1622
00:56:03,057 --> 00:56:04,587
(Panting)

1623
00:56:08,457 --> 00:56:10,457
Good. Good job, Sae Rok.

1624
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:13,997
You must get in there and recover fast in ten seconds.

1625
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:17,767
Don't bend your waist.

1626
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:19,437
Keep your waist up.

1627
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:21,206
Don't bend down when you reach it. Catch your breath.

1628
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:22,336
That's right.

1629
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,407
Keep moving.

1630
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:26,476
You need to move a little to recover.

1631
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:28,276
(They must keep moving to avoid lactic acid from building...)

1632
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:29,307
(for this training.)

1633
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:32,746
Let's go.

1634
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:35,017
- You can do it.
- Keep it up. You can do it.

1635
00:56:35,117 --> 00:56:37,257
You're recovering now. You found your tempo.

1636
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:38,887
You found your tempo.

1637
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,756
Okay. You still have the composure.

1638
00:56:40,757 --> 00:56:42,057
(You still have the composure.)

1639
00:56:43,527 --> 00:56:45,157
They're so relaxed.

1640
00:56:45,457 --> 00:56:46,596
They're so relaxed.

1641
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:47,627
(The other 3)

1642
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:52,866
You're all relaxed.

1643
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,936
So I'm going to extend the distance.

1644
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:55,337
You have to reach here.

1645
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:57,376
- That's not good.
- Okay. Focus.

1646
00:56:57,377 --> 00:56:59,777
(Extend the distance?)

1647
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:04,117
(Expanding from 20m to 22.5m)

1648
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:05,516
(Sae Rok doesn't have the stamina to stay up.)

1649
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:06,616
Keep your waist up.

1650
00:57:06,617 --> 00:57:07,716
Sae Rok, run one more time.

1651
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:08,787
One last time.

1652
00:57:09,347 --> 00:57:10,487
Good job.

1653
00:57:11,457 --> 00:57:15,127
(Now, it's 2.5m longer.)

1654
00:57:16,387 --> 00:57:17,796
Keep your waist up.

1655
00:57:17,797 --> 00:57:18,997
You can do it.

1656
00:57:23,027 --> 00:57:24,267
Try just a few more.

1657
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,566
Recover fast.

1658
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,936
(They feel the difference right away.)

1659
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:27,967
Okay.

1660
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,376
(Panting)

1661
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:36,816
Okay, Sae Rok. One more.

1662
00:57:36,817 --> 00:57:38,246
(Running out of breath)

1663
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,547
Okay. It's only begun.

1664
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:41,786
Don't bend down.

1665
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:43,016
Sae Rok, don't bend down.

1666
00:57:43,017 --> 00:57:44,057
(Captain Uie)

1667
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:46,087
Good.

1668
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:48,627
Good.

1669
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:51,457
(Trying one more time without giving up)

1670
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:55,366
(She didn't arrive before the finish tone.)

1671
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,597
Sae Rok, you're out.

1672
00:57:57,097 --> 00:58:01,366
(Sae Rok's final record: 102 laps)

1673
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,006
- Well done.
- Good job, Sae Rok.

1674
00:58:03,007 --> 00:58:04,406
- Good job.
- Good job.

1675
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:05,637
(She has given her all that she can't even respond.)

1676
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:08,277
(While Sae Rok is catching her breath, )

1677
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:10,676
(the other 3 still have iron stamina left.)

1678
00:58:10,677 --> 00:58:11,776
We can do it.

1679
00:58:11,777 --> 00:58:14,017
(the other 3 still have iron stamina left.)

1680
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:16,316
Let's go.

1681
00:58:16,317 --> 00:58:20,226
(104th lap)

1682
00:58:20,227 --> 00:58:23,556
(105th lap)

1683
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:25,756
Okay. Good.

1684
00:58:25,757 --> 00:58:26,766
You can do it.

1685
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,936
(106th lap)

1686
00:58:29,937 --> 00:58:31,137
You can do it.

1687
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:35,267
(In Ah and Ju Hyun barely make it.)

1688
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:38,206
(As it goes, they start to run out of breath.)

1689
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,277
(Panting)

1690
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:40,547
(Panting)

1691
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,847
Okay. Ju Hyun, focus.

1692
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:48,987
(30 minutes after the interval shuttle run began, 107th lap)

1693
00:58:50,157 --> 00:58:52,117
Listen to me while you recover.

1694
00:58:52,217 --> 00:58:55,557
For every 10 laps, I'm going to increase by 2.5m.

1695
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:58,097
(You're increasing the distance?)

1696
00:58:58,197 --> 00:58:59,197
(Sighing)

1697
00:59:02,127 --> 00:59:04,096
Okay. Go.

1698
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:05,936
(108th lap)

1699
00:59:05,937 --> 00:59:07,536
(109th lap)

1700
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:09,306
(110th lap)

1701
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:10,877
(111th lap)

1702
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:14,007
Now, you're running 25m.

1703
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:17,147
Okay. Sae Rok, move it here.

1704
00:59:18,147 --> 00:59:19,646
Okay. There.

1705
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,147
(Increasing 2.5m)

1706
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:24,117
(It's 5m longer than the beginning.)

1707
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:27,057
Now, it's 25m.

1708
00:59:27,957 --> 00:59:29,226
Okay. Focus.

1709
00:59:29,227 --> 00:59:30,626
You can do it.

1710
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:32,556
You can do it. Run for it.

1711
00:59:32,557 --> 00:59:34,027
(Running as fast as they can at 4-minute pace)

1712
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:35,997
You can do it. Run for it.

1713
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,467
(Close)

1714
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:40,937
You must recover fast.

1715
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:43,236
Yes. You need to recover fast.

1716
00:59:43,237 --> 00:59:46,107
(Recovering quickly in 10 seconds is the key.)

1717
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:47,777
(Groaning)

1718
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:49,407
- You can do it.
- Good.

1719
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:51,477
- You still have a long way to go.
- We got this.

1720
00:59:51,577 --> 00:59:52,876
Okay. Go.

1721
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:56,217
(Running as fast as they can after the distance increased)

1722
00:59:57,057 --> 00:59:58,257
Okay.

1723
00:59:59,587 --> 01:00:07,597
(20m, 9 seconds, 25m, 6 seconds)

1724
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:16,637
(Because they're running faster, they run out of breath even more.)

1725
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:18,206
(Ju Hyun is catching her breath far away from the start line.)

1726
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,247
Stand at the line.

1727
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:23,777
It's a waste if you run 1m more.

1728
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:27,587
(Ju Hyun began further away from the start line.)

1729
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:28,816
(Uie, In Ah, Ju Hyun)

1730
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:30,686
(117th lap, 6 seconds)

1731
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:32,656
(She begins to fall behind.)

1732
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:35,587
Get in there.

1733
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,627
Get in there.

1734
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,327
(Passing)

1735
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:43,667
(Far off)

1736
01:00:44,237 --> 01:00:45,237
No.

1737
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:48,606
(Park Ju Hyun's final record: 116 laps)

1738
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:50,936
Ju Hyun, you're out.

1739
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:51,977
Well done, Ju Hyun.

1740
01:00:52,307 --> 01:00:53,846
- Gosh.
- Go.

1741
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:55,406
Go.

1742
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:56,777
You can do it.

1743
01:00:58,217 --> 01:01:00,987
(Only Stamina Queen Uie and Sports Genius In Ah remain.)

1744
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:02,217
(Panting)

1745
01:01:03,147 --> 01:01:05,456
(Sports Genius is catching her breath.)

1746
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,156
Okay. Go.

1747
01:01:07,157 --> 01:01:08,656
Good.

1748
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:11,856
(118th lap, 25m, 6 seconds)

1749
01:01:11,857 --> 01:01:13,197
You can do it.

1750
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:17,596
Okay. In Ah, you're doing good.

1751
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:18,896
Keep your waist up.

1752
01:01:18,897 --> 01:01:21,237
Keep moving, so you can recover.

1753
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:23,067
Keep it up. Let's do a few more.

1754
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:26,677
Good.

1755
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:30,147
Good.

1756
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:31,846
(Uie, In Ah)

1757
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:35,417
(In Ah uses explosive power to catch up with Uie.)

1758
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,317
(Groaning)

1759
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:41,157
(Stamina Queen Uie also runs out of breath.)

1760
01:01:41,787 --> 01:01:43,757
(Shaking her head)

1761
01:01:43,797 --> 01:01:46,096
(Although they're exhausted...)

1762
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:49,766
You must recover as soon as you come in.

1763
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:53,807
(They squeeze their stamina and mental power.)

1764
01:01:54,437 --> 01:01:55,767
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

1765
01:01:55,907 --> 01:01:57,537
You got this, Seol In Ah.

1766
01:01:57,977 --> 01:01:59,337
- In Ah, you can do it.
- Good. Okay.

1767
01:01:59,437 --> 01:02:00,677
Okay. Come in.

1768
01:02:00,947 --> 01:02:02,247
Uie, you can do it.

1769
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,846
Okay. You made it. Okay.

1770
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,887
- No.
- Here. Okay.

1771
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:10,456
It's longer now. It's 27.5m.

1772
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:11,516
- No.
- Here.

1773
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:13,117
(While they're confused, it became 2.5m longer.)

1774
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:15,957
It's longer now. It's 27.5m.

1775
01:02:16,227 --> 01:02:17,297
My goodness.

1776
01:02:17,597 --> 01:02:18,727
That's crazy.

1777
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:21,366
It's longer now. It's 27.5m.

1778
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:23,126
- I don't think I can do it.
- You can do it.

1779
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:24,167
Give it a try, both of you!

1780
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:25,697
Hey.

1781
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:27,007
You can do it.

1782
01:02:27,137 --> 01:02:28,337
You can make it.

1783
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:32,877
(Clenching her teeth)

1784
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:36,576
- You can do it. You can make it.
- Go, Seol In Ah.

1785
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:39,917
(In Ah marches forward with an explosive energy.)

1786
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:46,187
(She makes it before Uie.)

1787
01:02:49,487 --> 01:02:54,027
(In Ah passes out upon arrival.)

1788
01:02:58,097 --> 01:03:02,507
(She can't stand up even at the tone.)

1789
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:08,277
(Seol In Ah's final record: 123 laps)

1790
01:03:12,177 --> 01:03:17,087
(In Ah gave it her all until the end.)

1791
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:18,487
Uie, try a few more.

1792
01:03:19,017 --> 01:03:20,887
Try a few more. You can do it.

1793
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,027
Hang in there.

1794
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:25,097
Okay.

1795
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:27,167
You look like you can go 0.5 seconds faster.

1796
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,166
Go, Uie.

1797
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:30,637
Recover fast.

1798
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:32,097
Go, Uie.

1799
01:03:32,337 --> 01:03:34,067
(27.5m, 6 seconds, Completing 124 laps)

1800
01:03:34,307 --> 01:03:36,667
(She must recover quickly to run one more time.)

1801
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,306
Uie, you can go faster.

1802
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:39,576
- No.
- Run up to here. Okay.

1803
01:03:39,577 --> 01:03:40,807
I can tell.

1804
01:03:41,847 --> 01:03:43,576
- Good.
- Good job.

1805
01:03:43,577 --> 01:03:44,776
- Good.
- You're doing great.

1806
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:45,816
You got it.

1807
01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:47,247
(Running at the pace of 3 minutes and 36 seconds)

1808
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:49,786
- Okay. Keep going.
- Uie.

1809
01:03:49,787 --> 01:03:52,156
Go.

1810
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:53,387
You can do it.

1811
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:58,197
Okay. One more. Hurry up.

1812
01:03:58,327 --> 01:03:59,756
- Go.
- You can do more.

1813
01:03:59,757 --> 01:04:01,867
- Let's go.
- Go.

1814
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:03,897
Run.

1815
01:04:04,937 --> 01:04:06,197
Recover right away.

1816
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:07,637
You can do a couple more.

1817
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,376
(The shuttle run even makes Stamina Queen Uie bend down.)

1818
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:11,877
Recover right away. Let's do one more.

1819
01:04:12,037 --> 01:04:14,476
Go.

1820
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:15,846
You can do it.

1821
01:04:15,847 --> 01:04:17,517
- You can do this!
- Last one!

1822
01:04:18,947 --> 01:04:19,977
Let's go.

1823
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,217
Okay. Uie, you're out.

1824
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:30,527
(She didn't arrive before the finish tone.)

1825
01:04:31,957 --> 01:04:32,997
Good job.

1826
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:35,426
(Uie's final record: 127 laps)

1827
01:04:35,427 --> 01:04:36,467
That was amazing.

1828
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:38,167
Good job.

1829
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:42,567
(I'm proud of you, Uie.)

1830
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:49,207
(Flopping)

1831
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:51,877
When the athlete is down, the coach is happy.

1832
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,687
It means the training went well.

1833
01:04:54,147 --> 01:04:56,046
You were good to the end.

1834
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:57,517
Good job.

1835
01:04:57,787 --> 01:05:00,217
(Everyone's lying down somewhere.)

1836
01:05:00,427 --> 01:05:01,527
Good job.

1837
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:03,386
Thank you, coach.

1838
01:05:03,387 --> 01:05:05,097
(The result of successful shuttle run training)

1839
01:05:05,297 --> 01:05:07,166
Good job.

1840
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,967
See? You can do it when you endure it.

1841
01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:11,597
Let's go, girls.

1842
01:05:12,437 --> 01:05:13,467
Gather around.

1843
01:05:14,267 --> 01:05:15,267
Gather around.

1844
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:22,377
(Uie's still catching her breath.)

1845
01:05:24,117 --> 01:05:25,147
(Grunting)

1846
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:32,287
(Uie finally gets up.)

1847
01:05:32,357 --> 01:05:34,087
(Rolling)

1848
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:36,087
Uie.

1849
01:05:36,587 --> 01:05:38,057
Are you okay?

1850
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:40,627
Ju Hyun, I can't go.

1851
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:42,027
- Come here.
- I...

1852
01:05:42,297 --> 01:05:44,966
Good job. Where does it hurt the most?

1853
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,367
- Here.
- Your thighs?

1854
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:47,807
- Your thighs?
- Yes.

1855
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:49,267
Good job.

1856
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,107
- Everyone did great.
- Good job.

1857
01:05:51,537 --> 01:05:53,436
- How was it? Was it hard?
- Yes.

1858
01:05:53,437 --> 01:05:55,276
- It was sweet.
- It was sweet?

1859
01:05:55,277 --> 01:05:56,547
- Yes.
- That was delicious.

1860
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,476
In both Seasons 1 and 2,

1861
01:05:58,477 --> 01:05:59,746
I've never seen Uie struggling so much.

1862
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,946
- It's the first time.
- It's the first time.

1863
01:06:00,947 --> 01:06:01,987
Really?

1864
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:03,857
(In Ah, don't sit down.)

1865
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,717
(No. Don't sit down.)

1866
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:08,257
(During their first boxing lesson)

1867
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:12,157
(Unlike the other three who fell on the floor, )

1868
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:15,397
(Stamina Queen was never exhausted.)

1869
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:20,667
(She couldn't get up for a while.)

1870
01:06:22,507 --> 01:06:24,906
Do you understand why we lie down now?

1871
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:26,206
- Do you get it now?
- Every time we lie down,

1872
01:06:26,207 --> 01:06:28,346
- you always tell us to get up.
- That's how we feel.

1873
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:29,746
She always does that.

1874
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:31,646
- You did 100.
- Did I?

1875
01:06:31,647 --> 01:06:33,217
- You did 100.
- I don't know.

1876
01:06:33,947 --> 01:06:38,387
Sae Rok ran 102 laps.

1877
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:39,617
Give it up for her.

1878
01:06:39,757 --> 01:06:40,857
Keum Sae Rok.

1879
01:06:41,357 --> 01:06:42,686
(Interval shuttle run)

1880
01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:44,396
Uie did 127 laps.

1881
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:45,796
In Ah did 123 laps.

1882
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,596
Ju Hyun did 116 laps.

1883
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:50,067
Sae Rok did 102 laps.

1884
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:54,436
I think I really need this training.

1885
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:56,837
- Why?
- Because...

1886
01:06:56,937 --> 01:06:58,376
if I could choose between 10km and this,

1887
01:06:58,377 --> 01:07:00,747
I chose 10km before.

1888
01:07:01,077 --> 01:07:04,146
I couldn't put in my everything at once and rest.

1889
01:07:04,147 --> 01:07:06,676
I never ran out of breath this much before.

1890
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:08,117
If I do this a lot,

1891
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:10,557
I think I'll be able to speed up.

1892
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:13,787
This is what I need.

1893
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:18,327
I saw In Ah struggling to run in Season One.

1894
01:07:18,597 --> 01:07:20,896
After seeing how much she improved,

1895
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:22,226
I think I can do that too.

1896
01:07:22,227 --> 01:07:24,266
I'll be able to improve.

1897
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:26,666
I realized as I watched her.

1898
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:27,937
I'll do my best to keep up.

1899
01:07:28,437 --> 01:07:29,966
You're getting better.

1900
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:33,236
Iron Girls have strong mental power.

1901
01:07:33,237 --> 01:07:35,046
Don't forget to increase your stamina.

1902
01:07:35,047 --> 01:07:36,047
- Yes.
- Yes.

1903
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:37,916
Don't forget...

1904
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:39,116
- that you're triathletes.
- That's right.

1905
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:42,986
I hope you pull off boxing as well.

1906
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:44,187
I'll be rooting for you from afar.

1907
01:07:45,257 --> 01:07:47,226
- KO!
- Iron...

1908
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:49,287
- Girls!
- Girls!

1909
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:50,826
Bye!

1910
01:07:50,827 --> 01:07:52,096
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1911
01:07:52,097 --> 01:07:53,327
I hope you come visit us again.

1912
01:07:53,397 --> 01:07:56,997
(A few days later)

1913
01:07:59,567 --> 01:08:02,906
(Covered in ocean fog)

1914
01:08:02,907 --> 01:08:05,977
(A desolate beach)

1915
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:12,547
(A tense atmosphere)

1916
01:08:13,787 --> 01:08:15,886
(The place reminds you of the movie "Silmido.")

1917
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,117
It's the perfect day for the brutal training.

1918
01:08:19,187 --> 01:08:20,886
Gosh. We've got to make...

1919
01:08:20,887 --> 01:08:22,257
the most of a day like this.

1920
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,527
It's really cold.

1921
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:26,827
- Isn't it suddenly chilly?
- It's better than earlier.

1922
01:08:27,027 --> 01:08:28,896
Hi.

1923
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,596
Hi. Isn't the weather great today?

1924
01:08:30,597 --> 01:08:32,167
Today's weather...

1925
01:08:32,337 --> 01:08:33,937
is perfect for the brutal training.

1926
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:35,966
- Seriously?
- It's too cold.

1927
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,577
A day like today is...

1928
01:08:38,037 --> 01:08:39,476
- Isn't it quite cool?
- Yes.

1929
01:08:39,477 --> 01:08:40,477
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

1930
01:08:40,478 --> 01:08:41,506
- It is, right?
- It's cold.

1931
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:43,276
On a day like this, you hit a record high.

1932
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:44,347
(She's had enough.)

1933
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,347
You must go all out on a day like today.

1934
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,216
- I'm serious.
- Don't you hate the cold?

1935
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:49,346
That's why I came bundled up.

1936
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:50,886
- Isn't that a bit too thick?
- To keep myself warm.

1937
01:08:50,887 --> 01:08:52,456
- I'm wearing three layers of pants.
- How thick is it?

1938
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:54,057
- I can tell.
- It's so cold.

1939
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:56,456
By the way, we're at the beach.

1940
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:58,727
Don't tell me we're going in the water to swim...

1941
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,257
- and such.
- What?

1942
01:09:00,327 --> 01:09:01,327
In this weather?

1943
01:09:01,328 --> 01:09:03,326
Today will be quite a surprise.

1944
01:09:03,327 --> 01:09:04,436
- That's right.
- What could it be?

1945
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:05,937
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1946
01:09:06,437 --> 01:09:08,037
We've invited...

1947
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:10,336
the strongest female fighters...

1948
01:09:10,337 --> 01:09:12,107
from each sport...

1949
01:09:12,877 --> 01:09:14,007
in Korea.

1950
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:18,517
What? Look at their uniforms.

1951
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,616
They've come in their uniforms.

1952
01:09:20,617 --> 01:09:22,547
Hold on. Didn't we wear that uniform last year?

1953
01:09:23,347 --> 01:09:26,156
- No. No way.
- What are you doing to us?

1954
01:09:26,157 --> 01:09:28,257
Don't do this to us.

1955
01:09:28,357 --> 01:09:30,057
She's Operator Jo Sung Won.

1956
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:31,596
You know her.

1957
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:33,997
Of course. I watched "The Iron Squad" countless times.

1958
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:35,566
Oh, my gosh.

1959
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:36,867
(From Sergeant Jo Sung Won of "The Iron Squad")

1960
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:38,236
Wrestling?

1961
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:39,937
- This is too much.
- Seriously?

1962
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:41,106
Taekwondo?

1963
01:09:41,107 --> 01:09:42,306
How intense.

1964
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:44,176
Jiu-jitsu? This is just wrong.

1965
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:45,777
- Move a little to the side.
- Come on.

1966
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:49,277
(The ladies approach with a commanding presence.)

1967
01:09:50,077 --> 01:09:51,276
I'm scared.

1968
01:09:51,277 --> 01:09:52,776
- Come on.
- Wait.

1969
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:53,986
What are you doing to us?

1970
01:09:53,987 --> 01:09:56,187
Don't do this to us.

1971
01:09:56,247 --> 01:09:58,757
Here are the taekwondo athletes.

1972
01:09:59,017 --> 01:10:00,086
Special forces martial arts.

1973
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:01,227
(Special forces martial arts)

1974
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:02,386
Wrestling.

1975
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:03,527
(Wrestling)

1976
01:10:04,227 --> 01:10:05,856
And jiu-jitsu athletes.

1977
01:10:05,857 --> 01:10:07,097
(Jiu-jitsu)

1978
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:11,767
We've invited the best martial arts for real combat.

1979
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:13,766
- I'm suddenly nervous.
- I'm nervous.

1980
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:14,807
(With the strongest female fighters in Korea, )

1981
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:19,337
(they must fight square and fair.)

1982
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:20,846
What?

1983
01:10:20,847 --> 01:10:22,477
- Yes!
- Nice!

1984
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:23,646
Push it.

1985
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:26,117
(A special stamina training with the female fighters)

1986
01:10:26,577 --> 01:10:28,147
(The so-called...)

1987
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:30,016
Our team will end up with a lot of water.

1988
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,687
(Female Fighter's Training Camp)

1989
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,256
(Coming soon)

1990
01:10:33,257 --> 01:10:34,787
- One, two.
- Go.

1991
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:39,457
With these ladies...

1992
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:41,496
Don't be too scared.

1993
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:43,896
- You should've known your limit.
- No, wait.

1994
01:10:43,897 --> 01:10:45,966
- There's no limit.
- Seriously?

1995
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:47,266
You look like...

1996
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:49,636
four hamsters huddled up.

1997
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:51,236
- You're all huddled together.
- We're doomed.

1998
01:10:51,237 --> 01:10:52,636
Pull your shoulders back. Relax.

1999
01:10:52,637 --> 01:10:53,836
I can't help but feel scared.

2000
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:55,747
I can sense the bloodthirsty energy from this side.

2001
01:10:55,777 --> 01:10:57,177
I can't even look this way.

2002
01:10:57,577 --> 01:10:58,617
Seriously.

2003
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,817
- I'm scared.
- Right.

2004
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,546
You can't be like this in the real game.

2005
01:11:02,547 --> 01:11:04,387
Pull your shoulders back. Right.

2006
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:08,457
We're here as boxing athletes today.

2007
01:11:08,527 --> 01:11:09,927
Be confident.

2008
01:11:10,027 --> 01:11:13,926
First, could each team introduce themselves?

2009
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:17,096
Starting with the athletes of Korea's national sport,

2010
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:19,697
- taekwondo.
- How cool!

2011
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:22,337
(If boxing is about fists, )

2012
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:26,637
(taekwondo is about feet.)

2013
01:11:27,177 --> 01:11:30,446
(They have the strongest feet...)

2014
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:33,117
(in Korea)

2015
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:38,586
(The strongest women fighters of taekwondo)

2016
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,356
Coach Kim So Hui...

2017
01:11:40,357 --> 01:11:43,556
- has over 100 medals.
- Sorry?

2018
01:11:43,557 --> 01:11:45,896
I've won in every national competition.

2019
01:11:45,897 --> 01:11:46,927
(Hong Hyo Rim)

2020
01:11:46,997 --> 01:11:48,466
She has no rival.

2021
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:50,426
- That's so cool.
- Nobody beat her for a year.

2022
01:11:50,427 --> 01:11:52,166
They are incredible. Welcome.

2023
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,297
Thank you.

2024
01:11:53,837 --> 01:11:55,106
- They're amazing.
- And...

2025
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:56,666
can we get a sneak peek at some...

2026
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:57,836
- taekwondo sparring?
- Yes.

2027
01:11:57,837 --> 01:11:59,106
We'll give you a demonstration.

2028
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:00,337
You will?

2029
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:02,276
- Let's have a look.
- What an honor.

2030
01:12:02,277 --> 01:12:03,607
Where's my phone?

2031
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:07,486
Taekwondo sparring is done in rounds.

2032
01:12:07,487 --> 01:12:09,316
- You score a point...
- Yes?

2033
01:12:09,317 --> 01:12:11,886
Only when you properly hit the head and torso.

2034
01:12:11,887 --> 01:12:13,416
- That's quite similar to boxing.
- It's like boxing.

2035
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,556
In boxing,

2036
01:12:14,557 --> 01:12:16,727
you must hit the head or the torso.

2037
01:12:16,787 --> 01:12:18,526
- Please watch them carefully.
- Okay.

2038
01:12:18,527 --> 01:12:19,657
- Okay.
- Good.

2039
01:12:19,757 --> 01:12:20,996
Attention. Bow.

2040
01:12:20,997 --> 01:12:22,967
(The match begins.)

2041
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:24,197
Get ready.

2042
01:12:24,697 --> 01:12:25,697
Fight.

2043
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:27,237
Fight.

2044
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:30,106
(An intense kick from the start)

2045
01:12:30,107 --> 01:12:32,107
- That's loud.
- She made the first move.

2046
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:35,376
(Kicking)

2047
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:36,847
- She dodged it.
- Front foot high.

2048
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:40,277
(A speed that could knock you out if you get hit)

2049
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:43,586
(A powerful impact from the tip of the foot)

2050
01:12:43,587 --> 01:12:44,917
The striking power is...

2051
01:12:45,117 --> 01:12:46,157
She dodged it.

2052
01:12:46,817 --> 01:12:49,127
I'm glad we're using our fists.

2053
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,456
If we were kicked...

2054
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:51,997
(Screaming)

2055
01:12:55,367 --> 01:12:56,367
(After a punch, )

2056
01:12:56,368 --> 01:12:59,596
(she goes in with a highly advanced kick.)

2057
01:12:59,597 --> 01:13:02,106
The athletes are using footwork.

2058
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:04,077
Like boxing, they must measure the distance.

2059
01:13:05,037 --> 01:13:06,206
Similar to boxing,

2060
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,246
taekwondo also uses footwork...

2061
01:13:08,247 --> 01:13:11,316
- to mainly evade attacks.
- Exactly.

2062
01:13:11,317 --> 01:13:13,246
Footwork is extremely important,

2063
01:13:13,247 --> 01:13:14,247
just like in boxing.

2064
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:15,347
- You're right.
- Yes.

2065
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,387
(Using their footwork to size each other up)

2066
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:21,956
(A kick attack, similar to throwing a jab in boxing)

2067
01:13:21,957 --> 01:13:23,057
What was that?

2068
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:26,196
(An intense battle of nerves, both trying to read each other's moves)

2069
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:27,257
Oh, no.

2070
01:13:28,197 --> 01:13:29,667
No. Don't fight.

2071
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:30,997
Wait. They must fight.

2072
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:33,897
There's one minute left.

2073
01:13:36,507 --> 01:13:38,506
That was the most difficult kick.

2074
01:13:38,507 --> 01:13:39,777
The double face kick.

2075
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,606
(Flies in with a kick...)

2076
01:13:41,607 --> 01:13:43,006
(and follows up with a high kick)

2077
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:44,117
That was...

2078
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:46,276
(As soon as the opponent changed sides, )

2079
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:48,046
(she launched a spinning kick.)

2080
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:49,146
She went in for it immediately after she changed sides.

2081
01:13:49,147 --> 01:13:51,787
That was the highest-level kick, the turn kick.

2082
01:13:52,587 --> 01:13:54,687
- How cool.
- It's called a turn kick.

2083
01:13:55,127 --> 01:13:56,256
They look cool.

2084
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:57,357
So cool.

2085
01:13:58,097 --> 01:13:59,156
Stop.

2086
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:00,656
(The sparring ends.)

2087
01:14:00,657 --> 01:14:01,966
Attention. Bow.

2088
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,627
How cool!

2089
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:07,036
- You are so cool.
- You are so cool.

2090
01:14:07,037 --> 01:14:08,066
It's my first time watching a match.

2091
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:09,767
Hearing the sound in person...

2092
01:14:09,907 --> 01:14:11,276
It was a lot intense than I imagined.

2093
01:14:11,277 --> 01:14:12,476
- I feel the pain.
- The force...

2094
01:14:12,477 --> 01:14:13,776
After getting hit by that kick,

2095
01:14:13,777 --> 01:14:15,277
- my tailbone shattered.
- What?

2096
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:18,616
- Many UFC athletes use the kick.
- Really?

2097
01:14:18,617 --> 01:14:20,476
After all, taekwondo kicks are powerful.

2098
01:14:20,477 --> 01:14:21,546
Also, counterattacking is difficult.

2099
01:14:21,547 --> 01:14:22,586
If you get hit once, it's over.

2100
01:14:22,587 --> 01:14:23,987
It sounds really painful.

2101
01:14:24,317 --> 01:14:25,416
Taekwon!

2102
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,186
(The taekwondo team put on a great match.)

2103
01:14:27,187 --> 01:14:28,626
Next are...

2104
01:14:28,627 --> 01:14:30,056
the comeback heroines.

2105
01:14:30,057 --> 01:14:31,426
Here are the wrestlers.

2106
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:33,757
(Wrestlers, the comeback heroines)

2107
01:14:34,227 --> 01:14:35,696
(Taking anyone down)

2108
01:14:35,697 --> 01:14:38,697
(Wrestling is a strength-based sport.)

2109
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:41,206
(The top-tier athletes...)

2110
01:14:41,207 --> 01:14:43,637
(when it comes to tremendous power)

2111
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:49,147
(The best female athletes in wrestling)

2112
01:14:49,247 --> 01:14:50,606
Gather up, wrestling!

2113
01:14:50,607 --> 01:14:51,716
- Shot!
- Shot!

2114
01:14:51,717 --> 01:14:53,416
- Let's go, wrestling!
- Let's go!

2115
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,147
(Taking control with the introduction)

2116
01:14:55,317 --> 01:14:57,086
(Park Hyeon Yeong, Kwon Young Jin, Jang Eun Sil, Lee Han Bit)

2117
01:14:57,087 --> 01:15:00,217
Here we have the incredible wrestlers of Korea.

2118
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,986
I'll show you the charms of wrestling.

2119
01:15:01,987 --> 01:15:04,657
She'll demonstrate what wrestling is to all of you.

2120
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:07,157
The match consists of 2 rounds that are 3 minutes each.

2121
01:15:07,627 --> 01:15:09,127
There's also the clean sweep.

2122
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:11,166
If both shoulders touch the mattress,

2123
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:13,297
it's considered a win, and the match ends.

2124
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,207
We'll proceed with...

2125
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:18,007
one three-minute round.

2126
01:15:18,937 --> 01:15:20,077
Shake hands.

2127
01:15:20,677 --> 01:15:21,777
Get ready.

2128
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:24,817
(The match starts.)

2129
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:30,386
(An intense physical battle right from the start)

2130
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:32,756
The opponent is trying a tie-up.

2131
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:34,016
(Strength versus strength)

2132
01:15:34,017 --> 01:15:37,427
(A fierce fight)

2133
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:39,826
Be careful. She used a leg trip just now.

2134
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,026
It's a technique.

2135
01:15:41,027 --> 01:15:42,126
(Attacking with a leg trip)

2136
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:43,166
(Earned 4 points by knocking her down)

2137
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,797
As the opponent landed on her back, she earned four points.

2138
01:15:45,797 --> 01:15:47,336
That would be two points.

2139
01:15:47,337 --> 01:15:49,207
In total, she got six points.

2140
01:15:50,067 --> 01:15:51,276
- That's...
- An attack.

2141
01:15:51,277 --> 01:15:52,836
(The red athlete counterattacks.)

2142
01:15:52,837 --> 01:15:53,876
A frontal attack.

2143
01:15:53,877 --> 01:15:55,677
A frontal attack got her two points.

2144
01:15:55,747 --> 01:15:57,947
She's preparing for a side roll on the ground.

2145
01:15:58,677 --> 01:16:00,816
In boxing, you throw punches.

2146
01:16:00,817 --> 01:16:02,216
But this sport is...

2147
01:16:02,217 --> 01:16:03,386
There are no punches.

2148
01:16:03,387 --> 01:16:05,086
It's a battle of tactics.

2149
01:16:05,087 --> 01:16:06,256
Indeed.

2150
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:07,557
- It's very interesting.
- Right?

2151
01:16:07,587 --> 01:16:08,786
- Is it?
- Yes.

2152
01:16:08,787 --> 01:16:09,827
I see.

2153
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:12,657
They're breathing heavily now.

2154
01:16:12,857 --> 01:16:14,267
They're short of breath.

2155
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,666
But really...

2156
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:23,106
(The two lions fight intensely.)

2157
01:16:23,107 --> 01:16:25,477
Sports that require body holds are...

2158
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:26,937
(Shocked)

2159
01:16:27,407 --> 01:16:29,146
(A powerful hip throw)

2160
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:30,276
Oh, no.

2161
01:16:30,277 --> 01:16:31,977
(Amazed)

2162
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:36,187
(An advanced technique that requires strong lower-body strength)

2163
01:16:36,247 --> 01:16:38,017
Both shoulders must touch the ground.

2164
01:16:38,517 --> 01:16:39,687
When they do...

2165
01:16:40,617 --> 01:16:41,626
Okay.

2166
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:42,856
She made a clean sweep.

2167
01:16:42,857 --> 01:16:45,327
(The blue athlete won as the red athlete's shoulders hit the ground.)

2168
01:16:45,497 --> 01:16:46,796
(Endlessly...)

2169
01:16:46,797 --> 01:16:48,396
(in awe)

2170
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,766
- It felt like people...
- Yes?

2171
01:16:49,767 --> 01:16:52,067
- were fighting in taekwondo.
- Right?

2172
01:16:52,137 --> 01:16:53,566
But wrestling was like a fight...

2173
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,237
- between instincts.
- Yes.

2174
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:57,036
You didn't avoid...

2175
01:16:57,037 --> 01:16:59,136
eye contact.

2176
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:01,906
Even we could feel the intense battle of nerves.

2177
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:03,547
- Taking the lead is important too.
- Yes.

2178
01:17:03,747 --> 01:17:05,176
Since it's a hand-to-hand fight.

2179
01:17:05,177 --> 01:17:06,616
What kind of training...

2180
01:17:06,617 --> 01:17:09,446
- do wrestlers do on a daily basis?
- We...

2181
01:17:09,447 --> 01:17:11,056
- train in pairs.
- Okay.

2182
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:13,656
We run around carrying the other person on our backs...

2183
01:17:13,657 --> 01:17:15,026
- or in front.
- "Person?"

2184
01:17:15,027 --> 01:17:16,326
Yes, we carry each other on our shoulders.

2185
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:18,057
- I think I've seen that somewhere.
- That's normal for us.

2186
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:20,457
(It's strength when it comes to wrestling!)

2187
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:23,797
(The training is just as intense.)

2188
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:30,136
(The most basic training is carrying people on the shoulders.)

2189
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:32,336
- Captain Kim.
- Yes?

2190
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:33,906
I'll carry you like a princess.

2191
01:17:33,907 --> 01:17:34,946
- You want to carry me?
- My goodness.

2192
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:35,947
Not us?

2193
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:37,917
- Captain Kim? Not us?
- Captain Kim?

2194
01:17:37,947 --> 01:17:39,176
Will you become a princess?

2195
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:40,416
- I'm...
- He does like the color pink.

2196
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:41,587
I'm almost...

2197
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:43,346
I weigh...

2198
01:17:43,347 --> 01:17:45,186
almost 100kg. That's right.

2199
01:17:45,187 --> 01:17:47,957
I wonder if a wrestler can carry me.

2200
01:17:47,987 --> 01:17:49,056
You weigh 100kg?

2201
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:50,627
Really? She's going to lift him up?

2202
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:51,657
No way.

2203
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,196
- One, two, three.
- Okay.

2204
01:17:53,197 --> 01:17:56,527
(Will she succeed?)

2205
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:59,237
(Shocked)

2206
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:00,767
(Lifting him up)

2207
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,067
She's got a strong core.

2208
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,537
(Lightly)

2209
01:18:04,677 --> 01:18:06,336
- My gosh.
- Seriously?

2210
01:18:06,337 --> 01:18:07,637
I can even walk around.

2211
01:18:09,947 --> 01:18:12,417
(The princess's splendid procession...)

2212
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:14,687
(satisfies the people.)

2213
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:17,116
Goodness.

2214
01:18:17,117 --> 01:18:19,056
- That was fun.
- We normally...

2215
01:18:19,057 --> 01:18:20,387
- That was really fun.
- We...

2216
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:22,187
- That was fun?
- You see...

2217
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:25,097
It was my very first time being carried around by someone.

2218
01:18:25,227 --> 01:18:26,457
It was fun.

2219
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:28,566
We'll start calling you Princess, Captain Kim.

2220
01:18:28,567 --> 01:18:30,167
- Princess Dong Hyun.
- Come on.

2221
01:18:30,397 --> 01:18:31,667
Are you curious, In Ah?

2222
01:18:32,097 --> 01:18:33,566
- Do you want to... She's curious.
- Yes.

2223
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:35,306
- She's curious.
- Please carry me.

2224
01:18:35,307 --> 01:18:36,467
Sure thing.

2225
01:18:38,537 --> 01:18:39,777
One, two, three.

2226
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:41,877
That's it.

2227
01:18:43,107 --> 01:18:45,146
(Here comes Princess In Ah.)

2228
01:18:45,147 --> 01:18:47,217
Like this.

2229
01:18:50,187 --> 01:18:53,517
(Princess In Ah treats her fans well.)

2230
01:18:53,757 --> 01:18:55,457
(Excuse me.)

2231
01:18:55,927 --> 01:18:57,327
Please carry me, ma'am.

2232
01:18:57,387 --> 01:18:59,297
(The princesses keep coming.)

2233
01:18:59,727 --> 01:19:01,967
Something feels wrong. Hold on.

2234
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,567
I'll carry you.

2235
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:04,867
One, two, three.

2236
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:06,536
- Like this.
- Goodness.

2237
01:19:06,537 --> 01:19:08,407
Gosh, ma'am.

2238
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:11,107
(An ungraded princess performance)

2239
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:13,477
(Flashy)

2240
01:19:13,937 --> 01:19:16,807
(A beautiful dance made by wrestling)

2241
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:19,117
- And...
- Are you okay?

2242
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:20,576
(The princess danced way too intensely.)

2243
01:19:20,577 --> 01:19:21,586
(Staggering)

2244
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:23,616
- I hope I don't look funny.
- I...

2245
01:19:23,617 --> 01:19:24,756
Go, Ju Hyun.

2246
01:19:24,757 --> 01:19:25,816
Try it, Park Ju Hyun.

2247
01:19:25,817 --> 01:19:26,886
- Do you have another training?
- Yes.

2248
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,556
- What is it?
- There's a technique...

2249
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:29,826
where you lift a person into the air.

2250
01:19:29,827 --> 01:19:30,856
- Got it.
- Why me?

2251
01:19:30,857 --> 01:19:32,727
Hold on.

2252
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:35,697
You're at Jang Eun Sil Amusement Park.

2253
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:38,196
Walking around princess style is over.

2254
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:39,936
- The merry-go-round is over.
- Is it?

2255
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:41,037
There's a different ride.

2256
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:42,837
- Is it over?
- It just closed. Yes.

2257
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,076
- I'll show you shrimping.
- A different ride.

2258
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:46,437
- A shrimp?
- Yes.

2259
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:47,507
A shrimp?

2260
01:19:47,577 --> 01:19:50,476
You have to become a shrimp and bend a little.

2261
01:19:50,477 --> 01:19:52,176
Yes, that's it. Stay like that.

2262
01:19:52,177 --> 01:19:55,847
- One, two, three.
- Oh, my gosh. What...

2263
01:19:56,587 --> 01:19:58,857
Oh, my gosh. What...

2264
01:19:59,757 --> 01:20:01,857
Oh, my gosh.

2265
01:20:02,027 --> 01:20:04,557
What's this? Goodness.

2266
01:20:07,157 --> 01:20:08,397
That's going too far.

2267
01:20:08,597 --> 01:20:10,297
Why are you bullying her?

2268
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:14,397
(Wrestling is this scary.)

2269
01:20:15,707 --> 01:20:16,807
Are you okay?

2270
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:18,177
Are you okay?

2271
01:20:19,407 --> 01:20:21,177
Come here, Ju Hyun.

2272
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:23,007
(Running away)

2273
01:20:23,547 --> 01:20:25,047
(Crying)

2274
01:20:25,147 --> 01:20:26,777
- What is this?
- Hold on.

2275
01:20:27,317 --> 01:20:29,117
We thought it'd be a pretty ride.

2276
01:20:29,587 --> 01:20:31,187
- What was that?
- Are you okay?

2277
01:20:31,687 --> 01:20:32,886
I'm sorry.

2278
01:20:32,887 --> 01:20:34,486
Who hasn't been on the ride yet?

2279
01:20:34,487 --> 01:20:36,186
No, I refuse.

2280
01:20:36,187 --> 01:20:38,326
- You refuse? Are you sure?
- Yes.

2281
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,326
- I'm so scared.
- Are you?

2282
01:20:40,327 --> 01:20:41,496
There's another ride.

2283
01:20:41,497 --> 01:20:43,866
What's that drill called?

2284
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:44,997
What was it called again?

2285
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:46,797
We call it the Titanic.

2286
01:20:47,137 --> 01:20:48,536
- The waist lift.
- "The waist lift?"

2287
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:50,006
- This one's fun.
- Is it?

2288
01:20:50,007 --> 01:20:51,506
This is fun.

2289
01:20:51,507 --> 01:20:54,136
- I'll trust you.
- It trains your waist, right?

2290
01:20:54,137 --> 01:20:55,147
- That's right.
- Right.

2291
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:56,547
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

2292
01:20:56,947 --> 01:20:58,946
One more time. Okay.

2293
01:20:58,947 --> 01:21:00,416
(The customer is 100 percent satisfied...)

2294
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:01,687
(with Jang Eun Sil Amusement Park.)

2295
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:07,157
(It's as thrilling as the Viking in Wolmido.)

2296
01:21:07,487 --> 01:21:11,327
(Is this how it feels to become the Viking ride?)

2297
01:21:12,757 --> 01:21:16,596
(Full of thrills)

2298
01:21:16,597 --> 01:21:19,096
- That was scary.
- It's over now. Are you okay?

2299
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:20,097
(Feeling dazed)

2300
01:21:20,098 --> 01:21:22,637
- Are you okay?
- That ride was awesome.

2301
01:21:23,207 --> 01:21:24,736
(Totally excited)

2302
01:21:24,737 --> 01:21:25,937
Thank you.

2303
01:21:26,437 --> 01:21:28,276
We have demonstrations of other drills.

2304
01:21:28,277 --> 01:21:29,306
- Nice.
- Like what?

2305
01:21:29,307 --> 01:21:31,817
- We'll make it short.
- Okay.

2306
01:21:31,877 --> 01:21:33,447
Here's the bridge and roll first.

2307
01:21:33,877 --> 01:21:35,987
- It's a bridge and a roll?
- Let them show you.

2308
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:37,717
Hold on.

2309
01:21:39,657 --> 01:21:40,657
Hold on.

2310
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:42,186
No, wait.

2311
01:21:42,187 --> 01:21:44,727
- How flexible.
- That looks really dangerous.

2312
01:21:45,327 --> 01:21:48,966
Wrestlers do the bridge and roll to strengthen their necks.

2313
01:21:48,967 --> 01:21:50,727
(Bridge and roll: A neck strengthening training)

2314
01:21:53,297 --> 01:21:55,237
That's no joke.

2315
01:21:55,907 --> 01:21:59,207
(Insane wrestling drills)

2316
01:21:59,737 --> 01:22:02,776
(As striking as a parade)

2317
01:22:02,777 --> 01:22:04,977
(Shocked)

2318
01:22:05,277 --> 01:22:07,377
- Isn't that breakdancing?
- "Breakdancing?"

2319
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:08,886
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2320
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,016
(Jang Eun Sil Amusement Park closes.)

2321
01:22:10,017 --> 01:22:12,986
I'm very fond of the next sport.

2322
01:22:12,987 --> 01:22:14,686
It's one of my favorites.

2323
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,226
The ultimate sports of push-and-pull.

2324
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:17,726
- What is it?
- Here are...

2325
01:22:17,727 --> 01:22:19,056
the female athletes of jiu-jitsu.

2326
01:22:19,057 --> 01:22:20,627
(Jiu-jitsu, the ultimate push-and-pull sport)

2327
01:22:21,097 --> 01:22:23,197
(Strangling the opponent)

2328
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:26,297
(Grabbing and twisting)

2329
01:22:26,837 --> 01:22:28,937
(The beauty of detailed control)

2330
01:22:29,407 --> 01:22:31,677
(An unbeatable streak of medals)

2331
01:22:32,007 --> 01:22:36,477
(The strongest female athletes of jiu-jitsu)

2332
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:39,246
(Lee Yu Jin, Kim Na Hyun, Sung Ki Ra, Choi Hee Ju)

2333
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:42,146
I personally know Sung Ki Ra.

2334
01:22:42,147 --> 01:22:44,486
When talking about female jiu-jitsu athletes,

2335
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:46,056
Sung Ki Ra is the one.

2336
01:22:46,057 --> 01:22:47,717
- Uie asked...
- She's a world-class athlete.

2337
01:22:48,187 --> 01:22:50,087
If it was different from judo.

2338
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:52,127
I'm confused because of the similar uniforms.

2339
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:55,526
Many judo techniques are done standing up.

2340
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:59,066
In jiu-jitsu, we either twist the opponent's joints...

2341
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,466
or strangle their neck.

2342
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:02,106
It's a form of martial arts with the goal of dominating the opponent.

2343
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:03,166
Sorry, ma'am?

2344
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:05,237
It's scary because you're explaining it to us so nonchalantly.

2345
01:23:05,477 --> 01:23:06,836
- It's...
- You strangle and twist?

2346
01:23:06,837 --> 01:23:07,977
- Strangle or...
- It's...

2347
01:23:08,047 --> 01:23:09,776
It's either you make your opponent pass out...

2348
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,677
or break a part of their body.

2349
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,577
It's that kind of sport.

2350
01:23:14,847 --> 01:23:17,616
- That's a sport, right?
- How is that a sport?

2351
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:18,886
Of course, it's a sport.

2352
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:22,356
The opponent can surrender by tapping.

2353
01:23:22,357 --> 01:23:23,986
With that, the match ends.

2354
01:23:23,987 --> 01:23:26,027
The match ends when the opponent signals surrender.

2355
01:23:26,397 --> 01:23:28,726
Do some people actually break bones?

2356
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:32,237
Many break their bones because they refuse to surrender.

2357
01:23:32,397 --> 01:23:34,396
Some even continue the match in that state.

2358
01:23:34,397 --> 01:23:36,636
- What? With a broken bone?
- Yes.

2359
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:39,006
I think it's a good idea to show us a sparring session.

2360
01:23:39,007 --> 01:23:41,037
(A thrilling yet intimidating jiu-jitsu match)

2361
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:43,176
(A jiu-jitsu match)

2362
01:23:43,177 --> 01:23:44,946
Normally, each round lasts...

2363
01:23:44,947 --> 01:23:47,016
- for five minutes in jiu-jitsu.
- Five minutes?

2364
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:48,087
- That's long.
- Yes.

2365
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:49,817
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

2366
01:23:50,087 --> 01:23:51,457
It sounds fun.

2367
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:53,456
Combate.

2368
01:23:53,457 --> 01:23:54,787
(The match starts.)

2369
01:23:55,927 --> 01:23:58,296
They both pulled guard from standing.

2370
01:23:58,297 --> 01:24:01,327
- The neck.
- Hee Ju is trying to strangle her.

2371
01:24:01,897 --> 01:24:03,666
(Her arm goes out to grab and strangle the neck.)

2372
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:04,867
Take the arm away.

2373
01:24:05,697 --> 01:24:07,437
- She locked her in.
- She's locked in.

2374
01:24:07,967 --> 01:24:10,367
She's strangling her with her uniform.

2375
01:24:11,477 --> 01:24:13,137
- Really?
- No.

2376
01:24:13,677 --> 01:24:16,007
She's trying to twist her ankle.

2377
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:21,647
(It looks painful just watching it.)

2378
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:23,287
Her finger is going in.

2379
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:27,457
(All they can hear is the rustling of their uniforms.)

2380
01:24:27,657 --> 01:24:30,657
It's intense without a single word.

2381
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,826
The athletes are trying really hard...

2382
01:24:32,827 --> 01:24:34,997
to strangle and twist each other.

2383
01:24:35,267 --> 01:24:38,797
Yu Jin is trying to subdue Hee Ju by pushing her down.

2384
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:40,967
(Shocked)

2385
01:24:47,877 --> 01:24:50,176
(The helicopter armbar technique)

2386
01:24:50,177 --> 01:24:51,246
(Surrendering)

2387
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:53,077
She has tapped, which means she surrenders.

2388
01:24:53,877 --> 01:24:55,886
She used the armbar technique.

2389
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:56,946
(That looks painful.)

2390
01:24:56,947 --> 01:24:58,686
But how can you stay silent...

2391
01:24:58,687 --> 01:25:00,617
when you're in pain?

2392
01:25:00,687 --> 01:25:03,626
The moment we make a sound, it means we surrender.

2393
01:25:03,627 --> 01:25:05,397
- Any kind of sound?
- Yes.

2394
01:25:06,097 --> 01:25:08,426
Are there childish athletes who pinch the opponent?

2395
01:25:08,427 --> 01:25:09,926
- Many do it.
- Really?

2396
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:11,227
I also do it at times.

2397
01:25:11,537 --> 01:25:12,636
- What?
- What?

2398
01:25:12,637 --> 01:25:14,396
Please edit that out.

2399
01:25:14,397 --> 01:25:16,167
How do you pinch your opponent?

2400
01:25:16,307 --> 01:25:18,436
When they're being cheeky, I grab their thigh...

2401
01:25:18,437 --> 01:25:19,576
as I'm grabbing their uniform.

2402
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:21,546
Does the match end when they scream?

2403
01:25:21,547 --> 01:25:24,447
- Yes.
- I see.

2404
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:27,416
I feel like jiu-jitsu causes the most injuries.

2405
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:29,946
How is it one of the most popular recreational sports?

2406
01:25:29,947 --> 01:25:30,986
It's really popular.

2407
01:25:30,987 --> 01:25:33,656
Regardless of your gender and weight,

2408
01:25:33,657 --> 01:25:35,126
you can spar every day.

2409
01:25:35,127 --> 01:25:37,426
Small-framed people can beat the bigger opponents.

2410
01:25:37,427 --> 01:25:38,826
That's what people are charmed by.

2411
01:25:38,827 --> 01:25:40,526
In short, you can dominate...

2412
01:25:40,527 --> 01:25:42,596
your opponent regardless of the weight difference.

2413
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:43,597
Right.

2414
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:45,467
If you win that match, imagine how good it will feel.

2415
01:25:45,997 --> 01:25:47,596
Can you even throw Captain Kim over?

2416
01:25:47,597 --> 01:25:48,807
Of course.

2417
01:25:48,967 --> 01:25:51,167
You said you could do a bit of jiu-jitsu.

2418
01:25:51,237 --> 01:25:53,736
- Well...
- How about a match?

2419
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:56,547
He keeps whispering in my ear, "I'm a brown belt."

2420
01:25:56,577 --> 01:25:57,747
He's a brown belt?

2421
01:25:58,217 --> 01:25:59,946
What are you waiting for? Take your shoes off.

2422
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:00,947
Me?

2423
01:26:01,617 --> 01:26:03,587
Come on. Jiu-jitsu is easy.

2424
01:26:03,787 --> 01:26:05,457
I'm not bad at jiu-jitsu.

2425
01:26:05,557 --> 01:26:08,457
(Knowing this could happen, he came prepared.)

2426
01:26:08,757 --> 01:26:11,156
Let me put on my uniform.

2427
01:26:11,157 --> 01:26:14,097
Why is your uniform so flashy, Captain Kim? It's like...

2428
01:26:14,227 --> 01:26:15,727
It's pink for our princess.

2429
01:26:16,197 --> 01:26:18,466
I received a pink uniform.

2430
01:26:18,467 --> 01:26:20,696
Captain Kim. Your uniform is quite tight on you.

2431
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:22,306
Did you borrow someone else's?

2432
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:23,536
- It's small.
- Too small.

2433
01:26:23,537 --> 01:26:25,537
It's because I'm wearing three layers of pants.

2434
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:27,837
The athletes in the back must be embarrassed.

2435
01:26:28,107 --> 01:26:29,977
This is... What is it?

2436
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:31,246
Is it weird? I'm sorry.

2437
01:26:31,247 --> 01:26:33,146
- Isn't it too small?
- It's too small.

2438
01:26:33,147 --> 01:26:35,317
The pants look like they're about to burst.

2439
01:26:35,747 --> 01:26:37,487
I don't think he can even move in those.

2440
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:40,586
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

2441
01:26:40,587 --> 01:26:41,857
(A big difference in physique, even at a glance)

2442
01:26:42,157 --> 01:26:43,757
(Provoking)

2443
01:26:43,957 --> 01:26:45,627
(Relaxed)

2444
01:26:45,957 --> 01:26:47,256
(Height: 191cm, Weight: 94kg)

2445
01:26:47,257 --> 01:26:49,897
(Height: 156cm, Weight: 48kg)

2446
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:53,067
(Can she overcome the noticeable physical difference?)

2447
01:26:58,577 --> 01:27:00,007
She knocked him down in one go.

2448
01:27:00,837 --> 01:27:04,707
(A technique that breaks the opponent's balance from behind)

2449
01:27:04,977 --> 01:27:06,016
(Screaming)

2450
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:07,017
(Laughing)

2451
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:08,917
You can't make a sound. Hold back.

2452
01:27:08,987 --> 01:27:10,687
You made a sound.

2453
01:27:11,187 --> 01:27:13,116
- Disqualified.
- I bet he'll tap out faster...

2454
01:27:13,117 --> 01:27:14,927
than it took him to change.

2455
01:27:15,627 --> 01:27:17,586
(The fighter lost quite some face.)

2456
01:27:17,587 --> 01:27:19,157
(She starts twisting his arm.)

2457
01:27:19,257 --> 01:27:20,457
Tap.

2458
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,226
- He can't handle it.
- Tap.

2459
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:23,767
(A perfect and successful armbar)

2460
01:27:24,567 --> 01:27:27,337
You groaned within ten seconds.

2461
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:29,406
- She's really strong.
- Thank you.

2462
01:27:29,407 --> 01:27:32,437
Thank you so much. That was a great demonstration.

2463
01:27:32,677 --> 01:27:34,807
Next up, they are the definition of strong.

2464
01:27:34,977 --> 01:27:36,246
- How cool.
- They're just strong.

2465
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:38,416
They don't dominate their opponents.

2466
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:40,376
- They kill them.
- Exactly.

2467
01:27:40,377 --> 01:27:41,416
They kill them!

2468
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:44,586
They've got iron stamina and a soldier's spirit.

2469
01:27:44,587 --> 01:27:46,356
We've invited four of the best female soldiers.

2470
01:27:46,357 --> 01:27:47,357
(Special forces martial arts)

2471
01:27:47,757 --> 01:27:50,187
(Just in time, the ocean fog rolls back in.)

2472
01:27:50,957 --> 01:27:53,357
(The team that best fits the vibes of "Silmido")

2473
01:27:53,527 --> 01:27:56,026
(Not just an ordinary match)

2474
01:27:56,027 --> 01:27:59,437
(The strongest of real combat)

2475
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:03,237
(The strongest female soldiers in special forces martial arts)

2476
01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:04,666
Salute.

2477
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,336
Staff Sergeant Jo Sung Won...

2478
01:28:06,337 --> 01:28:07,707
of the Korean army's 35th Special Mission Battalion.

2479
01:28:07,877 --> 01:28:09,107
- Unite!
- Unite!

2480
01:28:09,247 --> 01:28:10,606
Korea Army Special Warfare Command's...

2481
01:28:10,607 --> 01:28:12,217
Sergeant First Class Kim Ji Eun.

2482
01:28:12,277 --> 01:28:14,117
Staff Sergeant Yang Hae Ju.

2483
01:28:14,177 --> 01:28:15,247
Unite!

2484
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:18,817
Staff Sergeant Lee Hyun Seon of the 707th Special Mission Group.

2485
01:28:18,887 --> 01:28:19,917
I'm getting goosebumps.

2486
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:22,387
I'm getting goosebumps.

2487
01:28:22,527 --> 01:28:23,727
I got goosebumps.

2488
01:28:24,427 --> 01:28:26,927
They are female soldiers from the special forces.

2489
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:29,827
The most brutal training ever.

2490
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:32,466
They will give a sneak peek of what...

2491
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:34,167
- special forces martial arts is.
- I love you all.

2492
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,967
- They're the best.
- I made a sudden confession.

2493
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:39,377
(Special forces martial arts demonstration)

2494
01:28:39,477 --> 01:28:41,807
Salute to the people.

2495
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:43,207
- Salute!
- Salute!

2496
01:28:43,947 --> 01:28:44,977
They are so cool.

2497
01:28:45,017 --> 01:28:47,316
I bet they'll be cool.

2498
01:28:47,317 --> 01:28:48,317
As you were!

2499
01:28:48,447 --> 01:28:49,447
Get ready.

2500
01:28:50,587 --> 01:28:52,786
(A knife appears with a battle cry?)

2501
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:53,857
- What?
- What?

2502
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:54,957
What is this?

2503
01:28:55,527 --> 01:28:56,587
(Screaming)

2504
01:28:59,457 --> 01:29:02,526
(They're moving so fast that the knives aren't even visible.)

2505
01:29:02,527 --> 01:29:04,166
That's scary. They keep stabbing.

2506
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:05,836
- How scary.
- Oh, dear.

2507
01:29:05,837 --> 01:29:08,296
They're already dead. They're dead.

2508
01:29:08,297 --> 01:29:10,237
- Aren't you all so cruel?
- They're dead.

2509
01:29:11,307 --> 01:29:12,776
(Like being in the very center of a real battlefield)

2510
01:29:12,777 --> 01:29:14,336
Put your hands up. Do it!

2511
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:16,177
(Like being in the very center of a real battlefield)

2512
01:29:16,677 --> 01:29:18,816
(After punching her face, )

2513
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:20,077
(she takes the gun away.)

2514
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:24,247
(Shocked beyond words)

2515
01:29:24,517 --> 01:29:26,116
- That's...
- What is it?

2516
01:29:26,117 --> 01:29:28,216
Isn't she going to break it with her shin?

2517
01:29:28,217 --> 01:29:30,287
- No, don't do it.
- Stop.

2518
01:29:30,327 --> 01:29:31,757
- I'm scared.
- No way.

2519
01:29:32,335 --> 01:29:33,964
- That's...
- What is it?

2520
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:35,964
Isn't she going to break it with her shin?

2521
01:29:35,965 --> 01:29:38,134
- No, don't do it.
- Stop.

2522
01:29:38,135 --> 01:29:39,705
- I'm scared.
- No way.

2523
01:29:39,805 --> 01:29:41,705
Seriously? Won't it hurt tons?

2524
01:29:41,945 --> 01:29:43,144
What is she going to do?

2525
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:44,445
No, wait.

2526
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,645
- With her shin?
- No, wait.

2527
01:29:47,545 --> 01:29:49,915
(Layers of marble sheets)

2528
01:29:50,315 --> 01:29:51,415
How many is that?

2529
01:29:51,915 --> 01:29:53,684
(Shocked)

2530
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:55,384
- You can break them, right?
- No.

2531
01:29:55,385 --> 01:29:57,185
- We can't.
- Really?

2532
01:29:57,825 --> 01:29:59,225
(Screaming)

2533
01:29:59,655 --> 01:30:00,724
(No, stop!)

2534
01:30:00,725 --> 01:30:02,065
Stop.

2535
01:30:03,095 --> 01:30:04,295
With her shin?

2536
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:09,435
(Screaming)

2537
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:16,845
(What did I just witness?)

2538
01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:20,445
(The hamsters have frozen due to the shock.)

2539
01:30:21,985 --> 01:30:24,044
They might even rip people apart.

2540
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:25,084
Attention.

2541
01:30:25,085 --> 01:30:26,955
Salute to the people.

2542
01:30:27,085 --> 01:30:28,285
- Salute!
- Salute!

2543
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,054
(Maintaining perfect precision until the end)

2544
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,155
As you were!

2545
01:30:31,895 --> 01:30:32,895
To your positions!

2546
01:30:37,295 --> 01:30:39,265
- What are we doing today?
- What are we to do?

2547
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:42,404
- The athletes...
- They're shocked.

2548
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:44,564
Shocked after seeing them break...

2549
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:45,875
and swing knives.

2550
01:30:45,975 --> 01:30:47,534
Even Jang Eun Sil was like,

2551
01:30:47,535 --> 01:30:49,145
"We can't do that."

2552
01:30:49,175 --> 01:30:50,975
- "That's scary." - We can't do it.

2553
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,714
You demonstrated deadly intent.

2554
01:30:52,715 --> 01:30:54,715
- It was shocking.
- How can we...

2555
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,615
So what are we doing today?

2556
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:58,854
- We...
- I don't think...

2557
01:30:58,855 --> 01:31:00,384
- we should be here.
- Exactly.

2558
01:31:00,385 --> 01:31:03,984
What do you do when you don't have any weapons?

2559
01:31:03,985 --> 01:31:06,154
When we don't have any weapons,

2560
01:31:06,155 --> 01:31:08,624
we use available parts of the body...

2561
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,424
to cause damage.

2562
01:31:10,425 --> 01:31:12,434
So even your body is a weapon.

2563
01:31:12,435 --> 01:31:14,134
- Yes.
- You're literally a weapon.

2564
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,304
Certainly.

2565
01:31:15,305 --> 01:31:16,904
(Smiling)

2566
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,904
When you strike someone,

2567
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:20,375
you must look them straight in the eyes.

2568
01:31:20,405 --> 01:31:21,835
And the critical parts of the body.

2569
01:31:21,905 --> 01:31:24,504
We call it the kill box. We aim for those parts.

2570
01:31:24,505 --> 01:31:26,614
While keeping sharp peripheral vision...

2571
01:31:26,615 --> 01:31:27,714
- "Kill box?" - "Kill box?"

2572
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,345
You call a person's face a "kill box?"

2573
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,985
- "Kill box" is a big shocker.
- I can't believe it.

2574
01:31:33,215 --> 01:31:34,284
Kill box.

2575
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:36,185
(Let's remember kill box even during boxing.)

2576
01:31:36,285 --> 01:31:37,555
So what are we doing?

2577
01:31:37,755 --> 01:31:39,694
- I'm dead scared.
- Wait.

2578
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:43,194
With these amazing women assembled,

2579
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:45,634
we'll focus on the essence of each sport...

2580
01:31:45,635 --> 01:31:47,664
- Yes.
- and learn self-defense skills...

2581
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:50,365
we can actually use.

2582
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:52,904
Is it okay for us to learn it?

2583
01:31:52,905 --> 01:31:54,575
Of course, it's okay.

2584
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,644
In broad daylight in Sillim-dong, Seoul,

2585
01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:59,345
a man attacked passersby with a weapon...

2586
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:01,074
The man who assaulted a female stranger...

2587
01:32:01,075 --> 01:32:03,284
in the middle of Gangnam, Seoul,

2588
01:32:03,285 --> 01:32:04,845
was caught after four days.

2589
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:06,684
("A Teenage Boy Randomly Assaults a Female Stranger")

2590
01:32:06,685 --> 01:32:08,384
("A Public Knife Attack in Broad Sparks Public Fear")

2591
01:32:08,385 --> 01:32:10,054
("Series of Daytime Stabbings Raises Citizens’ Concerns")

2592
01:32:10,055 --> 01:32:11,885
(News about random crimes has increased recently.)

2593
01:32:11,925 --> 01:32:14,025
Imagine yourself walking alone at night.

2594
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:15,595
If an unidentified assailant...

2595
01:32:15,825 --> 01:32:17,794
appears in such a situation,

2596
01:32:17,795 --> 01:32:19,965
you might scream and panic.

2597
01:32:20,265 --> 01:32:21,535
That's so scary.

2598
01:32:21,865 --> 01:32:23,804
We'll learn self-defense skills...

2599
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:26,104
based on techniques and moves...

2600
01:32:26,105 --> 01:32:28,174
anyone can apply in everyday life.

2601
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:29,645
This is a rare chance.

2602
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,644
Self-defense is a martial art used to protect the body.

2603
01:32:32,645 --> 01:32:34,014
You can say that...

2604
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:36,614
everyone here is a self-defense expert.

2605
01:32:36,615 --> 01:32:39,385
(Self-defense: A martial art used to protect the body)

2606
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:42,124
Before we learn self-defense moves,

2607
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:43,784
let's watch what someone can do...

2608
01:32:43,785 --> 01:32:44,824
if they encounter...

2609
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,854
an unidentified assailant while walking...

2610
01:32:46,855 --> 01:32:48,424
the streets at night.

2611
01:32:48,425 --> 01:32:49,625
Where's the unidentified assailant?

2612
01:32:49,825 --> 01:32:51,225
If you walk around,

2613
01:32:51,295 --> 01:32:52,434
an unidentified assailant will appear.

2614
01:32:52,435 --> 01:32:54,434
- How scary.
- He's scary.

2615
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,164
His face is dead serious.

2616
01:32:56,165 --> 01:32:57,965
My heart is suddenly racing.

2617
01:32:58,105 --> 01:32:59,974
Uie is walking alone at night right now.

2618
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:00,975
(How will she defend herself?)

2619
01:33:01,435 --> 01:33:04,204
(Situation 1: She runs into an unidentified assailant.)

2620
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:05,475
- I'm scared.
- I'd better go home.

2621
01:33:06,975 --> 01:33:08,174
This is scary.

2622
01:33:08,175 --> 01:33:09,614
Oh, my gosh.

2623
01:33:09,615 --> 01:33:10,645
(He whips out a knife?)

2624
01:33:11,645 --> 01:33:14,815
(You have a knife?)

2625
01:33:16,185 --> 01:33:18,955
(Flustered, she backs away.)

2626
01:33:19,795 --> 01:33:23,425
(She struggles in silence.)

2627
01:33:23,695 --> 01:33:25,295
You forget to scream in that situation.

2628
01:33:26,395 --> 01:33:28,135
(Worried)

2629
01:33:28,535 --> 01:33:32,535
(Doing everything she can to free her arms from his grip)

2630
01:33:33,105 --> 01:33:34,274
I'm sorry.

2631
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:35,774
(Unable to do anything)

2632
01:33:35,775 --> 01:33:37,345
What are you...

2633
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:39,475
- I quit.
- See that?

2634
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:41,844
- She couldn't do anything.
- Uie had nothing with her.

2635
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:43,684
There was nothing she could've done.

2636
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:45,114
That knife itself was intimidating.

2637
01:33:45,115 --> 01:33:46,714
The moment you see the knife,

2638
01:33:46,715 --> 01:33:48,984
- you're frozen in shock.
- But that just now...

2639
01:33:48,985 --> 01:33:52,224
wasn't because Uie didn't know any self-defense moves.

2640
01:33:52,225 --> 01:33:53,724
Most people...

2641
01:33:53,725 --> 01:33:56,064
would react the same way she did if an assailant...

2642
01:33:56,065 --> 01:33:57,894
- suddenly pulled out a knife.
- That sounds scary.

2643
01:33:57,895 --> 01:33:58,934
The strongest...

2644
01:33:58,935 --> 01:34:01,435
special forces martial arts move one can use when facing someone...

2645
01:34:01,595 --> 01:34:02,664
with a knife.

2646
01:34:02,665 --> 01:34:05,165
If Sergeant Kim Ji Eun could kindly teach us.

2647
01:34:05,705 --> 01:34:08,434
The assailant might give up on pulling out the knife.

2648
01:34:08,435 --> 01:34:09,505
How cool.

2649
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:11,245
Take it out, and he's in big trouble.

2650
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:14,244
(How will she handle...)

2651
01:34:14,245 --> 01:34:18,015
(the unidentified assailant with a knife?)

2652
01:34:20,815 --> 01:34:22,824
(Screaming)

2653
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:23,825
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

2654
01:34:24,285 --> 01:34:25,285
- What?
- What?

2655
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:27,194
(What?)

2656
01:34:27,195 --> 01:34:28,595
- What was that?
- Really?

2657
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:30,894
For real?

2658
01:34:30,895 --> 01:34:33,195
(Was that a special forces martial arts self-defense?)

2659
01:34:33,395 --> 01:34:35,434
- I think I can do it.
- Same here.

2660
01:34:35,435 --> 01:34:37,605
- I can do it!
- Let me do it!

2661
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:39,374
- Time out.
- I can do it too.

2662
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,674
- Time out.
- What was that?

2663
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,804
Sergeant!

2664
01:34:41,805 --> 01:34:44,744
Didn't you show us those flashy moves earlier?

2665
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:48,314
But for real, think of this as a basic self-defense move...

2666
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:50,084
that anyone can do,

2667
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,485
even without any martial arts training.

2668
01:34:52,585 --> 01:34:54,454
The first thing you should do...

2669
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:56,025
is scream.

2670
01:34:56,185 --> 01:34:58,354
You have to catch the attacker off guard.

2671
01:34:58,355 --> 01:34:59,624
(Notify others that you're in danger by screaming)

2672
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:00,825
Please help me!

2673
01:35:01,025 --> 01:35:02,364
(An intense scream practice)

2674
01:35:02,365 --> 01:35:04,394
Second, get close to the assailant.

2675
01:35:04,395 --> 01:35:06,594
Get as close as possible...

2676
01:35:06,595 --> 01:35:08,595
and push hard with your weight.

2677
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:13,034
When you do, pull your arms away fast.

2678
01:35:13,035 --> 01:35:15,844
If you keep your arms out, you might get cut by the knife,

2679
01:35:15,845 --> 01:35:17,675
or the assailant might attack you again.

2680
01:35:17,975 --> 01:35:19,274
Push him fast...

2681
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:20,674
and pull your arms away.

2682
01:35:20,675 --> 01:35:21,874
Third,

2683
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:23,684
run towards the exit...

2684
01:35:23,685 --> 01:35:25,184
or anywhere it's crowded...

2685
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:27,054
and shout, "Save me. Help me."

2686
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:28,754
"Call the police."

2687
01:35:28,755 --> 01:35:31,354
You must call out for help.

2688
01:35:31,355 --> 01:35:33,694
Please remember those three steps.

2689
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,925
But in a real-life situation, you might be unable to scream.

2690
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:37,865
- From the shock.
- Yes, from the shock.

2691
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:41,435
(When Uie had run into the unidentified assailant earlier, )

2692
01:35:41,665 --> 01:35:45,575
(she got flustered and couldn't say a thing.)

2693
01:35:45,735 --> 01:35:49,345
(When facing an unidentified assailant, )

2694
01:35:49,405 --> 01:35:52,344
(one must notify of the situation by screaming.)

2695
01:35:52,345 --> 01:35:53,915
Those who have never screamed before...

2696
01:35:53,945 --> 01:35:55,214
might forget to scream.

2697
01:35:55,215 --> 01:35:57,544
That's why you need to practice multiple times.

2698
01:35:57,545 --> 01:35:59,214
(Screaming should also be practiced.)

2699
01:35:59,215 --> 01:36:02,624
To compare the before and after learning the self-defense move,

2700
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,924
Uie will try it again.

2701
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:05,625
(An actual practice of the self-defense move)

2702
01:36:06,555 --> 01:36:08,695
- Push him down.
- Let's do this.

2703
01:36:09,465 --> 01:36:10,495
Here I go.

2704
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:13,094
Should I go home?

2705
01:36:13,095 --> 01:36:14,165
Home...

2706
01:36:16,135 --> 01:36:18,035
(Screaming)

2707
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:19,805
Help me!

2708
01:36:20,335 --> 01:36:22,945
(Well done.)

2709
01:36:23,005 --> 01:36:24,674
That was perfect.

2710
01:36:24,675 --> 01:36:25,744
(Uie was perfect.)

2711
01:36:25,745 --> 01:36:27,615
If someone screams like that,

2712
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,344
- I would step outside.
- Same here.

2713
01:36:29,345 --> 01:36:32,144
- But that was a really useful tip.
- Right?

2714
01:36:32,145 --> 01:36:34,784
I want to know wrestling's self-defense move.

2715
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:36,954
- I'm really curious.
- Me too.

2716
01:36:36,955 --> 01:36:39,724
My situation is when an unidentified assailant...

2717
01:36:39,725 --> 01:36:40,824
picks a fight with me...

2718
01:36:40,825 --> 01:36:42,825
or grabs my shoulder from the front.

2719
01:36:42,865 --> 01:36:44,425
I don't think anyone will pick a fight with you.

2720
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,294
No one will...

2721
01:36:46,295 --> 01:36:48,835
Who would pick a fight with you?

2722
01:36:48,935 --> 01:36:51,104
- She's so cool.
- I'll show you a self-defense move.

2723
01:36:51,105 --> 01:36:53,775
(What kind of self-defense move will Team Wrestling show?)

2724
01:36:55,805 --> 01:36:56,874
The weather is nice.

2725
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:58,205
(She walks as she enjoys the weather.)

2726
01:36:59,015 --> 01:37:00,245
What's this?

2727
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:03,945
(What was that?)

2728
01:37:03,985 --> 01:37:05,015
What's this?

2729
01:37:05,345 --> 01:37:07,655
(She quickly does a shoulder throw.)

2730
01:37:08,215 --> 01:37:10,325
(Giggling)

2731
01:37:10,725 --> 01:37:12,854
(They become speechless.)

2732
01:37:12,855 --> 01:37:14,854
My goodness. I mean, that's...

2733
01:37:14,855 --> 01:37:16,764
That makes me want to learn how to wrestle.

2734
01:37:16,765 --> 01:37:17,924
- Seriously.
- Is it possible...

2735
01:37:17,925 --> 01:37:19,564
- for us to do that?
- That was great.

2736
01:37:19,565 --> 01:37:20,934
- Of course.
- You can definitely do it.

2737
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:21,965
- Really?
- Of course.

2738
01:37:22,535 --> 01:37:25,205
When the opponent comes near and grabs my shoulder,

2739
01:37:25,835 --> 01:37:28,374
I'll grab the bending part of the arm...

2740
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,074
with force like this.

2741
01:37:30,075 --> 01:37:31,104
(Press the bending part of the arm that's grabbing the shoulder.)

2742
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:32,815
Then comes the right leg.

2743
01:37:32,945 --> 01:37:34,615
Move the right foot forward.

2744
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:36,214
Then the left foot will go in.

2745
01:37:36,215 --> 01:37:37,785
It won't go too deep.

2746
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:39,685
The feet should be kept straight.

2747
01:37:40,185 --> 01:37:41,584
Form number 11 with your feet.

2748
01:37:41,585 --> 01:37:43,925
(As the left foot goes in backward, form number 11 with both feet.)

2749
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:45,724
Then stick out your bottom...

2750
01:37:45,725 --> 01:37:48,855
toward the opponent's pelvis. Have it rest on the pelvis.

2751
01:37:49,365 --> 01:37:50,664
Why do you need to stick out the bottom?

2752
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:51,764
It makes the throw easier.

2753
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,664
If you don't stick out the bottom, you'll just show your back.

2754
01:37:54,665 --> 01:37:56,734
If I don't stick out my bottom,

2755
01:37:56,735 --> 01:37:58,464
it'll be easier for the opponent to jump me.

2756
01:37:58,465 --> 01:38:01,004
- That's right.
- He can use his legs to block me.

2757
01:38:01,005 --> 01:38:03,144
But if I stick out my bottom and throw him over my shoulder...

2758
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:06,245
(Not sticking out the bottom versus Sticking out the bottom)

2759
01:38:06,415 --> 01:38:07,974
I'll go over what I learned.

2760
01:38:07,975 --> 01:38:09,444
The opponent grabs me.

2761
01:38:09,445 --> 01:38:11,014
- "Look at this punk." - Grab the arm.

2762
01:38:11,015 --> 01:38:12,315
From number 11 with your feet.

2763
01:38:12,515 --> 01:38:14,014
- Stick out the bottom.
- Do it as you sit down.

2764
01:38:14,015 --> 01:38:15,084
- Lie down.
- There you go. That's it.

2765
01:38:15,085 --> 01:38:16,554
(100 points for reviewing)

2766
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:18,184
- It was cool.
- He went over.

2767
01:38:18,185 --> 01:38:21,854
No. You don't pick up and throw the opponent.

2768
01:38:21,855 --> 01:38:23,764
When you pull the opponent, he's bound to follow.

2769
01:38:23,765 --> 01:38:25,064
- So I just do it like that.
- Afterward,

2770
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:27,034
he trips over your body and falls.

2771
01:38:27,035 --> 01:38:29,634
Depending on how I bend over, the opponent follows.

2772
01:38:29,635 --> 01:38:31,465
- I use the lack of balance. Yes.
- So this is how I do it.

2773
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:33,934
- Like this? I get it.
- Yes.

2774
01:38:33,935 --> 01:38:35,675
(Sports Genius, In Ah picked up a wrestling move.)

2775
01:38:36,105 --> 01:38:39,175
(Self-defense in wrestling, practicing an actual situation)

2776
01:38:39,245 --> 01:38:41,144
I'll go home quickly and give Julie a snack.

2777
01:38:41,145 --> 01:38:42,685
(In Ah is going home after a boxing practice.)

2778
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:44,445
What?

2779
01:38:46,915 --> 01:38:47,985
Like this.

2780
01:38:48,685 --> 01:38:50,725
(Don't defy me. I'm Simba Seol.)

2781
01:38:50,985 --> 01:38:53,095
(She runs away screaming.)

2782
01:38:53,255 --> 01:38:55,094
- She's really good.
- I know. I acknowledge her talent.

2783
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,124
- She's really good.
- You did very well.

2784
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:59,594
- Well done.
- Seriously.

2785
01:38:59,595 --> 01:39:00,595
Seniors.

2786
01:39:00,596 --> 01:39:01,765
(Loyalty to the seniors.)

2787
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,535
Iron Girls 3 will be on wrestling.

2788
01:39:03,865 --> 01:39:05,834
- Let's go.
- Wrestling.

2789
01:39:05,835 --> 01:39:08,535
Now, we'll check out Team Jiu-jitsu's self-defense move.

2790
01:39:08,775 --> 01:39:10,345
They knock out the opponent.

2791
01:39:11,005 --> 01:39:12,974
We'll block the carotid artery.

2792
01:39:12,975 --> 01:39:16,014
We can make the opponent faint in five seconds.

2793
01:39:16,015 --> 01:39:17,984
- What will you block?
- What will you block?

2794
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:19,115
- "Carotid artery." - "Carotid artery?"

2795
01:39:19,655 --> 01:39:20,785
How scary.

2796
01:39:21,585 --> 01:39:23,524
Let's check out a demonstration.

2797
01:39:23,525 --> 01:39:24,585
(Situation 3. You fall down when an assailant pushes you.)

2798
01:39:25,085 --> 01:39:27,195
(Walking quietly)

2799
01:39:27,855 --> 01:39:29,165
My goodness.

2800
01:39:29,465 --> 01:39:30,465
It's scary!

2801
01:39:30,825 --> 01:39:32,435
(He holds down both hands.)

2802
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:34,364
Oh, no! What is she going to do?

2803
01:39:34,365 --> 01:39:36,305
(If it's real, it'll be a terrible situation.)

2804
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:39,634
(She puts him in a choke hold right away.)

2805
01:39:39,635 --> 01:39:41,974
- Gosh, he picked the wrong girl.
- This is bad.

2806
01:39:41,975 --> 01:39:43,245
(Strangling to finish him off)

2807
01:39:43,705 --> 01:39:45,604
- Gosh.
- He picked the wrong girl.

2808
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:47,075
(The assailant passes out.)

2809
01:39:47,245 --> 01:39:49,945
You might think, "Who falls for such a move?"

2810
01:39:50,215 --> 01:39:51,944
But if the assailant doesn't know jiu-jitsu,

2811
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:53,885
- he won't know what's happening.
- Right.

2812
01:39:55,555 --> 01:39:57,754
(Triangle choke: A technique of making a triangle...)

2813
01:39:57,755 --> 01:39:59,994
( with both legs. and strangling the opponent's neck.)

2814
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:03,125
Ju Hyun, you should try the triangle choke.

2815
01:40:04,195 --> 01:40:05,195
You punk.

2816
01:40:06,265 --> 01:40:07,434
You punk, come here.

2817
01:40:07,435 --> 01:40:09,834
(The childish assailant attacks without fear.)

2818
01:40:09,835 --> 01:40:10,864
What?

2819
01:40:10,865 --> 01:40:12,575
(She uses the technique right away.)

2820
01:40:12,935 --> 01:40:14,075
Hold out as much as you can.

2821
01:40:14,275 --> 01:40:15,335
Hold on.

2822
01:40:15,805 --> 01:40:17,345
Hold out.

2823
01:40:18,005 --> 01:40:20,444
I already know what it feels like. Do you want me to hold out?

2824
01:40:20,445 --> 01:40:21,515
Yes.

2825
01:40:21,745 --> 01:40:22,784
You can hold out further.

2826
01:40:22,785 --> 01:40:24,445
(My goodness)

2827
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:26,685
(Tapping)

2828
01:40:27,555 --> 01:40:28,784
(I get that it's impressive.)

2829
01:40:28,785 --> 01:40:30,855
(If it gets used on you, you'll die.)

2830
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:34,055
It was a kill box. Ju Hyun, you were stuck in a kill box.

2831
01:40:34,855 --> 01:40:36,365
Ju Hyun, learn the technique.

2832
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:37,525
Okay.

2833
01:40:37,725 --> 01:40:40,034
- I'll lie down.
- Yes, you need to lie down.

2834
01:40:40,035 --> 01:40:41,334
- That's right.
- You need to lie down.

2835
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:42,335
Now...

2836
01:40:44,135 --> 01:40:46,774
That happens a lot...

2837
01:40:46,775 --> 01:40:47,805
during a jiu-jitsu lesson.

2838
01:40:47,835 --> 01:40:49,345
Let me explain.

2839
01:40:49,605 --> 01:40:52,375
If you keep your legs closed in jiu-jitsu,

2840
01:40:52,515 --> 01:40:54,975
you increase your chance of getting subdued by an opponent.

2841
01:40:57,645 --> 01:41:00,585
(Even after she falls down, her legs are spread open.)

2842
01:41:00,685 --> 01:41:04,524
You need to keep your legs open to keep the assailant from coming.

2843
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:06,155
Then the person on the floor can gain the upper hand.

2844
01:41:07,025 --> 01:41:08,654
- With your knees...
- There you go.

2845
01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:10,594
Move your knees to the chest...

2846
01:41:10,595 --> 01:41:13,835
and step on the assailant's pelvis to move up a bit.

2847
01:41:14,035 --> 01:41:15,634
- Then...
- Take out one leg.

2848
01:41:15,635 --> 01:41:18,035
That's it. Take it out.

2849
01:41:18,335 --> 01:41:19,405
Nice.

2850
01:41:19,535 --> 01:41:21,974
Now, your ankle should reach the knee pit.

2851
01:41:21,975 --> 01:41:24,505
(One ankle should reach the knee pit of the other leg.)

2852
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:27,245
Bring the knees together with force.

2853
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:28,675
- The knees.
- Do it with force.

2854
01:41:29,545 --> 01:41:32,114
- Squeeze. Yes, that's it.
- Gosh.

2855
01:41:32,115 --> 01:41:33,285
(Squeeze the knees to suffocate the assailant.)

2856
01:41:33,355 --> 01:41:35,214
If you keep strangling,

2857
01:41:35,215 --> 01:41:38,425
you'll block the carotid artery and make the assailant pass out.

2858
01:41:38,655 --> 01:41:40,825
I like this technique. I think it's nice.

2859
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:44,365
- Okay.
- Let's try it.

2860
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:46,835
(Happy)

2861
01:41:49,235 --> 01:41:50,934
(She keeps her legs raised to use a technique.)

2862
01:41:50,935 --> 01:41:52,064
- The legs.
- Use your knees.

2863
01:41:52,065 --> 01:41:53,134
(Ju Hyun does it one step at a time.)

2864
01:41:53,135 --> 01:41:54,135
Guard.

2865
01:41:56,475 --> 01:41:58,545
(She puts her in a choke hold!)

2866
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:00,215
(That's impressive.)

2867
01:42:00,545 --> 01:42:02,475
(Squeezing with all her might.)

2868
01:42:02,545 --> 01:42:03,585
(Tapping)

2869
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:06,485
(Self-defense in jiu-jitsu is over.)

2870
01:42:06,515 --> 01:42:07,984
Even if you know the basic steps,

2871
01:42:07,985 --> 01:42:11,354
you can't use a technique without practice.

2872
01:42:11,355 --> 01:42:13,824
You can make it your own through practice.

2873
01:42:13,825 --> 01:42:15,654
- It could save your life.
- That's right.

2874
01:42:15,655 --> 01:42:17,294
So keep that in mind...

2875
01:42:17,295 --> 01:42:18,724
and practice.

2876
01:42:18,725 --> 01:42:19,795
- Okay.
- Okay.

2877
01:42:20,065 --> 01:42:23,435
All right. Thank you for your hard work.

2878
01:42:24,005 --> 01:42:25,364
Eating is a part of training.

2879
01:42:25,365 --> 01:42:26,874
- Let's have lunch.
- All right.

2880
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,705
- I love it the most.
- For lunch,

2881
01:42:28,805 --> 01:42:31,574
I'll buy you pizza.

2882
01:42:31,575 --> 01:42:33,375
- I love it.
- Pizza.

2883
01:42:33,715 --> 01:42:35,115
I'll buy you tasty pizza.

2884
01:42:35,715 --> 01:42:37,944
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2885
01:42:37,945 --> 01:42:39,115
Please eat up.

2886
01:42:39,255 --> 01:42:40,384
- It looks tasty.
- It's on me.

2887
01:42:40,385 --> 01:42:43,625
Hold on. I love this pizza the most. Seriously.

2888
01:42:44,055 --> 01:42:46,224
This pizza is very popular these days.

2889
01:42:46,225 --> 01:42:47,255
(A hearty lunch for the female fighters)

2890
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:51,394
(Sweet corn...)

2891
01:42:51,395 --> 01:42:52,694
Whole shrimp.

2892
01:42:52,695 --> 01:42:55,595
(and whole shrimp that's covered in spicy seasoning)

2893
01:42:55,865 --> 01:42:57,435
- It's really tasty.
- It's tasty.

2894
01:43:00,505 --> 01:43:01,535
(Humming in approval)

2895
01:43:02,175 --> 01:43:03,844
I think the dough is really tasty.

2896
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:06,214
- It's so tasty.
- The cheese is so chewy.

2897
01:43:06,215 --> 01:43:08,515
They didn't skimp on the corn and shrimp.

2898
01:43:08,845 --> 01:43:10,214
Everyone, is it tasty?

2899
01:43:10,215 --> 01:43:11,515
- Yes.
- It's tasty.

2900
01:43:12,015 --> 01:43:13,854
- It's my first time eating it.
- Same here.

2901
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:16,785
By the way, aren't you nervous about getting...

2902
01:43:17,085 --> 01:43:18,185
tasty food?

2903
01:43:20,425 --> 01:43:23,195
(A wave of nervousness suddenly hits them.)

2904
01:43:24,195 --> 01:43:26,495
Young Jin, save your strength and unleash your potential later.

2905
01:43:28,065 --> 01:43:29,965
In the evening,

2906
01:43:30,405 --> 01:43:31,835
let's avoid placing last.

2907
01:43:32,205 --> 01:43:33,275
Let's place first.

2908
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:36,575
Enjoy the food.

2909
01:43:36,645 --> 01:43:37,744
Eat up when you can.

2910
01:43:37,745 --> 01:43:39,515
It might come back out today.

2911
01:43:39,775 --> 01:43:40,775
What do you mean by that?

2912
01:43:40,776 --> 01:43:42,015
(What's the legendary training for women who fight?)

2913
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:44,169
(We'll win no matter what.)

2914
01:43:44,499 --> 01:43:46,199
(We'll persevere until the end.)

2915
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,339
(The most powerful women in Korea)

2916
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:50,439
(With 16 women who fight, )

2917
01:43:51,209 --> 01:43:52,739
(they'll have the most intense physical training.)

2918
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:55,139
(From the set, )

2919
01:43:56,009 --> 01:43:57,879
(you can feel their superhuman physique.)

2920
01:43:58,149 --> 01:43:59,519
(Will the girls get on their knees?)

2921
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:01,819
(No! Sports is all about a twist!)

2922
01:44:02,049 --> 01:44:03,849
(Among strong participants...)

2923
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:05,889
(comes an eliminated member no one expected.)

2924
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:07,558
(The team that was most likely to win, )

2925
01:44:07,559 --> 01:44:08,989
(Team Wrestling gets disqualified?)

2926
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:11,029
(We have a chance!)

2927
01:44:11,229 --> 01:44:13,429
(If they don't give up until the end, )

2928
01:44:13,659 --> 01:44:15,859
(they might win.)

2929
01:44:16,369 --> 01:44:17,828
(They just need one more step...)

2930
01:44:17,829 --> 01:44:19,839
(to turn the tables.)

2931
01:44:20,539 --> 01:44:23,009
(Will they seize victory?)

2932
01:44:23,509 --> 01:44:25,369
(In only 2 weeks, )

2933
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:27,979
(the Iron Girls become boxers.)

2934
01:44:28,579 --> 01:44:31,209
(But they still have a long way to go.)

2935
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:33,419
(To become a champion, )

2936
01:44:33,749 --> 01:44:35,448
(they'll fight in earnest!)

2937
01:44:35,449 --> 01:44:36,789
(Will they fight among themselves?)

2938
01:44:36,949 --> 01:44:38,589
(Shy face...)

2939
01:44:38,819 --> 01:44:40,559
(and a not-so-shy punch)

2940
01:44:40,789 --> 01:44:42,659
(It's a matter of pride.)

2941
01:44:42,889 --> 01:44:44,729
(The more they punch, )

2942
01:44:44,889 --> 01:44:46,929
(their madness for each other grows.)

2943
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:48,758
(There's no hierarchy.)

2944
01:44:48,759 --> 01:44:49,799
(For goodness' sake)

2945
01:44:49,969 --> 01:44:52,029
(What will be the result of the match for hierarchy?)
