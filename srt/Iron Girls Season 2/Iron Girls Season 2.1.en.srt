1
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:19,981
(One scorching day in June)

2
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:21,781
- Go for it! One more hit! - You can do it.

3
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,612
- Those were some great punches. - That's right.

4
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,351
- Keep going! - Keep going.

5
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:27,981
- Move faster. - Guard up!

6
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,022
Keep your guard up!

7
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:32,422
Stop.

8
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,092
Breathe.

9
00:00:37,532 --> 00:00:40,761
All right. 1, 2, 3...

10
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:42,731
(Scared)

11
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:45,102
(The opponent is scary.)

12
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:46,571
That's it. Again.

13
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:47,901
(Afraid)

14
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,341
(Afraid of pain)

15
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,442
Gosh.

16
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:54,512
Turn.

17
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,611
(Exhausted)

18
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:58,612
(Even 3 minutes feels like forever.)

19
00:00:59,282 --> 00:01:01,221
Two, three...

20
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,951
(Still, they keep moving.)

21
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:06,761
(Still, they push through.)

22
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:09,631
(Still, they take on the challenge.)

23
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,902
(They take on boxing.)

24
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,872
(Iron Girls is back.)

25
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:24,572
(tvN's madness is back on.)

26
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,082
(This time, it's boxing.)

27
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:30,282
(Boxing)

28
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:33,082
(ESPN's number 1 toughest sport of 2020)

29
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,552
(Inside the squared ring)

30
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:37,952
(Using only their fists)

31
00:01:38,192 --> 00:01:40,192
(Fighting 1 on 1)

32
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:43,662
(A sport where you're on your own in the fight)

33
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:46,532
(In 2024, there were 1,916 boxing gyms nationwide.)

34
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:50,372
(The hottest sport at this very moment)

35
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:52,642
Never in my life...

36
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,642
have I thought that I'd be doing anything related to boxing.

37
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:57,041
That sound when you hit.

38
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,171
(A sport she has wanted to try)

39
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,742
I want to start learning soon.

40
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,781
I think I'd be better at boxing than Uie.

41
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:03,952
(A sport Ju Hyun is confident in)

42
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,581
It looks fun.

43
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:07,852
I just think it's something that needs to be done.

44
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,252
Nothing is impossible.

45
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:14,262
(They took on the challenge of boxing.)

46
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:17,892
(She has insane stamina.)

47
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:22,102
(Her punches are so powerful that even Captain Kim is surprised.)

48
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:25,802
(Their captain with iron stamina, Uie)

49
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:30,942
(She's a natural-born fighter with madness in her eyes.)

50
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,012
One, two.

51
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:35,011
(Even to the very end,)

52
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:36,812
(she keeps getting back up like a zombie.)

53
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,482
(A zombie boxer driven by madness, Park Ju Hyun)

54
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:43,852
(Flawless footwork)

55
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:45,721
- Gosh. - Nice.

56
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:46,891
(Incredible punching power)

57
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:47,922
(Mouths open in awe)

58
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:51,862
(The undeniable ace of boxing, Seol In Ah)

59
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:56,402
(A new member with flawless posture in every move)

60
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,531
(What's even more amazing than her form is...)

61
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,541
(Hit me!)

62
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,311
(her energy.)

63
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,372
(Shouting)

64
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,142
(She takes hit after hit,)

65
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:08,182
(but never backs down.)

66
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:11,682
(Bursting with confidence, Rocky Keum, Keum Sae Rok)

67
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:14,082
(The time they're given...)

68
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,022
(is 120 days.)

69
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:20,292
(They must overcome...)

70
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:23,692
(their dread of fighting 1 on 1.)

71
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:28,061
She's fighting a lonely battle all by herself.

72
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:31,671
(They're fighting alone.)

73
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:35,612
(They're fighting together.)

74
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:39,881
(Together with teammates who believe in each other...)

75
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:43,012
(more than they believe in themselves)

76
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:48,382
(They hurt together.)

77
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:53,662
(They sweat together.)

78
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:58,392
(They cry together.)

79
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:02,902
(The bloody, sweaty, tearful journey to becoming boxing champions)

80
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,631
- KO! - Iron...

81
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:06,341
- Girls! - Girls!

82
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:07,372
(Begins now)

83
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:11,242
(Two months ago)

84
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:16,452
(This place doesn't quite suit the Iron Girls.)

85
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,022
Hello.

86
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:21,622
Hello.

87
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:23,921
Hello.

88
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:26,762
(Uie)

89
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,562
(She makes a graceful entrance.)

90
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,062
Am I the first to arrive?

91
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:32,801
Hello.

92
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:34,201
(I dressed up a little today.)

93
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:35,901
I think I'll go home now.

94
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,202
(Instantly feeling awkward)

95
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:40,702
I'm more dressed up now than I usually am at award shows.

96
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,512
How does this make sense?

97
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:45,342
This will be the first and last time I show up here in hair and makeup.

98
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,212
(Don't forget this face.)

99
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,642
(Uie only got dressed up for the first episode.)

100
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:54,082
(Walking in with all the elegance in the world is...)

101
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:57,122
(Park Ju Hyun)

102
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,592
(Uie bursts into laughter as soon as she sees her.)

103
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:05,231
(Walking awkwardly)

104
00:05:05,232 --> 00:05:07,001
Uie. Let me see.

105
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,131
(Laughing)

106
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:09,472
Aren't you showing too much skin?

107
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,932
- Hello. - Hello.

108
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:13,602
It's a pleasure to meet you.

109
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,001
It really is a pleasure to finally meet you.

110
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:17,111
I can't believe I'm meeting actress Park Ju Hyun for the first time.

111
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:19,241
- I'm such a fan. - I see. It's been a while.

112
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,882
Aren't the shoulder pads a bit too much?

113
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:23,212
Your hair looks a bit too wet.

114
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:25,252
You're going to catch a cold.

115
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,351
Did you just get back from a run?

116
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,352
(They exchange warm greetings.)

117
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:30,252
You know this is our only opportunity, right?

118
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,152
Let's stick to being demure.

119
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:34,062
Water?

120
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:37,331
Did you just say oolong tea?

121
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,762
- Sure. I'll have some oolong tea. - "Oolong tea."

122
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:39,902
Are you thirsty?

123
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,202
How about cheers?

124
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:45,072
(While the two are fully immersed in their moment,)

125
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:48,372
(another Iron Girl enters the building.)

126
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:55,482
(Seol In Ah)

127
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:57,381
I'm sorry, but you two are...

128
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,251
being such celebrities right now.

129
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:01,651
- I'm sorry, but so are you. - You're right.

130
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,752
You know what? She'll be sitting next to you.

131
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,191
What am I going to do? Can you switch seats with me?

132
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,722
(One seat remains vacant.)

133
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,061
If it weren't for her injury, Seo Yeon would have...

134
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,931
Right. You're the eldest now.

135
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,101
Yes, I'm the eldest now.

136
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,561
(This isn't Seo Yeon's seat?)

137
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:18,231
The memories we made while working out together.

138
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,842
I miss them so much. I wish I could join them.

139
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,302
I love them so much.

140
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,811
But I've been receiving treatment for my wrist injury for a long time.

141
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:28,442
So I won't be joining the Iron Girls this time.

142
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,111
Boxing is actually scary.

143
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,581
The idea of having to hit the other person...

144
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:36,751
must be terrifying for them.

145
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,192
But once they step into the ring,

146
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:41,562
their eyes will probably harden instantly.

147
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,332
To my Iron Girls.

148
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:48,102
I have faith that you'll end up becoming champions.

149
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,272
There's no giving up inside the ring.

150
00:06:50,372 --> 00:06:52,942
You can't throw in the towel. Got it?

151
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,541
I'll be keeping my eye on you until the very end.

152
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:56,942
(I'll be cheering you on until the very end.)

153
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,612
When we meet our new member,

154
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:03,312
I plan to come across as reserved.

155
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:04,681
(Who will be making Ju Hyun act shy and reserved?)

156
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,122
- Did you say mature? You? - Yes, I'm going to be mature.

157
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,951
In Ah, you're also shy around new people.

158
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:10,251
I'm very shy around new people.

159
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,621
- In Ah is the worst one. - Right.

160
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:12,662
What am I going to do?

161
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:14,892
(Peeking)

162
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:19,091
Hello.

163
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:21,902
(The new Iron Girl who will be embarking on a boxing journey)

164
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,232
(Nice to meet you)

165
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,872
(From irresistibly charming romantic roles...)

166
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:34,212
(to intense action sequences, she nails them all.)

167
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:38,111
(The new Iron Girl is Keum Sae Rok.)

168
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,181
Yes.

169
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:40,651
Are you the second oldest...

170
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:44,391
- out of the four of us? - Yes, I am the second oldest.

171
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:45,521
What year were you born in?

172
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,422
- I was born in 1992. - I see.

173
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,761
So you weren't born in the 1980s.

174
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,991
(The second oldest, eldest, third oldest, youngest)

175
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,961
- Gosh, Uie. - I'm kind of nervous...

176
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:54,901
- and somewhat scared. - I'm sorry, but...

177
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,631
you were dressed in a white dress and sneakers when you came in.

178
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,032
So we're even more nervous.

179
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:02,141
Like you were at a photoshoot with the white dress and...

180
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,012
(Sneakers?)

181
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,571
(Sae Rok made a bold fashion statement upon arrival.)

182
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,811
I wanted to show...

183
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,182
my energy today, so I wore sneakers.

184
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:11,181
You're all so dressed up,

185
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,151
unlike how you were on the show.

186
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,351
- This is the first and last time. - I see. Right.

187
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:16,491
- We usually... - Being dressed up.

188
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,551
Since we don't need hair, makeup, and styling,

189
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:19,762
- it doesn't cost us much. - Yes.

190
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,591
- It's very cost-effective. - That's the best part.

191
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,932
We did try showing up with makeup on, but...

192
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:25,932
- Everything came off. - Right.

193
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,402
So did you really keep filming...

194
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:29,931
without any makeup on?

195
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,002
- Yes. - Yes.

196
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:32,131
- Really? - But...

197
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:34,401
- sweating makes you look pretty. - It does?

198
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,611
- You can't create that with makeup. - She's right.

199
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:38,911
- It's a result of our hard work. - Our values. Right.

200
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,812
Also, are you always this pale?

201
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,541
- Me? Yes. - You're always this pale?

202
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,311
- You're going to get tan. - Just think of it like this.

203
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:45,451
The money you'll be saving on hair and makeup?

204
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:48,251
You can use it for skin whitening.

205
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:49,851
Right. It costs a lot of money.

206
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,292
You end up spending a lot after the show wraps up.

207
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,261
(This is what being on Iron Girls is like.)

208
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:54,322
That's true, though.

209
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:56,831
- Do you work out regularly? - Now...

210
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:59,132
I normally work out every day.

211
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,302
- So like, - Gosh.

212
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:04,271
I used to spend 2 to 3 hours at the gym every day.

213
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:06,441
Even when I'm filming,

214
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,371
If I'm being picked up at 4:30am,

215
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,371
I go to the gym at 1am...

216
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:12,012
to get rid of the puffiness.

217
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:14,882
Yes, I never thought...

218
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:18,112
I was bad at sports.

219
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:19,582
How should I put this?

220
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,481
I can feel...

221
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,091
all the muscles in my body.

222
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,621
I'm aware of them,

223
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:26,421
so I've always been confident...

224
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,922
when it comes to sports.

225
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:31,891
I want to be known as one of the leading actresses...

226
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:33,231
in Korea when it comes to action.

227
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:35,661
The film series by Ma Dong Seok,

228
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,331
"The Roundup."

229
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:39,441
I wanted to be cast in it,

230
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:44,772
so I decided to film myself and send it to him directly.

231
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:45,942
Action.

232
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,982
(Sae Rok is working hard to become an action star.)

233
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,192
(Not only does she train for action scenes,)

234
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,862
(but she also spends 2 to 3 hours at the gym every day.)

235
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,361
At the core of action training...

236
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:02,761
is boxing.

237
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:03,891
That's something I thought to myself.

238
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,331
If I take up boxing,

239
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,132
I can build my stamina.

240
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:08,461
And if I keep at it,

241
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:11,532
I could actually get cast in an action role.

242
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,602
(This isn't a performance.)

243
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,472
(Sae Rok will be showing you real action.)

244
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:21,082
- What concerns you the most? - Me?

245
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,151
I didn't have any huge concerns,

246
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,282
but they kept scaring me.

247
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:27,881
They said it was going to be very tough.

248
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:28,951
- It is very tough. - They're right.

249
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:30,922
- It's actually very tough. - It's very tough.

250
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:32,021
I don't think they were trying to scare you.

251
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,161
It's like this.

252
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:35,062
You think, "They'll probably finish up shooting right about now."

253
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,591
- But try doubling that. - Really?

254
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:39,331
When you've practically fainted from exhaustion,

255
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:42,061
- that's when they finish shooting. - I see. Really?

256
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:43,201
- Yes. - Then...

257
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,501
(If it's that tough...)

258
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:45,871
why are you doing this again?

259
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,442
(why are you doing this again?)

260
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,142
- Tell me about it. - Tell me about it.

261
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,671
- Tell me about it. - Why are we here?

262
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:52,842
Tell me about it.

263
00:10:53,342 --> 00:10:55,542
I actually couldn't ride a bike before this.

264
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,011
So I'd never thought that I would even enter...

265
00:10:58,012 --> 00:10:59,311
a competition for bike riding.

266
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,552
But I did, through this show.

267
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:04,352
That gave me a lot of courage that I can do anything.

268
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,451
So...

269
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:07,621
I wanted to get more courage...

270
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:09,461
through trying something new.

271
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,291
For me, I experienced emotions...

272
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,801
that I'd never felt before in my life.

273
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:13,862
That dopamine rush.

274
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,102
So I understood why people do this.

275
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,131
I wanted to do it again.

276
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,271
That's right. For me,

277
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:23,612
I did taekwondo when I was young.

278
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:25,171
That sense of impact...

279
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,582
you get from hitting the mat or when you're fighting someone.

280
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:29,682
And I enjoy combat sports to begin with.

281
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:32,711
There's something fascinating about...

282
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:35,121
fighting within the fair rules of a sport.

283
00:11:35,122 --> 00:11:36,122
(You're a true athlete.)

284
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,822
- That's cool. - That's just you.

285
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,422
I'm actually excited about this.

286
00:11:40,922 --> 00:11:42,492
That's why I wanted to do this again.

287
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:43,761
(Thinking)

288
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,361
Have you ever hit someone?

289
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:49,132
(Have you ever hit someone?)

290
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,532
Was that not mature of me to ask?

291
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:53,301
How do you feel about that?

292
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,772
- We have to hit people. - I've filmed action...

293
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:59,412
sequences through a drama called "The Fiery Priest,"

294
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:01,342
and I'm bad at hitting people.

295
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:03,081
I think about the pain...

296
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:06,521
the other person will be in even before I hit them, so...

297
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,821
I'm scared that I'll hurt my face from boxing.

298
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,351
Me too. I'm scared I might get injured.

299
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:11,721
Right. I don't want my face to be scratched up.

300
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:14,022
My biggest concern is feeling intimidated.

301
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:15,961
Being intimidated by my opponent.

302
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:17,962
The possibility of having trained this much...

303
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,332
but not being able to hit my opponent at least once.

304
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:21,732
That's what I'm afraid of the most.

305
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,271
But no matter how tough something may be,

306
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:26,031
don't you eventually see it through?

307
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,972
So isn't it...

308
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,441
just a matter of doing it?

309
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,772
(What?)

310
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,981
We're all people who always follow through.

311
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,412
(We will follow through.)

312
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,452
Maybe I'm like this because it's my first time.

313
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,281
- Her eyes are so... - Right.

314
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,351
full of life.

315
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:42,352
(Her eyes show that she doesn't know what lies ahead.)

316
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:43,491
- How can I explain this? - Being...

317
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,821
Being in the ring is...

318
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:47,761
So I was thinking that we'd go hang out...

319
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:50,991
and maybe work out hard for two hours...

320
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,132
- How many hours? - Two hours?

321
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,531
(Did I say something wrong?)

322
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,931
- What do you think this is? - Wait.

323
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,631
- Two hours? - When we meet up in the morning,

324
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,071
we finish up at night. What do you think we do all day?

325
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,102
We work out.

326
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:02,441
They let us sleep, we wake up,

327
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:03,711
and what do we do? We work out.

328
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:05,772
So then we don't get to have fun after we eat?

329
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,841
Like sightseeing or taking walks?

330
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,081
- We do. - Did you not watch Iron Girls?

331
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:11,111
We have fun while putting pain relief patches on each other.

332
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:13,381
I just pictured Sae Rok in tears on our first day of shooting.

333
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:15,482
(I just pictured Sae Rok in tears.)

334
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:19,092
(She actually does cry.)

335
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,761
I want to...

336
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,132
- I want to go home. - You did great.

337
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,202
So then...

338
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:27,802
what's our goal?

339
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,872
What's our goal?

340
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:31,602
The goal of Season Two is...

341
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,641
becoming boxing champions...

342
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,541
- within four months. - What?

343
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,211
- Did you say champions? - In four months?

344
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:39,112
Champions? As in winning?

345
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,882
The difference with Season One is that...

346
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,581
your first competition...

347
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:43,711
- is in three months. - What?

348
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,281
What did you say?

349
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,752
(There is more than one competition?)

350
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:51,822
Wait. You said we'll be competing in four months.

351
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:54,492
I'm getting a strange feeling.

352
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:56,832
We're not competing once. There are multiple competitions.

353
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,661
(I guess it's not a matter of just doing it.)

354
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,261
I've given this some thought.

355
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:03,631
As soon as the match begins, go for the jaw and knock them out.

356
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:04,731
I think of that a lot.

357
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,541
- Then we'll be done with one punch. - Right.

358
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,002
But that could be us, Ju Hyun.

359
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:09,841
The person who's finished with one punch.

360
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,272
That's why we have to hit first.

361
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:12,642
As soon as the match starts?

362
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:14,981
- I feel like it could work. - Wait,

363
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:16,552
can we die from this?

364
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,582
She's so innocent and cute.

365
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:21,921
Gosh, this is completely different.

366
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:23,691
It's completely different from Season One.

367
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:24,852
We're pressed for time, then.

368
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,992
Right. We're even more pressed for time than in Season One.

369
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:32,061
(A few days later)

370
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:36,371
(Hoengseong Indoor Stadium)

371
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,901
- Hello. - Is it here?

372
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,271
Hello.

373
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:43,142
(The Iron Girls came together again for the first training session.)

374
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:45,311
(Something feels missing.)

375
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:47,311
Where's our captain?

376
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:49,141
We can't leave out our captain...

377
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:50,711
- in boxing. - We definitely need him.

378
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,212
- We need our captain. - Isn't he the best in Korea?

379
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:53,952
- The captain is... - He finally...

380
00:14:54,252 --> 00:14:56,492
Hello.

381
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,191
Hello.

382
00:14:58,192 --> 00:14:59,251
(Kim Dong Hyun, the captain of the Iron Girls)

383
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:00,421
- Hello. - We're so glad to see you.

384
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,792
We're so glad to see you.

385
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,032
Hello.

386
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,291
- It's great to see me, right? - We're so glad to see you.

387
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,401
Hello.

388
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:07,862
How have you been?

389
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:08,961
Hello.

390
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,472
(The whole team is finally here.)

391
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,171
You all know what we're doing, right?

392
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,201
- Of course. - Right.

393
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,341
He's become arrogant.

394
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:16,771
- You can't underestimate me now. - Right.

395
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,641
- You're right. - You're right.

396
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:19,982
My nickname is...

397
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,811
- Stun Gun. - Right.

398
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:22,881
- With one punch, - A knockout?

399
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,182
my opponent was down.

400
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:26,521
That's my punching power.

401
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:27,522
People also call you Cicada.

402
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:29,121
They do. You can look forward.

403
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,222
I see there's a new member.

404
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:33,921
Hello.

405
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,191
There's a certain...

406
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:37,132
vibe, you know?

407
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:40,531
When you look at a person, you get a certain vibe.

408
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:42,332
Yours is a little concerning.

409
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:43,672
I feel like you could...

410
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,032
get scared easily...

411
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:48,971
and be physically weak. That's the vibe I get.

412
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,642
Doesn't he sound like a fortune teller?

413
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:53,381
- What I'm... - Since he has experience.

414
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:55,911
Boxing comes down to punching style.

415
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:57,751
So tough people...

416
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,212
who like hitting enjoy it.

417
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:00,722
People who are like carnivores.

418
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:02,381
But I feel like...

419
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:03,892
you're closer to a herbivore.

420
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,651
I'll have to keep watching to get to know you better.

421
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,891
I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also a little worried.

422
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,131
To be honest, when I heard that Season Two will be about boxing,

423
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,232
I thought Uie...

424
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,401
- would drop out. - Right?

425
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:16,901
I personally think this is a huge challenge for Uie.

426
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,071
- You're right. - The way I see it.

427
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,501
- It's because she can't hit people. - Not once in my life.

428
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,571
That's right, but...

429
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:22,771
I'm going to give it a try.

430
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,541
I'm excited to see that. What about you, In Ah?

431
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,282
I want to see if I'm a hot-blooded carnivore.

432
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,281
She's a carnivore.

433
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:31,611
You're a lion, the king of animals.

434
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:32,751
"Hey, you!"

435
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:35,051
She's actually the one person I don't want to...

436
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:36,551
- spar with the most. - Why not?

437
00:16:36,552 --> 00:16:38,522
- You're really scary. - Right.

438
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,462
I've tried jiu-jitsu with her before.

439
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:42,891
(Gosh)

440
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,032
- I see. - She was just...

441
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,461
(Dong Hyun, In Ah)

442
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:48,632
(She charged at him without hesitation.)

443
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:50,502
- I got you. - Turn.

444
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:53,472
(She threw him down hard.)

445
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:54,972
Referee!

446
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,412
(In Ah fully subdued Dong Hyun.)

447
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,641
- I'm a beginner, though. - Among all lions,

448
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:01,781
she's the type to become the leader of the pride.

449
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,511
Let me be precise.

450
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,211
She's still a young cub,

451
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,351
but she has what it takes to become king.

452
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:08,852
- She's basically Simba. Simba Seol. - That's cute.

453
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:10,521
- I'm serious. - You're like Simba.

454
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,321
(Simba Seol)

455
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,292
Ju Hyun, as a boxer, the vibe you give off...

456
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,362
is madness.

457
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,131
- I think she's going to kill it. - What I mean is that...

458
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,331
she's neither herbivore nor carnivore.

459
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,632
She's just someone with madness.

460
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:24,071
She'll be back on her feet after getting hit.

461
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:25,271
She'll be back on her feet after taking a fall.

462
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,641
She'll be like this.

463
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:28,201
She'll be wearing her opponent down.

464
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:29,271
(Wearing her opponent down)

465
00:17:29,272 --> 00:17:31,072
- Seriously. - "Wearing the opponent down?"

466
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,482
I'm curious to see how she fights.

467
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:36,551
Anyway, that was my blunt assessment of the four of you.

468
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,652
As the captain of the Iron Girls,

469
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:39,851
I've prepared something...

470
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,081
incredible and special.

471
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:42,452
You might go inside and...

472
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,922
run right back out when you see what it is.

473
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:47,162
- Why? What is it? - Come on.

474
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,492
- How do you feel, Sae Rok? - I'm scared.

475
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,961
It won't be hard right away, right?

476
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:53,802
Sae Rok. This is just the beginning.

477
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,731
Hey, please pay attention.

478
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,241
- Everyone. - We're going.

479
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,001
- Come this way. - Hey, is this...

480
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,571
- like a theater? - This way.

481
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:04,942
- Amazing. No way. - I know.

482
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,982
(What brings them to a place where you can't see a thing?)

483
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,735
(What brings them to a place where you can't see a thing?)

484
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,364
- This way. - Are they showing us the ring?

485
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,404
What? No way.

486
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,475
- I'm sure this is the ring. - What is this?

487
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,105
- See? I told you! - Gosh.

488
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:23,615
See? I told you!

489
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:25,275
It's so cool.

490
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,555
(The boxing ring for the Iron Girls)

491
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,555
(A Blood, Sweat and Tears Journey to be the Boxing Champion)

492
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:39,925
(Iron Girls 2)

493
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,235
What is this?

494
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:47,764
This is so cool.

495
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:48,804
Gosh.

496
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:51,104
Gosh, Iron Girls...

497
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:52,704
has gotten even bigger in scale.

498
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:55,574
If singers have their concerts,

499
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:56,844
fighters have...

500
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,444
- the boxing ring. - Yes.

501
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,445
Their stage.

502
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,155
- What? - What's up with this scale?

503
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:10,154
I knew that we would see the venue for the match,

504
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,754
but I didn't think it would be set up just for us.

505
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:15,225
Have you ever seen an actual boxing match?

506
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:16,964
- No. - Not in person.

507
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:17,994
- I see. - Just on television.

508
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:19,765
I prepared something amazing today.

509
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,304
- What? - What is it?

510
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,335
- I'm scared. - What is that bow tie?

511
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:24,674
- Some people are coming. - What?

512
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,004
- It's scary. - What do we do?

513
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,205
They are the referees.

514
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:29,275
This many?

515
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,314
(The 5 referees have bow ties on.)

516
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,874
One of them is the head referee,

517
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,875
(The head referee is in the ring.)

518
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,344
The four referees on the side...

519
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:36,654
check the scores.

520
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:37,684
(The 4 referees are placed on each side of the ring.)

521
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,355
To see who is winning.

522
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:40,724
(Then what about the players?)

523
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,354
- Then who is playing? - There must be more coming.

524
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,225
There must be someone else coming here.

525
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,095
- This can't be it. - Gosh.

526
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:48,864
- What is it? - What is it?

527
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,295
- That scared me. - What?

528
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,335
2025, Iron Girls Season 2.

529
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:55,505
We will begin the long-awaited...

530
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,774
special match that will announce the start.

531
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,045
- What? - It's a special match.

532
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,645
They must be having a match. That's scary.

533
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,645
First, in the red corner...

534
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:07,015
- Goodness. - Gosh.

535
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:08,785
- Who is it? - Gosh.

536
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,414
- Who is it? - Gosh.

537
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,915
- Gosh. - It's a woman.

538
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:18,025
- Who is it? - Gosh.

539
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,725
27 years old.

540
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,765
- Height, 165cm. - Gosh.

541
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:26,535
The bronze medalist of the 2024 Paris Olympics...

542
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:28,965
Women's Boxing 54kg class.

543
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:35,805
South Korea's first-ever...

544
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:39,115
female boxing Olympic medallist,

545
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:44,555
Fighter Lim Ae Ji.

546
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,785
- What? - I know her!

547
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,684
I know her.

548
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:49,824
She's so cool.

549
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:50,894
- She's so cool. - I can't believe it.

550
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,595
- Gosh. - Gosh, she's so cool.

551
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,025
She is South Korea's first Olympic medallist,

552
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:57,695
Fighter Lim Ae Ji.

553
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,004
She's an Olympic bronze medallist.

554
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:03,435
Why are you here?

555
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,534
Over here.

556
00:21:04,535 --> 00:21:06,074
- She's so cool. - She's so cool.

557
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:07,945
- She will stand in her corner. - Hello.

558
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:10,614
- She's so cool. - She's so cool.

559
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,414
Hello.

560
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:14,914
She's in the red corner.

561
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,385
So that's how you stand?

562
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,985
- Next, the blue corner. - The blue corner.

563
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,425
What?

564
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:28,195
It says, "KOR" on her back. That's cool.

565
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,064
35 years old.

566
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:34,865
- Look at her muscles. - Height, 169cm.

567
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:35,905
- Gosh. - Gosh.

568
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,244
2020 Tokyo Olympics Women's Boxing 51kg class.

569
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,475
(She competed in the Tokyo Olympics.)

570
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:44,714
A good southpaw left.

571
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:45,745
She goes around.

572
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:47,844
(Video from OTAB)

573
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:51,615
The national fighter of the 2024 Paris Olympics...

574
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,985
Women's Boxing 50kg class.

575
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,155
Jung Ju Hyeong.

576
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:02,194
You're so cool.

577
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,795
She looks so strong.

578
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:07,105
- We have to actually watch this? - This is so...

579
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,134
- I'm getting goosebumps. - What?

580
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,334
I'm getting goosebumps.

581
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:11,774
(They participated in this special match...)

582
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,105
(for the growth of women's boxing.)

583
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:14,304
- Wait a minute. - Oh, no.

584
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:15,774
- I don't think I can. - We have to actually watch this?

585
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,045
It's my first time watching it.

586
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:19,614
We're watching the match of national players.

587
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:20,845
I'm getting goosebumps.

588
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:22,915
Is this something we can do?

589
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,455
- They are both so cool. - National players.

590
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:26,925
Good luck.

591
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:29,324
(The mouthpiece)

592
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:30,855
They put on their mouthpieces.

593
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:33,624
The headgear may look like it protects the head,

594
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,925
- I don't think it will. - but the front part is open.

595
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:37,594
I don't think I should watch this.

596
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,595
I don't think I can do it if I watch this.

597
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:41,064
I think we'll get scared If we watch it in advance.

598
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:42,905
- Player. - He's checking.

599
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,974
- Amazing. - To see if there's anything banned,

600
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:47,174
and if she has all the safety gear.

601
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:48,675
How many minutes is it?

602
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,344
Is it three minutes?

603
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:51,675
(Iron Girls 2)

604
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,114
International Olympic boxing matches...

605
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:55,345
consist of 3 rounds, 3 minutes each,

606
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,714
but the recreational boxing matches you will participate in...

607
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:00,355
consists of 2 rounds, 1 minute and 30 seconds each.

608
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,255
So today's match...

609
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:05,155
will be 2 rounds, 1 minute and 30 seconds each.

610
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:09,125
Players, forward.

611
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:10,535
Do not hold each other,

612
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,295
- do not hit below the belt, - Yes.

613
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,604
- and stay away from the box. - Yes.

614
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:14,635
You may greet each other.

615
00:23:16,135 --> 00:23:17,135
Fighter Lim Ae Ji...

616
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,104
Okay. Fighter Lim Ae Ji...

617
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,105
(Hitting)

618
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:21,904
Some people will show...

619
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:24,044
their energy to intimidate the opponent.

620
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,645
They're really doing it.

621
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:27,484
Oh, no. They're starting, you guys.

622
00:23:27,485 --> 00:23:28,944
My heart is shaking. Why am I shaking?

623
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:30,115
Oh, no. Can we...

624
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:33,454
(1 minute and 30 seconds, Round 1, Start)

625
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,554
Oh, no.

626
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,084
The game is starting.

627
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,155
It's good to start the game by touching gloves.

628
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,195
She's fast.

629
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:47,065
(The two players stay away and explore each other.)

630
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:52,034
(She avoids the punch with swift movements.)

631
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:53,944
That's so cool.

632
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:55,374
(She's so cool when she avoids it.)

633
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,814
- I keep avoiding with her. - Uie.

634
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,215
I keep going like this.

635
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,414
Gosh, I think she will get hit.

636
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:02,945
- She can reach so far. - Yes.

637
00:24:06,485 --> 00:24:12,294
(Ju Hyeong strikes Ae Ji in the face.)

638
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,025
- Gosh. - Goodness, I'm scared.

639
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:15,195
(Breathing out)

640
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:17,065
How are we supposed to...

641
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:19,235
(Gosh)

642
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:20,505
(Simba Seol is falling in)

643
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:26,844
(Ae Ji's counterattack)

644
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,174
(She strikes Ju Hyeong in the face.)

645
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,245
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

646
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,345
I can't believe I have to do that.

647
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:34,244
It's so scary.

648
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,645
(Can we really do that?)

649
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,514
- Goodness. - They're really getting hit.

650
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:40,824
Their energy is coming up.

651
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,085
(They become even more fierce.)

652
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:43,525
Gosh, she almost got hit.

653
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,695
(Swish)

654
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:53,534
(Swish)

655
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,864
Why do they make that sound?

656
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:58,105
They need to breath along with the movements,

657
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,245
- so you can't help but make that. - The energy goes with it.

658
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:03,744
(They take heavy breaths.)

659
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:04,845
Oh, no.

660
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:07,614
(Their hands and feet don't rest at all.)

661
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:08,844
Gosh, that's so fast.

662
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:10,184
Yes, they're so fast. How do we do that?

663
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,485
(Their hands and feet don't stop for a moment for the entire match.)

664
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,155
- They have amazing steps, though. - Yes.

665
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:16,124
There are different styles in boxing,

666
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,794
and they are both out-boxers.

667
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:19,454
- Out-boxers? - Staying on the outside...

668
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:21,224
- and fighting with distance. - I see.

669
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,494
(Out-boxers use their footwork...)

670
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:24,035
(to hit and pull back, using the ring extensively.)

671
00:25:25,635 --> 00:25:31,975
(They keep a good distance from the opponent.)

672
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,204
(They have a lot of footwork to keep distance,)

673
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,615
(which uses a lot of their physical strength.)

674
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:40,184
So they don't keep penetrating?

675
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:42,215
That's an in-fighter. They keep going for it.

676
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,785
Like Mike Tyson.

677
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:46,984
(Video from YouTube BOXXER)

678
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:50,354
(In-fighters aggressively close the distance...)

679
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,665
(and engage their opponents from up close.)

680
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:58,335
When it's 10 seconds before the match ends,

681
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:00,335
- Ten seconds? - they ring the warning bell.

682
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:03,905
Let's go!

683
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:07,975
Okay, stop.

684
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:11,745
(1 minute and 30 seconds, Round 1 is finished.)

685
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:16,215
Did you hear them ring the bell 10 seconds before?

686
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:17,784
It's the end of the round,

687
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,354
so either go all in, or get ready to end.

688
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:22,524
That 1 minute and 30 seconds felt so long.

689
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:23,525
A minute and 30 seconds?

690
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:25,225
If you're up there, it will feel like 10 minutes.

691
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:27,224
- When you're up there. - Oh, no.

692
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:28,765
When the round ends,

693
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,064
you get a short rest period,

694
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:35,604
your cornermen will bring water and throw in quick tactics.

695
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:36,904
That's so cool.

696
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,105
(They revise tactics and rest with the cornermen.)

697
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:40,945
(Second out, 10 seconds before the rest period is over)

698
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,045
- Second out. - Why is it so short?

699
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,344
- What? - It's already over?

700
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,914
- Let's go! - Let's go!

701
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:48,045
That feels like five seconds.

702
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:51,555
(1 minute and 30 seconds, Round 2, Start)

703
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,255
- The last round. - This is the last round.

704
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:56,324
(The two players throw punches as soon as it begins.)

705
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,525
Goodness.

706
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:04,065
(They exchange close punches.)

707
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:07,404
(Round 2 becomes even more intense.)

708
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:08,434
- Gosh. - I'm scared.

709
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:09,504
That's intense.

710
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,835
Their stamina is so...

711
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,214
(Ju Hyeong's punch hits her face again.)

712
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:19,514
Oh, no.

713
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,314
It's starting. It's getting stronger.

714
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:24,055
Gosh, she's really getting hit.

715
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:25,915
That's so cool.

716
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:28,854
(Simba Seol's blood is boiling.)

717
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,294
You can appeal to the referee during the last round.

718
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,354
How?

719
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:36,495
If you go all out in the final round,

720
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:38,734
it can make it seem like you dominated the fight.

721
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,534
That way, you can gain the upper hand in the judges' decision,

722
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,705
which is why fighters go all in during the final round.

723
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:45,604
(They punch each other in the face and stomach.)

724
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:46,835
Counter.

725
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:51,045
(A punch to the face, a punch to the stomach)

726
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:56,814
(The match is building to a thrilling peak.)

727
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:58,254
It's so scary.

728
00:27:58,255 --> 00:27:59,555
Please be careful.

729
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,754
I can't handle it.

730
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,025
(They become immersed in the match.)

731
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,864
(After this round,)

732
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:11,295
(the winner will be decided by the referee.)

733
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:13,804
(Both players put in all their strength.)

734
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:16,405
- Let's go. - Let's go.

735
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,404
(10 seconds before the match ends)

736
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,645
Only 10 seconds left.

737
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:22,544
Only 10 seconds left.

738
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:23,644
(They keep throwing punches until the end.)

739
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:25,445
That must be so strong.

740
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,115
They still have some energy left.

741
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:28,715
Stop.

742
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,014
(Round 2 ends)

743
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,755
- You're so cool. - Gosh. They're...

744
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:35,924
How cool.

745
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,724
- You're so cool. - You're so cool.

746
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:39,325
Thank you.

747
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,095
Gosh, that's so cool.

748
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,894
They dedicated their lives to boxing.

749
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:46,765
(They had a match together even with different weight classes.)

750
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:49,965
I can't believe I watched that.

751
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,004
- Good job. - Thank you.

752
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,704
(It was an honor to watch the match of the national players.)

753
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:54,875
Thank you.

754
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,144
- Thank you. - Good job.

755
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,645
Gosh, they are so cool.

756
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:00,684
It's shocking.

757
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:01,715
(The hot match ends.)

758
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:03,515
- Let's go down there. - Yes.

759
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:06,754
The ring is bigger than I thought.

760
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:08,124
It's so big.

761
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,055
- It's so big. - They're so cool.

762
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,295
(It feels much bigger up close.)

763
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:14,464
- Hello. - Hello.

764
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:15,465
- Hello. - Do we go in like this?

765
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:17,194
This is my first ring entrance.

766
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:18,264
Gosh.

767
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:19,335
- Wait. - We will help.

768
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:20,665
- Like this? - Yes, like this.

769
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,365
This all feels off, right from the entrance.

770
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:25,404
- Hello. - Hello.

771
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:27,675
- You were so cool. - Nice to meet you.

772
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,104
You were so cool.

773
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:30,304
- Thank you. - Thank you.

774
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:31,814
- You seem so shy... - Hello.

775
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:33,745
- in person. - Right?

776
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:35,545
They are so...

777
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:37,415
How can they smile like this.

778
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:38,814
They are so cute.

779
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:40,884
They're so different from moments ago.

780
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:42,754
How did you start boxing?

781
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:46,524
- I told my parents I wanted to, - First?

782
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:48,694
- but they said no. - Of course.

783
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,064
Their pretty daughter could get hurt in the face.

784
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,294
They said no,

785
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,365
so I got more worked up.

786
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:55,304
I started practicing,

787
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:57,504
- and I went home with scratches... - Yes.

788
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,034
and bruises all over me.

789
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:00,134
My parents said,

790
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:02,405
"Then what did you do?"

791
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,844
- "How many bruises did you give?" - "Make one more bruise."

792
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:05,914
Usually, if you get hurt,

793
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,844
they would say, "I told you not to."

794
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:09,084
"Then what did you do?"

795
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:10,484
"You need to make the same bruises."

796
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:12,554
- Yes, that's it. - So that's what happened?

797
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,284
They have a competitive side. I see.

798
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:15,924
Then what about you, Ju Hyeong?

799
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,654
- How did you start boxing? - For me,

800
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:20,254
- I started when I was 28. - What?

801
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:21,424
(She started at a relatively older age.)

802
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,425
Really?

803
00:30:22,426 --> 00:30:25,064
That's almost impossible.

804
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:28,135
Starting at 28, and going to the Olympics as a national player.

805
00:30:28,465 --> 00:30:32,234
I also started in recreational sports,

806
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:34,645
but I started playing in matches...

807
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,904
- after 3 to 4 months. - What?

808
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:38,444
- Just like us. - It's like our situation.

809
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,915
At the end of my first year,

810
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:42,844
as soon as I stepped into the ring,

811
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,015
I threw one punch and that was it.

812
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:45,584
- With a punch? - Was it a KO?

813
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:47,685
It took 15 seconds. She was knocked out right away.

814
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,195
(Ju Hyeong)

815
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:53,925
She won.

816
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,251
(The match ended in 10 seconds due to her unmatched skills.)

817
00:30:59,252 --> 00:31:01,251
Is it over? My gosh.

818
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:02,422
(The match ended in 10 seconds due to her unmatched skills.)

819
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,361
They told me I shouldn't come here anymore...

820
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,261
and that I should go somewhere else,

821
00:31:06,262 --> 00:31:07,262
whether it's the professional or the amateur league.

822
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:09,161
That's what happened,

823
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:10,861
and after a year in the amateur league,

824
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:12,261
I became the national player.

825
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:14,101
Then you were born with it.

826
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:16,131
- That's not easy. - You don't see knockouts...

827
00:31:16,132 --> 00:31:18,142
in recreational sports matches.

828
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:20,571
But she threw a knockout in 15 seconds,

829
00:31:20,572 --> 00:31:23,111
which means she has an amazing punch power.

830
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:24,142
She's incredible.

831
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:26,981
I went to a physical education high school,

832
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,511
and I had boxer friends.

833
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,151
When I saw those who won medals,

834
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,882
no one was left unscathed.

835
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:35,152
They're...

836
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,221
Right?

837
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:38,521
They always have a bruise somewhere,

838
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:43,332
or are really skinny because of the weight class.

839
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:45,261
What is it about boxing...

840
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:46,561
that makes you go through all that?

841
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:48,201
It's really tough,

842
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:49,431
but I keep thinking, "Once more."

843
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:50,432
"Just one more punch."

844
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,702
Even when I feel like giving up,

845
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:53,601
I think, "I just need one more. Just until there."

846
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:54,911
And then, before you know it,

847
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,511
it's yours.

848
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:58,341
(You see yourself grow before you realize it.)

849
00:31:58,342 --> 00:32:00,342
It's always a 1-on-1 match,

850
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:03,252
so my skills may have improved this much,

851
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,582
the opponent can still be much better.

852
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:08,092
I'm sure there's always that situation.

853
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,121
The fact that I worked hard...

854
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,392
is separate from how good that person is.

855
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:13,991
So you don't think "Why did I lose?"

856
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:16,062
"I did better than yesterday, so that's fine."

857
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,631
I think that's how it goes.

858
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:19,601
In the end, it's a battle with yourself.

859
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:21,902
- It's about seeing a better me. - Yes.

860
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:24,601
They gathered for the first time today.

861
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:26,901
I had my first win...

862
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:29,071
after 3 to 4 months,

863
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,042
so I am confident that you will all be champions.

864
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,781
You will be, for sure. Good luck.

865
00:32:33,782 --> 00:32:34,811
- Let's go! - Let's go!

866
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:36,751
I saw your will to win during the triathlon,

867
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,652
so I believe that you will all make it.

868
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:39,922
- Really? - Good luck.

869
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:41,421
- Thank you. - Thank you.

870
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:42,722
- Thank you. - Good luck.

871
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:46,722
- Let's sit. - Let's sit.

872
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,931
- Gosh. I'm tired. - I was nervous.

873
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,591
Now that they're gone,

874
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:52,101
my legs are giving in.

875
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:53,801
- I was excited, to be honest. - Yes.

876
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:55,131
I was excited to think that...

877
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:56,931
I would be fighting in this ring,

878
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,171
but to use her expression,

879
00:32:58,172 --> 00:32:59,771
she said that she felt like throwing up.

880
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:01,511
My stomach was lurching.

881
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,111
We don't often get to see...

882
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,011
- people hitting each other. - Exactly.

883
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:08,211
Even when there's a fight on the street,

884
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:10,151
- we just go like this. - Right. That's all we do.

885
00:33:10,152 --> 00:33:12,552
But they had to keep going.

886
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,691
I couldn't get used to the sight.

887
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,251
I feel like I shouldn't have watched it,

888
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:18,961
because it scares me more.

889
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:23,392
I saw what I actually had to do.

890
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,701
And 1 minute and 30 seconds seems too long.

891
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:26,731
I know.

892
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:29,902
I felt that if I didn't train really hard,

893
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:32,341
it would all be over for me.

894
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:34,872
When I was watching, it didn't seem that long.

895
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:38,281
A minute and 30 seconds didn't seem that long.

896
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,781
It may seem short...

897
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,751
since you already completed the triathlon in three hours.

898
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:43,011
But you will see...

899
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,081
- Right. - that it's different from that.

900
00:33:44,082 --> 00:33:46,521
I think it will be the longest minute and a half in my life.

901
00:33:46,522 --> 00:33:48,421
- It could be. - Seriously.

902
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:49,491
(Sighing)

903
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:51,261
To be honest, I'm not sure. No matter what we say,

904
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,891
- Yes, we don't have the experience. - it's different...

905
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:54,592
from actually having the experience.

906
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,692
If we could have...

907
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:59,861
a sort of sparring in the ring...

908
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:01,902
- Who will the opponent be? - I'm scared.

909
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:03,702
Who will we do that with?

910
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,102
(Who will the Iron Girls get to experience it with?)

911
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:08,071
You can all hit me with full power.

912
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:09,571
- Give me the gloves. - I want to try.

913
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:10,811
- Gloves. - Me.

914
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:12,041
- Seriously. - This could be my only chance...

915
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,281
to get to hit this guy.

916
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:16,052
- Promise me. - Okay.

917
00:34:16,312 --> 00:34:17,781
If you're going to do it,

918
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:19,381
you really have to hit me with full power.

919
00:34:19,382 --> 00:34:20,382
- Okay. - You can't be like,

920
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:21,451
"I'm sorry, I can't hit you."

921
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:22,491
- None of that. You have to do it. - Hold on.

922
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:24,221
- You won't be hitting us, right? - Never.

923
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:25,361
- Okay. - But...

924
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,862
I can guarantee that you won't be able to make a single hit.

925
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:28,031
Please give me a hair tie.

926
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,092
(Confident)

927
00:34:29,492 --> 00:34:31,902
(The Iron Girls have...)

928
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:34,471
(endured going for 3 hours and 30 minutes.)

929
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,531
(They are as strong as steel.)

930
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,042
(3 minutes seem easy, right?)

931
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:41,272
(But it's different with boxing!)

932
00:34:41,772 --> 00:34:42,841
(1 minute 30 seconds, 2 intervals)

933
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:44,942
(For 3 minutes, they will need to use their full power.)

934
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:46,511
(They need to use their whole body...)

935
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:47,852
(to bring out the most power in an instant.)

936
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,222
(Boxing is a battle of endurance.)

937
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:53,581
(1 minute 30 seconds, 2 intervals)

938
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:55,621
(It's a 3-minute match,)

939
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:57,921
(but they will get to experience it for 2 minutes today,)

940
00:34:57,922 --> 00:35:00,092
(with a discount of 1 minute.)

941
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:04,461
(Will the Iron Girls be able to endure the 2 minutes?)

942
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:05,502
- Is it 4 on 1? - Let's go.

943
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,831
- Let's go. - Is it 4 on 1?

944
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:09,102
(The beginners don't even know the basics of boxing.)

945
00:35:09,132 --> 00:35:10,831
- Who will try? - Gosh, the gloves.

946
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:12,802
- Ju Hyun. - You want me to go first?

947
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:13,972
Ju Hyun, you try.

948
00:35:14,842 --> 00:35:16,241
- How do you do this? - Like this.

949
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:18,082
Don't you need this to protect yourself?

950
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:19,812
Like this.

951
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:21,681
- Gosh. - Push.

952
00:35:21,682 --> 00:35:22,782
This is uncomfortable.

953
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,321
- I should cut my nails. - Yes.

954
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:26,681
I think she will be good.

955
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:27,892
You're cool, Ju Hyun.

956
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:29,691
The first in the country.

957
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,221
I think it's the first time for a complete beginner...

958
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:32,921
to get in the ring.

959
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,262
The first in our country.

960
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:36,061
Wake up!

961
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:37,331
You need to get revenge for your parents.

962
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:38,502
- Wake up. - Right?

963
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:39,802
He kidnapped your dog.

964
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:42,031
He kidnapped your dog.

965
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,301
They can joke around and have fun...

966
00:35:43,302 --> 00:35:44,741
since it's not a real match.

967
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,771
If it's a real match, your legs shake like this...

968
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:48,072
when you get in the ring.

969
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,512
- Is that real? - I think I will be like that.

970
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:52,381
The rule is that you need to punch...

971
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,612
with all your strength during the two minutes.

972
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:56,012
And during the two minutes,

973
00:35:56,682 --> 00:35:57,782
you can't give up.

974
00:35:58,182 --> 00:35:59,352
That's too long.

975
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,321
Think of it as part of your training.

976
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:02,791
Put up your guard...

977
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,321
and keep moving like a real boxer.

978
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:05,421
- Okay. - Even if you're tired.

979
00:36:05,422 --> 00:36:06,991
Let me tell you this in advance.

980
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,461
Don't announce it and go like this...

981
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:10,691
(Don't be passive when you throw the punch.)

982
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:11,831
Don't do any of that.

983
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:13,701
You need to think that you're giving damage...

984
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,001
and throw the punch.

985
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,802
(Make it full power so that you give damage.)

986
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:19,871
- Let's go, Ju Hyun. - Ju Hyun,

987
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:20,872
- you can do it. - Let's go!

988
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:21,941
- Let's go, Ju Hyun! - Ju Hyun,

989
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:23,172
- Let's go, Ju Hyun! - show him.

990
00:36:23,242 --> 00:36:24,342
Stun Gun?

991
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:25,642
Whatever.

992
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:27,611
(She taunts him like a pro-level boxer.)

993
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:29,082
Power through.

994
00:36:29,452 --> 00:36:30,751
(In response,)

995
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,082
(Dong Hyun takes initiative as well.)

996
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:33,682
(Thump)

997
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:35,452
Some people do that.

998
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,762
(She doesn't fall behind.)

999
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:39,961
(Blue corner, red corner)

1000
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:41,061
Okay.

1001
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,391
(Quick Boxing Facts: The red corner is for the champion,)

1002
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:43,731
(and the blue corner is for the challenger.)

1003
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:44,801
Let's go.

1004
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,402
(Ju Hyun in the blue corner, Dong Hyun in the red corner)

1005
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:52,842
(Will she be able to endure the 2 minutes?)

1006
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:55,511
Let's hit the gloves.

1007
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,212
(The 2-minute trial starts.)

1008
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,241
Why are you trying to hit me?

1009
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:00,812
I won't. Hit me.

1010
00:37:01,112 --> 00:37:02,151
(Punching)

1011
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,252
Good.

1012
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:04,752
Oh, nice.

1013
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,721
Hold on. She's good.

1014
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:08,551
(She doesn't know anything about boxing,)

1015
00:37:08,552 --> 00:37:09,852
(but she still throws punches.)

1016
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:14,732
- Good. - I think she'll be able to hit him.

1017
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,192
- Hit my face. - Don't talk to me.

1018
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:18,432
Hit my face.

1019
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:20,332
You just hit him.

1020
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:23,802
(Unfortunately, she only brushed past.)

1021
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:25,171
You just hit him.

1022
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:26,671
(She swings with her best.)

1023
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:27,912
You didn't. Hit my face.

1024
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,472
(Thorough defense)

1025
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,742
(Stun Gun is not an easy opponent.)

1026
00:37:33,812 --> 00:37:36,682
(All of Ju Hyun's punches are blocked.)

1027
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,082
(Attacking with her full power)

1028
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,451
- You're good. - I'm scared.

1029
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:44,662
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:49,662
(She keeps throwing punches nonstop.)

1031
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,031
- Look at her eyes. - Why is she so good?

1032
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:57,132
(Mad)

1033
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:59,101
He's protruding his face for her to hit him.

1034
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,271
He's so annoying.

1035
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:01,472
(Ju Hyun's desperate to hit his face.)

1036
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:06,582
(Stun Gun keeps avoiding her.)

1037
00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,882
(Laughing)

1038
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:11,682
- Hit my face. - I'm scared.

1039
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,252
- She's good. Where are you aiming? - Gosh, I'm scared.

1040
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:16,792
- She's good. Where are you aiming? - Gosh, I'm scared.

1041
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,892
You're good. Keep going.

1042
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:22,232
(It's been 1 minute since the trial began.)

1043
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:23,862
(Panting)

1044
00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:25,662
Hit me.

1045
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:26,902
(She begins panting.)

1046
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,271
- Ju Hyun, you can do it. - Hit me.

1047
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:30,632
Ju Hyun, just one punch.

1048
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,971
- Ju Hyun keeps staring at him. - Gosh.

1049
00:38:32,972 --> 00:38:34,272
She never stops staring at him.

1050
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:37,642
(40 seconds left.)

1051
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,482
- She's good. - My face.

1052
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:41,952
Stun Gun, you're pretty good.

1053
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,382
(Laughing)

1054
00:38:44,512 --> 00:38:45,681
- Ju Hyun's good. - Gosh.

1055
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:46,682
(Stun Gun drains her by avoiding her.)
(Teasing)

1056
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,091
- Hurry. - It's even hard to hold these.

1057
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,221
Hurry up. Punch hard.

1058
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:51,252
Don't talk to me.

1059
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:53,092
(Swish)

1060
00:38:54,192 --> 00:38:55,561
(10 seconds left.)

1061
00:38:55,562 --> 00:38:56,891
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

1062
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,001
(The Iron Girl with no boxing experience tried for 2 minutes.)

1063
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,562
Ju Hyun. You can do it.

1064
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,531
Give your all in the next ten seconds.

1065
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,972
(Yelling)

1066
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:06,171
(Without a single punch to the face)

1067
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:07,372
(The 2-minute trial ends.)

1068
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,371
(Falling down as soon as the 2 minutes is up)

1069
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:11,412
You were good.

1070
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,282
That was so exhausting.

1071
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:18,121
(She's already knocked down from chasing him.)

1072
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,851
I taste blood in my throat.

1073
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:21,521
Right. It tastes like blood.

1074
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:22,622
(Shocked)

1075
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,422
I don't want to do it.

1076
00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:28,232
I noticed Ju Hyun has a pretty good punch.

1077
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,591
- Really? - Yes.

1078
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:30,761
- She's good. - That was cool.

1079
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:33,532
You tried it for two minutes. How was it?

1080
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,002
Two minutes felt like...

1081
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:37,602
You're supposed to begin now.

1082
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:39,342
I can't do it.

1083
00:39:39,872 --> 00:39:42,742
I can't move my arms. My muscles will ache tomorrow.

1084
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,281
(Ju Hyun's 2-minute trial result)

1085
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,381
(Stamina, punch)

1086
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:49,582
(One-sentence review, Good punch but lacks stamina)

1087
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,481
- I want to try too. - Sure.

1088
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:52,722
Let me see how hard it is.

1089
00:39:52,752 --> 00:39:55,221
After Seol In Ah,

1090
00:39:55,222 --> 00:39:57,222
it's basically a break afterward.

1091
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,121
Why would you disregard us?

1092
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:00,462
The other two have soft punches.

1093
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:01,731
- Sae Rok, say something. - It's better for us...

1094
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,361
because he'll be out of energy.

1095
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,362
- Right? - Yes.

1096
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,002
Oh, my gosh. This is heavy.

1097
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:07,062
Is it heavy?

1098
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:09,232
(1 glove weighs 14oz, which is about 400g.)

1099
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:12,372
I think she'll be good at it.

1100
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:14,372
I have a feeling I'll get a few punches.

1101
00:40:14,502 --> 00:40:16,072
I can tell by the looks of her.

1102
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:17,742
I won't be able to avoid everything.

1103
00:40:18,642 --> 00:40:20,311
(Simba Seol is excited.)

1104
00:40:20,312 --> 00:40:21,712
Go, Seol In Ah.

1105
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:23,982
- I'm actually nervous to try it. - Right.

1106
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:25,752
Give your all.

1107
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:27,582
I'm Ju Hyun's sister. Gosh.

1108
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,521
- Good luck. - You can do it.

1109
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:30,592
(She needs stamina to last 2 minutes.)

1110
00:40:30,892 --> 00:40:32,822
(The 2-minute trial starts.)

1111
00:40:34,762 --> 00:40:36,892
(In Ah is aggressive from the start.)

1112
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,102
How is she so good?

1113
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,332
You're strong. What's gotten into you?

1114
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,602
(There's a swishing sound every time she swings.)

1115
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,742
- What's going on? - That's going to hurt.

1116
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:58,522
- How is she so strong? - He's flustered.

1117
00:40:58,582 --> 00:40:59,651
You're so strong.

1118
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:01,422
(In Ah's punch makes Stun Gun nervous.)

1119
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:02,822
He's flustered.

1120
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:04,922
(Jaw-dropping)

1121
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,592
(Swinging with her all)

1122
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:09,261
(It has been 30 seconds since the trial has begun.)

1123
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:10,762
Why can't I hit him?

1124
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,162
(In Ah keeps going at him without giving up)

1125
00:41:13,832 --> 00:41:15,631
(However, the captain is...)

1126
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:18,702
(way above In Ah.)

1127
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:23,471
(She throws her punches with her best.)

1128
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:24,982
(Avoiding)

1129
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:28,082
(But Stun Gun continues to avoid them.)

1130
00:41:33,182 --> 00:41:34,852
(What happened?)

1131
00:41:35,052 --> 00:41:36,892
- You hit him. - He got hit.

1132
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:48,902
(She was surprised to hit him.)

1133
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:52,471
(I'm a carnivore Simba Seol.)

1134
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:53,671
I approve.

1135
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,042
You hit me once. Okay.

1136
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:57,542
(Simba Seol continues to attack aggressively.)

1137
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:00,982
- I just brushed past. - Where?

1138
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:03,452
(Staggering)

1139
00:42:03,512 --> 00:42:05,682
- You're drunk now. - I brushed past.

1140
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:08,422
(Because she gave it her all, she quickly ran out of energy.)

1141
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:10,191
(Panting)

1142
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:13,261
You're exhausted.

1143
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:15,262
(A different kind of energy consumption from the triathlon)

1144
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,632
How long has it been?

1145
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:20,262
(She still has 40 seconds left.)

1146
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:22,502
(Since when did 2 minutes feel this long?)

1147
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,402
- This is tiring. - Keep going.

1148
00:42:25,102 --> 00:42:27,042
- Stop pushing me. - I didn't push you.

1149
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:29,142
(Pushing)

1150
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:31,712
- Stop pushing me. - I didn't push you.

1151
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,542
That's how he drains you.

1152
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:35,581
- Don't push me. - Come on.

1153
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,112
- It's all part of it. - Don't be sullen.

1154
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:39,082
You can't sulk during the test.

1155
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:40,882
(I'm boiling with anger. I'm coming for you.)

1156
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:49,092
(Pushing again)

1157
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:52,531
I said no pushing.

1158
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:53,532
(Angry)

1159
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:56,772
(Simba Seol, do your best.)

1160
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,702
(10 seconds left.)

1161
00:42:59,002 --> 00:43:01,002
(She throws punches with her all.)

1162
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,082
I can guarantee that you won't be able to make a single hit.

1163
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:16,722
- I hit you again. - That's two.

1164
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:17,851
(The 2-minute trial ends.)

1165
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:18,922
Okay.

1166
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,522
- You hit him. - She hit me twice.

1167
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:22,662
(Panting)

1168
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:23,762
Isn't it really hard?

1169
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:24,932
Gosh.

1170
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:26,262
Doesn't your throat hurt?

1171
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:28,032
My throat hurts so much. I can taste blood in my throat.

1172
00:43:29,602 --> 00:43:32,271
(She experienced a new world for 2 minutes.)

1173
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:33,541
Gosh, her punch.

1174
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,771
If Ju Hyun's punch...

1175
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:37,442
felt like a midsize car,

1176
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:39,312
she was an SUV.

1177
00:43:40,082 --> 00:43:41,582
She has a good punch.

1178
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,682
- She's good. - She's Strong In Ah.

1179
00:43:43,782 --> 00:43:45,451
(In Ah's 2-minute trial result)

1180
00:43:45,452 --> 00:43:46,721
(Stamina, punch)

1181
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:49,792
(One-sentence review, Strong punch but lacks stamina)

1182
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:51,661
- The eldest. - Go, sister.

1183
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,892
Go, sister.

1184
00:43:53,522 --> 00:43:55,662
(The strongest among Iron Girls, Uie)

1185
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:58,162
(Teasing)

1186
00:43:58,632 --> 00:43:59,632
Let's go.
(Will she be able to show what it means to be the ace?)

1187
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:02,772
(Annoying)

1188
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:05,072
(The 2-minute trial starts.)

1189
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:06,871
- The look in her eyes changed. - Say hi.

1190
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:08,612
Why won't you do the greeting?

1191
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:12,112
(She throws punches nonstop.)

1192
00:44:12,512 --> 00:44:14,741
(But something doesn't feel right.)

1193
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:17,112
What are you doing? Seriously.

1194
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:19,382
- The cat punch. - It's...

1195
00:44:20,722 --> 00:44:21,791
What are you doing?

1196
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,022
(The herbivore Uie's cat punch)

1197
00:44:26,262 --> 00:44:29,562
Punch hard.

1198
00:44:29,932 --> 00:44:31,332
I'm so tired.

1199
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:35,272
Punch hard. With all your power.

1200
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,432
(Her punches are still soft because she's a beginner.)

1201
00:44:37,702 --> 00:44:39,042
Gosh, because you have the stamina...

1202
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,572
- A minute left. - One more minute.

1203
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:45,682
(Uie has the stamina to support her.)

1204
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:47,242
She has the stamina.

1205
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:50,512
(She keeps moving without stopping.)

1206
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:51,721
(10 seconds left.)

1207
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,852
Uie, ten seconds to go.

1208
00:44:56,222 --> 00:44:57,521
(The 2-minute trial ends.)

1209
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:59,522
- The captain's exhausted. - You have so much stamina.

1210
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:02,132
- You have a monstrous stamina. - She has the stamina.

1211
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,731
Two minutes wasn't so bad.

1212
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:04,861
- I can see. - What?

1213
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,301
- She can go for one more minute. - That's amazing.

1214
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,562
Because she has the stamina,

1215
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:09,872
she doesn't get tired. She's making me tired.

1216
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,341
See? She doesn't even sit down.

1217
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,841
She has crazy stamina.

1218
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:16,111
- She has the best stamina... - She's a monster.

1219
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,272
among us.

1220
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:18,811
(Uie's 2-minute trial result)

1221
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:20,111
(Stamina, punch)

1222
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:21,481
(One-sentence review)

1223
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:24,482
(Long reach and monstrous stamina, but weak punch)

1224
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:26,451
You can do it. Come here.

1225
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,452
(Lastly, it's Sae Rok's turn.)

1226
00:45:27,622 --> 00:45:29,351
- Just do it. - Yes.

1227
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,092
- Okay. I'll do it. - Just do it to the end.

1228
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:35,062
It's our first time to see Sae Rok exercising.

1229
00:45:35,162 --> 00:45:36,162
You can do it.

1230
00:45:36,432 --> 00:45:38,132
(Sae Rok is mysterious.)

1231
00:45:38,332 --> 00:45:39,802
She's a mysterious person.

1232
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:42,632
I can't analyze her strategies.

1233
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:44,172
I don't know what I'm like either.

1234
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:46,841
- You can do it. - Good luck.

1235
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:47,872
(Will Sae Rok be able to last 2 minutes?)

1236
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:50,212
(The 2-minute trial starts.)

1237
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:55,081
That was a greeting.

1238
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:56,082
- Where are your manners? - Sorry.

1239
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:04,922
Look at her eyes.

1240
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:10,891
(A long and straight punch)

1241
00:46:10,892 --> 00:46:13,232
- It's long. - She has a long reach.

1242
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:18,102
(Punching with her long arms)

1243
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,342
(Sae Rok dominates the opponent with her confidence.)

1244
00:46:20,472 --> 00:46:21,971
(Her random punches...)

1245
00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:23,112
You hit him.

1246
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:27,882
I can guarantee that you won't be able to make a single hit.

1247
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:34,922
She has long arms.

1248
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:36,621
I know. She has long arms.

1249
00:46:36,622 --> 00:46:37,692
Her arms are so long.

1250
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:40,922
She's good. I knew she'd be good.

1251
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:43,462
(Punching with all her might)

1252
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,132
Corner him.

1253
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:49,532
(Shouting)

1254
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,342
(Shouting)

1255
00:46:56,142 --> 00:46:57,211
(Shouting)

1256
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:58,311
How many minutes are left?

1257
00:46:58,312 --> 00:46:59,481
(She soon ran out of stamina.)

1258
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:00,482
I'm so tired.

1259
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,541
(Shouting)

1260
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:02,581
I'm so tired.

1261
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:04,912
Don't talk and save your energy.

1262
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:06,181
- You have a minute left. - Sae Rok,

1263
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:07,551
you still have a minute left.

1264
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:08,792
Mom!

1265
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:09,892
Mom.

1266
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:11,922
I'm so tired.

1267
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:14,421
I'm so tired!

1268
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:15,732
(2 minutes feel like 2 hours.)

1269
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:17,861
(Come on.)

1270
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:19,132
I'm tired.

1271
00:47:19,732 --> 00:47:20,862
Help me.

1272
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:22,572
- Help. - You ran out of energy.

1273
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,502
(Groaning)

1274
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:25,872
Mom.

1275
00:47:25,873 --> 00:47:26,942
(Laughing)

1276
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:28,341
(Grunting)

1277
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:29,472
(Yelling)

1278
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:33,612
(Is she giving up?)

1279
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:35,482
She's cute.

1280
00:47:36,212 --> 00:47:37,451
(She crawls.)

1281
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:39,421
Sae Rok, you can do it. Keep going.

1282
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:40,682
(Flopping down again)

1283
00:47:43,222 --> 00:47:44,922
(Teasing)

1284
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:47,591
Ten seconds, Sae Rok.

1285
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:49,261
Sae Rok, breathe.

1286
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,361
He's so annoying.

1287
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:51,491
Yes, just punch him.

1288
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:52,661
Punch his face.

1289
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,702
(Grunting)

1290
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,701
(The 2-minute trial ends.)

1291
00:47:56,702 --> 00:47:58,031
That's what happens.

1292
00:47:58,032 --> 00:47:59,102
Hit him.

1293
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:04,242
(Knock down with 2 seconds left)

1294
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:06,482
(You're exhausted.)

1295
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:08,712
(Panting)

1296
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,882
Sae Rok, think about it again.

1297
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:13,122
Sae Rok.

1298
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,591
Call your agency.

1299
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:19,421
- Tell them you can't do it. - What?

1300
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:21,021
Tell them it wasn't what you expected it to be.

1301
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:22,592
- Sae Rok is dying. - Sae Rok.

1302
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:25,031
- Good job. - Are you okay?

1303
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:26,762
- Breathe. - Good job.

1304
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:28,771
Don't talk. Just breathe.

1305
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,531
That's normal.

1306
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,571
- Right? - Yes.

1307
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:32,602
I told you. She has the stamina.

1308
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,742
But she used all her energy in the beginning.

1309
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:36,872
- She has a good punch though. - She burned it.

1310
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:38,341
Gosh, I'm so tired.

1311
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:39,742
- Just work on your stamina. - Gosh.

1312
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,412
Sae Rok had...

1313
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:43,812
the most dogged expression.

1314
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:46,081
She was like, "Hey."

1315
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:47,151
If she...

1316
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:48,281
(Regardless of his compliments)

1317
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:49,921
- She was... - Let's...

1318
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:50,991
- really dogged. - Let's go home.

1319
00:48:50,992 --> 00:48:53,221
- She's going home. - I want to go home.

1320
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,661
Wait. She said she was going home.

1321
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:55,691
Help me.

1322
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:56,692
(Sae Rok's 2-minute trial result)

1323
00:48:56,693 --> 00:48:57,761
(Stamina, punch)

1324
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:00,532
(One-sentence review, Long punch, but very weak stamina)

1325
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:02,601
- None of you tried it before. - Yes.

1326
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:03,902
How was it?

1327
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,171
I thought I was going to die.

1328
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:07,741
When Ju Hyun said, "In Ah, one more minute!"

1329
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:08,871
I was like, "What?"

1330
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:11,141
- "It's not over yet?" - I was the same.

1331
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:13,141
When I was in the ring,

1332
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:14,511
- it felt long. - It was so long.

1333
00:49:14,512 --> 00:49:16,252
- It's different from watching. - Yes.

1334
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,851
To be honest, two minutes...

1335
00:49:18,852 --> 00:49:20,482
weren't so bad.

1336
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:21,952
You were the toughest to deal with.

1337
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:24,092
- I think I smiled. - Yes.

1338
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:25,222
- You scared me. - Yes.

1339
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:26,422
You scared me too.

1340
00:49:26,562 --> 00:49:28,561
I can't remember anything...

1341
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:30,792
halfway through.

1342
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:33,631
I don't remember what I did.

1343
00:49:33,632 --> 00:49:36,471
You can feel the difference.

1344
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,231
- Right. Your stamina... - I lack the stamina.

1345
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:40,201
- Unless I work hard... - You're right.

1346
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:41,741
to grow stamina,

1347
00:49:41,742 --> 00:49:43,812
I won't be able to catch up.

1348
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:45,941
In boxing, you use your whole body...

1349
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,481
without a break during the round.

1350
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:49,512
(Boxing is an intensive exercise.)

1351
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:51,651
You must bear the weight of the heavy gloves...

1352
00:49:51,652 --> 00:49:54,222
and throw a strong punch at the same time.

1353
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:57,292
Your whole body is tensed throughout the whole round.

1354
00:49:57,622 --> 00:49:59,361
Because you have to move without stopping,

1355
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:00,992
it consumes a lot of energy.

1356
00:50:01,092 --> 00:50:04,131
(Calorie consumption per sport in 60 minutes)

1357
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:07,261
(Burning 900kcal per hour, The number 1 calorie consumption)

1358
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:10,232
To last long in the ring, you need the stamina to support you.

1359
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,241
(There is no time for this.)

1360
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:14,341
Now, let's begin...

1361
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:15,911
your training.

1362
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:17,211
There's more today?

1363
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:18,441
"There's more today?"

1364
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:20,781
You need it the most.

1365
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:22,152
Let's move on to the training now.

1366
00:50:22,212 --> 00:50:23,281
- Okay. - Let's go.

1367
00:50:23,282 --> 00:50:24,411
- Let's do this. - Wait.

1368
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:25,582
Can we...

1369
00:50:25,852 --> 00:50:27,021
- What do you want to do? - chant together with me?

1370
00:50:27,022 --> 00:50:28,081
Oh, right.

1371
00:50:28,082 --> 00:50:29,151
- Yes. The chant. - That's right.

1372
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,491
- Let's do it. - Let me join you.

1373
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:32,322
- Of course. - Come here.

1374
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,521
But...

1375
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:35,731
if you try something new...

1376
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,061
Let's go with KO.

1377
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:38,591
- KO. - Yes. KO.

1378
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:40,031
KO? Okay.

1379
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:41,931
- It's the first time with Sae Rok. - I know.

1380
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:44,632
- Our first chant in Season Two. - Yes.

1381
00:50:44,732 --> 00:50:46,101
- KO. - Iron...

1382
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:48,372
- Girls. - Girls.

1383
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:52,782
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1384
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:54,881
- Let's go. - Okay.

1385
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:56,451
- Okay. - I prepared...

1386
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:57,812
amazing training.

1387
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,052
Something suitable for the Iron Girls.

1388
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:03,022
To be honest, those two minutes were shocking.

1389
00:51:03,322 --> 00:51:05,092
I thought I'd look cool like in the movies.

1390
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:06,921
I thought I'd look cool.

1391
00:51:06,922 --> 00:51:08,761
- On the ring... - I thought you were...

1392
00:51:08,762 --> 00:51:10,131
trying to look cute.

1393
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:11,192
(Embarrassed)

1394
00:51:11,732 --> 00:51:12,931
Didn't she do this?

1395
00:51:12,932 --> 00:51:14,302
(They can't help but make fun of her soft punch.)

1396
00:51:14,632 --> 00:51:17,001
(Soft punch)

1397
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:20,472
(Forget about Uie's soft punch.)

1398
00:51:21,402 --> 00:51:25,812
(Uie's fierce punch is coming soon.)

1399
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:28,041
(Staring)

1400
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,351
We're going up.

1401
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:31,352
(We're going up.)

1402
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,892
(The uphill continues.)

1403
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,962
My ears are deafening.

1404
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,761
- Oh, my. What's that? - What's that?

1405
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:43,892
We're not going there, are we?

1406
00:51:44,332 --> 00:51:45,431
Hey.

1407
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:47,601
Does it say Iron Girls?

1408
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:49,131
(A mysterious object outside the window)

1409
00:51:49,132 --> 00:51:51,302
I've seen that before.

1410
00:51:51,532 --> 00:51:53,602
- What's that? - What is that?

1411
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:55,812
- To test your fear. - It's a tourist attraction.

1412
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:57,241
Seriously, I don't know what to say.

1413
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:58,812
For real? You're kidding me, right?

1414
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:01,511
We're doing this on the first day?

1415
00:52:01,512 --> 00:52:03,482
- No way. - Where are we?

1416
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:05,451
This is beyond my imagination.

1417
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:06,552
Guess what?

1418
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:08,721
(Where will Iron Girls 2's first training take place?)

1419
00:52:08,722 --> 00:52:10,851
- What am I doing here? - What is that?

1420
00:52:10,852 --> 00:52:13,191
- It says Iron Girls. I was right. - Really?

1421
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:15,162
How high is that?

1422
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:18,632
This is where the 2018 Winter Olympics took place.

1423
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:20,161
It's the ski jump center.

1424
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:21,262
(Pyeongchang Ski Jump Center)

1425
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,001
- Did they jump here? - Oh, my gosh. That's so scary.

1426
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:27,671
(The ski jump competition that runs down the steep slope...)

1427
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:28,912
(took place here.)

1428
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,841
What are we doing at the ski jump center?

1429
00:52:31,842 --> 00:52:32,981
Let's go.

1430
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:34,381
Is this really May? Why is it so cold?

1431
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:35,951
- It's cold. - It's really cold.

1432
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,381
- Are you sure it's May? - Everyone.

1433
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:39,521
- Are you cold? - Yes.

1434
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:42,151
- Soon, you'll feel hot. - No.

1435
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:44,221
Soon, you'll feel hot. Don't worry.

1436
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:45,451
You'll prefer this weather.

1437
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:47,261
(What are they doing here?)

1438
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,432
- What are we doing here? - Here?

1439
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:51,462
In the last season,

1440
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:53,361
- we went up a building. - Yes.

1441
00:52:53,362 --> 00:52:54,661
- Yes. A tall building. - We went up the stairs.

1442
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:56,471
It's the symbol of Iron Girls.

1443
00:52:56,472 --> 00:52:59,272
Something intense from the start.

1444
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,302
We'll begin our first training today.

1445
00:53:01,372 --> 00:53:02,511
Your training today is...

1446
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,411
(What is Iron Girls 2's first training?)

1447
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:07,741
Your training today is...

1448
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:09,952
going up the ski jump ramp in reverse.

1449
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:13,081
(Going up...)

1450
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:14,481
(the ski jump ramp?)

1451
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,692
- What? - Are we able to climb up there?

1452
00:53:17,452 --> 00:53:22,792
(Continuing from the 123rd-floor stair climb from Season 1)

1453
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:26,131
(Iron Girls 2's intense stamina training)

1454
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:27,801
We have to get up there.

1455
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:30,332
Reverse up? Is that even possible?

1456
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,341
Did they make this because of us?

1457
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,341
You're right. No way.

1458
00:53:34,342 --> 00:53:36,141
Why are we doing it in reverse?

1459
00:53:36,142 --> 00:53:38,171
It's meant to come down.

1460
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:39,782
Something others don't try.

1461
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:41,381
Something hard.

1462
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:43,411
That's what Iron Girls do.

1463
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:46,252
Let me tell you about your training today.

1464
00:53:46,952 --> 00:53:48,552
The total length is 400m.

1465
00:53:49,252 --> 00:53:50,421
It starts from here.

1466
00:53:50,422 --> 00:53:52,052
You'll start from here.

1467
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:53,591
You'll go all the way up.

1468
00:53:53,592 --> 00:53:55,162
Do you see the blue box?

1469
00:53:56,192 --> 00:53:58,332
- What? - That's 300m.

1470
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,002
You're lying.

1471
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:01,662
Because...

1472
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,571
(Flat zone, the 1st slope, the 2nd slope)

1473
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:07,372
(A total of 3 training courses)

1474
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:09,611
The first 100m is flat.

1475
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:12,042
(The first 100m is a flat zone.)

1476
00:54:12,742 --> 00:54:16,412
(A 25° incline, the 1st slope)

1477
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:18,351
(The last 100m is the hardest, The 2nd slope)

1478
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:19,982
How steep is that?

1479
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:21,181
The max angle...

1480
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:23,321
- is 38°. - What?

1481
00:54:23,322 --> 00:54:25,222
It's about 40th floor high.

1482
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:27,991
It's basically as steep as a cliff.

1483
00:54:27,992 --> 00:54:29,231
Do we have to crawl up there?

1484
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,962
As you know, you need cardiovascular endurance,

1485
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,701
muscular strength,

1486
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,661
and a brave heart.

1487
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:36,031
- If you look back, - It'll be scary.

1488
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:37,301
it's scary, so...

1489
00:54:37,302 --> 00:54:39,602
it'll also help train your mind.

1490
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,742
This is important...

1491
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:45,272
because you take steps with the balls of your feet.

1492
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:47,641
(The step is the basic movement in boxing.)

1493
00:54:47,642 --> 00:54:50,011
Your calf muscles are very important in boxing,

1494
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:52,752
and in the end, your power comes from your calves.

1495
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,521
This ski jump training...

1496
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:57,092
will help strengthen your calf muscles.

1497
00:54:58,052 --> 00:54:59,891
Is it possible to climb up there?

1498
00:54:59,892 --> 00:55:01,521
- Has anyone tried it? - There is...

1499
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:03,261
actually a race-up competition.

1500
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:04,262
(The ski jump race-up is real?)

1501
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:09,472
Since 2011, it has taken place in 19 countries.

1502
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:12,871
Was it held in Korea too?

1503
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,802
It was held last year.

1504
00:55:14,872 --> 00:55:16,871
A lot of people joined the event.

1505
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:18,071
It went viral.

1506
00:55:18,072 --> 00:55:21,081
There was a cut-off point for female participants last year.

1507
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:22,241
- What was it? - That was...

1508
00:55:22,242 --> 00:55:24,651
- 11 minutes and 23 seconds. - What?

1509
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:27,151
(Within 11 minutes and 23 seconds)

1510
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:29,591
- The number is limited. - Is that possible?

1511
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,691
I'll give you more time...

1512
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:32,962
and make it 12 minutes.

1513
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:35,222
Our goal is to make it before 12 minutes.

1514
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:38,961
(Race up this steep in 12 minutes?)

1515
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,601
If you make it in 12 minutes,

1516
00:55:40,602 --> 00:55:41,602
it's the end of the training.

1517
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:42,802
(If you make it in 12 minutes, it's the end of the training.)

1518
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,301
- Really? - Really?

1519
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,002
What if we can't make it in 12 minutes?

1520
00:55:46,642 --> 00:55:48,141
If you can't, you'll do it one more time.

1521
00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:50,912
(If you can't make it in 12 minutes, you have to do it one more time.)

1522
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:53,112
- We have to go back up? - Yes, one more time.

1523
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:55,951
(If they can't make it in 12 minutes,)

1524
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,022
(they have to go back up again.)

1525
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:00,182
(Screaming)

1526
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:04,352
This is our first training?

1527
00:56:04,892 --> 00:56:06,522
It sounds so tough.

1528
00:56:07,062 --> 00:56:09,991
Actually, I'm not scared...

1529
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,332
because I haven't tried it yet.

1530
00:56:11,432 --> 00:56:13,231
I can do it.

1531
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:14,361
- You're so lucky. - I'm okay...

1532
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:15,501
- because I haven't done it. - Right?

1533
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:17,271
I'll make it in 12 minutes.

1534
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:19,102
That's the spirit.

1535
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,801
- It means our training... - I can't do that.

1536
00:56:21,802 --> 00:56:24,242
ends in 12 minutes. It's a good thing.

1537
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:27,681
Says who?

1538
00:56:27,682 --> 00:56:28,811
You said...

1539
00:56:28,812 --> 00:56:30,951
if we complete it in 12 minutes,

1540
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:32,381
we're done for the day.

1541
00:56:32,382 --> 00:56:34,422
This training is over.

1542
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:35,621
This training is over.

1543
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:36,822
Never mind.

1544
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:39,461
I hope you get used to it soon.

1545
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:40,491
Welcome.

1546
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:41,521
- Welcome. - Is this your first time...

1547
00:56:41,522 --> 00:56:42,562
in Iron Girls?

1548
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:44,831
That's how it is in Iron Girls.

1549
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:46,901
Let me...

1550
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:48,101
- give you a tip on this. - Okay.

1551
00:56:48,102 --> 00:56:49,471
- Once you're somewhere up there, - Yes.

1552
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:50,732
don't ever look back.

1553
00:56:51,802 --> 00:56:52,802
(Advice like a horror movie cliche)

1554
00:56:52,803 --> 00:56:54,442
- I guess it's scary. - If you look back,

1555
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:56,711
it feels like you're hanging off a cliff.

1556
00:56:56,712 --> 00:56:59,082
- Come on. - That was why I screamed.

1557
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:02,451
(Look back,)

1558
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,482
(and it's an endless cliff.)

1559
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:07,552
The maximum slope is 38°.

1560
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:10,192
The height is 140m.

1561
00:57:10,322 --> 00:57:12,322
It's as tall as a 40-story building.

1562
00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:16,832
(They must climb using only their legs.)

1563
00:57:17,332 --> 00:57:20,001
(They must get to the top...)

1564
00:57:20,002 --> 00:57:21,161
(with the 12-minute time limit.)

1565
00:57:21,162 --> 00:57:22,472
Please head to the starting line.

1566
00:57:23,102 --> 00:57:26,872
(Can the Iron Girls do it?)

1567
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,142
I'm nervous.

1568
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:29,672
Grit your teeth and power through.

1569
00:57:30,342 --> 00:57:32,042
I'll follow the last person.

1570
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:34,182
- I'll turn the clock on. - Just focus on reaching the top.

1571
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:35,852
- You can do it. - We can do it.

1572
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:36,981
- Thank you. - We can do it.

1573
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:38,551
Don't step on the rope. It's dangerous.

1574
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:40,151
- Yes, it's dangerous. - Please.

1575
00:57:40,152 --> 00:57:41,322
(Laughing)

1576
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:43,051
- Shall we do a cheer? - Okay.

1577
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:44,521
- Start after "KO Iron Girls." - Okay.

1578
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:45,861
- KO! - Iron...

1579
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,662
- Girls! - Girls!

1580
00:57:47,722 --> 00:57:48,821
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1581
00:57:48,822 --> 00:57:49,861
Let's cheer again at the top.

1582
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:50,932
Get ready.

1583
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:02,472
(The Iron Girls set off.)

1584
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:09,252
(The first 100m of the 400m course is flat.)

1585
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:13,222
(They run calmly at their own pace.)

1586
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:16,291
Gosh. The closer I get, the less I can see the end.

1587
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,551
(The steep slope is before them.)

1588
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:18,622
I can't get a feel for it.

1589
00:58:19,892 --> 00:58:21,491
- Hold on. - This feels strange.

1590
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:23,062
(All four run toward the slope.)

1591
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:25,832
(Running to the steady sound of their footsteps,)

1592
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:29,872
(they quickly reached the 100m flat stretch end.)

1593
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:33,072
(And...)

1594
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:36,472
(from now on,)

1595
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:38,841
(the real 1st incline begins.)

1596
00:58:38,842 --> 00:58:40,481
It feels much higher now that I'm up close.

1597
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,042
(The average slope is 25°.)

1598
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:46,222
(They've now entered the incline section.)

1599
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:50,292
(It's hard to run because of the inclination.)

1600
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:53,222
(Breathing heavily)

1601
00:58:56,592 --> 00:59:00,502
(The stadium is filled solely with the sound of breathing.)

1602
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:07,142
(They've passed 150m of 400m.)

1603
00:59:08,242 --> 00:59:10,441
(The slope starts getting steeper from now on.)

1604
00:59:10,442 --> 00:59:11,542
It's slippery.

1605
00:59:15,412 --> 00:59:19,282
(For balance, Uie starts climbing on all fours.)

1606
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:21,281
Wait.

1607
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:24,122
(Ju Hyun, who was behind her, also gets on all fours.)

1608
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:25,352
Be careful.

1609
00:59:25,592 --> 00:59:26,622
Okay.

1610
00:59:28,262 --> 00:59:29,262
I'm scared.

1611
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:34,462
(Sae Rok starts climbing on all fours as well.)

1612
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:36,871
(As it requires full-body effort,)

1613
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:39,242
(her breathing gradually gets heavier.)

1614
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,672
(While everyone is climbing on all fours,)

1615
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:47,442
(In Ah is walking up fast.)

1616
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:51,182
(Walking up)

1617
00:59:51,952 --> 00:59:55,052
(Simba Seol's sprint)

1618
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:57,821
(As the others crawl up, In Ah picks up her pace...)

1619
00:59:57,822 --> 00:59:59,321
(In Ah)

1620
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:04,192
(and takes the lead.)

1621
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:09,132
(Once she's in the lead, she begins climbing on all fours.)

1622
01:00:09,332 --> 01:00:12,072
(Remaining time: 10 minutes)

1623
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:15,772
(Remaining distance: 200m)

1624
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,841
(The Iron Girls' current location)

1625
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:22,512
(In Ah, Sae Rok, Uie, Ju Hyun)

1626
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,952
(Current slope: 35°)

1627
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:24,982
(Groaning)

1628
01:00:25,212 --> 01:00:26,322
Is this for real?

1629
01:00:29,452 --> 01:00:30,692
This is crazy.

1630
01:00:32,122 --> 01:00:35,322
(The steep slope looks endless.)

1631
01:00:35,892 --> 01:00:39,602
(She's already out of breath, gasping for air.)

1632
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,332
(Meanwhile, Uie's...)

1633
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:47,472
(breathing remains calm.)

1634
01:00:48,242 --> 01:00:50,271
(Uie isn't fast,)

1635
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,472
(but she keeps climbing at a steady pace.)

1636
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,781
(Uie)

1637
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,042
I'll show them.

1638
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:57,911
(Sae Rok is climbing at a pace similar to Uie's.)

1639
01:00:57,912 --> 01:00:59,182
(Sae Rok)

1640
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:04,952
(She's going up steadily.)

1641
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:06,991
(At that moment,)

1642
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:08,191
(she suddenly looks back.)

1643
01:01:08,192 --> 01:01:09,962
(Groaning)

1644
01:01:10,862 --> 01:01:11,932
I'm scared.

1645
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:15,662
(Under her feet is a steep cliff.)

1646
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:17,902
I'm scared.

1647
01:01:19,602 --> 01:01:22,642
(A chilling fear creeps down her back.)

1648
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:25,242
I can do it.

1649
01:01:25,672 --> 01:01:27,582
I can do it.

1650
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:29,112
I can...

1651
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:31,181
do it.

1652
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,952
(While Sae Rok is overcoming her fear and climbing up)

1653
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:36,122
Let's go, Ju Hyun.

1654
01:01:36,522 --> 01:01:38,992
Why is it so slippery?

1655
01:01:40,892 --> 01:01:42,662
Come on. We have to go.

1656
01:01:43,392 --> 01:01:45,792
- No. - What was that?

1657
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:49,031
(Ju Hyun's legs gave out.)

1658
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:50,802
- Why did I slip? - Grab the rope.

1659
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:53,401
You're lacking leg muscles, not stamina.

1660
01:01:53,402 --> 01:01:54,602
What do I do?

1661
01:01:55,202 --> 01:01:56,272
My calves are...

1662
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,272
Don't take any breaks.

1663
01:01:58,412 --> 01:01:59,581
My ankles are weak.

1664
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,642
I had to wear casts quite often.

1665
01:02:02,182 --> 01:02:04,482
- My calf muscles must be weak. - Just a bit more.

1666
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:06,882
We're almost there. Let's go.

1667
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:08,582
Keep going. Just a bit more.

1668
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:10,622
Why can't I get my calves to work?

1669
01:02:10,692 --> 01:02:12,092
You're doing great.

1670
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:13,992
Lift your feet slightly.

1671
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:15,922
You're almost there. Let's go.

1672
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,561
Come on. Just a bit more.

1673
01:02:17,562 --> 01:02:18,692
(The incline is causing constant strain on the calves.)

1674
01:02:18,962 --> 01:02:20,462
This reminds me of us going up the stairs.

1675
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,332
- I'm having deja vu. - Exactly.

1676
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:25,932
- Let's go. Come on. - Oh, my.

1677
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:29,812
(She can't pick up the speed.)

1678
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:32,571
(In Ah, Uie, Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

1679
01:02:32,572 --> 01:02:34,982
(The gap has grown little by little.)

1680
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:37,911
In Ah is killing it.

1681
01:02:37,912 --> 01:02:39,112
(In Ah is in the lead.)

1682
01:02:41,482 --> 01:02:43,822
(Simba Seol is roaring.)

1683
01:02:44,822 --> 01:02:50,832
(Climbing up like crazy)

1684
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:52,031
Help me.

1685
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:53,562
(And then, she lost all energy.)

1686
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,572
(After catching her breath for a second,)

1687
01:02:57,432 --> 01:03:01,102
(she starts climbing up like crazy again.)

1688
01:03:01,202 --> 01:03:03,742
(She has lost all energy.)

1689
01:03:05,472 --> 01:03:09,012
(After repeatedly rushing up and then taking breaks,)

1690
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:12,882
(she's now at the end of the 1st incline section.)

1691
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:14,452
(Breathing heavily)

1692
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:16,392
(After catching her breath one last time)

1693
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,962
(In Ah starts running up the cliff.)

1694
01:03:27,002 --> 01:03:29,262
I imagined something was chasing after me.

1695
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,102
Look back, and I'm dead meat.

1696
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:35,972
(The slope has leveled out again.)

1697
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:41,642
(She has passed the 1st incline section.)

1698
01:03:43,852 --> 01:03:44,981
(But the real part starts now!)

1699
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:47,052
What's that? That's crazy.

1700
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:52,752
(The brutal 2nd incline section)

1701
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:56,092
(A steep slope with a maximum incline of 38°)

1702
01:03:57,862 --> 01:04:01,462
(An even more dizzying height)

1703
01:04:02,162 --> 01:04:06,442
(The last 100m is climbing toward the sky.)

1704
01:04:07,072 --> 01:04:10,042
(In Ah has entered the steep slope.)

1705
01:04:11,572 --> 01:04:13,912
(Uie, in 2nd place, is right behind In Ah.)

1706
01:04:14,282 --> 01:04:15,412
I'm almost gone.

1707
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,212
(Smiling)

1708
01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:19,381
(Her stamina is still at maximum.)

1709
01:04:19,382 --> 01:04:21,452
(The stamina freak continues to look calm.)

1710
01:04:22,052 --> 01:04:26,322
(Going up in her initial pace without getting tired)

1711
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:29,362
(And...)

1712
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:33,702
(Sae Rok is in 3rd place.)

1713
01:04:34,302 --> 01:04:38,332
(She calmly reaches 300m.)

1714
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:40,071
(The Iron Girls' current location)

1715
01:04:40,072 --> 01:04:42,601
(In Ah, 350m)

1716
01:04:42,602 --> 01:04:44,711
(Uie, 320m)

1717
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,582
(Sae Rok, 300m)

1718
01:04:46,912 --> 01:04:50,512
(Ju Hyun, 270m)

1719
01:04:50,912 --> 01:04:53,622
(They have about 5 minutes left.)

1720
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:57,222
(Will the Iron Girls make it in time?)

1721
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:01,192
(In Ah's current location: 350m)

1722
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:06,962
(The next level of the slope is giving her a hard time.)

1723
01:05:07,062 --> 01:05:08,131
(In Ah, Uie)

1724
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:12,202
(They're practically climbing up a cliff.)

1725
01:05:12,472 --> 01:05:14,772
Walk. I must walk. Stop.

1726
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:16,142
Walk.

1727
01:05:18,072 --> 01:05:19,441
Go down, and you'll fail.

1728
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:20,542
(In Ah walks up the 38° slope.)

1729
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:22,782
Endure it.

1730
01:05:23,582 --> 01:05:25,752
No. I can't endure it.

1731
01:05:26,252 --> 01:05:27,722
No. Endure it.

1732
01:05:29,122 --> 01:05:30,122
(While torn between two egos)

1733
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:31,922
Endure it.

1734
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:40,362
(She climbs up with explosive power.)

1735
01:05:42,762 --> 01:05:46,602
(Her back looks like that of a wild animal.)

1736
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:53,382
(Like she can devour everything)

1737
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:56,482
(And Stamina Queen Uie is climbing right behind her.)

1738
01:05:57,652 --> 01:06:00,322
(Going at the same pace as when she started)

1739
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:03,552
(Looking fresh without a sign of fatigue)

1740
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:08,992
(Unlike In Ah, who used a burst of energy and is now resting,)

1741
01:06:09,762 --> 01:06:11,161
(Uie keeps climbing slowly without taking a break.)

1742
01:06:11,162 --> 01:06:12,292
370m.

1743
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:15,631
(In Ah, Uie)

1744
01:06:15,632 --> 01:06:18,372
(The two are right before the finish line.)

1745
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:19,741
(In Ah's current location: 380m)

1746
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:20,802
(Screaming)

1747
01:06:22,642 --> 01:06:25,712
(Out of energy again)

1748
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:27,482
(Passing out)

1749
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:30,212
You, production crew!

1750
01:06:30,312 --> 01:06:32,951
(We prepared something intense since it's been a while.)

1751
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:34,851
Who made us come up here? Why are we doing this?

1752
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:36,392
(Simba Seol is tired now.)

1753
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,092
(Glancing)

1754
01:06:38,522 --> 01:06:39,762
You can do it, In Ah.

1755
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:41,392
Just a bit more.

1756
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:43,461
You're almost there.

1757
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,292
(Uie cheers In Ah on from behind.)

1758
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:47,362
(Struggling)

1759
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:49,501
(Encouraged by Uie,)

1760
01:06:49,502 --> 01:06:50,671
Here I go.

1761
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:52,002
(she starts climbing again.)

1762
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,772
(Squeezing out the last bit of her strength to go up again)

1763
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:00,511
I can do it.

1764
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:02,082
(She's back to being a wild animal.)

1765
01:07:02,782 --> 01:07:06,312
(The final burst without stopping)

1766
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:10,722
(Using all her strength as she continued to climb,)

1767
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:14,392
(In Ah reached 400m.)

1768
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,702
(She arrives with a last roar.)

1769
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:34,142
(In Ah has completed the course.)

1770
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:39,252
(What time did In Ah arrive?)

1771
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:43,892
(In Ah's ski jump race-up record: 10 minutes 19 seconds)

1772
01:07:44,722 --> 01:07:47,021
(She completed the course within 12 minutes.)

1773
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:48,122
Nice.

1774
01:07:49,522 --> 01:07:50,761
Hurry up, Uie.

1775
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:52,191
(Hurry up, Uie.)

1776
01:07:52,192 --> 01:07:53,361
Uie!

1777
01:07:53,362 --> 01:07:54,432
(Uie!)

1778
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:58,432
(Uie's current location: 390m)

1779
01:07:58,972 --> 01:08:00,042
390m.

1780
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,202
10m left.

1781
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,671
I'm almost there.

1782
01:08:04,672 --> 01:08:05,712
(Without a break until the end)

1783
01:08:06,512 --> 01:08:10,312
(Uie has maintained her pace from start to finish.)

1784
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:15,882
(Uie reached 400m.)

1785
01:08:17,692 --> 01:08:20,922
(Rushing over)

1786
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:22,822
Hurry, Uie.

1787
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:23,932
Good job.

1788
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:25,361
Hurry, Uie.

1789
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:26,432
Good job.

1790
01:08:29,362 --> 01:08:34,042
(Uie's ski jump race-up record: 11 minutes 17 seconds)

1791
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:37,142
(She completed the course within 12 minutes.)

1792
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:38,812
(She looks at the display board.)

1793
01:08:41,912 --> 01:08:43,911
(Shocked)

1794
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,111
For real?

1795
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:46,251
(For real?)

1796
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,281
Hold on.

1797
01:08:47,282 --> 01:08:48,481
They might make it.

1798
01:08:48,482 --> 01:08:49,752
(Hold on. They might make it.)

1799
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:51,751
They might make it.

1800
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:52,752
(She gets up after 10 seconds.)

1801
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:55,822
(Captain Uie looks for the other members.)

1802
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:57,562
You can do it!

1803
01:08:57,962 --> 01:08:58,991
(Sae Rok)

1804
01:08:58,992 --> 01:09:02,132
(Can Sae Rok hit the 12-minute mark?)

1805
01:09:02,274 --> 01:09:06,074
(Sae Rok's current location: 380m)

1806
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:09,613
I want...

1807
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:11,113
(I want...)

1808
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:12,414
to go home.

1809
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:15,384
You're almost there, Sae Rok.

1810
01:09:15,524 --> 01:09:16,594
You can do it.

1811
01:09:18,224 --> 01:09:21,524
(With her eyes fixed ahead, she takes one step at a time.)

1812
01:09:21,964 --> 01:09:23,464
Yes. Stay calm.

1813
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:26,504
(She's 10m away from the finish line.)

1814
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:28,204
You have enough time, Sae Rok.

1815
01:09:28,904 --> 01:09:31,174
Stick to your pace, Sae Rok.

1816
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,303
Let me set up the finish line.

1817
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,304
(Off to attach the finish line)

1818
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:36,743
She has to experience it.

1819
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:37,814
It's her first time.

1820
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:41,643
You're almost here.

1821
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,084
Come to this side.

1822
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,624
- I'm scared. - No, you can do it.

1823
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:48,224
I can't help you up here.

1824
01:09:48,624 --> 01:09:49,624
(Sae Rok drops down right by the finish line.)

1825
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,754
I'm scared.

1826
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,294
Are you okay?

1827
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,893
- It's scary. - I know it is.

1828
01:09:53,894 --> 01:09:54,963
(The fear of falling at any moment)

1829
01:09:54,964 --> 01:09:56,124
Don't look back.

1830
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:58,963
Good. You did well.

1831
01:09:58,964 --> 01:10:01,103
(Uie keeps encouraging the frightened Sae Rok.)

1832
01:10:01,104 --> 01:10:02,864
Sae Rok, grab this and climb up.

1833
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,573
- That's it. - I'm scared.

1834
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:07,474
It's okay. That's the finish line.

1835
01:10:07,574 --> 01:10:08,873
- Do you see it? - Yes.

1836
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:10,213
- I'm scared. - Okay, let's go.

1837
01:10:10,214 --> 01:10:11,943
- Keum Sae Rok! - Hang in there.

1838
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:13,714
Go for it. Look at the clock.

1839
01:10:13,844 --> 01:10:15,484
Go for it. Look at the clock.

1840
01:10:16,384 --> 01:10:17,484
Look at the clock.

1841
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:21,053
(Keum Sae Rok has completed the course.)

1842
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:22,984
You did it. Great job.

1843
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:24,754
Nice.

1844
01:10:26,494 --> 01:10:27,723
It was too scary.

1845
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:28,964
(Breathing heavily)

1846
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,034
How tiring.

1847
01:10:33,864 --> 01:10:37,234
(What's Sae Rok's time after that tough climb?)

1848
01:10:38,504 --> 01:10:42,004
(Sae Rok's ski jump race-up record: 13 minutes 27 seconds)

1849
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:47,584
(She didn't make it in time, but she pulled off a good record!)

1850
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:49,884
Mom.

1851
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,553
I miss my mom.

1852
01:10:51,554 --> 01:10:52,614
(I miss my mom.)

1853
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:55,923
(While Sae Rok, who has left home, is catching her breath)

1854
01:10:55,924 --> 01:10:57,254
It was too scary.

1855
01:10:58,024 --> 01:11:01,024
(Where is Ju Hyun?)

1856
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,334
You're 10 steps away from reaching 350m.

1857
01:11:05,064 --> 01:11:06,094
10m at a time.

1858
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:07,764
Be careful.

1859
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:10,474
50m.

1860
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,174
Catch your breath here.

1861
01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:14,073
Catch your breath.

1862
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:16,273
(The pain in her calves is tormenting Ju Hyun.)

1863
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:17,474
Catch your breath.

1864
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:22,583
It wasn't because I was out of breath...

1865
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:23,983
or hyperventilating.

1866
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:25,984
My calves just wouldn't work.

1867
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:27,754
You can do it.

1868
01:11:27,924 --> 01:11:30,123
(Last year, during the 123-story challenge)

1869
01:11:30,124 --> 01:11:31,354
My calves.

1870
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:33,323
- Right there. - Got it. Relax.

1871
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:37,864
(Ju Hyun's calves have always given her trouble.)

1872
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:39,393
This is horrible.

1873
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:42,834
(Even while working out, the pain gave her a hard time.)

1874
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:46,334
It really...

1875
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:47,844
Let's see.

1876
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,443
I felt frustrated...

1877
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:52,274
- and disappointed in myself. - Where?

1878
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:53,984
Is it your legs?

1879
01:11:54,514 --> 01:11:55,844
Are they not working?

1880
01:11:58,354 --> 01:12:00,884
You're at 340m. Just imagine reaching 365m.

1881
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:02,324
Slowly.

1882
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:05,594
I can't believe this.

1883
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:07,994
Let's do this. Come on.

1884
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:09,693
Her calves are weak.

1885
01:12:09,694 --> 01:12:12,063
The slope was slippery for her at the start.

1886
01:12:12,064 --> 01:12:13,234
(The members are worried as they know Ju Hyun's condition.)

1887
01:12:15,134 --> 01:12:16,834
You're almost there, Ju Hyun!

1888
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:19,673
If you can't, how about grabbing onto that as you climb?

1889
01:12:19,674 --> 01:12:21,204
(The pillar)

1890
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:22,603
Be careful as you cross the slope.

1891
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,743
Grab the ropes. Okay.

1892
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:25,813
(She decides to use the pillar on the other side.)

1893
01:12:25,814 --> 01:12:27,984
Let's see. Let's try it using the pillar.

1894
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,213
- Is it better? - Yes.

1895
01:12:30,214 --> 01:12:32,053
Grabbing the pillar is much better. Good.

1896
01:12:32,054 --> 01:12:33,653
- This is better. - My calves.

1897
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:35,423
- This will do. - This strains my calves less.

1898
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:37,224
There's less pressure on the calves. Raise your torso.

1899
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:40,293
- You're almost there. - You're almost there.

1900
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:41,524
You're almost done.

1901
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,594
- Gosh. - Grab the pillar.

1902
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,634
Support your heels.

1903
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,034
Raise your torso.

1904
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:49,164
Rely on your hands.

1905
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:51,234
You're almost there. 10m.

1906
01:12:51,235 --> 01:12:53,643
- You're almost here! - 10m.

1907
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:55,604
(Taking it one step at a time, she's in the last 10m.)

1908
01:12:56,074 --> 01:12:57,644
- Come this way. - Cross over.

1909
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,544
Come up. Come up first.

1910
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:02,184
- Cross over. - Uie.

1911
01:13:02,414 --> 01:13:04,554
You did an amazing job.

1912
01:13:04,654 --> 01:13:06,513
Climb over now.

1913
01:13:06,514 --> 01:13:09,823
(Taking one last tough step toward the end)

1914
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:11,023
- It's hot. - Ju Hyun.

1915
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:12,053
(Ju Hyun reached 400m.)

1916
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,194
My legs.

1917
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,164
- I had no other choice. - Go.

1918
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,663
This is...

1919
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:20,064
Sit.

1920
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:22,864
No, sit over there. Get on the mat.

1921
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:25,104
This was...

1922
01:13:26,504 --> 01:13:33,044
(Despite her calf pain, Ju Hyun showed perseverance.)

1923
01:13:33,814 --> 01:13:35,943
Are your legs all right, Uie?

1924
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,514
(She's fine.)

1925
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:40,424
How can she not take a rest?

1926
01:13:41,154 --> 01:13:42,254
That's wild.

1927
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,223
(Their ski jump race-up records)

1928
01:13:44,224 --> 01:13:45,623
(In Ah: 10 minutes 19 seconds, Uie: 11 minutes 17 seconds,)

1929
01:13:45,624 --> 01:13:47,063
(Sae Rok: 13 minutes 27 seconds, Ju Hyun: 19 minutes 18 seconds)

1930
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:49,093
The first training is never easy.

1931
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:50,833
But we came here without any preparation...

1932
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,033
- or knowledge of the place... - Exactly.

1933
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:55,464
and started climbing just five minutes after we arrived.

1934
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,173
I think you all did a fantastic job.

1935
01:13:57,174 --> 01:13:58,674
(The Iron Girls did their best.)

1936
01:13:58,774 --> 01:14:01,103
If you two had participated in last year's competition,

1937
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,203
you would've made it to the finals.

1938
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:05,314
From what I can see, Uie would've done...

1939
01:14:05,414 --> 01:14:07,744
much better if the distance had been twice as long.

1940
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:10,043
She barely broke a sweat by the time she finished.

1941
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:12,013
- When everyone else drops out, - For real.

1942
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,953
- her skills will begin to shine. - Right.

1943
01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:15,053
- It suits Uie more. - That's why...

1944
01:14:15,054 --> 01:14:16,793
- I prefer long-distance running. - Exactly.

1945
01:14:16,794 --> 01:14:19,753
I'd rather climb up this slope again.

1946
01:14:19,754 --> 01:14:20,893
How are we different?

1947
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:22,693
- That's just how lions are. - I didn't mean that.

1948
01:14:22,694 --> 01:14:24,033
- Lions... - That's not what I meant.

1949
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:25,093
Lions are naturally like that.

1950
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:26,363
They use up all their energy...

1951
01:14:26,364 --> 01:14:28,363
in a short burst to hunt.

1952
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:29,703
Lions can't run for more than one minute.

1953
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:31,033
- I'm a lion. - Yes.

1954
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,733
But those...

1955
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,973
who can run long distances.

1956
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:36,773
- They don't have a burst of energy. - No, never.

1957
01:14:36,774 --> 01:14:38,273
They have no bounce,

1958
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:39,543
but they excel in long distances.

1959
01:14:39,544 --> 01:14:41,543
We can bring that individual style...

1960
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,344
into boxing.

1961
01:14:43,814 --> 01:14:44,914
By the way...

1962
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,724
Let me remind you of what I said earlier.

1963
01:14:48,254 --> 01:14:51,194
The training ends if you make it within 12 minutes.

1964
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:53,123
If you don't,

1965
01:14:53,124 --> 01:14:54,624
you must go up the slope again...

1966
01:14:54,694 --> 01:14:56,664
as part of training.

1967
01:14:57,734 --> 01:15:00,663
(They forgot about the rule of today's training.)

1968
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:01,834
I'll climb up with you.

1969
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:03,873
It's you and me.

1970
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,173
(Happy)

1971
01:15:05,174 --> 01:15:07,574
It's okay. We can do it, Ju Hyun.

1972
01:15:07,774 --> 01:15:09,374
- Even Sae Rok? - Are you okay? Can you do it?

1973
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:11,374
- Of course. - Gosh.

1974
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:12,974
You scare me now.

1975
01:15:13,684 --> 01:15:14,843
- Because... - She's scary.

1976
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,613
I felt it the very first day we met.

1977
01:15:16,614 --> 01:15:18,713
There are athletes like her.

1978
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:21,324
The so-called maniacs with bright eyes.

1979
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:24,193
It was exhausting and extremely painful.

1980
01:15:24,194 --> 01:15:25,754
- But I'm fine now. - Right.

1981
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,423
Do it again, and it'll be excruciating again.

1982
01:15:28,424 --> 01:15:29,824
But I'll be fine again.

1983
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:32,493
How about this? In Ah.

1984
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,603
You climb with Sae Rok.

1985
01:15:33,604 --> 01:15:35,003
- I'll climb with Ju Hyun. - Okay.

1986
01:15:35,004 --> 01:15:36,204
- One more time. - Let's do it again.

1987
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:38,334
(Yes, because we're a team!)

1988
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,703
(Totally moved)

1989
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,404
- Okay. - How cool.

1990
01:15:43,574 --> 01:15:45,014
That was cool.

1991
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:47,383
There's no place for me here.

1992
01:15:47,384 --> 01:15:49,983
Will our training end for the day after the second climb?

1993
01:15:49,984 --> 01:15:51,383
- Stop. - What's with you, Sae Rok?

1994
01:15:51,384 --> 01:15:52,614
Is there more?

1995
01:15:52,684 --> 01:15:55,624
- I'm not doing it then. - Look, Sae Rok.

1996
01:15:55,654 --> 01:15:56,884
Where's the sun right now?

1997
01:15:57,194 --> 01:15:59,053
It's still up, right? It won't end yet.

1998
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,394
It'll end only after the sun sets. Let's get going now.

1999
01:16:01,494 --> 01:16:03,294
- As expected of the captain. - Come on.

2000
01:16:03,694 --> 01:16:05,263
Guys, the faster we do it, the sooner it'll be over.

2001
01:16:05,264 --> 01:16:06,293
- Okay. - Got it?

2002
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:07,334
Let's go.

2003
01:16:07,464 --> 01:16:08,503
(A little while later)

2004
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:10,934
Oh, my gosh. She actually went down there.

2005
01:16:12,104 --> 01:16:14,944
(What happened to the girls?)

2006
01:16:15,544 --> 01:16:16,604
Let's go.

2007
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:17,744
Let's do this.

2008
01:16:18,114 --> 01:16:20,743
(The second ski jump race-up attempt)

2009
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:21,784
Slowly.

2010
01:16:23,084 --> 01:16:25,413
(This time, they're aiming to complete the course,)

2011
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,784
(not to set a record.)

2012
01:16:27,324 --> 01:16:29,324
(They begin the second attempt.)

2013
01:16:33,864 --> 01:16:35,363
(Sae Rok and In Ah take the lead from the start.)

2014
01:16:35,364 --> 01:16:36,493
If possible,

2015
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:38,163
let's speed up in that blue section...

2016
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:40,193
and slow down once we're up there.

2017
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:41,434
- On the artificial turf. - Okay.

2018
01:16:42,134 --> 01:16:43,563
(The two have already reached the artificial turf.)

2019
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:44,674
Let's run.

2020
01:16:45,704 --> 01:16:46,733
Let's go.

2021
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:48,204
(As planned, they pick up the pace.)

2022
01:16:48,844 --> 01:16:50,973
Use your toes and lower your torso.

2023
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:52,014
Okay.

2024
01:16:52,414 --> 01:16:53,884
- Tell me when it gets tough. - Okay.

2025
01:16:54,544 --> 01:16:57,154
(Age doesn't matter when it comes to exercise.)

2026
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:59,353
(She quickly reached 160m.)

2027
01:16:59,354 --> 01:17:01,154
(Sae Rok, Ju Hyun)

2028
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:03,084
(Breathing heavily)

2029
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:06,323
(Staggering)

2030
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:08,593
(As the slope inclines, Sae Rok's pace has dropped.)

2031
01:17:08,594 --> 01:17:10,964
Using your whole feet will tire you out more.

2032
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:11,994
Use your toes.

2033
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:14,063
(Input: Use your toes.)

2034
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:15,934
(Output: Going on all fours)

2035
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,273
(I can't do it.)

2036
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:18,304
I'm tired.

2037
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:20,203
You're already crawling? I don't recommend that.

2038
01:17:20,204 --> 01:17:21,703
Keep your pace.

2039
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,274
(In Ah doesn't get why Sae Rok is already walking on all fours.)

2040
01:17:23,674 --> 01:17:25,244
How can you walk up standing?

2041
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,783
Sae Rok, take a break after you step on that.

2042
01:17:27,784 --> 01:17:28,883
- I think it'll help. - Okay.

2043
01:17:28,884 --> 01:17:30,653
Let's take a break. Relax.

2044
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:31,813
(She turns her head instinctively.)

2045
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,284
Don't look behind.

2046
01:17:33,384 --> 01:17:34,424
Oh, my.

2047
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,353
- How scary. - We promised not to look back.

2048
01:17:37,354 --> 01:17:38,453
It's shocking, right?

2049
01:17:38,454 --> 01:17:39,623
(Startled by the unexpected height)

2050
01:17:39,624 --> 01:17:40,764
(Trembling)

2051
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,223
- It's my first time seeing it. - Don't look back.

2052
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:44,293
(In Ah is excited by the view she's seeing for the first time.)

2053
01:17:44,294 --> 01:17:46,464
You're really amazing, In Ah.

2054
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:49,064
I want to walk up standing like you.

2055
01:17:49,104 --> 01:17:51,633
Good idea. My feet are pretty muscular.

2056
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:53,103
I can walk up easily.

2057
01:17:53,104 --> 01:17:54,104
Gosh.

2058
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:55,444
Unbelievable.

2059
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:57,174
(Astonished by the easy-looking demonstration)

2060
01:17:57,844 --> 01:17:58,844
Let me give it a shot.

2061
01:17:58,845 --> 01:18:00,114
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

2062
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:02,644
(She gathers all her strength and walks up.)

2063
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:03,684
What?

2064
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:05,184
Yes, good.

2065
01:18:06,614 --> 01:18:07,883
(Taking in In Ah's feedback)

2066
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,024
You're doing well.

2067
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:10,554
What's gotten into you?

2068
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:12,854
You've got some strong willpower.

2069
01:18:13,024 --> 01:18:14,123
Your stamina...

2070
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:15,493
(Gritting her teeth, Sae Rok keeps going up.)

2071
01:18:15,494 --> 01:18:16,793
is not that bad.

2072
01:18:16,794 --> 01:18:18,064
She's got willpower.

2073
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:23,264
You climbed a lot in that short time.

2074
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:27,644
(Starting at 220m, she climbed nonstop...)

2075
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:29,974
(and reached 250m in one breath.)

2076
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:32,273
You're doing great.

2077
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,114
As far as I can tell, Sae Rok...

2078
01:18:34,384 --> 01:18:36,243
is similar to In Ah in how she uses her energy.

2079
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,314
Yes. She goes all out and then takes a rest.

2080
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:42,153
(In Ah's style: One big spurt,)

2081
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:44,354
(then rest)

2082
01:18:44,794 --> 01:18:46,894
(Like In Ah, Sae Rok took a rest.)

2083
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:49,094
- What? - Gosh.

2084
01:18:49,194 --> 01:18:50,833
It's another sudden burst of energy.

2085
01:18:50,834 --> 01:18:52,293
- Nice. Let's go together. - What?

2086
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,204
- What's this? - Just run.

2087
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:57,773
Right now, it's like a flurry in boxing.

2088
01:18:57,774 --> 01:18:58,804
(Releasing her stored energy)

2089
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,774
You're doing well. You can do it, Keum Sae Rok.

2090
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:03,913
Let's become an action actress.

2091
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:05,973
(Climbing up while dreaming of becoming an action actress)

2092
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:08,783
- Sae Rok is doing great right now. - She's doing so well.

2093
01:19:08,784 --> 01:19:09,784
(The 2nd incline section is already right before them!)

2094
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,654
(Breathing heavily)

2095
01:19:15,124 --> 01:19:16,323
It's our second attempt.

2096
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,154
(She's becoming paler by the minute.)

2097
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,523
Take a break. This won't do. Sit.

2098
01:19:19,524 --> 01:19:21,394
- No. I'm going to rest over there. - "No?"

2099
01:19:22,194 --> 01:19:23,423
But your breathing sounds off.

2100
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:25,634
(Going up without stopping, powered by sheer willpower)

2101
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,804
- I'm okay. I can do it. - After I go back down.

2102
01:19:29,104 --> 01:19:31,503
- I can do it. - Where are the other two?

2103
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:33,573
(Sae Rok climbs the last slope,)

2104
01:19:33,574 --> 01:19:35,303
(reminding herself that she can do it.)

2105
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:36,944
She's battling her own fight.

2106
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:38,814
Let's go.

2107
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:41,984
I can do it.

2108
01:19:42,184 --> 01:19:44,954
I can do it.

2109
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:49,084
(Sae Rok holds out with willpower alone.)

2110
01:19:49,624 --> 01:19:52,123
(Sae Rok arrives at the 2nd incline section.)

2111
01:19:52,124 --> 01:19:56,423
- Take a break. - Gosh. I'm tired.

2112
01:19:56,424 --> 01:20:00,034
(All that's left is the brutal steep incline.)

2113
01:20:01,104 --> 01:20:02,203
You're almost there.

2114
01:20:02,204 --> 01:20:03,764
(Sae Rok climbs up the last slope.)

2115
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:05,004
You can do it, Sae Rok.

2116
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:06,104
- Yes, I can. - You're doing good.

2117
01:20:07,404 --> 01:20:10,244
(Breathing heavily because of the steep slope)

2118
01:20:11,414 --> 01:20:14,084
(In the end, she starts walking on all fours.)

2119
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:18,814
(Sae Rok goes up with all her might towards the finish line.)

2120
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:21,354
Two more sets just like that.

2121
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:23,484
Think of it like doing two sets at the gym.

2122
01:20:24,024 --> 01:20:25,093
Okay.

2123
01:20:25,094 --> 01:20:27,054
(By following In Ah's advice,)

2124
01:20:27,964 --> 01:20:28,964
(she is now just 50m away from the finish line.)

2125
01:20:28,965 --> 01:20:29,994
Mom.

2126
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:31,394
Take a break.

2127
01:20:32,434 --> 01:20:35,464
(In Ah has Sae Rok's back while she's taking a break.)

2128
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,234
I'm right behind you.

2129
01:20:38,374 --> 01:20:39,934
Let's just go up to 360m.

2130
01:20:40,204 --> 01:20:41,373
370m.

2131
01:20:41,374 --> 01:20:43,443
(She sets the target to 370m herself.)

2132
01:20:43,444 --> 01:20:44,614
Go.

2133
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,643
(She goes up again!)

2134
01:20:46,644 --> 01:20:47,713
10m.

2135
01:20:47,714 --> 01:20:50,584
She goes all out again as long as she has time to recover.

2136
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:52,783
Ten more steps. One, two, three, four,

2137
01:20:52,784 --> 01:20:55,684
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Let's rest.

2138
01:20:56,224 --> 01:20:57,654
No? All right.

2139
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:00,524
(Even though she's gasping for air,)

2140
01:21:00,964 --> 01:21:03,194
(she chooses to crawl without stopping...)

2141
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:08,064
(and keeps going until she reaches the goal.)

2142
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:09,364
One more.

2143
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:10,504
Seven.

2144
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:12,204
That's it.

2145
01:21:12,404 --> 01:21:13,904
You climbed up 20m without a break.

2146
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,403
How scary.

2147
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,644
You're strong, Keum Sae Rok.

2148
01:21:18,914 --> 01:21:20,044
You're cool.

2149
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:22,544
- I'm exhausted. - Take a long break.

2150
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,454
You're doing great. I'm proud of you.

2151
01:21:26,614 --> 01:21:29,784
(In Ah takes thorough care of Sae Rok's condition.)

2152
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:31,853
- I'm almost there. - You're almost there.

2153
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,094
Let's see this through.

2154
01:21:33,324 --> 01:21:35,024
- Don't take a break midway. - No, don't.

2155
01:21:36,194 --> 01:21:37,364
Here she goes.

2156
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,364
Here goes the lion.

2157
01:21:39,894 --> 01:21:41,933
- Good. - She's doing great.

2158
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:43,204
(Passing the 380m mark)

2159
01:21:43,974 --> 01:21:46,773
Three, four, five.

2160
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:48,074
(Passing the 390m mark)

2161
01:21:48,444 --> 01:21:50,474
- You're almost there, Keum Sae Rok. - You're almost there.

2162
01:21:50,544 --> 01:21:52,014
Five more steps, and you're done.

2163
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,484
- Twelve, thirteen. - Okay. You're almost there.

2164
01:21:56,084 --> 01:21:57,314
Okay. Great job.

2165
01:21:57,554 --> 01:21:59,254
- I'm scared. - Good job, Sae Rok.

2166
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:01,854
I want to go home.

2167
01:22:02,524 --> 01:22:04,654
Good job. You did much better than earlier.

2168
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,693
I'm serious. Go ahead.

2169
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:09,794
(Sae Rok heads to the finish line.)

2170
01:22:11,434 --> 01:22:14,164
(Keum Sae Rok nailed her second attempt.)

2171
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:17,933
(Here lies Keum Sae Rok.)

2172
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:19,874
Great job.

2173
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,644
She's just like me.

2174
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:25,814
One big spurt, then rest.

2175
01:22:26,014 --> 01:22:27,584
Send me home.

2176
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:29,644
I want to go home.

2177
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,914
Well done. You came up twice.

2178
01:22:32,984 --> 01:22:34,523
Give yourself a round of applause.

2179
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:36,553
(Sae Rok is the best.)

2180
01:22:36,554 --> 01:22:39,454
It was less tiring than before...

2181
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:41,264
because In Ah helped me.

2182
01:22:42,494 --> 01:22:44,334
That only makes me want to help you more.

2183
01:22:44,894 --> 01:22:46,594
In Ah is awesome.

2184
01:22:47,834 --> 01:22:50,304
She kept rooting for me.

2185
01:22:51,274 --> 01:22:52,303
(Come to think of it)

2186
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:53,773
- Where's Ju Hyun? - I'll be right back.

2187
01:22:53,774 --> 01:22:54,874
Go ahead.

2188
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:56,274
I can't go with you.

2189
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,244
What? Ju Hyun is still not here?

2190
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:02,714
(Ju Hyun isn't near the finish line.)

2191
01:23:02,715 --> 01:23:04,014
I can't see her yet.

2192
01:23:07,084 --> 01:23:08,883
(No matter how far down, she can't be seen.)

2193
01:23:08,884 --> 01:23:10,624
Where's Ju Hyun? I'm down here already.

2194
01:23:11,394 --> 01:23:14,863
(Ju Hyun's current location:)

2195
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:17,533
(270m)

2196
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,694
You're almost there.

2197
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,034
Ju Hyun, you need to walk.

2198
01:23:21,904 --> 01:23:23,133
(Taking the advice, Ju Hyun begins to walk.)

2199
01:23:23,134 --> 01:23:24,174
This is...

2200
01:23:24,574 --> 01:23:25,674
Let's do this.

2201
01:23:26,104 --> 01:23:27,273
Let's go, Park Ju Hyun!

2202
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:30,003
(She drags her trembling leg forward.)

2203
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:31,474
She's walking.

2204
01:23:31,744 --> 01:23:33,273
You can do it. You're almost there.

2205
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,344
(Walking down easily)

2206
01:23:34,544 --> 01:23:36,383
You're doing great. Nice.

2207
01:23:36,384 --> 01:23:37,484
(Simba Seol is already down the slope.)

2208
01:23:37,784 --> 01:23:40,614
(Even In Ah has come down to help Ju Hyun.)

2209
01:23:40,924 --> 01:23:42,683
(Sae Rok is all alone at the top.)

2210
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,324
Did In Ah go down?

2211
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:47,093
(Shocked)

2212
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:49,594
What? How did she go down?

2213
01:23:50,264 --> 01:23:51,364
Oh, no.

2214
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:53,194
Where's Ju Hyun?

2215
01:23:53,764 --> 01:23:55,204
I can't go down.

2216
01:23:55,304 --> 01:23:56,434
My legs are shaking.

2217
01:23:57,304 --> 01:23:58,604
(Gulping)

2218
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,473
For now, I'll grab this pole.

2219
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:03,474
(She musters up the courage and moves forward.)

2220
01:24:03,574 --> 01:24:06,174
(A dizzying view)

2221
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:11,314
(Automatically sitting in a humble posture)

2222
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,324
How did she go down there?

2223
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:16,754
Should I head down as well?

2224
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:19,293
What do I do?

2225
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:20,624
(Sitting down, she thinks about it for a while.)

2226
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:22,693
Let's go.

2227
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:24,534
(Shutting her eyes tight)

2228
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:27,503
This is dead scary.

2229
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:29,363
(Going down each step on her bottom)

2230
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,104
How do I go down?

2231
01:24:31,304 --> 01:24:34,774
(She just manages to grab the handrail.)

2232
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:36,373
(Struggling)

2233
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:37,844
This is too scary.

2234
01:24:40,344 --> 01:24:41,644
I love you, Mom.

2235
01:24:44,044 --> 01:24:49,324
(She's moments away from crying.)

2236
01:24:49,654 --> 01:24:52,294
I can do it.

2237
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:53,794
I can do it too.

2238
01:24:54,364 --> 01:24:56,124
(Sniffling)

2239
01:24:57,124 --> 01:24:58,193
(A triumph)

2240
01:24:58,194 --> 01:24:59,234
(She's finally at the starting point of the 2nd incline.)

2241
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:01,464
You can do it, Park Ju Hyun!

2242
01:25:02,234 --> 01:25:03,434
You came all the way down here?

2243
01:25:04,064 --> 01:25:06,673
Park Ju Hyun is so cool!

2244
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:07,874
(Ju Hyun, Sae Rok)

2245
01:25:07,944 --> 01:25:09,074
That's it.

2246
01:25:09,374 --> 01:25:10,774
Isn't this better?

2247
01:25:10,914 --> 01:25:12,143
Getting pushed is better.

2248
01:25:12,144 --> 01:25:13,474
(Ju Hyun arrives at the 2nd incline section.)

2249
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:15,683
- Be careful. - Look at her bottom.

2250
01:25:15,684 --> 01:25:16,713
What's this?

2251
01:25:16,714 --> 01:25:18,853
(She's climbed with her whole body and is now a mess.)

2252
01:25:18,854 --> 01:25:19,914
Is she okay?

2253
01:25:20,184 --> 01:25:21,224
(Struggling)

2254
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:24,224
(Groaning)

2255
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:27,523
- Take a break here, Ju Hyun. - Take a break.

2256
01:25:27,524 --> 01:25:28,563
(She finally meets Sae Rok.)

2257
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:29,724
- I can't do it. - It's the last section.

2258
01:25:29,894 --> 01:25:31,193
- You're almost there. - It's the last one.

2259
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,933
(The Iron Girls have gathered for Ju Hyun.)

2260
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:34,033
You made it all the way here.

2261
01:25:34,034 --> 01:25:35,464
- You can do it, Park Ju Hyun. - Park Ju Hyun.

2262
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:37,103
You came all the way here.

2263
01:25:37,104 --> 01:25:38,404
Do you want to use the stairs?

2264
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,044
Climb the stairs for the last bit.

2265
01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:43,443
- Isn't it tough? - Do that. I bet it hurts.

2266
01:25:43,444 --> 01:25:44,444
Exactly.

2267
01:25:44,844 --> 01:25:46,113
There's more training after this.

2268
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:47,143
(The best decision for her current calf condition)

2269
01:25:47,144 --> 01:25:48,843
Okay. Take the stairs.

2270
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:49,983
(They choose to take the stairs for the last 100m.)

2271
01:25:49,984 --> 01:25:51,583
Let's go. But...

2272
01:25:51,584 --> 01:25:53,753
don't take a break for training.

2273
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:54,954
- Okay. - On the stairs.

2274
01:25:55,054 --> 01:25:57,724
(After that,)

2275
01:25:58,694 --> 01:26:02,163
(Ju Hyun didn't take a single break.)

2276
01:26:02,164 --> 01:26:03,294
Good job.

2277
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,063
Ju Hyun, you can do it.

2278
01:26:05,064 --> 01:26:06,493
Way to go.

2279
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,533
(She walked up 100m.)

2280
01:26:07,534 --> 01:26:08,633
It helps, right?

2281
01:26:08,634 --> 01:26:09,933
(She walked up 100m.)

2282
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:11,104
It's helping.

2283
01:26:11,534 --> 01:26:12,534
It helps, right?

2284
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,904
It was the friends...

2285
01:26:15,074 --> 01:26:16,403
who helped me keep going.

2286
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:17,943
(It was the members who helped her keep going.)

2287
01:26:17,944 --> 01:26:19,243
I was thankful.

2288
01:26:19,244 --> 01:26:20,543
And I felt bad.

2289
01:26:20,544 --> 01:26:22,083
(She's thankful and sorry to the members.)

2290
01:26:22,084 --> 01:26:23,344
- You're here. - You're here.

2291
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:27,984
(She finally climbed the high slope.)

2292
01:26:28,284 --> 01:26:29,454
Let's go.

2293
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:30,993
(The ski jump race-up)

2294
01:26:30,994 --> 01:26:32,193
(Park Ju Hyun's second attempt is a success.)

2295
01:26:32,194 --> 01:26:33,954
Good job.

2296
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:36,424
I'm so tired.

2297
01:26:36,994 --> 01:26:39,064
Good job. You did it.

2298
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,063
My legs are aching.

2299
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:42,204
(My legs are aching.)

2300
01:26:43,334 --> 01:26:44,534
Okay.

2301
01:26:44,834 --> 01:26:46,634
- Race completed. - Okay.

2302
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:47,904
Race completed.

2303
01:26:49,474 --> 01:26:50,674
- I can finally smile. - Race completed.

2304
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:54,244
It felt like I was climbing for an hour.

2305
01:26:54,714 --> 01:26:56,483
(I know how you feel.)

2306
01:26:56,484 --> 01:26:57,484
Still,

2307
01:26:57,485 --> 01:26:59,484
it's amazing that you did it twice.

2308
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:00,754
Good job.

2309
01:27:00,755 --> 01:27:02,453
(She gave her all.)

2310
01:27:02,454 --> 01:27:04,053
Well done.

2311
01:27:04,054 --> 01:27:05,123
(Everyone completed their race up the ski jump.)

2312
01:27:05,124 --> 01:27:06,893
Well done.

2313
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:07,963
Good work.

2314
01:27:07,964 --> 01:27:09,694
- It's finally over. - Well done.

2315
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,340
Finally, we get to start boxing.

2316
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,739
It looks fun.

2317
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,069
(The former national athlete coach Kim Ji Hoon...)

2318
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,670
(is here to take care of the Iron Girls.)

2319
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,179
(A fun boxing lesson with the coach in charge?)

2320
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,610
(A deadly boxing lesson with the coach in charge)

2321
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,450
(The legendary evil coach appears.)

2322
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,280
(The Spartan boxing lesson that tests their limits)

2323
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:30,089
(It's deadly hard.)

2324
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:32,019
(But the time they have left until the boxing competition is...)

2325
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,560
(only 3 months.)

2326
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,129
Now, 1 and 2.

2327
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:36,930
(They don't have time or energy.)

2328
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:38,459
(Are they giving up?)

2329
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,900
(To enhance the Iron Girls' stamina...)

2330
01:27:39,930 --> 01:27:40,999
(What?)

2331
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,300
(Who are they in uniforms?)

2332
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:46,699
(The women who fight the best in Korea are here.)

2333
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,340
(Taekwondo)

2334
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,110
(Wrestling)

2335
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,540
(Jiu-jitsu)

2336
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,010
(Special martial arts)

2337
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:54,480
(Who are these women?)

2338
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:59,179
(The best female fighters in the country are all here.)

2339
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,250
(The four hamsters are scared among them.)

2340
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:04,150
(No, we're boxing girls.)

2341
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:06,220
(No time to be afraid)

2342
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,289
(Iron Girls versus...)

2343
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,789
(the female fighters)

2344
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:13,000
(Who will be the winner of this match?)
