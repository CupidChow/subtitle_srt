1
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:33,746
(10 days until the 1st competition)

2
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:36,616
(In Phuket, Thailand, they experienced...)

3
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:37,956
During this Phuket trip...

4
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,256
(the Phuket Boot Camp.)

5
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:43,026
(To bring up their stamina,)

6
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:47,226
(they had the toughest training.)

7
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:49,466
(What was their next training?)

8
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:51,466
(Full sparring)

9
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:53,665
(Their opponents were...)

10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,865
(foreign boxers.)

11
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,036
(Ireland, Australia, UK, Thailand)

12
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:01,646
(The last sparring before the first competition)

13
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,016
You're doing great!

14
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:06,816
(A slugfest kicked off.)

15
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:09,045
(Their plane tickets weren't wasted...)

16
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,386
(because the sparring was fierce.)

17
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:14,726
(What's the remaining schedule of the Phuket Boot Camp?)

18
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:18,796
(Phuket Boot Camp, Day 2)

19
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:22,366
(What's Iron Girls' 1st schedule on their 2nd day in Phuket?)

20
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,266
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

21
00:01:24,536 --> 00:01:26,536
(Singing a tune)

22
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:30,406
(There's excitement in their voices.)

23
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,875
Gosh, we're in Phuket.

24
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,706
Gosh. Finally.

25
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:37,046
Finally, I feel like I'm in Thailand.

26
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,646
Phuket's morning.

27
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,445
(Let's enjoy this place until the afternoon training.)

28
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,885
I love it.

29
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,655
I'm so happy.

30
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:45,486
This is incredible.

31
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,256
I want to live in a house like this.

32
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,496
Isn't it our first time playing in a swimming pool?

33
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:53,265
It's our first time playing, period.

34
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,065
- I know.
- When we trained for a triathlon,

35
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,966
we never visited a swimming pool.

36
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:58,466
It'll be fun.

37
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:01,135
I'll see Uie swim.

38
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,205
- Me? What should I do?
- I've never seen it.

39
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,305
You've never seen it, right?

40
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:05,476
Shall I put on a wetsuit?

41
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,046
Shall I show you?

42
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,106
Shall we go to the sea? Shall I put on a wetsuit?

43
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:12,616
One, two, three, four.

44
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,946
Hold the shoulder next to you and stretch the right thigh.

45
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,316
Like this?

46
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,626
One, two, three...

47
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,286
Seven, eight.

48
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:23,756
- My hamstrings are about to snap.
- Stretch those muscles.

49
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,195
(Screaming)

50
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,426
We can't sit down. We can't sit down now.

51
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:30,996
We really can't sit down.

52
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,666
(Screaming)

53
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,765
We want to swim...

54
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,335
in a pretty swimming pool this way.

55
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,435
(The aftereffect of yesterday's intense training)

56
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,306
Had I known about this, I would've put on a wetsuit.

57
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:40,046
(Screaming)

58
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,146
(Sighing)

59
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,016
- I can't do it.
- I can't do it.

60
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:44,715
Can we enter the pool now?

61
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:45,816
(After warming up, they enjoy their free time.)

62
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:47,646
- Step on me.
- Okay.

63
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:49,286
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

64
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:56,326
(They submerge themselves for a mysterious reason.)

65
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,596
Let's go!

66
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:00,826
(Let's go!)

67
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,566
Aquaman!

68
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:04,096
(Aquaman!)

69
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:08,166
(They continue to submerge themselves.)

70
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:10,836
That was so unpleasant.

71
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,735
- That was so...
- Right.

72
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:14,105
- Did we do that right?
- That was too strong.

73
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,846
- That was so unpleasant.
- I mean...

74
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,616
(Pressing down)

75
00:03:19,046 --> 00:03:25,356
(Uie got stepped on and dragged in the water.)

76
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:32,096
(These are the model examples of what they attempted.)

77
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,826
- The next Aquaman is...
- Yes.

78
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,595
- Here.
- I feel bad about grabbing...

79
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,366
- your hair.
- It's okay. That's how it's done.

80
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,666
- That's how it's done.
- Really?

81
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:41,936
Shall we go?

82
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,675
(She grabs In Ah's hair and sets off.)

83
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:47,606
(Heave-ho)

84
00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:51,016
(Let's go.)

85
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,316
(I'm Aquaman.)

86
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,655
- Did it work?
- I think so.

87
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,086
I did it, right?

88
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,486
I stood up, right?

89
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,156
I want to do it again.

90
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:06,096
Ma'am, you need to pay the entrance fee.

91
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,026
You need to pay to grab the hair.

92
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,865
- It's five dollars.
- My hair is a great handle, right?

93
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,895
- Yes. Let's go.
- Let's begin.

94
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,535
- How do we do it?
- Uie, just...

95
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,536
(Let's go.)

96
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,276
(Dodging)

97
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,406
(Sharp)

98
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,646
(Solemn)

99
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,906
(I'm Aquaman.)

100
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,116
(Laughing)

101
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:25,915
Hey, it's no joke under the water.

102
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,886
- It's so funny under the water.
- Was it okay?

103
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,756
(Pressing down)

104
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:38,056
(Kicking hard)

105
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,495
Sae Rok is strong.

106
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,996
You should try Muay Thai.

107
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,395
She has strong kicks.

108
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:45,836
- She's good at riding.
- Yes.

109
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,436
When she suddenly got up,

110
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,835
I went like this.

111
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,536
(Iron Children are having fun.)

112
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:55,346
Are you guys going to try swimming?

113
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,346
This pool...

114
00:04:58,246 --> 00:04:59,746
- is 15m.
- Okay.

115
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,216
What's the distance if you make ten laps?

116
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,715
- What are we doing?
- Ten laps?

117
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:04,786
Aren't you going to stretch your muscles?

118
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,326
I don't want to play with her.

119
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:09,996
But we really need to stretch our muscles.

120
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,155
Since we're used to boxing,

121
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:14,166
swimming is a rehabilitation exercise.

122
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,295
Let's just have six laps.

123
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,465
- Let's go. Okay.
- Let's go.

124
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,196
- Let's go.
- Get ready.

125
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,206
Set, go.

126
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:30,716
(Ju Hyun, Sae Rok)

127
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,315
- She's good.
- She's good.

128
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,345
(Sae Rok has impressive swimming skills.)

129
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:36,186
- What?
- They look pretty.

130
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,456
They're really good.

131
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:47,966
(Having done a triathlon, Ju Hyun can swim easily.)

132
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:56,106
(The ace member, Uie sets off.)

133
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:00,675
She's so fast.

134
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:01,776
(She reaches the halfway point in no time.)

135
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,546
You're cool. Gosh, she's so fast.

136
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:07,546
(In Ah sets off.)

137
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:16,286
(Mermaid Seol is back.)

138
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:21,496
(Swimming Queen, Uie)

139
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,735
They're really good.

140
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:30,536
(They are both so good.)

141
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:34,846
(Iron Girls don't forget to train even during playtime.)

142
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,176
(They finish warming up during playtime.)

143
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:39,715
I did my best.

144
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:41,046
How do you breathe?

145
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,385
- Now, - Yes?

146
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,915
let's wash up and get ready.

147
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,056
- Okay.
- Okay.

148
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:49,225
You guys always use my shampoo,

149
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,555
so I brought it from home.

150
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:51,595
Yes!

151
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:53,725
When I shampoo my hair abroad,

152
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,025
it becomes very frizzy...

153
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:56,665
- and brittle.
- That's right.

154
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,695
- Thank you.
- Yes.

155
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,335
But this shampoo is different.

156
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,706
- Really?
- Let me use it.

157
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:02,305
- You'll take a shower first, right?
- Yes.

158
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,076
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

159
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,205
(They take time to get ready for a refreshing day.)

160
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,375
It's really nice.

161
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,676
It even smells nice.

162
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,545
I just shampooed my hair, but it turned very soft.

163
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,115
Right? It's like using a treatment,

164
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:15,345
- right?
- Yes.

165
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,415
My hair becomes damaged in an instant...

166
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,186
if the water isn't right abroad.

167
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,655
And since my hair is short,

168
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,256
it needs volume.

169
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,056
When I use this product, it becomes voluminous.

170
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:26,455
Dry your hair.

171
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:31,435
(Dry your hair well.)

172
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:32,466
It's nice.

173
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,236
- My hair became voluminous.
- Yes.

174
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,575
There's more volume,

175
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,276
- right?
- Seriously.

176
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,305
Let's go and train.

177
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:44,216
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

178
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,016
- Hello, Captain.
- Hey.

179
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:50,256
What will happen in the afternoon?

180
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,115
There are boxing gyms here and there.

181
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:53,325
There are boxing gyms everywhere.

182
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:55,856
- "Muay Thai." - "Boxing."

183
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,155
People love Muay Thai here.

184
00:07:58,156 --> 00:07:59,455
A Korean equivalent...

185
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,766
- would be a taekwondo village.
- Seriously.

186
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:03,535
(Which training will Iron Girls do?)

187
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:05,366
- It's Muay Thai!
- All right.

188
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:06,705
When you think of Thailand,

189
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:07,805
- Muay Thai comes to mind.
- Yes.

190
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:08,935
Let me tell you about this place.

191
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,335
In Phuket,

192
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,075
it's the biggest Muay Thai gym.

193
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,806
(The biggest Muay Thai gym in Phuket)

194
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,545
(It's the most popular gym in Phuket.)

195
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,415
Muay Thai and boxing have many things in common.

196
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,615
They influence each other a lot.

197
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:24,185
Thus, this gym has a lot to do with boxing as well.

198
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:26,516
- Also, a special coach...
- Okay.

199
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,726
is waiting in the ring inside.

200
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,695
Is this person a local?

201
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,155
Yes, this person is a foreigner.

202
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,765
- I won't tell you more.
- Sure.

203
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:35,596
I think this coach will be a woman.

204
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:36,935
Let's go and meet the coach.

205
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:38,566
- Okay.
- Let's go.

206
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,106
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

207
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,035
I feel like I'm entering an amusement park.

208
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:44,836
You'll be shocked if you check out the back.

209
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,476
- No way! This is so fascinating.
- It's the coolest.

210
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,846
(When you walk inside the gym)

211
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,356
I feel like I've entered a strange world.

212
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,056
If you walk to the back,

213
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:01,355
you'll keep seeing more booths.

214
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,285
(Countless exercise booths appear.)

215
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:04,496
What's this?

216
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,525
I think we've traveled through time and space.

217
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,266
(There's no end in sight. It's a huge gym.)

218
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,166
(This place is like a paradise to athletes.)

219
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,965
(It's full of fighters...)

220
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,206
(from around the world.)

221
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,106
There's a baby, too.

222
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,876
(They also offer a variety of fitness classes.)

223
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,176
(It's a haven for athletes.)

224
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:27,715
It must be a famous place.

225
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,046
They sell souvenirs.

226
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,986
I want to buy their boxing shorts.

227
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:33,686
There are so many items.

228
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,586
I think the gloves are pretty.

229
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,395
(There's even a restaurant...)

230
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,026
(where you can get protein after exercising.)

231
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,265
This place is a different world.

232
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:42,396
(The location of today's training is like a martial arts theme park.)

233
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,396
I didn't know that such a place existed.

234
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,165
They're doing knee kicks.

235
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,066
(Everywhere they look, people are doing martial arts.)

236
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,535
This place is no joke.

237
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:51,975
It's seriously cool.

238
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:54,646
This place is like a new world.

239
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,146
Hey!

240
00:09:58,676 --> 00:09:59,816
- What?
- I think it's her!

241
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:03,816
(Is there someone in the ring?)

242
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:05,185
- What?
- I think it's her!

243
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,355
She's so cool. What's going on?

244
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,885
- What?
- There she is.

245
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:09,226
- What?
- Let's go.

246
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:18,296
(Her fierce movements are unrivaled.)

247
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,336
(Who is this extraordinary boxer?)

248
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:26,235
(Shouting)

249
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:27,476
She's good.

250
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,015
(Their jaws drop.)

251
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,176
She's strong.

252
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:40,526
(They approach cautiously.)

253
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:43,755
(Is she the special coach?)

254
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,326
I'll call the coach.

255
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,496
- Coach.
- Hi.

256
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:49,665
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,195
Nice to meet you.

258
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:53,166
- Are you finished?
- I'm finished. I'm done.

259
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,736
(Iron Girls can't take their eyes off of her.)

260
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,876
She's our special coach.

261
00:10:57,936 --> 00:10:59,806
She's the world champion in boxing.

262
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:04,346
How are we meeting the world champion?

263
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,546
(Number 1 in the world?)

264
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:08,445
She's Coach Shannon Courtenay.

265
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:10,456
(Shannon Courtenay)

266
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,355
(World-class boxer)

267
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,226
(WBA champion)

268
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,096
(She's a professional boxer from the UK.)

269
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:22,126
(She began boxing in 2015.)

270
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,666
(In 4 years, she became a professional boxer.)

271
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,636
(In just 2 years after becoming a professional,)

272
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,676
(she held the WBA bantamweight title.)

273
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,776
(Boxing world champion, Shannon Courtenay)

274
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,116
(She's a world champion.)

275
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,015
- She's cool.
- Can you introduce yourself?

276
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,385
Hi, I'm Shannon Courtenay...

277
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,916
and I'm the WBA bantamweight world champion.

278
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,056
Okay. Gosh.

279
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:47,426
Seriously.

280
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,386
- She's cool.
- Right.

281
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:52,055
She's very hard to meet.

282
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:55,065
She's at the top of the world in this field.

283
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:57,496
I knew something about her she was different.

284
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:58,966
How old are you?

285
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,266
I'm 31.

286
00:12:00,406 --> 00:12:01,766
- Thirty-one?
- Thirty-one?

287
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:03,606
- She looks very young.
- I know.

288
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,476
You've got a baby face.

289
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,605
That's my name. Baby Face.

290
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:08,975
Your name?

291
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:11,016
- Really?
- Really?

292
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,515
- Nickname?
- Is her nickname Baby Face?

293
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,845
My boxing name is Baby Face Assassin.

294
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:16,015
(Shannon's boxing name, Baby Face Assassin)

295
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:17,355
Baby Face.

296
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:18,356
I knew it.

297
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:19,756
Baby Face Assassin.

298
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,226
- Baby Face Assassin.
- How cute.

299
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,756
- That's scary.
- Baby Face Assassin.

300
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,125
That's scary.

301
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,655
(Innocent face and not-so-innocent name)

302
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,265
Since she's on another level,

303
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,465
- I don't know where to begin...
- Same here.

304
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,135
or what to ask.

305
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:33,935
When did you begin boxing?

306
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,065
How old were you?

307
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,136
Ten years.

308
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,606
- Really?
- Ten years.

309
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:40,476
I won my world title in my seventh fight.

310
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:43,646
(The unbelievable record makes their jaws drop.)

311
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,475
(Shannon points to something.)

312
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:46,746
It's here.

313
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:48,746
- Can I...
- Yes!

314
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:50,316
What's that?

315
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,816
(It shines in its glory.)

316
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,726
(WBA Champion Belt)

317
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,995
It's my first time seeing it.

318
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,866
- Isn't it a decoration?
- I want it.

319
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:02,065
Everyone.

320
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,095
Isn't it a decoration?

321
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,395
World Boxing Association.

322
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:05,735
(World Boxing Association)

323
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,566
- I want to touch it.
- Touch it.

324
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:09,666
- It's so cool.
- I want to touch it.

325
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,036
Can I...

326
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,046
- Can I try it on?
- Yes. Of course, you can.

327
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:16,976
- How is it? Does it suit me?
- Leave it on.

328
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:18,646
It doesn't suit you.

329
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:19,976
It doesn't suit you.

330
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,486
- Doesn't it suit me?
- Do this.

331
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:26,115
- It's so heavy.
- Seriously, it's heavy.

332
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:27,156
(Heavy)

333
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,695
Gosh, my baby.

334
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:32,426
(She's cute.)

335
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:34,665
- This is incredible.
- This is...

336
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,866
The weight...

337
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:37,765
I'll put it here.

338
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,695
(Shannon's champion belt is very fascinating.)

339
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,605
Does a professional boxer...

340
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,276
get stressed out about losing weight?

341
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,776
The competition is next week, but these two...

342
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,975
are stressed out because they can't lose 2kg.

343
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,315
- Did you say 2kg?
- Yes.

344
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,176
I could do that in one hour.

345
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:54,585
(1 hour?)

346
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,245
- Just wear a sweat suit...
- Oh, my gosh.

347
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,815
and skip, and it'll come off.

348
00:13:57,816 --> 00:13:59,916
Okay. Let's stop being weak.

349
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,825
- I was very fat.
- Yes?

350
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,725
I smoked. I drank.

351
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:07,065
And I wanted to get fit.

352
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,696
And I loved boxing.

353
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:10,265
And I stuck to it.

354
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,895
And I got fit. I lost weight.

355
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,136
And I've become the world champion.

356
00:14:13,766 --> 00:14:16,466
- So, this was me before boxing.
- Okay.

357
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:19,736
Really?

358
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:21,975
- You're a liar.
- It's me.

359
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,676
- No. No way.
- It's me.

360
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:24,976
When?

361
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,815
(Shannon before taking up boxing 10 years ago)

362
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,485
I lost 30kg.

363
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,216
(After losing 30kg)

364
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,256
(Impressive)

365
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:33,486
30kg.

366
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:38,795
Let's begin the one-point lesson from the boxing champion.

367
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:40,595
- We're in your care.
- Thank you.

368
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:43,425
Today, which training will come first?

369
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,036
We're going to do skipping.

370
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,295
We're going to do the ladder,

371
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:47,465
padwork...

372
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,205
And then we're going to do technical sparring.

373
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,606
I'll spar you,

374
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:52,835
but technically.

375
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:54,345
- Okay.
- Not too heavy.

376
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:55,406
Okay.

377
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:56,675
I can't believe it!

378
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,016
Will I be in the ring with her?

379
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,275
Can I really do that?

380
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:00,316
(I can't believe I'll spar with the world's number 1!)

381
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:03,315
It's a precious lesson that can't be bought with money.

382
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,616
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

383
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,656
You know,

384
00:15:05,657 --> 00:15:08,085
since she currently works as a professional boxer,

385
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,425
she doesn't teach lessons.

386
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:11,855
No, you're my first.

387
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:12,925
The first.

388
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,025
(We're the first students.)

389
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:16,466
- I'm the first too.
- Oh, my gosh.

390
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,566
- Can I change into my boxing shoes?
- Yes.

391
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,696
I'm going to do my best.

392
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,436
- I want to put on my boxing shoes.
- Okay.

393
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:25,236
Let's begin the first lesson.

394
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:27,776
Jump ropes?

395
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:31,015
Coach will watch you first...

396
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,816
and decide what to teach you.

397
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,045
Jump rope for a minute.

398
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,846
It's time to show what you can do.

399
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,255
- Okay.
- Okay. Get ready.

400
00:15:39,256 --> 00:15:40,285
Set, go.

401
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:44,726
(They begin to jump rope for 1 minute.)

402
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,766
(In Ah warms up with rhythmic jump roping.)

403
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:53,396
(She can do high knees with ease now.)

404
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:58,406
(Ju Hyun does energetic high knees like a boxer.)

405
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,876
(Watching carefully)

406
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,516
(How is Sae Rok doing?)

407
00:16:05,176 --> 00:16:08,746
(She started out as a beginner at jump roping.)

408
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:13,416
(And through intense practice, she improved a lot.)

409
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,626
(But high knees were still too challenging for her.)

410
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,426
(How is she doing now, two months later?)

411
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,326
You practiced jump roping hard.

412
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,366
You're handling it so smoothly, without any tangles.

413
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:30,976
(Sae Rok has mastered even high knees.)

414
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,336
The last ten seconds.

415
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,006
High knees for ten seconds.

416
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,616
Five, four, three,

417
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:40,915
two, one. Time's up.

418
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,986
(What does the world champion think?)

419
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,715
You're very stiff. You need to relax.

420
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:47,256
And make it really easy.

421
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:50,286
When you try too much, you're out of breath.

422
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,096
She says you need to relax and make it light.

423
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,126
What do we do now?

424
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,925
- Can we get a glimpse...
- Show me.

425
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,465
of a world champion's jump roping?

426
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,566
I'm so curious.

427
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,466
- Show them?
- Watching it is part of training.

428
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:07,746
(With incredible speed)

429
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,805
(Gently)

430
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,346
- Her jump roping...
- Nice and easy.

431
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,086
- Loose and then...
- Easy. Relax.

432
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:20,755
How does she do that?

433
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,885
Even after doing all that,

434
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:22,985
- she's not out of breath.
- Look.

435
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:24,756
My arms are really loose.

436
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,496
- So I'm not out of breath. Easy.
- How does she do that?

437
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:30,026
Yes?

438
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:33,596
Will we be able to jump rope so cool like that?

439
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:35,906
Slow. Go on. Ready.

440
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,405
This one is called a side swing.

441
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,676
You swing it from side to side. Okay?

442
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,545
- Swing.
- Swing.

443
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:44,215
- Go around.
- Around.

444
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:46,076
(Step 1: Swinging from side to side)

445
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,716
- Okay.
- And then you go...

446
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:51,256
(Step 2: Swinging from side to side and single unders)

447
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,556
(Now, they each practice the side swing.)

448
00:17:55,486 --> 00:17:57,395
That's it. Uie is doing it.

449
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:58,526
- Gosh.
- Hang on.

450
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:00,456
- And then you go...
- Jumping.

451
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,426
- How do I do that?
- Jumping.

452
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:04,765
(It's not easy even for In Ah, the Sports Genius.)

453
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,296
When should I jump?

454
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,775
- Swing twice and jump.
- Yes.

455
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,536
- Yes.
- Swing and...

456
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:14,805
- She's got it.
- Swing twice and jump.

457
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:16,275
(She quickly got the hang of it after a few tries.)

458
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:17,676
- Gosh.
- How do you do that?

459
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:19,115
(Jumping lightly)

460
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:20,215
- Yes.
- How is she so good at it?

461
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,815
Wait. What do you do after this?

462
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,246
You're so good.

463
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,356
If you jump rope like that, you look like you're good at it.

464
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:29,025
(The second move)

465
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,326
(Double unders)

466
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:32,795
- Right?
- Double unders.

467
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:35,296
- Double unders.
- On a jump, twice. Twice around.

468
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,996
I really want to do this.

469
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,566
Ju Hyun, show us.

470
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:44,335
(Ju Hyun's double unders)

471
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:46,506
(She performed 7 double unders.)

472
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:48,806
We should enter Ju Hyun in a jump rope competition.

473
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:52,245
(In Ah's double unders)

474
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,576
In Ah is good.

475
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:55,186
In Ah is doing well.

476
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,015
Gosh.

477
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,585
- How many times did you do that?
- Yes.

478
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,286
(She's good.)

479
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:01,926
In Ah is good.

480
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:06,656
Okay. Now, with all the skills I taught you,

481
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:09,766
you will jump rope for nine minutes. Okay?

482
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:11,296
- Nine minutes?
- Nine minutes?

483
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:14,536
I've never done it for nine minutes without a break.

484
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,165
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

485
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,935
- It's not easy.
- One, two, three.

486
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,106
- Go.
- Go.

487
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:20,576
For nine minutes, without stopping.

488
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:23,405
- Just be simple. Basic.
- Jump.

489
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:25,246
- Easy.
- Easy.

490
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,176
- Easy.
- Easy.

491
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:28,686
Easy.

492
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:30,316
Easy.

493
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:33,485
I like this one the most.

494
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,985
(They relax their body and try the skills they learned 1 by 1.)

495
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,056
Next leg.

496
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:40,056
Next leg.

497
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:43,666
(Their side swings look smoother than before.)

498
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,366
(Trying hard)

499
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:48,866
Three minutes.

500
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,976
- I can't believe this.
- Keep going.

501
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,405
Just be simple. Basic.

502
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:55,475
(For a long 9 minutes,)

503
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:57,546
(Iron Girls keep jumping without stopping.)

504
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:59,245
(Last 10 seconds)

505
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,185
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

506
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,786
(Burning with a final spurt)

507
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,755
- Booster. Jump.
- Keep going.

508
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:08,626
(The members jump until the end.)

509
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,955
(The 9-minute jump roping is over.)

510
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,096
Well done.

511
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,496
I feel like throwing up.

512
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,066
(Worn out)

513
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:18,336
Gosh, this is...

514
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,866
- Drink lots of water.
- Okay.

515
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:23,066
- Coach, what's the next training?
- Next.

516
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:26,006
The next is footwork drills using the ladder.

517
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:27,336
I just can't do this.

518
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:30,946
We do have good footwork.

519
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,016
We've practiced it a lot.

520
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,386
(During their individual training,)

521
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:39,156
(they've been training footwork using the ladder.)

522
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,285
Since you've practiced hard,

523
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:43,756
I want you to show her how good you are at this.

524
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,055
Please show us one of your best moves.

525
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:47,696
Then we will try the same.

526
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,066
The fastest?

527
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,166
(If it's something fast...)

528
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:54,806
That's In Ah's thing.

529
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,666
- That's In Ah's thing.
- In Ah is good at this.

530
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,876
- This is In Ah's specialty.
- In Ah is good at this.

531
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,346
(This footwork drill is...)

532
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:06,716
(In the previous season, it surprised everyone.)

533
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,116
Hang on.

534
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:13,716
(In Ah's first moment as the Sports Genius)

535
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,886
Hang on.

536
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,626
- Is that it?
- She did it.

537
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,726
(This is the side three-step)

538
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,626
Actually, I was hoping she would do this.

539
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,636
- I wanted her to show this.
- Show us, In Ah.

540
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,536
Then, I'll time this.

541
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:31,305
When you reach the end, finish it like this.

542
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,536
- Okay.
- Okay.

543
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:34,145
(Shannon goes first.)

544
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:35,146
Ready.

545
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,445
(What is the speed of the world champion like?)

546
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:38,476
Go.

547
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:40,316
Go.

548
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,856
(Their jaws drop open at the incredible speed.)

549
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:46,756
Ready, go.

550
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,266
All right. It's 4.97 seconds.

551
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:57,396
- Did you say 4 seconds?
- It's 4.97 seconds.

552
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:58,936
- My gosh.
- It's 4.97 seconds.

553
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,006
(Uie is the second.)

554
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,506
Ready.

555
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,306
Start.

556
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,046
She's fast.

557
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:10,945
- Yes.
- Uie.

558
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:12,016
Okay.

559
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:13,716
It's 6.10 seconds.

560
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,546
- What's with you, Uie? Yes!
- I've improved a lot, right?

561
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:19,186
I just want to beat Park Ju Hyun.

562
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:20,585
(It won't be easy.)

563
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,386
- I just want to beat Park Ju Hyun.
- Ready.

564
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,126
Start.

565
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,255
Good.

566
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:28,465
- Your footstep looks light.
- Don't trip.

567
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,496
Focus.

568
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,466
Okay.

569
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,365
(Shannon: 4.97 seconds, Uie: 6.10 seconds,)

570
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,406
(Ju Hyun: 6.54 seconds)

571
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,406
Ready. Start.

572
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:38,675
Good.

573
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:40,535
- Focus.
- Don't trip.

574
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,946
She's about to trip.

575
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:43,106
Okay.

576
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,375
It's 6.10 seconds. It's a tie.

577
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,586
- With whom?
- Me.

578
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,685
Is that because she is light-footed?

579
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:51,885
- Yes.
- Now we have our Simba Seol.

580
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:54,156
Seol In Ah is up next.

581
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:56,255
- She's the best.
- Best?

582
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,796
- Okay.
- Ready.

583
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,326
(She has everyone's expectations on her shoulders.)

584
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:02,425
(Will she be able to beat the champion?)

585
00:23:02,426 --> 00:23:04,566
Start.

586
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:09,266
(Her expression changes as soon as she starts.)

587
00:23:11,836 --> 00:23:14,176
(As expected, her speed is overwhelming.)

588
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,206
(What?)

589
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:18,946
Go. Keep going.

590
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,885
- My gosh.
- Okay.

591
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,916
Go. Keep going.

592
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:24,486
Okay. What?

593
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,486
(What is In Ah's record?)

594
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:31,496
It's 4.86 seconds.

595
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,055
My gosh. It's 4.86 seconds.

596
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:36,695
Faster than me? My goodness.

597
00:23:36,696 --> 00:23:37,765
(Truly surprised)

598
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,836
Look.

599
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:40,436
Start.

600
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,805
Go. Keep going.

601
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,376
Okay. What?

602
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,445
She was 0.11 seconds faster.

603
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,146
- My gosh.
- You're amazing.

604
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:54,076
(Simba Seol beat the champion with her footwork.)

605
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,616
She's really impressive.

606
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,286
(Thumbs-up)

607
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,516
She's really fast. How can she do that?

608
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,186
In Ah, you did it.

609
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,495
You've trained your footwork a lot.

610
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:06,625
Right.

611
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,496
You managed to show that to the coach.

612
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:09,796
- What's next?
- Next.

613
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,495
- Okay. Come this way.
- Okay.

614
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:12,795
- Okay.
- Okay.

615
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:13,896
The first one.

616
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:21,276
(Standing side by side with Shannon,)

617
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:26,345
(they learn various steps.)

618
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,586
- The first.
- I'm honored.

619
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:30,186
I'm doing this with her.

620
00:24:31,286 --> 00:24:34,456
(Learning the steps for a while)

621
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:36,556
I think I've improved a little.

622
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,525
Do this every session until your fight.

623
00:24:39,526 --> 00:24:42,326
Keep your feet fast and get ready for your fight.

624
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,696
- Okay.
- Yes.

625
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,236
What's next?

626
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,366
I'm going to take all of you on the pads. One round each.

627
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:50,836
(Will she be wearing the mitts?)

628
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,906
I wonder if the coach has ever taken anyone on the pads before.

629
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,146
No.

630
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:57,206
- First time?
- Yes.

631
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,216
- First time ever?
- Yes.

632
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:01,586
This is really...

633
00:25:02,116 --> 00:25:04,685
She's doing this for the first time in her life.

634
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:06,086
What do I do? I'm nervous.

635
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,286
I really want to do well.

636
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:12,196
How are you going to do the mitt work?

637
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,395
Each girl is going to get two minutes.

638
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,666
- Two minutes.
- For two minutes.

639
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:17,965
Okay.

640
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,565
What do I do? I'm nervous.

641
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,695
(Uie goes first.)

642
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,266
- Here? Alright. Jab.
- Yes.

643
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:23,935
(The 2-minute mitt work begins.)

644
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:24,976
Jab.

645
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,106
One, two.

646
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:28,806
One, two, hook.

647
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:31,076
(Focused)

648
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,246
Body.

649
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:33,916
Body.

650
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:35,285
Gosh, the body shot.

651
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:36,286
(She missed the body shot.)

652
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:39,416
All right. Let's get this. You only need to go down.

653
00:25:39,616 --> 00:25:41,856
(She should lean forward and shift weight onto the front foot.)

654
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:43,055
- Go down?
- So...

655
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:45,125
- Duck down and up.
- I see.

656
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,456
(Punching as she comes up)

657
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:50,896
There you go. Again. One more.

658
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,466
Body.

659
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,195
(Before and after)

660
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:55,536
You should bend your body completely.

661
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:59,276
(She improved her posture by bending her body as she learned.)

662
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:01,646
There you go. Again.

663
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:02,976
One more.

664
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,045
(Her body shot has become heavier.)

665
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:05,146
There you go. Jab.

666
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,985
- I see. After shifting her weight.
- Good.

667
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,015
(Studying hard)

668
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:11,386
(Like this!)

669
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:14,756
(She checks Uie's posture again with an eagle eye.)

670
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:16,256
(One, two)

671
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:18,225
That's your best punch.

672
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,296
One, two.

673
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:21,696
Now, just a big two.

674
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:23,266
- Big two.
- It's been a minute.

675
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:24,536
Again.

676
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:25,866
Again.

677
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:28,306
Good shot. One, two.

678
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,176
(The maximum distance straight punch)

679
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,536
- Okay. Harder.
- Good shot. One, two.

680
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:36,105
(Powerful straight)

681
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:37,506
- Her one-two is really good.
- She's amazing.

682
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,046
- Her one-two is great.
- She's good.

683
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:43,445
(Her specialty, the powerful straight punch,)

684
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:45,416
(has been upgraded.)

685
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:46,516
Jab.

686
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:47,656
- Ten seconds.
- One, two.

687
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:49,056
Two.

688
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:50,125
Two.

689
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,126
Two.

690
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:54,866
(The last 10 seconds to burn everything up)

691
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,565
Two.

692
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:01,605
(Uie's mitt work is over.)

693
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:02,966
Well done.

694
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:06,035
- Thank you.
- Well done.

695
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,105
(Hugging)

696
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:08,575
You told me...

697
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:10,646
to use a lot of one-twos during the match,

698
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:13,646
but I'm still not sure how to adjust the distance.

699
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,986
- Because you have long arms, - Yes.

700
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:18,055
if you blind them with a jab,

701
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,356
then you go like this.

702
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:22,125
So, jab and punch.

703
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:23,386
That's your best shot.

704
00:27:23,786 --> 00:27:24,795
(Jab and punch)

705
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:26,055
- There you go.
- Thank you.

706
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:27,095
You're welcome.

707
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,625
It's been three months...

708
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,065
since they started boxing.

709
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,335
What do you think of her?

710
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,266
You're ready to fight next week.

711
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,765
You're ready to fight next week.

712
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:39,476
(The champion approves that she's ready to fight.)

713
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:42,376
(Jealous)

714
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:44,445
I'll show you with my one-twos.

715
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,445
- Okay. Good.
- Thank you.

716
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:47,575
Uie. Seriously,

717
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:50,045
- your one-twos look so stable.
- Really? I'm glad to hear that.

718
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:52,156
You're the best. Your twos are so heavy.

719
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,316
By the way,

720
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,426
she's a champion indeed.

721
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,985
She took me on the pads so well.

722
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:58,055
(Satisfied)

723
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,625
Next. Please get ready.

724
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:01,625
(Next up is Ju Hyun.)

725
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:02,895
- Ready?
- Okay.

726
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:03,926
Go.

727
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:06,966
(The 2-minute mitt work begins.)

728
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:10,706
(She checks Ju Hyun's one-two's first.)

729
00:28:10,836 --> 00:28:12,006
One, two, hook.

730
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:13,476
One, two, hook.

731
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:15,805
Wait. You're coming in too close.

732
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,176
Keep a long distance.

733
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:18,545
Make it long.

734
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,245
You're getting too close now.

735
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:21,446
You're wasting a bit of distance.

736
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:25,116
(Ju Hyun throws a one-two, standing too close.)

737
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,256
Like that. I want you to turn.

738
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,826
- Oh, turn? Okay.
- Yes.

739
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:31,495
(I see.)

740
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:33,356
Make the jab longer like a straight punch.

741
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,726
After this, you need to turn.

742
00:28:36,066 --> 00:28:40,166
(She should duck to dodge punches...)

743
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:42,105
Make the jab longer like a straight punch.

744
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:46,106
(and turn her shoulder to make a long jab.)

745
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,706
- Oh, turn? Okay.
- Yes.

746
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:50,523
Turn.

747
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:51,793
Better.

748
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,023
Again.

749
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:54,393
One more.

750
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:56,163
One more.

751
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:57,632
That's it.

752
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:58,903
(She's learned a long jab that's as strong as a straight.)

753
00:28:59,063 --> 00:29:00,363
That's really good.

754
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,202
It's been a minute.

755
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:03,373
(She has 1 minute left.)

756
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,772
I'm sad that time flies.

757
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,772
(Every minute and every second counts during the special session.)

758
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,043
How time flies.

759
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,142
Uppercut.

760
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,213
Hook.

761
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,543
You're going to go one...

762
00:29:12,913 --> 00:29:14,183
- That's it.
- Again.

763
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:16,913
- Again.
- Consecutively.

764
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,552
Your best shot is the left hook.

765
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,182
- Left hook?
- That's your best shot.

766
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:22,192
- Okay? Again.
- Okay.

767
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,193
Hook.

768
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:24,622
Just try a hook.

769
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:27,463
(She starts upgrading her left hook.)

770
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:28,962
(Turn your back.)

771
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:30,293
Turn your back.

772
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,563
Again.

773
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,933
(Turning her back)

774
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:37,002
(She performs a hook as she's taught right away.)

775
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:38,032
(Before and after)

776
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,502
Each one gets different advice.

777
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,843
(She rotates her body in a totally different way.)

778
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:44,813
(The power has changed with her new posture.)

779
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,412
(A stronger left hook)

780
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,482
Jab.

781
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,683
- Her hook is really strong.
- It's really good.

782
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:50,952
Uppercut. Body.

783
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:53,053
(10 seconds left)

784
00:29:53,323 --> 00:29:55,453
(Time to burn everything up with straight punches)

785
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:57,253
- Two.
- Harder.

786
00:29:57,453 --> 00:29:58,462
Two.

787
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,493
(Squeezing out all the strength she has left)

788
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:02,292
Okay.

789
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:05,163
(Ju Hyun's mitt work is over.)

790
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,902
Well done.

791
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,703
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

792
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,203
Your best shot is your left hook.

793
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,142
- Left hook.
- You're small,

794
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,543
but you are very strong.

795
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,673
So you're ready to fight next week.

796
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:18,783
So you're ready to fight next week.

797
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,612
- I'm ready too.
- Good.

798
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,752
The two minutes are really short.

799
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,923
I know. It feels really short.

800
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,583
- All right.
- Ready.

801
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:28,652
Let's go.

802
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:31,353
(Next up is Sae Rok.)

803
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,223
Jab.

804
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:34,463
- Good.
- Jab. One, two.

805
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,192
One, two.

806
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:38,433
One, two, hook.

807
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:43,633
(Sae Rocky reacts quickly.)

808
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:44,903
One, two, hook.

809
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,442
You're very fast.

810
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:47,773
Quick. It's good.

811
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:50,973
(She praises Sae Rok for her speed?)

812
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,883
(Sae Rok used to throw big punches,)

813
00:30:55,453 --> 00:31:00,283
(so she was too slow.)

814
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:02,452
(Sae Rocky is not slow anymore.)

815
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:03,553
- Sae Rok.
- One, two.

816
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,722
Her posture has changed.

817
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:07,863
(The oldest member acknowledges it.)

818
00:31:08,193 --> 00:31:10,833
(She has only 10 seconds left.)

819
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,862
Two.

820
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:16,473
That's the ten seconds you'll never get back in your life.

821
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:20,003
Two.

822
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:22,872
- Gosh. Keum Sae Rok!
- Two.

823
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:25,513
(Stamina to maintain the crazy speed)

824
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:26,943
(Groaning)

825
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:31,013
- Two.
- Keum Sae Rok!

826
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,123
(Groaning)

827
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:36,553
(Sae Rok burned herself for 2 minutes without regret.)

828
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:40,322
(Sae Rok's mitt work is over.)

829
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:41,323
Well done.

830
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:43,033
We got to hear her groaning for a while in the middle.

831
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:45,203
(They were glad to hear the voice.)

832
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,332
You are the fastest out of all of them.

833
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,202
Use your speed and fast one-twos.

834
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,603
- Your one-twos are very fast.
- Okay.

835
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,312
Stick to that. But you lose your shape a little bit.

836
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,042
So just stay tight.

837
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,612
(Sae Rok's specialty is a quick one-two while maintaining distance.)

838
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,813
- Okay?
- Yes.

839
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,283
You're ready to fight.

840
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,382
Seriously, this is amazing.

841
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,782
When else will I learn something like this?

842
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:07,353
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Well done.

843
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,422
The precious two minutes have passed.

844
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:12,462
And now, the last fighter.

845
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,523
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

846
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:14,563
Ready.

847
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:16,433
(The last fighter is In Ah.)

848
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:18,533
Her eye is going to change.

849
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,933
Jab.

850
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:24,073
- One, two.
- Everyone is good.

851
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:26,502
One, two, hook.

852
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:27,642
Everyone is good.

853
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,312
(The ace's posture is exceptional.)

854
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,172
Two.

855
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:32,283
You're going to go...

856
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:35,352
(Coach Shannon moves on to the weaving.)

857
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,613
- Okay?
- Two? Okay.

858
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:38,882
It's been one minute.

859
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:39,883
And you go...

860
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:40,982
One, two.

861
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:44,352
(After weaving, even the straight is stable.)

862
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:46,123
Two.

863
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:48,563
Good.

864
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:50,493
How could she become like that after only three months?

865
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,403
- I feel so proud when I watch her.
- Two.

866
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:53,703
You know what I mean?

867
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,003
Body.

868
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,343
- Okay.
- Body.

869
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:00,073
Yes. Again.

870
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:01,342
- Body.
- Okay.

871
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:02,442
(Turning her back)

872
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:04,272
- That's it. Right.
- Yes. Again.

873
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:08,012
(Before and after)

874
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:11,783
(The weight has been shifted.)

875
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,623
Very good.

876
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,922
(Her body shot has been strengthened.)

877
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:16,923
And this body.

878
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:19,093
(Her body shot has been strengthened.)

879
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:21,632
(Memorizing the skills)

880
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,663
- That's strong.
- Body.

881
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:23,893
Body.

882
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,602
That's your best shot.

883
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,933
It's the body shot. Good.

884
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:32,242
(Learning the applied technique, jab-to-body shot.)

885
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,243
Jab.

886
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,573
The precious last 30 seconds.

887
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,742
(Punch through, and a body shot)

888
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:37,743
And again.

889
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:41,713
(Mastering the ultimate body shot)

890
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,913
(Time left)

891
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:45,522
- Two.
- Ten seconds!

892
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,083
(The precious 10 seconds!)

893
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:50,923
(Time to burn everything up with straight punches)

894
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,193
Keep going.

895
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,793
(The speed is getting faster and faster.)

896
00:33:57,563 --> 00:34:00,433
(Simba Seol is carried away.)

897
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:04,973
(Being pushed back)

898
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,143
(Satisfied)

899
00:34:07,573 --> 00:34:09,473
(That's our ace.)

900
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:16,353
(She gave it her all in the last 10 seconds.)

901
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:17,912
(The mitt work is over.)

902
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:19,183
- Well done.
- Thank you.

903
00:34:19,653 --> 00:34:20,723
Well done.

904
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:22,953
I'm honored.

905
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:24,292
Your best shot...

906
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,023
is your body shot.

907
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:29,332
Out of all the girls, you are the neatest.

908
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,063
It's very tidy and tight.

909
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,003
You're ready to fight next week.

910
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,173
Okay. Thank you.

911
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:36,902
All right.

912
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,032
We finished the mitt work.

913
00:34:38,033 --> 00:34:40,442
Coach, I wonder if there is a next session.

914
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:41,673
The next session.

915
00:34:41,943 --> 00:34:43,543
You're going to spar me.

916
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:45,183
But technical.

917
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:47,283
(Unbelievable)

918
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,313
Okay.

919
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:50,912
The first sparring with her first students.

920
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:52,353
I'm so honored.

921
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:53,653
All right.

922
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:55,752
While doing the mitt work with the coach,

923
00:34:55,753 --> 00:34:58,092
she told you the things you need to work on.

924
00:34:58,093 --> 00:35:00,123
I want you to remember and practice them.

925
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:01,933
I'm really honored.

926
00:35:02,163 --> 00:35:03,463
We're honored.

927
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,903
(The champion enters.)

928
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:08,702
She looks like she belongs here.

929
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:09,703
(Swift)

930
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:13,202
The way she steps into the ring is so cool.

931
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,803
I want to do the same thing.

932
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:17,512
(Coach Shannon is getting ready to spar.)

933
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,743
It has an eye on it.

934
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:19,943
Eye.

935
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:22,283
(Eye?)

936
00:35:22,483 --> 00:35:24,213
Her mouthpiece has an eye on it.

937
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,623
So, there are three eyes looking at you.

938
00:35:27,653 --> 00:35:28,893
It's scary.

939
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:31,353
I'm honored.

940
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:32,423
Sure.

941
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:33,693
- Thank you.
- Good.

942
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,693
All right.

943
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:37,192
Let's begin. Box.

944
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:40,263
(The supervised sparring begins.)

945
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,903
(The skill In Ah needs to practice is her body shot.)

946
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:47,002
(Trying a body shot)

947
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:48,713
In Ah's posture has improved a lot.

948
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,113
(Coach Shannon doesn't lay herself open to attack against In Ah.)

949
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:57,053
(She can't keep up with her movements.)

950
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:04,753
(Coach Shannon disappears before her eyes in an instant.)

951
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:07,193
- She's quick.
- She's really fast.

952
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:09,033
She disappeared.

953
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,263
(Another body shot)

954
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,533
(She finally lands a body shot.)

955
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:18,773
That was good.

956
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,013
(Body shot)

957
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:24,143
(Body shot 2)

958
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:26,313
(Simba Seol successfully executed the advanced body shot.)

959
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:30,253
(The next supervised sparring is with Sae Rok.)

960
00:36:33,553 --> 00:36:35,022
(Close pursuit)

961
00:36:35,023 --> 00:36:36,823
Nice. The coach is thrown off.

962
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:37,953
That's it.

963
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:40,693
Nice.

964
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:41,963
(Sae Rok shows off a quick execution of the one-two.)

965
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:44,033
Her one-twos are great.

966
00:36:44,593 --> 00:36:47,403
(Aggressively launching a fast one-two)

967
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:48,902
That's it.

968
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,533
(But Coach Shannon throws a right hook at her opening.)

969
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,903
(Left hook)

970
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:58,842
(Even though she's taking hit after hit,)

971
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:00,813
(Sae Rok keeps throwing punches.)

972
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:05,053
- Nice. Keep going.
- Aim at her waist.

973
00:37:05,383 --> 00:37:07,182
- Okay.
- Well done.

974
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,753
(Sae Rok unleashed a rapid flurry of punches until the end.)

975
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,452
(Next up is Ju Hyun)

976
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:12,723
Now.

977
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:15,233
Always straighten your shoulders. Throw your hooks.

978
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,433
- Nice offense.
- Yes, Ju Hyun.

979
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:24,102
(She puts her newly learned long jab into action.)

980
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,703
- Nice offense.
- Yes, Ju Hyun.

981
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:29,543
Long jabs. Yes.

982
00:37:31,273 --> 00:37:32,982
There’s an opening. Her jabs are great.

983
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,413
(She attempts a left hook.)

984
00:37:34,843 --> 00:37:36,383
(Dodge)

985
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:39,183
(She attempts another left hook.)

986
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,723
(And then, she quickly evades Shannon's punch.)

987
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:46,522
The champion is starting to have fun.

988
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:47,623
Go!

989
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:49,832
- Go!
- Go!

990
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,263
(Coach Shannon put herself in a corner so Ju Hyun could practice.)

991
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,063
(Left hook)

992
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,333
Nice.

993
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:01,542
(Ju Hyun did her best to throw a left hook.)

994
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:02,573
Well done.

995
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:03,973
Give it your all.

996
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:05,913
(The last one is Uie.)

997
00:38:07,683 --> 00:38:08,683
Body.

998
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:10,052
- That's nice.
- Body.

999
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:13,623
(An attempt for a powerful one-two)

1000
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:16,893
(Uie is looking for another opening.)

1001
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,163
(Uie throws a straight.)

1002
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:25,703
(She struck the world champion in the face.)

1003
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,833
That's it.

1004
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,703
Gosh, that's it.

1005
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,102
Go.

1006
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,443
(The last intense stretch)

1007
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,613
Nice. Keep going.

1008
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:39,382
Keep going.

1009
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,342
Your opponent is taking damage. Don't stop.

1010
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:43,452
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1011
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:44,653
(With Uie's turn, the training is complete.)

1012
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:46,653
Okay.

1013
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:49,152
That was nice.

1014
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:51,192
- I'm so grateful.
- Good.

1015
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:52,592
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1016
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:57,032
We spent a fun day today training with Coach Shannon,

1017
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,392
the number one world champion.

1018
00:38:58,393 --> 00:38:59,702
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1019
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,503
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1020
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:04,572
The one who listens to what I'm telling them...

1021
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:07,302
and does what I taught them on the pads earlier.

1022
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,402
You get the prize.

1023
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,313
(You get the prize.)

1024
00:39:10,643 --> 00:39:11,842
- It's an honor.
- You did great.

1025
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:16,213
She said she would pick one person as today's MVP.

1026
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:17,512
Who is it?

1027
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,722
Okay. You've all been fantastic, but my MVP...

1028
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:23,693
(Who will the champion choose as today's MVP?)

1029
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,393
is In Ah.

1030
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:27,822
I knew it.

1031
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,633
(Today's MVP is Simba Seol.)

1032
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:31,262
I knew it.

1033
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:32,802
I knew it.

1034
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,862
- I knew it.
- In Ah.

1035
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,102
She chose In Ah.

1036
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,203
(Congratulations)

1037
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:38,532
- How do you feel?
- My hand has been raised.

1038
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:40,143
My hand has been raised.

1039
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,912
Because she listened the most.

1040
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,683
She was very quicker than me on the ladders.

1041
00:39:46,043 --> 00:39:48,782
And in sparring, she did what I taught her to do.

1042
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:51,382
And very fast, as well.

1043
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:52,552
- Very good.
- Thank you.

1044
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:54,682
Fighters can tell who's a real fighter.

1045
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,822
They can really tell.

1046
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:56,823
(Fighters recognize fighters.)

1047
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:58,762
- What is it?
- Is that a gift?

1048
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,423
(It's time for the gifts.)

1049
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:01,963
(Excited)

1050
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,562
I'm so jealous.

1051
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:05,233
You go stand here.

1052
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,332
- I'm not going to look.
- You go stand here.

1053
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,663
Stand over here.

1054
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,073
(Screaming)

1055
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,103
Oh, my gosh.

1056
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:16,272
These are autographed gloves.

1057
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:18,172
(A pair of gloves with the champion's autograph)

1058
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:19,412
- I'm jealous.
- She'll be an amateur fighter.

1059
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,113
I'm really jealous.

1060
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:22,813
I'll never stop boxing.

1061
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:24,883
Thank you.

1062
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,823
Well done.

1063
00:40:28,023 --> 00:40:30,953
You three are going to get my t-shirts signed as well.

1064
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:35,293
(The three Iron Girls will get autographed t-shirts too.)

1065
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:39,103
Thank you.

1066
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:42,503
- This is so pretty.
- Thank you.

1067
00:40:43,203 --> 00:40:45,003
- Thank you.
- Does she only have three?

1068
00:40:47,473 --> 00:40:48,703
Does she only have three?

1069
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:54,183
I'm your student. Please.

1070
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:56,152
This is so pretty.

1071
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,783
Thank you.

1072
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:01,322
- The energy of the world champion.
- Right.

1073
00:41:01,323 --> 00:41:04,153
- May it dwell within us.
- I can feel it inspiring us.

1074
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,363
Thank you so much.

1075
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:08,662
It's not much,

1076
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:10,193
but we've prepared a gift for you too.

1077
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:11,792
- What is it?
- The Iron Girls prepared...

1078
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:12,902
Korean snacks.

1079
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,162
- Korean traditional snacks.
- Korean snacks.

1080
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:16,202
Korean seaweed crisps.

1081
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:18,203
We brought Korean seaweed crisps as a gift for you.

1082
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,772
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1083
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:22,913
I love seaweed. Thank you very much.

1084
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,413
You can eat them by themselves.

1085
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:26,813
You can eat them by themselves or you can eat them with your meal.

1086
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:29,013
Seaweed.

1087
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,283
These are snacks made with seaweed.

1088
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,153
Do you like it?

1089
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,393
We said these were for her.

1090
00:41:38,723 --> 00:41:40,923
- These are so crispy.
- They're crispy and tasty.

1091
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:42,793
These go well with beer.

1092
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,792
The seaweed itself is good quality,

1093
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,232
- so the crisps have a rich flavor.
- Yes.

1094
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:49,503
I want to hear from the Iron Girls.

1095
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:52,202
The competition is right around the corner.

1096
00:41:52,203 --> 00:41:54,103
No matter who our opponent is,

1097
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,842
I feel like I would think, "Come on."

1098
00:41:56,843 --> 00:42:00,212
"I did supervised sparring with the world champion."

1099
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,882
So I'm grateful for this precious experience.

1100
00:42:02,883 --> 00:42:04,683
- Thank you so much.
- That's nice.

1101
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:08,122
I felt my blood boil today.

1102
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:09,693
"I want to be like her."

1103
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,823
That thought was in my head the whole time,

1104
00:42:11,953 --> 00:42:13,692
so I think this would motivate me to work even harder.

1105
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:15,893
Thank you for inspiring me.

1106
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,032
All I'm going to say to you is,

1107
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:21,133
you've done all the hard work already. Enjoy yourself.

1108
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:23,373
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

1109
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:25,032
(A special training session with the world champion)

1110
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,143
Thank you.

1111
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:29,713
What do you think we're having for dinner?

1112
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,012
Pu pad pong karee.

1113
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:32,142
- What? Today...
- Is it pu pad pong karee?

1114
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:34,812
We prepared everything you wanted to eat.

1115
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,212
- Even stir-fried morning glory?
- For real?

1116
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:38,053
- Can we trust you?
- For real.

1117
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:39,852
This is actually a popular restaurant.

1118
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:41,222
(Did Captain Kim really bring them to a famous local spot?)

1119
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:42,523
Look at this view.

1120
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:45,353
- Gosh.
- Gosh, this is nice.

1121
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:48,262
- Gosh.
- The view is beautiful.

1122
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:50,062
- What?
- What?

1123
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:51,192
- Goodness.
- What is this?

1124
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,033
- This is amazing.
- Is this a honeymoon hot spot?

1125
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,803
It finally feels like we're in Phuket.

1126
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:57,173
- Gosh.
- This is beautiful.

1127
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,302
I love this ambience.

1128
00:42:58,303 --> 00:42:59,942
How is this place so beautiful?

1129
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,542
- The vibe is amazing.
- It really is.

1130
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:04,713
(Located on Rawai Beach in southern Phuket)

1131
00:43:06,843 --> 00:43:08,952
(Rawai Beach is known for its beautiful sunsets.)

1132
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,612
How is this place so beautiful?

1133
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:12,322
- The vibe is amazing.
- It really is.

1134
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,182
- It's breathtaking.
- It's incredible.

1135
00:43:14,183 --> 00:43:17,222
I ordered all the food I know you'll like...

1136
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:20,092
and the foods that are locally famous in Thailand.

1137
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:21,122
(He ordered famous local food.)

1138
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,962
- Is this real?
- It is.

1139
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:24,792
- I feel like he's lying.
- Why do you keep saying I'm lying?

1140
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:27,132
Are we back in protein land?

1141
00:43:27,133 --> 00:43:29,332
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

1142
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,472
- Are they making protein shakes?
- Seriously, is this...

1143
00:43:31,473 --> 00:43:33,172
They must be using the blender right now.

1144
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:34,872
This is so disappointing.

1145
00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:36,612
Just give us our protein already.

1146
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,072
- Over there.
- The food's here.

1147
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,412
- I see something.
- What is it?

1148
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:41,542
- The food's here.
- It's here.

1149
00:43:41,543 --> 00:43:42,953
(They're half worried, half excited. What is the dish?)

1150
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:45,453
Curry powder.

1151
00:43:46,453 --> 00:43:48,223
- What is it?
- Is this pu pad pong karee?

1152
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:50,852
Chicken. This is really good.

1153
00:43:50,853 --> 00:43:51,893
- Good food.
- Yes.

1154
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:54,563
- Gosh.
- Shrimp!

1155
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:57,332
(Thai glass noodle salad, yam wun sen)

1156
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,532
Gosh. Thank you.

1157
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,962
You were right. Lobsters!

1158
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:02,032
- Over here, please.
- It's a real lobster.

1159
00:44:02,033 --> 00:44:03,303
It's a real lobster.

1160
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:05,402
- It's a real lobster.
- Gosh.

1161
00:44:05,403 --> 00:44:07,942
(It's a real grilled lobster with cheese on top.)

1162
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:08,973
Okay.

1163
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,443
Pad Thai!

1164
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:14,342
- Pad Thai!
- Pad Thai!

1165
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:15,852
This is the best.

1166
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,213
(The most famous stir-fried noodle dish in Thailand, pad Thai)

1167
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:19,253
Why are you being so nice to us?

1168
00:44:19,453 --> 00:44:20,653
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1169
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:22,292
(Another dish is being brought out mysteriously.)

1170
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,722
- Tom yum kung.
- Tom yum kung?

1171
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:26,192
- Gosh, it's tom yum kung.
- I love tom yum kung.

1172
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:27,463
- I've never seen it like this.
- Me too.

1173
00:44:28,023 --> 00:44:29,592
I guess they're doing something with this.

1174
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:31,233
Let's watch the performance.

1175
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:33,033
I guess they're putting on a show.

1176
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:35,162
Why is she turning it on? What is she trying to do?

1177
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:36,173
(She turns on the torch.)

1178
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:37,758
I guess they're putting on a show.

1179
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,058
Why is she turning it on? What is she trying to do?

1180
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,157
Will the glass not blow up?

1181
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:43,227
(She heats up the glass with the tom yum kung inside.)

1182
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:44,698
- It's moving up.
- Gosh. It's moving up.

1183
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:47,267
It's moving up.

1184
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,597
(The broth on the bottom is moved up.)

1185
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,097
- It keeps moving up.
- It keeps moving up.

1186
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:51,098
This is amazing.

1187
00:44:51,238 --> 00:44:52,367
I'm worried it's going to blow up.

1188
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:53,737
(The broth is infused with the aroma of the spices.)

1189
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:54,868
- Infusing the broth.
- Gosh.

1190
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:56,078
It's hot. Be careful.

1191
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,077
(Move the infused broth down the glass pipe again.)

1192
00:44:58,078 --> 00:44:59,347
- She's moving it down again.
- She's moving it down again.

1193
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:00,608
What? And then...

1194
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:02,847
And then...

1195
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,317
(The dish is complete when the broth is poured into...)

1196
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:05,377
(a plate with the ingredients.)

1197
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:06,947
I’ve never had tom yum kung served this way before.

1198
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:08,918
- Me neither.
- Look at the quality.

1199
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,417
(A unique local tom yum kung)

1200
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,128
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your dinner.

1201
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:14,887
(Enjoy your meal.)

1202
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:16,758
- Thank you for the food.
- She said we could eat.

1203
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:17,898
(Gosh!)

1204
00:45:18,128 --> 00:45:19,327
I'm really losing it.

1205
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:20,968
We really need to take pictures.

1206
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,767
- I'm so happy.
- Finally, it feels like Thailand.

1207
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,737
- Gosh. This looks good.
- We're finally having Thai food.

1208
00:45:26,738 --> 00:45:28,308
I'm having Thai food.

1209
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:29,477
This looks so good.

1210
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:30,677
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

1211
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:32,038
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy.

1212
00:45:32,178 --> 00:45:33,377
This nice view...

1213
00:45:33,378 --> 00:45:34,577
and this good food.

1214
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:35,607
(She takes a huge bite.)

1215
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,678
It's so good.

1216
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:40,948
(Shocked)

1217
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:44,188
- It's so good.
- Enjoy.

1218
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:49,928
Let's have one more of this.

1219
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:55,598
This is so good.

1220
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:57,298
It's good.

1221
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,038
Let me hold that for you.

1222
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:05,848
- I thought no one would do this.
- Like this.

1223
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:08,647
Eat. Take the one you cut up.

1224
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:10,348
- Eat it. Put it in your mouth.
- Eat that one.

1225
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:11,948
It's so good.

1226
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:13,787
(She puts it in her mouth.)

1227
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:14,788
(Gosh)

1228
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:16,988
This is so good.

1229
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:24,158
(Today's feast is absolutely satisfying.)

1230
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:25,928
Let me try the tom yum kung.

1231
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:31,338
(How will the tom yum kung with the fancy performance taste?)

1232
00:46:32,438 --> 00:46:33,438
(Gosh)

1233
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,508
How is it?

1234
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:36,138
- Is it legit?
- Yes.

1235
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:37,808
The tom yum kung.

1236
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:41,947
(Flavors that make you forget all the fatigue.)

1237
00:46:41,948 --> 00:46:43,977
- This must be a really good place.
- Indeed.

1238
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:46,018
Doesn't it explain it all if their tom yum kung is good?

1239
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:47,548
Even their cola is pretty.

1240
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:52,558
My impression of Thailand is getting better.

1241
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,457
It had been tough only for us.

1242
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,028
Why are we so basic?

1243
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:57,558
- As long as we're fed...
- As long as we're fed...

1244
00:46:57,628 --> 00:46:59,057
As long as the food is good...

1245
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:00,998
Food makes everything right.

1246
00:47:02,228 --> 00:47:03,237
(Uie, who needs to bulk up...)

1247
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,398
This is so good.

1248
00:47:05,038 --> 00:47:06,137
It's so good.

1249
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:07,207
Help yourself.

1250
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,637
(Her chopsticks...)

1251
00:47:08,638 --> 00:47:10,708
Who wants some fried rice?

1252
00:47:11,378 --> 00:47:13,877
I think this is a really good Thai restaurant.

1253
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:18,078
(Unstoppable)

1254
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,288
Uie looks very happy, which is so cute.

1255
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:22,588
I really love Thai food.

1256
00:47:23,688 --> 00:47:30,498
(The Iron Girls trained hard, so they fuel up properly.)

1257
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:32,728
But seriously,

1258
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:34,767
I often go on training camps...

1259
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,798
with this many members of other athletes,

1260
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:38,168
and you guys eat more than they do.

1261
00:47:38,598 --> 00:47:39,637
- Don't lie.
- I'm serious.

1262
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:40,767
- Don't lie.
- Don't lie.

1263
00:47:40,768 --> 00:47:42,237
More than five men?

1264
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:43,307
- Captain.
- Yes?

1265
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,537
If word gets out, it's you.

1266
00:47:44,538 --> 00:47:45,978
Alright. I get it.

1267
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:47,648
But...

1268
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,048
You really are like athletes.

1269
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:50,548
You don't say a word.

1270
00:47:50,748 --> 00:47:51,848
We ate too quickly again.

1271
00:47:52,348 --> 00:47:53,348
I know.

1272
00:47:53,648 --> 00:47:55,348
- I'm so full.
- We're in trouble.

1273
00:47:55,448 --> 00:47:56,718
But seriously,

1274
00:47:57,088 --> 00:47:58,287
did you ever think you'd meet...

1275
00:47:58,288 --> 00:48:00,187
the world boxing champion in Phuket?

1276
00:48:00,188 --> 00:48:01,758
- No way.
- Never.

1277
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:04,227
And it's our first time seeing the belt...

1278
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,327
- for us.
- Yes.

1279
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:07,227
- It was so heavy.
- Yes.

1280
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:08,267
It’s a symbol of success.

1281
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:11,167
The top rank in the world.

1282
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,508
It’s the honor of the family.

1283
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:14,907
You now have nine days until the competition.

1284
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,177
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

1285
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:17,237
Now,

1286
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:19,307
with more sparring experience, are you used to it?

1287
00:48:19,308 --> 00:48:20,407
How do you feel about it?

1288
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:22,347
- It's...
- I'm not as anxious as before,

1289
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:26,047
but I still have enough excitement and tension.

1290
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,887
What I practiced during training...

1291
00:48:28,888 --> 00:48:31,158
didn't come out perfectly in execution,

1292
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:32,627
and I couldn't perform it...

1293
00:48:32,628 --> 00:48:34,558
- during the actual match.
- When your body doesn't follow?

1294
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:36,327
I can't sleep at night...

1295
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:37,627
after having an actual sparring session.

1296
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:39,497
- Because of stress?
- That too,

1297
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:41,127
and I spend about three hours monitoring the recording,

1298
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:42,427
when it's only a three-minute clip.

1299
00:48:42,428 --> 00:48:43,637
(She spent 3 hours monitoring the 3-minute match!)

1300
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:45,467
- Is that so?
- That's so...

1301
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,367
What you just said is the same stress I had...

1302
00:48:47,368 --> 00:48:49,038
back when I was an athlete.

1303
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:52,077
You grow because you have that stress.

1304
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:54,348
But I wish you wouldn't get so stressed.

1305
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:55,877
You don't even know how much experience...

1306
00:48:55,878 --> 00:48:56,977
your opponent will have,

1307
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,717
but the fact that you can go up there and fight...

1308
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,387
- You're right.
- makes you a winner already.

1309
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,618
You overcame such amazing things.

1310
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:07,157
No matter who comes, let's have a great match.

1311
00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:08,387
I think I will also feel like...

1312
00:49:08,388 --> 00:49:09,597
- I had done my best.
- Right.

1313
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:11,857
That's what Boxer Ae Ji said last time.

1314
00:49:11,858 --> 00:49:13,667
"If I outdid myself from yesterday, that’s enough."

1315
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:14,898
- Yes, that's right.
- Yes.

1316
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:15,937
Give it your all.

1317
00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:16,938
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1318
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:18,367
- I’m confident about that.
- So that you have no regrets.

1319
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:19,368
That's how we will prepare.

1320
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:20,368
Let's do this.

1321
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:21,807
- Good job.
- Good job.

1322
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:24,007
Thank you. Today was yet another long day.

1323
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:25,378
(The Phuket Boot Camp is over.)

1324
00:49:25,948 --> 00:49:28,848
(How did they spend the 2 weeks before their first competition?)

1325
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:31,377
Okay. Let's go. Start.

1326
00:49:31,378 --> 00:49:33,788
(In Ah, Sae Rok)

1327
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:36,917
(Arm-working training for upper body muscle strengthening)

1328
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:38,418
- You're doing great.
- You're doing great.

1329
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:39,727
(In Ah)

1330
00:49:39,728 --> 00:49:43,527
(For Iron Muscle In Ah,)

1331
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:47,168
(she even does push-ups.)

1332
00:49:47,928 --> 00:49:49,897
Gosh. She's amazing. Good job.

1333
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:50,937
(Sae Rok)

1334
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:55,938
(As the competition nears, the training gets more intense.)

1335
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:57,107
(Uie)

1336
00:49:57,108 --> 00:49:58,937
(The Iron Girls are steadily pushing through.)

1337
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:00,778
Okay. Good job.

1338
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:04,478
(They check their muscles after the workout.)

1339
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:11,017
(The sparring training is done at high intensity.)

1340
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:13,028
You need to bounce up and down.

1341
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:16,897
(His radar is on.)

1342
00:50:16,898 --> 00:50:18,197
- Above.
- Both of you...

1343
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,428
have no impact in your punches.

1344
00:50:19,868 --> 00:50:21,268
What I can do...

1345
00:50:21,828 --> 00:50:23,798
- is this.
- That's it. That's how you do it.

1346
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:25,968
- She might get hurt.
- It's okay.

1347
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:28,338
It won't hurt even if she gets hit like that.

1348
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:30,238
- You need to be precise.
- Let's do it.

1349
00:50:30,478 --> 00:50:31,738
The match is in two days.

1350
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:34,408
Your opponent will come at you to finish you.

1351
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:35,777
You need to be like that.

1352
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:37,748
(As the competition nears, the sparring is done realistically.)

1353
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:39,347
(Ju Hyun, Uie)

1354
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:42,148
(They actively train while supporting each other.)

1355
00:50:42,388 --> 00:50:43,458
That's it.

1356
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:44,658
I can't reach you.

1357
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,728
You did reach me.

1358
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:49,227
(Ju Hyun's training log: I tried to overcome Uie's reach,)

1359
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:51,057
(but I only ended up straining my neck.)

1360
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:53,497
(You can't overcome the reach.)

1361
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:56,198
(You just keep going in while taking the blows!)

1362
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,767
(I had an intense workout session for 3 hours,)

1363
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:00,037
(before heading to the show.)

1364
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:02,067
(My arms, hands, and even my eyes are trembling.)

1365
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:05,638
(I almost even drooled.)

1366
00:51:05,778 --> 00:51:06,847
(Uie)

1367
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:11,548
(The Iron Girls are using their time to grow even further.)

1368
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:15,318
(This person even came to the gym twice a day.)

1369
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:19,457
(It's In Ah.)

1370
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:23,998
I am wearing my sweat suit and preparing to jump rope.

1371
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:26,268
(Groaning)

1372
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:32,638
(The reason she is working so hard...)

1373
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:36,708
(The crucial hurdle for the first competition)

1374
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,808
(Preparing for the weigh-in.)

1375
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:43,477
(In order to get on the ring,)

1376
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:46,288
(they need to meet the weight class.)

1377
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:48,247
(In order to optimize their body condition,)

1378
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:49,788
(considering their height, muscle mass, and more,)

1379
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:52,728
(weight management is crucial.)

1380
00:51:52,888 --> 00:51:56,698
(So the Iron Girls set their target weight class.)

1381
00:51:57,028 --> 00:52:01,568
(Uie, 30s Division, Under 54kg)

1382
00:52:02,268 --> 00:52:06,608
(Uie's goal is to gain 1.6kg while increasing muscle mass.)

1383
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,808
(Sae Rok, 30s Division, Under 54kg)

1384
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:13,178
(Sae Rok's goal is to gain 0.8kg while reducing body fat.)

1385
00:52:13,578 --> 00:52:18,178
(Ju Hyun, 30s Division, Under 51kg)

1386
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:24,858
(Ju Hyun's goal is to lose 2.9kg while consuming carbohydrates.)

1387
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:27,788
(In Ah, 20s Division, Under 54kg)

1388
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:33,568
(In Ah's goal is to lose 2.7kg while doing cardio exercises.)

1389
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:37,067
(In Ah has 26kg of skeletal muscle mass...)

1390
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:40,768
(and only 10kg of body fat.)

1391
00:52:41,368 --> 00:52:44,778
(But she still started the 2.6kg weight reduction.)

1392
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,708
(She came twice a day.)

1393
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,877
(Boxing training)

1394
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:50,348
(Sparring training)

1395
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:52,617
(And she even did cardio with a sweat suit on.)

1396
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:54,448
(Sweat suit)

1397
00:52:56,388 --> 00:53:00,788
(Massive training load)

1398
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:02,627
(In Ah's training log: During my 1-hour run,)

1399
00:53:02,628 --> 00:53:04,227
(I felt like 8 versions of myself appeared inside,)

1400
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,027
(saying "give up, don't give up, good job", and others,)

1401
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:08,767
(and then it was over.)

1402
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,598
(Of course, it felt like 3 hours.)

1403
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:11,937
That's it.

1404
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,437
(It felt good to train outside after a long time.)

1405
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:16,037
(When will I ever work this hard at something again?)

1406
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:18,307
(Have I ever been this obsessed before?)

1407
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:21,177
(Lying down afterwards and looking up at the sky,)

1408
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:23,748
(I felt an indescribable feeling.)

1409
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:27,748
I may whine about how hard it is, but deep down, it's actually fun.

1410
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:32,658
I don’t think I’ve ever been this crazy for something.

1411
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,597
I don't come here because I have to.

1412
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:37,997
I come because I enjoy it.

1413
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:39,398
(I don't come because I have to, but because I enjoy it.)

1414
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:41,767
(All of this will be a valuable experience...)

1415
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,797
(that will become my blood and flesh.)

1416
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:46,568
(I will do my best so that I have no regrets even if I die tomorrow.)

1417
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:50,608
(And another weight-loss member, Ju Hyun)

1418
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,737
(Since she had no time, she did cardio...)

1419
00:53:52,738 --> 00:53:54,608
(with the sweat suit on, after her theater show.)

1420
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:56,217
(Ju Hyun's training log: After the show,)

1421
00:53:56,218 --> 00:53:58,117
(all I can do is jump rope and run in my sweat suit.)

1422
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:00,217
(The unbearably hot weather is helping me.)

1423
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:02,118
(People get scared of me when I run at night.)

1424
00:54:02,418 --> 00:54:03,858
In order to lose weight,

1425
00:54:04,718 --> 00:54:07,788
I am in my sweat suit and running by the Han River.

1426
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:11,427
(Before the show,)

1427
00:54:11,428 --> 00:54:14,198
(and after the show)

1428
00:54:14,428 --> 00:54:17,738
(She keeps working out whenever and wherever she has the time.)

1429
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,637
(She keeps up with her carb intake, which was another goal for her.)

1430
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:22,768
(Banana)

1431
00:54:24,908 --> 00:54:28,448
(Frequently eating bananas)

1432
00:54:28,948 --> 00:54:30,547
I think I might turn into a monkey.

1433
00:54:30,548 --> 00:54:32,548
(I think I might turn into a monkey.)

1434
00:54:32,948 --> 00:54:34,187
(Ju Hyun's training log: I can't sleep...)

1435
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,787
(because I'm too hungry.)

1436
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:38,057
(Working out to lose weight is so hard that I'm crying.)

1437
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:40,487
(After the weigh-in, what should I eat to make it fully satisfying?)

1438
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:42,958
(Tteokbokki, pizza, jjajangmyeon, pasta, gukbap, stir-fried pork...)

1439
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:44,857
Let's overcome this.

1440
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:46,267
(The competition is nearing.)

1441
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:47,697
(I need to do my best to have no regrets.)

1442
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:48,867
(Let's endure it a bit more. I can do this!)

1443
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,238
It's not long until the competition.

1444
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:51,867
Let's go.

1445
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:53,508
(She stays positive even despite the tough training.)

1446
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:54,608
Nine.

1447
00:54:54,609 --> 00:54:56,978
(On the other hand, Uie's goal is to increase muscle mass.)

1448
00:54:57,438 --> 00:55:01,448
(She focuses on gaining weight through strength training.)

1449
00:55:02,078 --> 00:55:05,278
(But...)

1450
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:09,918
I noticed that you lose fat too quickly.

1451
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:11,018
I know.

1452
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:12,958
It's very fast.

1453
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:15,387
How much do you weigh right now?

1454
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:17,228
I'm 51kg right now.

1455
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:18,858
You're 51kg right now?

1456
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:20,560
How much do you weigh right now?

1457
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,491
I'm 51kg right now.

1458
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:24,831
- You're 51kg right now?
- I checked this morning.

1459
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:29,671
(Since she worked 3 to 4 hours every day,)

1460
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:33,841
(Uie lost 1kg of body fat.)

1461
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:38,481
(It's a serious situation where she could be below the weight standard.)

1462
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:40,250
(Worried)

1463
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:42,681
(On eggshells)

1464
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:44,551
I'll try to eat well.

1465
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:47,321
- Eat a lot of carbs.
- Okay.

1466
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:51,260
(She begins eating to bulk up.)

1467
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:53,661
(Pork belly)

1468
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:56,801
(Meat is always delicious.)

1469
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:58,861
Dinner tonight is...

1470
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:01,871
sushi.

1471
00:56:02,201 --> 00:56:05,701
Coach Ji Hoon recommended sushi.

1472
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:10,781
(Eating a lot to gain weight)

1473
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:13,611
(An egg toast for a snack after 1 hour)

1474
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:16,381
Since I try to eat a lot,

1475
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,721
the number is going up.

1476
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:24,691
(Will Uie be able to gain weight?)

1477
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:29,701
(Meanwhile, Sae Rok agreed to reduce her body fat.)

1478
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:39,441
(She plays all over the boxing gym and trains hard.)

1479
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,070
(Sae Rok's training log:)

1480
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:43,580
(I can hit the sandbag for 2 minutes for 10 rounds?)

1481
00:56:43,581 --> 00:56:45,810
(I never got to hit it without taking any breaks.)

1482
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:48,611
(Now, I got the skills to hit it nonstop!)

1483
00:56:49,311 --> 00:56:51,180
(Upon getting ready to meet the weight,)

1484
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:55,621
(Rocky's stamina also increased.)

1485
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,591
(And)

1486
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:01,961
(Their uniform for their first tournament arrived.)

1487
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:04,231
I'm so nervous.

1488
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:07,330
Oh, I thought this would be a t-shirt.

1489
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:08,771
I'm so nervous!

1490
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:14,241
(Getting more excited and nervous after putting on the uniform)

1491
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:17,181
(Ju Hyun got changed as soon as she received it.)

1492
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:20,011
(The Max Boxer is ready.)

1493
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:22,351
(Bring it on.)

1494
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:24,950
(Iron Girls are becoming real boxers.)

1495
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:26,221
This is our uniform.

1496
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:28,051
It feels different to put it on.

1497
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:29,321
Yes. It's new.

1498
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:31,761
We're really entering the tournament.

1499
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,031
Seoul.

1500
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:36,861
Iron Girls!

1501
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:39,671
- That's so cool.
- Right?

1502
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:44,141
One, two.

1503
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:47,911
You got it. Yes.

1504
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:50,281
Two, one.

1505
00:57:53,551 --> 00:57:58,521
(The day of the first tournament)

1506
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,021
(Seoul Sports Council)

1507
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:08,061
(The weight center is crowded with people who are here to register.)

1508
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,000
This is so...

1509
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,631
(Sighing)

1510
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:17,041
- Hello.
- Hello.

1511
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:18,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

1512
00:58:18,841 --> 00:58:20,710
- Oh, gosh. Hello.
- Hello.

1513
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:22,841
- Hello.
- You lost so much weight.

1514
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:26,081
(Humming)

1515
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,110
How's your back? Feeling better?

1516
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:29,550
- I can now...
- Is it today?

1517
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:30,820
- Yes, it's today.
- Is it today?

1518
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:31,850
I'll bite you for asking questions.

1519
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:32,851
(Suspicious, nervous, sensitive, crying)

1520
00:58:32,852 --> 00:58:35,320
Ju Hyun, you look determined.

1521
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:37,820
- I know.
- Isn't she so cool?

1522
00:58:37,821 --> 00:58:39,760
- Gosh.
- She has the composure.

1523
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:40,830
Are you feeling okay?

1524
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:43,500
Shuffle and turn.

1525
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,001
- That's crazy.
- Did we bring a dancer?

1526
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:48,171
From an expert's perspective,

1527
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:49,871
you're going, "I'm nervous!"

1528
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:51,971
I couldn't sleep.

1529
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:54,741
Players who are nervous tend to do that.

1530
00:58:55,171 --> 00:58:56,810
- I couldn't sleep at all.
- Right.

1531
00:58:56,811 --> 00:58:58,881
This is finally your first tournament.

1532
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:01,281
- Finally.
- Your first tournament.

1533
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,051
How are you feeling?

1534
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:04,220
It couldn't be better!

1535
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:06,350
- Good?
- I'm ready to enter the ring now.

1536
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:07,490
- Really?
- Yes.

1537
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:10,490
But we haven't passed the weigh-ins yet.

1538
00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:11,560
- Of course.
- I'm scared.

1539
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:14,730
The two of you, Ju Hyun and In Ah had to lose weight.

1540
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:17,200
Right. It was so tough for them.

1541
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,961
This morning,

1542
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,371
I didn't even put on the moisturizer.

1543
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:24,670
I didn't even put on the body lotion after the shower.

1544
00:59:24,671 --> 00:59:26,910
- In case you get heavy?
- In case I absorb the moisture...

1545
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:29,440
- and become too heavy.
- Gosh. I see.

1546
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,340
- I'm so thirsty right now.
- And...

1547
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:32,840
she got changed five times.

1548
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:33,951
Why?

1549
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,351
"Four hundred grams? No."

1550
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:38,020
"Three hundred grams? No."

1551
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:41,221
I adjusted the weight of my clothes to 200g.

1552
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,190
They worked so hard to lose weight.

1553
00:59:44,191 --> 00:59:45,320
Let's stand together.

1554
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,560
Sure. Let's stay together.

1555
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:47,961
- Let's stand like this.
- Okay.

1556
00:59:48,061 --> 00:59:51,730
First of all, to tell you the weight division,

1557
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:53,900
Uie, Sae Rok, and In Ah are...

1558
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,570
entering the minus 54kg weight division.

1559
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:57,940
And Ju Hyun is in the minus 51kg weight division.

1560
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:01,141
- A month ago, you all had a goal.
- Yes.

1561
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:03,111
- Uie?
- What was it?

1562
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:05,710
- The muscles.
- Increase 1kg of muscles.

1563
01:00:05,711 --> 01:00:06,981
And Sae Rok?

1564
01:00:07,111 --> 01:00:08,711
- Body fat.
- Reduce the body fat.

1565
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,720
And In Ah and Ju Hyun.

1566
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:11,880
- Meet the weight division.
- Meet the weight division.

1567
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:13,750
We'll find out about that...

1568
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:16,051
when we measure your weight later.

1569
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,861
Sae Rok and Uie.

1570
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:19,590
- Uie.
- Yes.

1571
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:21,691
Did you manage to increase 1kg of muscle mass?

1572
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:23,730
If you give me one more month...

1573
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:25,431
What? A month?

1574
01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:27,330
While performing,

1575
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:29,230
I'd been on a diet a lot.

1576
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:31,501
But I wasn't sure about how to increase it.

1577
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:33,410
You have to eat more protein than you think.

1578
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:35,510
- I did until I got sick of it.
- You have to eat more.

1579
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,010
- I know.
- You have to eat more.

1580
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:39,681
I had to do it while exercising.

1581
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:43,151
To be honest, it's still the same. It's 23kg.

1582
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:45,620
- Really? As you can see, - I'm sorry.

1583
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:46,621
it's really hard...

1584
01:00:46,622 --> 01:00:47,790
- to increase the muscles.
- It's tough.

1585
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,890
- I took it for granted.
- It's really hard to do that.

1586
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:51,221
- I'm sorry.
- What about your weight?

1587
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:53,831
Is your weight still the same compared to a month ago?

1588
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:56,130
I lost so much weight exercising.

1589
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:58,731
So I lost weight down to 49kg and 50kg.

1590
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:00,600
I don't know.

1591
01:01:00,601 --> 01:01:02,130
I'm trying to meet the weight.

1592
01:01:02,131 --> 01:01:03,970
Uie is actually...

1593
01:01:03,971 --> 01:01:05,240
worried about being below the standard.

1594
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:06,810
This is my first time since my debut.

1595
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:08,140
- Uie kept...
- For some reason...

1596
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:09,611
- losing weight.
- You're getting skinnier.

1597
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:10,880
I'm just jealous.

1598
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:13,451
Sae Rok, you look anxious.

1599
01:01:13,651 --> 01:01:15,180
It says on your face that you're anxious.

1600
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:16,520
Are we checking Sae Rok's InBody?

1601
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,851
Show me your InBody result. How did it go?

1602
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:20,450
- Yes.
- Okay.

1603
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:22,551
Don't just say yes.

1604
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,360
If you give us a month...

1605
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:25,661
Please give us a month.

1606
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,531
We saw this coming...

1607
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:29,760
and completed their missions.

1608
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:31,860
- What?
- Our body fat is 16 percent.

1609
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:33,571
- Okay.
- I lost five percent of body fat.

1610
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:36,131
- My muscles increased by 1kg.
- My muscle mass is 26kg.

1611
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:38,100
- Your muscles are 26kg?
- Yes.

1612
01:01:38,101 --> 01:01:39,870
- Amazing.
- How did you increase it?

1613
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:42,240
Because of the play,

1614
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,780
- Yes?
- I could only...

1615
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:45,441
- exercise once a day.
- Okay.

1616
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:46,880
I was losing confidence.

1617
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:50,420
"What if I fail to lose weight and can't even enter the ring?"

1618
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:52,421
- I was too anxious to eat.
- Right.

1619
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:53,650
I'd never been so nervous...

1620
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:54,750
- in my life before.
- Me too.

1621
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:57,890
- Boxing is a tough sport.
- It's unbelievable.

1622
01:01:57,891 --> 01:02:00,691
People only see the games and training.

1623
01:02:00,731 --> 01:02:02,031
But losing weight.

1624
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,430
- Meeting the weight limit is...
- Seriously.

1625
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:04,601
very tough.

1626
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:06,430
- You get to experience...
- We went through...

1627
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,900
- how tough it is.
- so much.

1628
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:09,070
We didn't have this for the triathlon.

1629
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:10,340
- No.
- No.

1630
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:11,670
Still,

1631
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,370
- I'm getting anxious.
- You're anxious, right?

1632
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:14,740
You have to take off your socks and everything.

1633
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:15,910
- I'm going to take off everything.
- You have to take off everything.

1634
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:17,181
Should I cut my hair?

1635
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,980
Some boxers cut their hair, but...

1636
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:20,880
- My hair grew.
- You know what?

1637
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,280
Based on what I see right now,

1638
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:24,080
if you shave your head, you'll lose 500g.

1639
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:26,321
- Really?
- I'm very accurate.

1640
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:28,690
- Five hundred grams...
- Keep that in mind...

1641
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:30,390
- No.
- if it's necessary.

1642
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:33,231
- No!
- What's my occupation?

1643
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:34,831
- This is...
- "No."

1644
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:36,960
- your first weigh-in.
- Yes.

1645
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,601
The moment you get on the scale and pass,

1646
01:02:40,871 --> 01:02:42,201
you become Boxer Park Ju Hyun.

1647
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:43,740
- Your first...
- Oh, please.

1648
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:45,300
Please help me this once.

1649
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:47,640
It might be too much for you to even stay standing.

1650
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:48,710
- We can do it.
- Let's do the weigh-in.

1651
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:50,110
- Let's go. Let's do the weigh-in.
- We can do it. Let's go.

1652
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,811
- Girls, let's go. Let's do it.
- Hurry up.

1653
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,681
Wait. Let me do this before I go in.

1654
01:02:54,881 --> 01:02:56,410
I have to look strong.

1655
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:57,821
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1656
01:02:57,981 --> 01:02:59,221
- We can do it.
- Gosh.

1657
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:01,651
Coach, this worries me more than the tournament.

1658
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,090
- Even more than my first play.
- Oh, my gosh.

1659
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,460
This is more tense.

1660
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,690
(Will everyone be able to pass the weigh-in?)

1661
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,060
- Hello.
- Good luck.

1662
01:03:08,061 --> 01:03:09,660
- Good luck.
- Hello.

1663
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,730
Hello.

1664
01:03:10,731 --> 01:03:12,100
It says, "The boxer card registration."

1665
01:03:12,101 --> 01:03:13,101
That's cool.

1666
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:14,971
(Boxer Card Registration)

1667
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:18,600
(To register as a boxer: Fill out the basic information.)

1668
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:21,840
(Basic medical check including the blood pressure)

1669
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:27,211
(Measure the weight.)

1670
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:29,711
(Starting with Captain Uie,)

1671
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:31,320
I'm so nervous.

1672
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:34,350
(they nervously fill out the boxer card.)

1673
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:35,591
Write your name.

1674
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:37,890
- Let's go.
- Are you done?

1675
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:39,360
- Yes. We got this.
- See you.

1676
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,361
- You can do it.
- We got this.

1677
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,960
Someone might come out crying.

1678
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:43,331
Scream if you don't make it.

1679
01:03:43,531 --> 01:03:45,360
- Scream if you don't make it.
- Then we'll dash out.

1680
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:46,401
Scream if you don't make it.

1681
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:49,100
(The mood is serious in the weigh-in room.)

1682
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,841
- This way.
- Okay.

1683
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,941
There aren't many people.

1684
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:58,181
(First is the medical check.)

1685
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:11,320
You can weigh in now.

1686
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:12,421
Thank you.

1687
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:17,301
(She finally goes on the scale.)

1688
01:04:17,831 --> 01:04:22,401
(Uie was worried about going below the weight standard.)

1689
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:30,840
(The weight range is 51.01kg to 54kg.)

1690
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,210
It's 52.7kg.

1691
01:04:32,211 --> 01:04:34,981
(She passed as 52.7kg.)

1692
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:36,350
It's 52.7kg.

1693
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,751
(She safely passed the weigh-in.)

1694
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:44,721
(Next is Sae Rok's turn.)

1695
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:49,791
Wait. When I weighed myself...

1696
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:53,770
(Her blood pressure check is taking way too long.)

1697
01:04:53,771 --> 01:04:55,330
If you don't make the weight, it'll be legendary.

1698
01:04:55,331 --> 01:04:56,941
(Her blood pressure check is taking way too long.)

1699
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,101
How's your blood pressure normally?

1700
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:00,340
It's a bit low.

1701
01:05:00,341 --> 01:05:01,841
- It's a bit low.
- It is?

1702
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:03,911
- Come back later.
- Okay.

1703
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:06,281
- Come back later?
- Yes.

1704
01:05:06,411 --> 01:05:08,610
- I didn't pass?
- No.

1705
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:10,551
(I didn't pass?)

1706
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:12,120
- Come back when you're done.
- Really?

1707
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:13,450
- Really?
- It's too low.

1708
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,791
(Sae Rok will measure it again because it's too low.)

1709
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:18,020
I have low blood pressure too.

1710
01:05:18,021 --> 01:05:19,291
(I have low blood pressure too.)

1711
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:22,030
(The blood pressure is the unexpected ambush.)

1712
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,831
(It must be between 50 and 150 to be on the scale.)

1713
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:27,470
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

1714
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:28,530
It couldn't be more normal.

1715
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:29,671
Good.

1716
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:32,871
Now, I can move to the next step.

1717
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:34,510
I'm taking my socks off.

1718
01:05:34,511 --> 01:05:36,111
(I'm taking my socks off.)

1719
01:05:36,341 --> 01:05:37,480
I'm taking the mic off.

1720
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:38,640
Me too.

1721
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:41,651
(Taking off everything that will add weight)

1722
01:05:42,511 --> 01:05:43,650
(Will her effort to lose weight be worthwhile?)

1723
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:45,080
Look how skinny she is.

1724
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:47,220
(Will her effort to lose weight be worthwhile?)

1725
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:49,551
- I look forward to your service.
- Go on.

1726
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:53,161
(Exhaling)

1727
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:58,461
(She goes on the scale nervously.)

1728
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:05,740
(Dong Hyun and Ji Hoon wait for the Iron Girls.)

1729
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:07,570
Why aren't they coming out? It's making me nervous.

1730
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:09,511
(Why aren't they coming out? It's making me nervous.)

1731
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:13,681
(Anxious, nervous)

1732
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:21,620
(Ju Hyun has to be below 51kg to pass.)

1733
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:22,691
It's 50.7kg.

1734
01:06:23,491 --> 01:06:27,760
(She passed as 50.7kg.)

1735
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:28,961
Ju Hyun.

1736
01:06:29,331 --> 01:06:31,961
Ju Hyun, please stay still.

1737
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:33,730
Uie.

1738
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:35,371
(Ju Hyun's body composition, height 166cm)

1739
01:06:35,601 --> 01:06:37,140
Don't cry. Come here.

1740
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:38,600
Put your clothes on. Come here.

1741
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:39,941
(Joy surges with relief)

1742
01:06:40,171 --> 01:06:41,241
Thank you.

1743
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:43,210
Thank you.

1744
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:44,381
(Thank you.)

1745
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:46,711
- Good job.
- I can join the tournament.

1746
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:48,981
You're really amazing.

1747
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:51,051
Don't cry.

1748
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:52,580
You can weigh in now.

1749
01:06:52,581 --> 01:06:53,920
(In Ah weighs in next.)

1750
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:55,291
(Extreme tension)

1751
01:06:59,121 --> 01:07:00,121
Go up.

1752
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:01,390
Please.

1753
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:04,361
(In Ah is nervous, but she goes up bravely.)

1754
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:08,931
(She sweated so much for today.)

1755
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:18,210
(In Ah must be below 54kg to pass the weigh-in.)

1756
01:07:18,211 --> 01:07:19,380
It's 53.8kg.

1757
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:22,651
(She passes as 53.8kg.)

1758
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:27,091
(By 200g, she passes the weigh-in for under 54kg.)

1759
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:29,851
I did it. This is amazing.

1760
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:31,561
I know this is no big deal,

1761
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:33,890
but I'm so proud of you.

1762
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:35,731
- Oh, my gosh.
- I almost cried.

1763
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,060
(While the three who passed the weigh-in celebrate...)

1764
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:38,261
I almost cried.

1765
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:41,871
(Nervous)

1766
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:45,140
- Is it too low?
- I almost screamed.

1767
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:46,270
You made it.

1768
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,941
(She passed the medical checkup.)

1769
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:51,881
(Sae Rok is the last one to go on the scale.)

1770
01:07:56,411 --> 01:08:01,521
(She must be below 54kg to pass.)

1771
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:03,051
It's 53.2kg.

1772
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:05,560
It's 53.2kg.

1773
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:09,091
(She passes as 53.2kg.)

1774
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:10,861
(Relieved)

1775
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:13,930
I'm a boxer now.

1776
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:15,971
(All Iron Girls passed the weigh-in.)

1777
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:18,740
Should we tease Captain and Coach?

1778
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:20,341
Me or you?

1779
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:25,711
(Their surprise strategy goes smoothly.)

1780
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:27,750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1781
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:28,911
They must be done.

1782
01:08:32,181 --> 01:08:33,281
What happened?

1783
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:36,251
- Are you done?
- Are you done? How did it go?

1784
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:38,721
You didn't scream. All good?

1785
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:41,260
No, it's okay.

1786
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:42,460
Only the two of us passed.

1787
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:43,901
- What?
- We'll have to go for a run.

1788
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:45,731
Hurry up.

1789
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:47,101
Really?

1790
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:48,530
We have to go for a run.

1791
01:08:48,531 --> 01:08:49,630
- How did it go?
- Who?

1792
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:51,270
- How much time do we have left?
- Who has to go for a run?

1793
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:52,301
Hurry up.

1794
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,710
- Sae Rok?
- Really?

1795
01:08:53,711 --> 01:08:55,341
Sae Rok, for 300g.

1796
01:08:55,471 --> 01:08:56,840
- For 300g.
- For 300g?

1797
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,240
(Pretending to be over 300g)

1798
01:08:58,241 --> 01:09:00,580
- My goodness.
- But we were okay yesterday.

1799
01:09:00,581 --> 01:09:01,581
- You have to lose 300g?
- No.

1800
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:02,610
No, we can run.

1801
01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:04,380
- Hurry up.
- Will running do?

1802
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:05,851
- That won't be easy.
- Hurry up and run.

1803
01:09:06,551 --> 01:09:10,051
No, I'm not going to run.

1804
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:11,961
Because she passed.

1805
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:13,460
Seriously.

1806
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:14,831
Because she passed.

1807
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:16,390
Seriously.

1808
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:18,301
(Did you fall for it?)

1809
01:09:19,931 --> 01:09:23,401
(Relieved)

1810
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:26,001
- You scared me to death.
- It's...

1811
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:29,610
You need to drink something warm.

1812
01:09:29,611 --> 01:09:31,381
(Warming up with warm honey tea)

1813
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:34,410
Whether it's high blood pressure or low blood pressure...

1814
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:35,780
I didn't know how good it was.

1815
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:37,150
This is so good.

1816
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,151
It's 100 times sweeter.

1817
01:09:38,152 --> 01:09:39,250
- Where's our meal?
- This is so sweet.

1818
01:09:39,251 --> 01:09:40,251
We'll have to go eat.

1819
01:09:40,252 --> 01:09:42,350
Now that you've passed the weigh-in,

1820
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:43,820
- let's go now.
- Yes.

1821
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:44,861
Let's go.

1822
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:46,220
This is so good.

1823
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:47,331
Good job.

1824
01:09:48,361 --> 01:09:50,091
You guys are so cool.

1825
01:09:50,261 --> 01:09:52,261
We've only...

1826
01:09:52,801 --> 01:09:54,431
completed one step.

1827
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:59,370
(Moving to the stadium)

1828
01:09:59,371 --> 01:10:01,410
You just finished the weigh-in.

1829
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:02,770
Now,

1830
01:10:02,771 --> 01:10:04,210
- what do you want to eat the most?
- Fried chicken?

1831
01:10:04,211 --> 01:10:06,310
We chatted about that a lot.

1832
01:10:06,311 --> 01:10:08,010
The two of us talked about it a lot.

1833
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:09,050
- Right.
- Right.

1834
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:10,921
"What's the first thing you're going to eat?"

1835
01:10:11,221 --> 01:10:12,420
- "What about you?" - "I'll have..."

1836
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:13,480
- "jjajangmyeon." - She said jjajangmyeon.

1837
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:14,750
- "I want jjajang ramyeon." - Yes.

1838
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:16,120
(Let's kill our senses for two days.)

1839
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:17,490
Malatang or hot pot.

1840
01:10:17,491 --> 01:10:18,890
I could even chew plastic.

1841
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:19,891
Right.

1842
01:10:19,892 --> 01:10:21,690
Yes. They shouldn't put the mouthpiece.

1843
01:10:21,691 --> 01:10:23,291
They'll even eat that.

1844
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:24,960
- Eat the mouthpiece?
- "It's delicious."

1845
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:26,501
- They'll think it's ham.
- "It's yummy."

1846
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:28,130
After the meal, the tournament will come to your mind,

1847
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:29,531
- and your heart will start racing.
- Right.

1848
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:32,271
- All I can think of is the food.
- Me too.

1849
01:10:33,911 --> 01:10:36,310
(While Ju Hyun's chatting...)

1850
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:37,541
(Staring)

1851
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:40,981
- It must be here.
- We're here.

1852
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,511
- The stadium.
- Are we there?

1853
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:44,180
(Iron Girls arrived...)

1854
01:10:44,181 --> 01:10:45,520
We have to look strong from here.

1855
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:46,820
(at the place of their first boxing tournament.)

1856
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,120
It feels different...

1857
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:50,521
now that this is our stadium.

1858
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:55,061
(Reaching the first tournament stadium)

1859
01:10:56,731 --> 01:11:00,261
(4 hours before the boxing tournament)

1860
01:11:00,971 --> 01:11:03,670
(Iron Girls arrived.)

1861
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:04,841
Where's my opponent?

1862
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:08,470
(Squealing)

1863
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:10,540
I passed the weigh-in.

1864
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:11,680
(I passed the weigh-in.)

1865
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:12,711
Hang on.

1866
01:11:12,941 --> 01:11:14,451
Hang on. There are our enemies.

1867
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:16,081
- Wait for me.
- I'll pretend to be cool.

1868
01:11:17,151 --> 01:11:18,151
(Pretending to be cool as they enter)

1869
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:19,650
You look like real boxers.

1870
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,451
(Pretending to be cool as they enter)

1871
01:11:21,821 --> 01:11:23,591
- Is this the stadium? This is cool.
- Is it here?

1872
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:25,391
What are they doing?

1873
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:27,760
I think this is the ring.

1874
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,361
The ring must be here.

1875
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,661
(Gasping)

1876
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,870
- Is this it?
- No. I'm so nervous.

1877
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,301
(How does their first stadium look?)

1878
01:11:37,341 --> 01:11:39,741
(2025 Seoul Boxing Association President's Cup)

1879
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:44,881
- Everyone will be focused on us.
- Oh, no.

1880
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:47,510
(Something steals Ju Hyun's attention.)

1881
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:48,780
Oh, the trophies.

1882
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:49,950
(They're the trophies.)

1883
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:51,080
- Oh, the trophies.
- Gosh.

1884
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:52,180
- I want them.
- Look at this.

1885
01:11:52,181 --> 01:11:53,620
- Cool.
- My goodness.

1886
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:54,950
Why are there trophies?

1887
01:11:54,951 --> 01:11:55,951
For the overall champion.

1888
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:58,020
For the team with many players...

1889
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,090
- and many wins.
- For the team?

1890
01:11:59,091 --> 01:12:01,531
(If many from a team win, they're given a trophy.)

1891
01:12:01,691 --> 01:12:02,730
Good. Let's go.

1892
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:04,330
Let's eat and get some rest.

1893
01:12:04,331 --> 01:12:05,861
(Their first boxing tournament finally feels real.)

1894
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,201
Let's go. This way.

1895
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:11,701
(Exclaiming)

1896
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:14,371
Nice. This is nice.

1897
01:12:15,171 --> 01:12:19,211
(This space was filmed with the cooperation of the school.)

1898
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:20,481
- Oh, my gosh.
- This is nice.

1899
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:23,710
(Why are the Iron Girls surprised?)

1900
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:26,221
What is this?

1901
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:27,851
"Iron Girls."

1902
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,251
- "Let's be champions." - "Let's be champions."

1903
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:31,791
After the weigh-in,

1904
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:34,731
it's important to consume healthy carbohydrates.

1905
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:37,431
And baekseolgi is the best.

1906
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:41,071
So for you to get a good result from your first tournament,

1907
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:43,030
I prepared it.

1908
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:44,500
(A good meal before the tournament)

1909
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,671
Enjoy. Take one.

1910
01:12:46,541 --> 01:12:47,641
This is my favorite.

1911
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:50,410
(Sae Rok who must eat enjoys it.)

1912
01:12:50,411 --> 01:12:52,810
This is the hardest part.

1913
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:54,010
(The Iron Girls enjoy the food.)

1914
01:12:54,011 --> 01:12:55,480
- I'll stop eating and go.
- What?

1915
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:56,710
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

1916
01:12:56,711 --> 01:12:58,451
After the weigh-in,

1917
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:00,791
the coaches have a coach meeting.

1918
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:02,090
(A coach meeting?)

1919
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:03,420
- That's so cool.
- With who?

1920
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,561
Everyone together.

1921
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:06,720
- All coaches coming today?
- Yes.

1922
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:07,960
All coaches gather...

1923
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:09,430
and do what they have to do.

1924
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:10,901
- See you.
- I'll go talk to them.

1925
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:12,331
- Good luck.
- See you.

1926
01:13:12,901 --> 01:13:15,070
(3 hours before the boxing tournament)

1927
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:18,470
While the coach is attending the meeting,

1928
01:13:18,471 --> 01:13:19,840
I researched...

1929
01:13:19,841 --> 01:13:21,911
the tournament bracket.

1930
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:23,570
The tournament bracket...

1931
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:25,140
- Oh, I'm so nervous.
- and the weight divisions.

1932
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:26,510
And how many joined.

1933
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:30,950
First of all, about 200 boxers are participating.

1934
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:33,050
And 40 of them are female boxers.

1935
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:34,990
(40 female boxers out of 200 boxers in total)

1936
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:37,121
- That's a lot.
- Among them,

1937
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:39,260
the elementary, middle school,

1938
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:41,790
and high school and 20s are in the same division.

1939
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:44,331
And the last division is over 30s.

1940
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:48,170
The younger and lighter division will go first.

1941
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:53,271
The tournament is randomly selected.

1942
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:55,740
As I said before,

1943
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:57,040
this is a physical match,

1944
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,240
and you have to hit each other.

1945
01:13:59,241 --> 01:14:00,310
Regardless of how many there are,

1946
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,680
today, it's the quarterfinal, and tomorrow, it's the final.

1947
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:04,020
It's one game a day.

1948
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:05,150
It's two at a time no matter what.

1949
01:14:05,151 --> 01:14:07,250
Lose, and it's over. You don't have to come tomorrow.

1950
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:08,790
(Only the winners will keep competing.)

1951
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:10,050
(B: Winner)

1952
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,790
(Semifinal tournament format)

1953
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:14,661
(Gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal)

1954
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:16,630
- He's here.
- Hey.

1955
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:18,101
(Coach Ji Hoon has returned.)

1956
01:14:18,531 --> 01:14:19,631
Well...

1957
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,031
There's a little problem in today's tournament.

1958
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:24,941
- The coaches had a meeting.
- Okay.

1959
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:26,900
We have a problem.

1960
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:28,141
- Is there a southpaw?
- What is it?

1961
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:29,811
What's going on?

1962
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,510
One boxer failed to make weight.

1963
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:33,840
- Failed the weigh-in.
- So...

1964
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:35,551
- right now...
- Really? Wait. Is this for real?

1965
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:38,181
- Uie's opponent was...
- Yes?

1966
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:39,651
disqualified for failing the weigh-in.

1967
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:41,791
She was disqualified for failing the weigh-in.

1968
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,661
What?

1969
01:14:46,491 --> 01:14:48,831
What? Then what happens to me? Can't I compete?

1970
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:51,760
You've advanced to the finals by default.

1971
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:52,860
(Uie advances to the finals by default.)

1972
01:14:52,861 --> 01:14:55,171
Right. That means Uie is guaranteed at least a silver medal.

1973
01:14:55,431 --> 01:14:58,341
This shows how important it is to make weight.

1974
01:14:58,401 --> 01:14:59,900
Self-management, including your weight, is...

1975
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:01,040
Hold on.

1976
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:03,471
Wait a minute. I feel a lot more pressure now.

1977
01:15:05,611 --> 01:15:07,110
(Uie: Walkover, Boxer D: Missed the weigh-in)

1978
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:11,121
(Uie has secured the silver medal.)

1979
01:15:11,251 --> 01:15:12,751
Normally,

1980
01:15:13,081 --> 01:15:15,250
advancing to the finals through the preliminary rounds...

1981
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:16,851
- helps you warm up.
- True.

1982
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:19,390
Since you've already won a match,

1983
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:20,931
- it could play in your favor.
- Right.

1984
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:23,261
On the other hand, in a way,

1985
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:26,001
- you're also lucky.
- I see.

1986
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:28,971
It all comes down to personal luck.

1987
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:31,070
I have mixed feelings about it.

1988
01:15:31,071 --> 01:15:33,400
I'm both happy and anxious.

1989
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:36,011
- Of course. We understand.
- Today, I'll watch the opponent...

1990
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:38,141
I'll be facing tomorrow,

1991
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:40,211
cheer for the others,

1992
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:43,081
and get ready for my match tomorrow.

1993
01:15:43,881 --> 01:15:46,420
You have a slight smile on your face.

1994
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:48,351
I thought I'd lose in the preliminaries,

1995
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,520
but now I'm suddenly in the finals.

1996
01:15:50,521 --> 01:15:52,021
(Congratulations.)

1997
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:58,101
(30 minutes before the boxing tournament begins)

1998
01:15:58,861 --> 01:16:03,131
(The boxers are warming up before the tournament begins.)

1999
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:06,571
(The strong determination to win)

2000
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:10,510
(The stands...)

2001
01:16:10,511 --> 01:16:15,051
(are gradually filling up with spectators.)

2002
01:16:16,011 --> 01:16:19,781
(Family and friends of the boxers are here to cheer them on.)

2003
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:25,621
(In Ah?)

2004
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,160
(In Ah's parents, Ju Hyun's dad)

2005
01:16:28,161 --> 01:16:30,631
(The Iron Girls' family and friends are also here.)

2006
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:36,830
We will now begin the 2025 Seoul Boxing Association...

2007
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:37,870
President's Cup.

2008
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:41,041
(Elementary Division, Under 45kg, begins.)

2009
01:16:41,611 --> 01:16:44,741
(What are the Iron Girls doing in the midst of this tension?)

2010
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:08,871
(The 1st boxing tournament that will prove their past 3 months of effort)

2011
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:14,071
(The last training)

2012
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,671
This is the real thing.

2013
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:18,740
Always treat the real match like practice,

2014
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:20,140
and practice like the real match.

2015
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:21,451
Let's stay calm.

2016
01:17:23,581 --> 01:17:25,751
It's okay to lose. Let's make it a good fight...

2017
01:17:25,981 --> 01:17:27,751
and leave no regrets.

2018
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:31,960
Regardless of the result,

2019
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:35,161
I want to see the fruits of my efforts.

2020
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:38,960
- This way.
- Come on.

2021
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:40,001
Let's join hands.

2022
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,830
Recall your training. Listen to your coach.

2023
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:44,371
- Good luck. I love you guys.
- Let's all cheer.

2024
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:45,700
It's time to enter the ring.

2025
01:17:45,701 --> 01:17:46,770
- KO!
- KO!

2026
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:49,210
- Iron Girls!
- Iron Girls!

2027
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,181
- Let's do this.
- Good luck.

2028
01:17:52,541 --> 01:17:54,151
I'm cooling down. I'd better hurry.

2029
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:56,481
In Ah should get ready.

2030
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:02,250
Your bag. Give it to me.

2031
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:04,051
Boxers shouldn't carry their bags.

2032
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:07,061
Here, your bag. No, it's Ju Hyun's.

2033
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:08,530
Let's go.

2034
01:18:08,531 --> 01:18:10,661
(Staring)

2035
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:15,200
(All their attention...)

2036
01:18:15,201 --> 01:18:16,570
(is on the venue.)

2037
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:18,541
There are three matches left, including this one.

2038
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:23,241
(The venue is already in a state of excitement.)

2039
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:26,310
(The world of competition...)

2040
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:31,051
(unfolds here.)

2041
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,650
After the third match, it'll be In Ah's turn.

2042
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:34,791
The third after this one.

2043
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:38,521
Stretch your joints and knees, In Ah.

2044
01:18:38,961 --> 01:18:41,430
Sit down and stand up a few times. Loosen your shoulders.

2045
01:18:41,431 --> 01:18:43,090
(In Ah...)

2046
01:18:43,091 --> 01:18:45,960
(calmly prepares for her match.)

2047
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:47,431
There will be two more matches.

2048
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:50,071
- Gosh.
- They're going all out.

2049
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:53,541
- They're good.
- They're good.

2050
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:56,911
Really, those two are good.

2051
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:00,111
Both of them are good.

2052
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:03,910
(As each match ends,)

2053
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:06,481
(In Ah's turn draws closer.)

2054
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:08,390
- Let's go.
- I'm off.

2055
01:19:08,391 --> 01:19:09,851
We'll keep watching you, In Ah.

2056
01:19:10,321 --> 01:19:11,460
- Good luck.
- In Ah.

2057
01:19:11,461 --> 01:19:13,561
If you win and make it to the next round.

2058
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:15,791
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2059
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:18,500
(Cheered on by everyone,)

2060
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:23,731
(In Ah heads to the ring.)

2061
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:26,401
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2062
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:29,640
- Go for it.
- Good luck.

2063
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:31,141
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2064
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:34,081
I'm nervous all of a sudden.

2065
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,911
Let's go!

2066
01:19:36,311 --> 01:19:37,720
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

2067
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:39,780
- Good luck.
- He said, "Good luck."

2068
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:41,120
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

2069
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:43,021
- He must've just arrived.
- Don't be nervous.

2070
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:45,821
(10 minutes before In Ah fights)

2071
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:48,861
(In Ah has entered the venue.)

2072
01:19:49,931 --> 01:19:54,001
(She heads straight to the glove room.)

2073
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:55,800
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2074
01:19:55,801 --> 01:19:57,641
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2075
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,071
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2076
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:02,771
(Let's do this.)

2077
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:05,881
(She arrives at the glove room.)

2078
01:20:06,811 --> 01:20:08,411
- Any jewelry on you?
- No.

2079
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,080
We're in your care.

2080
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:12,680
(Making eye contact with today's opponent)

2081
01:20:12,681 --> 01:20:14,081
The opponent greeted her.

2082
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:17,151
- Her opponent is...
- She's very small.

2083
01:20:17,421 --> 01:20:19,020
True, but she looks strong.

2084
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:20,121
Let's watch the match.

2085
01:20:20,161 --> 01:20:22,391
(Kim Min Jung, 20s, under 54kg)

2086
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,030
(Boxing experience: 6 months)

2087
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:26,001
(Special martial arts experience: 6 years)

2088
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:30,271
(In Ah quickly puts on her gear.)

2089
01:20:31,301 --> 01:20:33,270
- Coach.
- You need this.

2090
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:35,371
- Coach. I'm nervous.
- Don't worry.

2091
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,640
It's okay. It's the same.

2092
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:39,280
Remember how it felt like nothing after our sparring session?

2093
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:41,650
It was like that every time we reviewed the matches.

2094
01:20:41,651 --> 01:20:42,651
Nothing is different.

2095
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:44,451
Let's go.

2096
01:20:45,951 --> 01:20:47,851
- Good luck.
- In Ah is going now.

2097
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:49,591
Oh, dear.

2098
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:52,661
In Ah must be really nervous.

2099
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:56,961
(Good luck, In Ah.)

2100
01:20:57,901 --> 01:21:00,831
(After seeing the others, she smiles brightly.)

2101
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:06,671
(The match from the front heat begins before In Ah's match.)

2102
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,741
(Her first match is just around the corner.)

2103
01:21:11,811 --> 01:21:13,911
Fighting first is making me really nervous.

2104
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:16,581
Don't be nervous. That's all that matters.

2105
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:18,150
How can I not get nervous?

2106
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,581
- It's my first ever...
- Then just a little.

2107
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:22,420
- Be nervous just a little.
- Just a bit.

2108
01:21:22,421 --> 01:21:23,950
- I'll be just a little nervous...
- Okay.

2109
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:25,321
- as small as this fist.
- Okay.

2110
01:21:26,391 --> 01:21:27,660
(The opponent seems nervous too.)

2111
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:29,530
Her opponent must also be nervous.

2112
01:21:29,531 --> 01:21:31,731
(She quietly loosens up her body.)

2113
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:35,270
In Ah's opponent seemed quite short.

2114
01:21:35,271 --> 01:21:37,501
- There's a big height difference.
- She's short but sturdy.

2115
01:21:37,701 --> 01:21:39,341
The opponent might have a strong punch.

2116
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:42,571
(In Ah is about to fight a mysterious opponent.)

2117
01:21:43,241 --> 01:21:45,440
(The front heat's match has ended.)

2118
01:21:45,441 --> 01:21:47,581
- Kim Yeo Jin is the winner.
- Kim Yeo Jin.

2119
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:50,711
Let's go.

2120
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:53,551
That's it. Good. Warm your body up.

2121
01:21:54,551 --> 01:21:57,961
Match 32 of the under-54kg division.

2122
01:21:58,361 --> 01:21:59,560
In the Red Corner,

2123
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:01,731
- Iron Girls' Seol In Ah.
- Let's go.

2124
01:22:01,961 --> 01:22:04,430
- Good luck.
- In the Blue Corner...

2125
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:07,331
(Red Corner: Seol In Ah)

2126
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:09,801
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2127
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:15,370
(Entering the ring to the cheers of many spectators)

2128
01:22:15,371 --> 01:22:16,371
Greet him.

2129
01:22:16,911 --> 01:22:18,540
(The referee's gear inspection)

2130
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:19,541
Your hands.

2131
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:20,841
Mouthguard.

2132
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:23,011
- Good.
- Good luck.

2133
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:26,021
Stay calm.

2134
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:29,091
(The boxers meet at the center.)

2135
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:31,860
Watch out for the back of your head and open blows.

2136
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:33,460
- Don't punch below the belt.
- Okay.

2137
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:34,531
Touch gloves.

2138
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:36,490
- To your corners.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2139
01:22:36,491 --> 01:22:38,701
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2140
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:41,171
Feint with a jab and move in with a one-two combination.

2141
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:42,530
Throw a feint, okay?

2142
01:22:42,531 --> 01:22:43,701
(Sharing the strategy one last time)

2143
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:44,901
- Throw a feint, okay?
- Good luck.

2144
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:50,471
(In Ah is about to compete in her first tournament.)

2145
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:52,441
Do everything you want, In Ah.

2146
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:54,210
(Seol In Ah versus Kim Min Jung)

2147
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:56,351
(Round 1 begins.)

2148
01:22:58,451 --> 01:22:59,480
Box.

2149
01:22:59,481 --> 01:23:02,791
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Seol In Ah versus Kim Min Jung)

2150
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,791
Turn.

2151
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:19,371
(In Ah keeps her distance and eyes her opponent.)

2152
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:22,010
Her opponent ducks in and attacks using both hooks.

2153
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:24,141
Dodge both hooks, then counter with a one-two.

2154
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:28,181
That's it.

2155
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:30,651
- Guard up.
- Yes, again.

2156
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:32,981
- Good. Again.
- Small punches.

2157
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:35,691
Yes.

2158
01:23:39,361 --> 01:23:41,961
Good. That's it.

2159
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:45,001
(One, two)

2160
01:23:45,331 --> 01:23:46,731
Nice.

2161
01:23:46,761 --> 01:23:48,171
(One, two)

2162
01:23:49,831 --> 01:23:52,400
(In Ah's clean punches draw a roar of applause.)

2163
01:23:52,401 --> 01:23:53,440
Okay!

2164
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:55,541
(In Ah's clean punches draw a roar of applause.)

2165
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:58,281
- Well done. Yes.
- Turn!

2166
01:23:58,441 --> 01:23:59,781
That's it. It's okay.

2167
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:01,481
Good. Nice one.

2168
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:03,051
Yes.

2169
01:24:04,651 --> 01:24:07,080
Move in. Attack.

2170
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:09,290
Close in. Come on.

2171
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:11,221
(The opponent slips in and lands a hook.)

2172
01:24:12,891 --> 01:24:14,020
Stop.

2173
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:16,131
(Stop)

2174
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:17,931
(A warning given to In Ah.)

2175
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,131
Don't keep your arm straight.

2176
01:24:22,401 --> 01:24:24,500
(Passive: Excessively keeping distance...)

2177
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:26,601
(or only extending your arms, resulting in a warning)

2178
01:24:26,901 --> 01:24:27,910
Box.

2179
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:29,470
(The match resumes after a warning is given.)

2180
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:30,471
Guard up. Eyes ahead.

2181
01:24:30,472 --> 01:24:31,811
(Another wide hook lands)

2182
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:34,381
(Keeping a distance for a short while)

2183
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:37,080
(A slugfest begins.)

2184
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:38,081
Again.

2185
01:24:38,082 --> 01:24:39,221
In Ah is a little annoyed.

2186
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:42,951
(A flurry of one-two combinations)

2187
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:45,090
That's it.

2188
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:46,391
Keep going.

2189
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:49,061
The opponent took some damage.

2190
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:50,831
Don't stop, In Ah.

2191
01:24:52,101 --> 01:24:53,901
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2192
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:56,631
Move in, In Ah!

2193
01:24:57,171 --> 01:24:58,871
Step back and reset your stance.

2194
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:00,901
Yes, attack.

2195
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:02,971
- In Ah has to get annoyed.
- That's it.

2196
01:25:03,171 --> 01:25:04,240
- In Ah is annoyed.
- Nice.

2197
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:05,341
Good.

2198
01:25:05,841 --> 01:25:09,011
(Round 1 ends with In Ah's clean shot.)

2199
01:25:09,081 --> 01:25:11,521
Okay. Nice.

2200
01:25:12,181 --> 01:25:13,921
In Ah needs to get furious.

2201
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:18,161
(The venue is buzzing with excitement.)

2202
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:21,531
(40-second rest period)

2203
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:23,030
She's really strong.

2204
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:24,091
She's not strong at all.

2205
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:26,061
The opponent can only read one of your moves.

2206
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:27,660
Keep feinting and attacking.

2207
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:28,771
That's more than enough.

2208
01:25:28,871 --> 01:25:29,930
As soon as the opponent...

2209
01:25:29,931 --> 01:25:31,501
reacts to your feint, strike back.

2210
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:32,671
Counter that attack.

2211
01:25:32,971 --> 01:25:34,971
- As soon as the opponent reacts.
- Good luck.

2212
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:37,070
(The Blue Corner also goes over the strategy.)

2213
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:38,510
You're doing great.

2214
01:25:38,511 --> 01:25:39,540
Breathe.

2215
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:41,111
Be more aggressive, okay?

2216
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:42,750
Duck,

2217
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,651
come up straight, and punch. Got it?

2218
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:46,880
Follow it up with a double hook, okay?

2219
01:25:46,881 --> 01:25:47,920
Breathe.

2220
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:50,321
(Round 2 strategy: Follow up with a double hook)

2221
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:53,461
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2222
01:25:56,231 --> 01:25:58,901
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.
- Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2223
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:01,770
Box.

2224
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:03,101
(Round 2 begins.)

2225
01:26:03,371 --> 01:26:04,500
(Dodging the hook)

2226
01:26:04,501 --> 01:26:05,641
That's it.

2227
01:26:05,701 --> 01:26:06,741
Block.

2228
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:09,241
(She dodges again and then throws a one-two.)

2229
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:11,070
Yes, go for it.

2230
01:26:11,071 --> 01:26:12,511
(Hooks keep raining in aggressively.)

2231
01:26:12,641 --> 01:26:13,641
Attack.

2232
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:16,951
(In Ah counters with an endless one-two combination.)

2233
01:26:17,081 --> 01:26:18,821
You're fighting well, In Ah. You're so cool.

2234
01:26:18,851 --> 01:26:19,881
- Nice.
- Jab.

2235
01:26:21,421 --> 01:26:22,450
- That's it.
- Jab.

2236
01:26:22,451 --> 01:26:23,451
(Hooks keep coming in relentlessly)

2237
01:26:23,452 --> 01:26:24,491
Guard up.

2238
01:26:24,521 --> 01:26:25,791
Keep going.

2239
01:26:26,891 --> 01:26:27,961
Don't stop.

2240
01:26:28,631 --> 01:26:29,961
Make the first move, In Ah.

2241
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:31,631
Move in.

2242
01:26:32,561 --> 01:26:33,961
Again.

2243
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:36,270
Try attacking twice.

2244
01:26:36,271 --> 01:26:37,530
(She needs to attack more aggressively.)

2245
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:38,971
That was so close.

2246
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:45,011
(The opponent keeps landing double hooks.)

2247
01:26:45,111 --> 01:26:46,441
You've got to move in even if you're tired, In Ah.

2248
01:26:46,811 --> 01:26:48,051
In Ah, you can do it.

2249
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:50,651
(She dodged the hook and countered with a straight.)

2250
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:52,651
(A double strike)

2251
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:53,781
- Yes.
- Yes.

2252
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:55,421
Well done.

2253
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:58,161
(Her powerful punch landed perfectly.)

2254
01:26:59,191 --> 01:27:00,621
(Stop)

2255
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:03,030
K.O.

2256
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:04,801
(Standing 8 count for the Blue Corner)

2257
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:13,741
You're so cool, Seol In Ah.

2258
01:27:14,471 --> 01:27:16,310
(Standing 8 count: If a boxer is judged...)

2259
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:18,480
(unable to continue safely, the referee counts...)

2260
01:27:18,481 --> 01:27:20,680
(from 1 to 8 to determine whether the match can go on.)

2261
01:27:20,681 --> 01:27:23,081
(Failure to recover within the count may result in a K.O.)

2262
01:27:23,411 --> 01:27:25,320
(After checking the boxer's condition,)

2263
01:27:25,321 --> 01:27:27,120
(the match resumes.)

2264
01:27:27,121 --> 01:27:28,191
Box.

2265
01:27:29,651 --> 01:27:30,720
A long reach.

2266
01:27:30,721 --> 01:27:31,790
Counter right away.

2267
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,260
That's it. Just like that.

2268
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:37,061
(Another flurry of punches)

2269
01:27:37,231 --> 01:27:39,760
(Two, one, two)

2270
01:27:39,761 --> 01:27:41,331
Yes, that's what a K.O. is.

2271
01:27:44,371 --> 01:27:46,941
(Even a powerful straight punch)

2272
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:49,441
Nice. One more time.

2273
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:51,040
Again.

2274
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:53,211
(The opponent's double hook)

2275
01:27:54,111 --> 01:27:55,380
Duck.

2276
01:27:55,381 --> 01:27:56,451
Attack.

2277
01:27:58,051 --> 01:27:59,051
Duck.

2278
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:01,320
(An intense showdown until the end)

2279
01:28:01,321 --> 01:28:02,551
Hurry, one more time.

2280
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:04,650
Stop.

2281
01:28:04,651 --> 01:28:06,261
(Round 2 ends.)

2282
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:10,931
(In Ah has completed all her rounds safely.)

2283
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:14,660
Well done.

2284
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:21,371
(All that's left is the judges' decision.)

2285
01:28:21,471 --> 01:28:24,040
Why is my heart pounding like crazy?

2286
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:26,541
The opponent's punches were pretty wide,

2287
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:28,981
so they did some damage to In Ah.

2288
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:30,750
But In Ah landed way more clean shots.

2289
01:28:30,751 --> 01:28:31,851
- You're right.
- Yes.

2290
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:35,050
The results are being tallied.

2291
01:28:35,051 --> 01:28:37,150
What will the final decision be?

2292
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,921
(Head referee)

2293
01:28:39,421 --> 01:28:42,690
(In Ah returns to the center of the ring for the decision.)

2294
01:28:42,691 --> 01:28:44,761
Please, In Ah.

2295
01:28:44,931 --> 01:28:46,400
Please, In Ah.

2296
01:28:46,401 --> 01:28:48,431
- Red.
- Red.

2297
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:50,501
Red. Please.

2298
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:52,200
Red.

2299
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:53,241
(A tense moment...)

2300
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:56,471
(as she waits for the decision after her very first fight)

2301
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:59,981
- Kim Min Jung!
- Kim Min Jung!

2302
01:29:00,211 --> 01:29:01,950
(A fierce cheering battle)

2303
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:03,611
They're from the opponent's gym.

2304
01:29:03,951 --> 01:29:05,620
- Seol In Ah!
- Seol In Ah!

2305
01:29:05,621 --> 01:29:07,221
(We can't lose the cheering battle.)

2306
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:11,221
(In Ah's parents)

2307
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:15,661
(With wide hooks, the Blue Corner attacked fiercely.)

2308
01:29:15,991 --> 01:29:20,461
(In Ah's precise strikes led to a standing 8 count.)

2309
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:25,271
(Who is the winner?)

2310
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:29,211
(The head referee has tallied all the scores.)

2311
01:29:29,571 --> 01:29:32,441
(What's the outcome of the Iron Girls' first match?)

2312
01:29:35,111 --> 01:29:41,921
(Seol In Ah wins.)

2313
01:29:43,151 --> 01:29:45,760
(Seol In Ah advances to the finals.)

2314
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:46,861
Thank you.

2315
01:29:47,621 --> 01:29:48,691
Thank you.

2316
01:29:48,761 --> 01:29:50,591
Thank you. Great work.

2317
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:55,231
(In Ah earned her first precious victory.)

2318
01:29:55,731 --> 01:29:56,831
(Screaming)

2319
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:01,240
(The members are in festive mode.)

2320
01:30:01,241 --> 01:30:03,071
She did an amazing job.

2321
01:30:03,211 --> 01:30:04,811
She was incredible.

2322
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:08,950
(Even In Ah's parents are touched.)

2323
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:10,511
You're the best.

2324
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:12,921
- You're the best. Let's go!
- Here.

2325
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:15,591
I won.

2326
01:30:15,621 --> 01:30:16,850
- Great job.
- Seriously.

2327
01:30:16,851 --> 01:30:18,290
- I can't believe it.
- Good job.

2328
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:19,460
- Well done.
- For real?

2329
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:20,620
You won.

2330
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:21,661
(Enjoying the victory outside the ring)

2331
01:30:21,831 --> 01:30:25,561
(An emotional hug with Coach Kim)

2332
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:28,730
(Amazed)

2333
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:30,001
This feels like a dream.

2334
01:30:31,971 --> 01:30:34,340
(People congratulate and cheer In Ah.)

2335
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:35,441
Great work.

2336
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:37,211
- Thank you.
- In Ah.

2337
01:30:37,871 --> 01:30:38,941
You were the best.

2338
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:42,950
(And those waiting for In Ah)

2339
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:45,321
In Ah, you did an incredible job.

2340
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:46,751
Coach.

2341
01:30:47,381 --> 01:30:49,651
- You did really well, In Ah.
- For real.

2342
01:30:49,751 --> 01:30:53,491
There were 2 to 3 close calls halfway through the match.

2343
01:30:53,591 --> 01:30:54,860
If you had kept getting cornered,

2344
01:30:54,861 --> 01:30:56,360
you would have left a bad impression on the referee.

2345
01:30:56,361 --> 01:30:58,260
But you countered with a flurry of punches.

2346
01:30:58,261 --> 01:31:00,330
- You made a flurry right away.
- I don't remember.

2347
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:01,770
- You were great, In Ah.
- A fighter.

2348
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:03,070
- In Ah.
- In Ah.

2349
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:04,200
You're a fighter.

2350
01:31:04,201 --> 01:31:05,941
- A fighter, In Ah.
- I should leave.

2351
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:07,401
The match was really fun.

2352
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:10,810
- People went wild, you know? Yes.
- Really?

2353
01:31:10,811 --> 01:31:12,110
What will you do about this thrill...

2354
01:31:12,111 --> 01:31:13,210
- from now on?
- This is so much fun.

2355
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:15,550
What are you going to do? Where will you find it now?

2356
01:31:15,551 --> 01:31:16,580
- It's so fun. Oh, my gosh.
- You can only experience it...

2357
01:31:16,581 --> 01:31:18,581
- in a tournament.
- It was so much fun.

2358
01:31:19,221 --> 01:31:20,880
My blood is boiling. This is crazy.

2359
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:22,420
I'm worried about what you'll do from now on.

2360
01:31:22,421 --> 01:31:23,421
While watching your match,

2361
01:31:23,422 --> 01:31:24,690
I thought, "She should continue boxing."

2362
01:31:24,691 --> 01:31:25,761
(Simba Seol has a fighter's blood.)

2363
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:28,891
(Meanwhile,)

2364
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:32,901
(the tournament continues.)

2365
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,201
Good luck. What matters is the momentum, Ju Hyun.

2366
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:39,100
- I'm off.
- Okay. Show them what you've got.

2367
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:40,171
- Good luck.
- Do as much as you practiced.

2368
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:42,410
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2369
01:31:42,411 --> 01:31:44,371
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2370
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:46,510
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.
- Good luck.

2371
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:48,241
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2372
01:31:49,311 --> 01:31:52,021
(Ju Hyun enters the venue.)

2373
01:31:52,051 --> 01:31:53,420
How do you feel right now?

2374
01:31:53,421 --> 01:31:55,221
- I'm okay. Yes.
- Really?

2375
01:31:55,951 --> 01:31:58,420
(After the attire check in the glove room)

2376
01:31:58,421 --> 01:31:59,861
- Any jewelry on you?
- No.

2377
01:32:01,021 --> 01:32:07,701
(Putting on the gear right away)

2378
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:09,271
How are you? All good?

2379
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:12,071
- If I'm losing, I'll keep going.
- That's Ju Hyun.

2380
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:14,440
- It's not, is it?
- I'm not nervous right now.

2381
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:15,641
(Ju Hyun waits calmly for her match.)

2382
01:32:15,871 --> 01:32:17,071
Where's our baby?

2383
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:19,341
(Looking around)

2384
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:21,040
Park Ju Hyun. Good luck, Gwang Bok.

2385
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:22,151
I love you.

2386
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:24,311
Trust your instinct.

2387
01:32:24,711 --> 01:32:27,421
(Feeling the support)

2388
01:32:28,181 --> 01:32:29,920
There's one match before yours.

2389
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,050
It's your turn right after it.

2390
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:32,391
(Ju Hyun's match is about to start.)

2391
01:32:32,821 --> 01:32:34,761
My opponent looks small.

2392
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:36,660
The one over there.

2393
01:32:36,661 --> 01:32:37,991
(The one over there.)

2394
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:39,161
I wonder...

2395
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:40,431
if she's good.

2396
01:32:42,601 --> 01:32:44,931
(Yang Seo Jeong, 30s, under 51kg)

2397
01:32:45,471 --> 01:32:49,211
(Boxing experience: 1 years and 6 months)

2398
01:32:49,971 --> 01:32:51,341
She looks like she'll do well.

2399
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,280
She looks really strong.

2400
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:54,740
- No.
- No.

2401
01:32:54,741 --> 01:32:55,881
Not at all.

2402
01:32:56,511 --> 01:32:57,950
Do it as you did before.

2403
01:32:57,951 --> 01:32:59,080
Remember what we practiced earlier?

2404
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:00,351
That alone is more than enough.

2405
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:05,921
(Ju Hyun, who is always calm, seems nervous today.)

2406
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:10,231
(However, to advance to the finals, she must beat the opponent.)

2407
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:14,161
(The front heat's match has ended.)

2408
01:33:14,901 --> 01:33:17,771
(It's time for Ju Hyun to enter the ring.)

2409
01:33:19,171 --> 01:33:20,171
Let's go.

2410
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:23,441
(Heading to the ring)

2411
01:33:23,811 --> 01:33:26,081
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.

2412
01:33:26,841 --> 01:33:30,651
Match 36 of the under-51kg division.

2413
01:33:31,081 --> 01:33:34,380
In the Red Corner, S Boxing School's Yang Seo Jeong.

2414
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:36,020
(Yang Seo Jeong versus Park Ju Hyun)

2415
01:33:36,021 --> 01:33:37,351
- In the Blue Corner, - Good luck.

2416
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:40,161
Iron Girls' Park Ju Hyun.

2417
01:33:43,161 --> 01:33:45,501
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.

2418
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:48,870
Let's go!

2419
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:49,931
(Ju Hyun's dad)

2420
01:33:50,201 --> 01:33:53,201
(Making eye contact with her dad who came to cheer her on)

2421
01:33:53,701 --> 01:33:57,071
(One last mental check)

2422
01:33:57,141 --> 01:33:59,481
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2423
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:01,481
No open blows.

2424
01:34:01,511 --> 01:34:02,511
Touch gloves.

2425
01:34:02,512 --> 01:34:03,550
(Touch gloves)

2426
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:04,610
To your corners.

2427
01:34:04,611 --> 01:34:06,321
(Back to their corners)

2428
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:09,520
Remember. Jab, feint, and attack when she moves in.

2429
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,950
- Box.
- Good luck, Yang Seo Jeong.

2430
01:34:10,951 --> 01:34:14,160
(Round 1 begins.)

2431
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:17,131
(Round 1, Under 51kg: Yang Seo Jeong versus Park Ju Hyun)

2432
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:18,960
(Feeling out in the early round)

2433
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:20,300
Here they go. But she should feel her out first.

2434
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:22,170
- Good, focus.
- A focused attack.

2435
01:34:22,171 --> 01:34:23,271
- Let's watch.
- Nice.

2436
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:25,170
Move around. That's it.

2437
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:26,871
- Punch. Hook.
- Yes.

2438
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:29,671
- She's fast.
- Good.

2439
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:35,950
Punch. That's it.

2440
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:37,411
- Keep going.
- Nice.

2441
01:34:39,151 --> 01:34:45,361
(Counterattacking even from the corner)

2442
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:47,890
- That's it. Good.
- Yes.

2443
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,631
(Ju Hyun was able to get out smoothly.)

2444
01:34:50,361 --> 01:34:51,491
- You're so cool.
- Feel her out.

2445
01:34:51,591 --> 01:34:53,500
- Throw a feint. That's it.
- You're amazing.

2446
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:55,301
Again. Here she comes. Keep your eyes on her.

2447
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:01,570
(The opponent keeps pressing forward)

2448
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,340
Move around. Punch.

2449
01:35:03,341 --> 01:35:05,011
- That's it.
- Good luck, Yang Seo Jeong.

2450
01:35:05,381 --> 01:35:07,210
- Good luck.
- Attack.

2451
01:35:07,211 --> 01:35:09,051
- Move in.
- Step in.

2452
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:11,480
Punch. That's it. She'll attack you again.

2453
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:13,551
- Watch closely. Punch. Again.
- Yes.

2454
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:15,251
Keep up the strikes. Yes. Do that again.

2455
01:35:16,021 --> 01:35:17,090
(Hitting and retreating calmly)

2456
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:19,661
That's it. You're doing well. Keep it up.

2457
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:21,020
Here she comes.

2458
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:22,360
(Remaining time: 30 seconds)

2459
01:35:22,361 --> 01:35:24,991
Punch. Well done. Keep going.

2460
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:27,561
- Yes, nice.
- Good.

2461
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:32,371
(Ju Hyun's left hook)

2462
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:35,311
One more time.

2463
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:43,251
(Striking and retreating to draw the opponent's attack)

2464
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:45,981
She's going to attack. Quick. Well done.

2465
01:35:46,151 --> 01:35:48,721
That's it. Good. Yes.

2466
01:35:51,321 --> 01:35:53,421
(Her right hook lands perfectly.)

2467
01:35:53,621 --> 01:35:55,791
(Staggering)

2468
01:35:57,091 --> 01:35:59,330
Nice. Keep going. Hurry.

2469
01:35:59,331 --> 01:36:01,731
Yes, don't stop.

2470
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:05,000
Go. Press forward.

2471
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:07,300
(One, two, one, two)

2472
01:36:07,301 --> 01:36:08,301
(Through the guard)

2473
01:36:08,302 --> 01:36:10,010
(One, two, one, two)

2474
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:12,741
- You can do it.
- Good luck.

2475
01:36:12,941 --> 01:36:15,751
Ju Hyun almost got in. Just a bit more.

2476
01:36:16,481 --> 01:36:19,181
Hurry up and press forward. Come on. That's it.

2477
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:21,920
One more time. Good.

2478
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:24,951
(Round 1 ends.)

2479
01:36:25,091 --> 01:36:26,721
- Stop.
- That was great.

2480
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:31,430
Because of the last attack, she won Round One.

2481
01:36:31,431 --> 01:36:32,761
Ju Hyun won Round One.

2482
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:36,000
Ju Hyun knows what a standing K.O. is.

2483
01:36:36,001 --> 01:36:37,901
She cornered the opponent.

2484
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:39,201
- She cornered the opponent.
- Immediately.

2485
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:41,101
Well done.

2486
01:36:42,541 --> 01:36:44,210
- It's not bad.
- Right?

2487
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:45,411
- I told you.
- I can do it.

2488
01:36:46,281 --> 01:36:47,540
She's out of energy.

2489
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:48,681
- You noticed, right?
- Yes.

2490
01:36:48,711 --> 01:36:50,281
You could've knocked her out.

2491
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:52,550
Try and attack her even more, okay?

2492
01:36:52,551 --> 01:36:54,950
You're calm and doing well. That's how you should fight, okay?

2493
01:36:54,951 --> 01:36:56,791
- Use your lead hand, got it?
- Good luck.

2494
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,821
(The Red Corner discusses their strategy.)

2495
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:01,761
With how things are right now...

2496
01:37:01,861 --> 01:37:03,460
(Whispering)

2497
01:37:03,461 --> 01:37:05,601
(Their strategy meeting is behind closed doors.)

2498
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:07,531
- Stronger, okay?
- Okay.

2499
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:09,171
You can do it.

2500
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,871
You're doing well. Drink some water.

2501
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:14,841
Use your lead hand, got it?

2502
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:16,611
Use your lead hand, but watch her rear hand.

2503
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:19,880
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2504
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,711
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

2505
01:37:22,251 --> 01:37:23,281
- Box.
- Good luck.

2506
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:26,680
(Round 2 begins.)

2507
01:37:26,681 --> 01:37:29,251
(Round 2, Under 51kg: Yang Seo Jeong versus Park Ju Hyun)

2508
01:37:30,221 --> 01:37:31,491
Attack her.

2509
01:37:31,891 --> 01:37:33,760
Fight a bit more aggressively.

2510
01:37:33,761 --> 01:37:34,921
Try to take the lead.

2511
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:38,761
- Good luck.
- Move in. That's it.

2512
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,431
All the way.

2513
01:37:40,661 --> 01:37:42,271
Pivot out. Punch her.

2514
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:44,171
That's it. Yes.

2515
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:46,141
Yes! Keep going.

2516
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:49,741
(Sprinting to the other side of the ring)

2517
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:53,141
(Valid strike)

2518
01:37:53,281 --> 01:37:54,641
Great.

2519
01:37:55,241 --> 01:37:56,511
She's tough.

2520
01:37:57,011 --> 01:37:58,980
(The venue is going wild...)

2521
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:00,621
(at her relentless attack.)

2522
01:38:00,821 --> 01:38:02,791
Well done. She hit the opponent countless times.

2523
01:38:02,991 --> 01:38:04,521
Pivot. That's it.

2524
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:06,091
Pivot, Ju Hyun. Nice.

2525
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:10,590
(The slugfest continues.)

2526
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:12,961
- Good luck.
- Yes. Well done.

2527
01:38:14,061 --> 01:38:15,131
Nice.

2528
01:38:15,161 --> 01:38:16,800
(The opponent attacks Ju Hyun.)

2529
01:38:16,801 --> 01:38:18,631
- Good luck.
- You can do it.

2530
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:21,400
(A jab,)

2531
01:38:21,401 --> 01:38:22,971
(followed by a right hook)

2532
01:38:24,341 --> 01:38:26,381
(Finishing off with a left hook)

2533
01:38:27,841 --> 01:38:29,780
(Throwing a series of jabs)

2534
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:30,851
You can do it, Ju Hyun.

2535
01:38:31,881 --> 01:38:34,220
Throw consecutive punches. Good. You're doing well.

2536
01:38:34,221 --> 01:38:35,890
(Both boxers keep their distance, looking for an opening.)

2537
01:38:35,891 --> 01:38:38,091
- Good.
- You can do it.

2538
01:38:38,551 --> 01:38:40,790
That's it. Right away. Yes.

2539
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,431
Ju Hyun's grit is insane.

2540
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:44,260
Pivot.

2541
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:46,301
- Attack her.
- That's it. Pivot.

2542
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:47,960
Good luck.

2543
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:50,901
(Both boxers hold back, wary of each other's powerful punches.)

2544
01:38:51,231 --> 01:38:52,371
Another attack,

2545
01:38:52,541 --> 01:38:54,101
- She's waiting for a straight.
- and she'll win.

2546
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:57,170
Punch. That's it. Keep going.

2547
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:59,341
Yes. That's what I'm talking about. One more time.

2548
01:38:59,781 --> 01:39:00,841
You can do it.

2549
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:03,281
- Try again.
- Good luck.

2550
01:39:03,411 --> 01:39:05,481
Block her. That's it.

2551
01:39:08,121 --> 01:39:10,821
(Her straight lands perfectly.)

2552
01:39:14,461 --> 01:39:16,430
- Nice. Good job.
- Yes.

2553
01:39:16,431 --> 01:39:18,491
(After cornering her opponent, Ju Hyun unleashes a flurry.)

2554
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:20,430
That's it. Yes.

2555
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:22,060
The opponent is tired.

2556
01:39:22,061 --> 01:39:23,730
- Ten seconds.
- Well done.

2557
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:25,300
- Ten seconds, Park Ju Hyun.
- Yes.

2558
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:26,301
Keep going.

2559
01:39:26,371 --> 01:39:28,601
(Both boxers keep fighting until the end.)

2560
01:39:29,741 --> 01:39:32,481
(They trade valid strikes in a clinch until the last moment.)

2561
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,081
Stop.

2562
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:37,980
(Round 2 ends.)

2563
01:39:37,981 --> 01:39:39,481
Great work.

2564
01:39:39,981 --> 01:39:41,021
Well done.

2565
01:39:42,651 --> 01:39:44,521
Good job.

2566
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:46,291
You're good.

2567
01:39:46,961 --> 01:39:49,560
(Feeling proud)

2568
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:50,790
Great job.

2569
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,361
- She won.
- Yes, she won.

2570
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:56,200
(Ju Hyun went all out and delivered a great match.)

2571
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:58,301
Well done. I told you.

2572
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:06,581
(Returning to the center of the ring for the decision)

2573
01:40:06,841 --> 01:40:09,610
I think Ju Hyun won the match.

2574
01:40:09,611 --> 01:40:10,980
- Me too.
- Please.

2575
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:12,110
I think she won.

2576
01:40:12,111 --> 01:40:13,451
The opponent took more hits.

2577
01:40:13,551 --> 01:40:16,051
Anyone can see the opponent almost got knocked out.

2578
01:40:16,151 --> 01:40:17,420
- She won.
- She won for sure.

2579
01:40:17,421 --> 01:40:19,160
How Ju Hyun cornered her from the Blue Corner...

2580
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:20,691
- to the Red Corner was impressive.
- I agree.

2581
01:40:21,591 --> 01:40:24,531
(From one side of the ring to the other)

2582
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:29,101
(She cornered her opponent and attacked like a bulldozer.)

2583
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:34,901
(Did Ju Hyun win after firing up the crowd?)

2584
01:40:35,301 --> 01:40:37,611
The opponent might earn big points for her proactiveness.

2585
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:40,911
Although she didn't land many punches,

2586
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:42,750
the opponent cornered Ju Hyun.

2587
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,481
(The opponent didn't stop attacking.)

2588
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:46,150
That must have earned her major points.

2589
01:40:46,151 --> 01:40:47,181
(Did the opponent win?)

2590
01:40:47,381 --> 01:40:49,521
Please give points to Ju Hyun.

2591
01:40:49,851 --> 01:40:50,991
Please.

2592
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:54,690
(Everyone is eagerly waiting.)

2593
01:40:54,691 --> 01:40:55,861
Please.

2594
01:40:56,191 --> 01:40:57,730
Please, Ju Hyun.

2595
01:40:57,731 --> 01:41:02,701
(What's the outcome of this match?)

2596
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:14,711
(Park Ju Hyun wins.)

2597
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:22,691
I knew it. She won.

2598
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:25,561
Exactly. I approve. She won.

2599
01:41:26,261 --> 01:41:27,760
(Gwang Bok's dad is happy that his daughter won.)

2600
01:41:27,761 --> 01:41:29,561
(My daughter is the best.)

2601
01:41:29,761 --> 01:41:31,531
(Greatly touched)

2602
01:41:32,601 --> 01:41:33,601
(Park Ju Hyun advances to the finals.)

2603
01:41:33,602 --> 01:41:36,101
Well done.

2604
01:41:39,141 --> 01:41:40,271
I'm tired.

2605
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:44,070
You did perfectly.

2606
01:41:44,071 --> 01:41:45,241
You did it.

2607
01:41:46,011 --> 01:41:47,380
(The crowd applauds Ju Hyun.)

2608
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:50,080
I was lucky.

2609
01:41:50,081 --> 01:41:51,281
(The crowd applauds Ju Hyun.)

2610
01:41:51,711 --> 01:41:52,821
Thank you.

2611
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:55,590
I won because you guys cheered me on.

2612
01:41:55,591 --> 01:41:56,921
(The students next to them)

2613
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:00,090
(Reuniting with her beloved members)

2614
01:42:00,091 --> 01:42:02,091
- Ju Hyun.
- You did really well.

2615
01:42:02,361 --> 01:42:04,090
- Good job.
- Ju Hyun.

2616
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:05,290
- Well done.
- Good job.

2617
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:07,260
- It was exhausting.
- Great job.

2618
01:42:07,261 --> 01:42:08,901
The opponent had good stamina.

2619
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:11,770
Both of you are amazing.

2620
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:14,441
- You two are fighters.
- It was so much fun.

2621
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:16,510
To think three months could change you so much,

2622
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:17,811
when you used to dodge punches.

2623
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:20,411
- Wasn't it fun?
- I was lucky.

2624
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:23,911
(The tournament continues.)

2625
01:42:24,711 --> 01:42:25,851
That's it.

2626
01:42:26,251 --> 01:42:29,051
(Sae Rok's turn is approaching.)

2627
01:42:29,221 --> 01:42:30,991
Okay. Let's go, Sae Rok.

2628
01:42:31,621 --> 01:42:34,261
Sae Rok, if the opponent throws 2 punches, counter with 4.

2629
01:42:34,721 --> 01:42:36,231
Throw plenty of straight punches.

2630
01:42:36,561 --> 01:42:37,691
My Rocky Keum.

2631
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:40,761
The symbol of luck.

2632
01:42:41,031 --> 01:42:42,870
You don't have to aim at the opponent's face.

2633
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,100
- Just extend your punch, - Okay.

2634
01:42:44,101 --> 01:42:45,701
- and it'll land here.
- Got it.

2635
01:42:45,841 --> 01:42:47,871
- You're the symbol of luck.
- Trust yourself.

2636
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:49,010
- I'm off.
- Stretch out,

2637
01:42:49,011 --> 01:42:50,011
and you'll punch the opponent.

2638
01:42:50,012 --> 01:42:51,071
You'll do well.

2639
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:52,680
Good luck, Keum Sae Rok.

2640
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:54,111
Good luck.

2641
01:42:54,681 --> 01:42:57,511
(Being cheered on by the crowd...)

2642
01:42:58,081 --> 01:43:00,281
(makes the match feel more real.)

2643
01:43:00,451 --> 01:43:02,051
- I feel weak.
- You do?

2644
01:43:03,221 --> 01:43:06,521
It's just nerves. You'll be fine once you step into the ring.

2645
01:43:06,661 --> 01:43:07,760
There's no need to be nervous.

2646
01:43:07,761 --> 01:43:10,461
(The coaches help Sae Rok relax.)

2647
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:13,131
(But her face stiffens from nervousness.)

2648
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:14,501
Show him your hands.

2649
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:17,031
No jewelry on you, right?

2650
01:43:17,271 --> 01:43:18,470
You've got your pads on, right?

2651
01:43:18,471 --> 01:43:19,671
- I'm in your care.
- Same here.

2652
01:43:21,971 --> 01:43:24,211
- I'm in your care.
- Hey. Same here.

2653
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:25,711
We're in your care.

2654
01:43:27,941 --> 01:43:29,380
Sae Rok's opponent.

2655
01:43:29,381 --> 01:43:30,381
(Kim Bo Min, 30s, under 54kg)

2656
01:43:30,382 --> 01:43:31,681
- She's someone new.
- Yes.

2657
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:35,281
(Boxing experience: 1 year)

2658
01:43:35,551 --> 01:43:37,491
I know it won't happen,

2659
01:43:38,391 --> 01:43:40,390
- but I can't help but feel anxious.
- She can do it.

2660
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:42,431
I have faith in Sae Rok. She will win.

2661
01:43:42,761 --> 01:43:44,130
(How is Sae Rok doing?)

2662
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:45,260
She can do it.

2663
01:43:45,261 --> 01:43:46,401
I have faith in her too.

2664
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:50,271
It's mine. I can do it.

2665
01:43:51,271 --> 01:43:53,041
Let's have fun.

2666
01:43:53,371 --> 01:43:55,541
- I can do it.
- You'll do well.

2667
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,110
I'm an Iron Girl.

2668
01:43:57,111 --> 01:43:58,170
Of course.

2669
01:43:58,171 --> 01:43:59,941
- It's up to my spirit.
- Stick to your routine.

2670
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:04,011
(Meanwhile, the front heat's match has ended.)

2671
01:44:04,751 --> 01:44:06,020
(It's time to show what she has practiced.)

2672
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:07,320
That should be enough.

2673
01:44:07,321 --> 01:44:08,380
(It's time to show what she has practiced.)

2674
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:09,950
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2675
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:12,521
- Keum Sae Rok, let's go!
- Keum Sae Rok, let's go!

2676
01:44:12,761 --> 01:44:15,421
(Afte receiving the members' support,)

2677
01:44:15,731 --> 01:44:16,930
(Sae Rok enters the ring.)

2678
01:44:16,931 --> 01:44:18,460
- I can do it.
- This is...

2679
01:44:18,461 --> 01:44:22,030
Match 41 of the under-54 division.

2680
01:44:22,031 --> 01:44:25,370
In the Red Corner, Iron Girls' Keum Sae Rok.

2681
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:26,471
(Iron Girls' last boxer enters.)

2682
01:44:26,671 --> 01:44:28,770
(If Sae Rok wins, everyone will enter the finals.)

2683
01:44:28,771 --> 01:44:31,870
In the Blue Corner, Star Boxing's Kim Bo Min.

2684
01:44:31,871 --> 01:44:33,981
(However, the opponent has a lot of boxing experience.)

2685
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:37,110
(Iron Girls' last match in the preliminaries)

2686
01:44:37,111 --> 01:44:38,980
As soon as you hear the bell, put your guard up.

2687
01:44:38,981 --> 01:44:40,521
Do as you've always done, okay?

2688
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:42,921
- You're better than you think.
- Okay.

2689
01:44:43,291 --> 01:44:45,050
- Let's do this.
- Yes. It's okay.

2690
01:44:45,051 --> 01:44:46,060
Do as you've always done.

2691
01:44:46,061 --> 01:44:47,790
Keum Sae Rok, let's go!

2692
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:49,061
Let's go!

2693
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:52,530
(The boxers come to the center.)

2694
01:44:52,531 --> 01:44:53,700
Watch your head.

2695
01:44:53,701 --> 01:44:54,800
Watch out for the open blows.

2696
01:44:54,801 --> 01:44:55,870
Don't punch below the belt, okay?

2697
01:44:55,871 --> 01:44:57,130
- Don't hit the back of the head.
- Okay.

2698
01:44:57,131 --> 01:44:58,131
Touch gloves.

2699
01:45:02,101 --> 01:45:03,140
(Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Bo Min)

2700
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:05,910
(Round 1 begins.)

2701
01:45:05,911 --> 01:45:06,940
Box.

2702
01:45:06,941 --> 01:45:10,851
(Round 1, Under 54kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Bo Min)

2703
01:45:11,551 --> 01:45:13,681
(Her opponent attacks first.)

2704
01:45:13,781 --> 01:45:16,521
(Sae Rok turns right away.)

2705
01:45:16,821 --> 01:45:18,150
Let's go. There you go.

2706
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:19,620
(A slugfest begins.)

2707
01:45:19,621 --> 01:45:22,091
Keep going.

2708
01:45:23,161 --> 01:45:25,160
(Sae Rok's straight punch)

2709
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:27,001
There you go. Keep going.

2710
01:45:27,361 --> 01:45:28,760
You can do it!

2711
01:45:28,761 --> 01:45:30,201
(The opponent's body shot and hook)

2712
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:32,701
- There you go.
- That's good.

2713
01:45:32,741 --> 01:45:33,940
Turn.

2714
01:45:33,941 --> 01:45:35,241
(Sae Rok's one-two punches follow.)

2715
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:37,341
There you go.

2716
01:45:37,741 --> 01:45:39,311
- You've become relaxed.
- You can do it.

2717
01:45:39,341 --> 01:45:41,081
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

2718
01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:46,621
(Sae Rok's one-two punches versus the opponent's body attacks)

2719
01:45:53,191 --> 01:45:54,790
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2720
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:55,791
Keum Sae Rok!

2721
01:45:55,792 --> 01:45:56,990
(Again, it's Sae Rok's one-two versus the opponent's body shot)

2722
01:45:56,991 --> 01:45:58,961
There you go. That's good.

2723
01:46:01,301 --> 01:46:03,970
(The opponent's valid strikes: 1, Sae Rok's valid strikes: 2)

2724
01:46:03,971 --> 01:46:05,171
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 3)

2725
01:46:10,671 --> 01:46:12,071
Come on. There you go.

2726
01:46:13,011 --> 01:46:14,280
(The opponent's body shot)

2727
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:16,650
(Sae Rok's straight)

2728
01:46:16,651 --> 01:46:17,711
Throw a punch.

2729
01:46:17,751 --> 01:46:18,951
Throw a punch.

2730
01:46:19,551 --> 01:46:20,621
Throw a punch.

2731
01:46:22,621 --> 01:46:23,920
- You can go in there.
- Throw a punch.

2732
01:46:23,921 --> 01:46:24,991
The opponent can't get closer.

2733
01:46:25,121 --> 01:46:26,220
- Punch.
- There you go.

2734
01:46:26,221 --> 01:46:27,361
Until the end.

2735
01:46:27,491 --> 01:46:28,791
- Turn.
- Until the end.

2736
01:46:29,161 --> 01:46:30,491
- Throw a punch.
- Pivot.

2737
01:46:31,961 --> 01:46:33,030
There you go. Pivot.

2738
01:46:33,031 --> 01:46:34,301
(Sae Rok pivots as she attacks.)

2739
01:46:40,271 --> 01:46:42,001
There you go.

2740
01:46:42,741 --> 01:46:45,010
(After a jab)

2741
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:46,080
That's how you do it.

2742
01:46:46,081 --> 01:46:47,341
- There you go.
- Keep going.

2743
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:49,310
Keep punching.

2744
01:46:49,311 --> 01:46:50,351
One more punch.

2745
01:46:50,511 --> 01:46:51,580
(Remaining time: 10 seconds)

2746
01:46:51,581 --> 01:46:53,250
- Keep punching.
- Ten seconds!

2747
01:46:53,251 --> 01:46:55,851
(They attack at the same time.)

2748
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:02,091
- Time!
- There you go.

2749
01:47:02,491 --> 01:47:05,291
(Round 1 ends.)

2750
01:47:07,301 --> 01:47:08,301
Sit.

2751
01:47:08,302 --> 01:47:09,471
In Round One,

2752
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:12,101
I think she won with a score of 6 to 4.

2753
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:14,470
- Really? Thank goodness.
- Yes.

2754
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:16,771
- Sae Rok has more valid strikes.
- That's right.

2755
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:20,711
Your opponent only has one attacking pattern.

2756
01:47:20,841 --> 01:47:22,180
If you throw a two, it'll land.

2757
01:47:22,181 --> 01:47:23,351
Why aren't you doing it?

2758
01:47:23,711 --> 01:47:25,450
Throw a two and a hook, okay?

2759
01:47:25,451 --> 01:47:27,780
Also, don't get cornered or try to attack at the same time.

2760
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:30,551
Then you'll get sucked into her pace. Stick to your pace.

2761
01:47:31,521 --> 01:47:32,920
You can corner her more.

2762
01:47:32,921 --> 01:47:34,621
- Corner her if you want to win.
- Okay.

2763
01:47:36,161 --> 01:47:37,460
Corner her if you want to win.

2764
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:39,760
(The opponent's strategy is to press her more.)

2765
01:47:39,761 --> 01:47:40,831
Okay?

2766
01:47:41,331 --> 01:47:44,170
(It's the last round for advancing to the finals.)

2767
01:47:44,171 --> 01:47:45,301
Keum Sae Rok, good luck.

2768
01:47:45,401 --> 01:47:47,040
(She needs to pour her everything into the match.)

2769
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,840
- Keum Sae Rok, good luck!
- You can do it.

2770
01:47:49,841 --> 01:47:50,870
Round Two.

2771
01:47:50,871 --> 01:47:51,910
(Round 2 begins.)

2772
01:47:51,911 --> 01:47:52,911
Box.

2773
01:47:53,581 --> 01:47:56,510
(The last round that'll determine the result)

2774
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:59,620
(Round 2, Under 54kg: Keum Sae Rok versus Kim Bo Min)

2775
01:47:59,621 --> 01:48:00,721
There you go.

2776
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:02,381
Punch. There you go. Yes.

2777
01:48:02,721 --> 01:48:03,821
Good.

2778
01:48:04,091 --> 01:48:05,890
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 1)

2779
01:48:05,891 --> 01:48:08,890
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 2)

2780
01:48:08,891 --> 01:48:10,590
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 3, The opponent's valid strikes: 1)

2781
01:48:10,591 --> 01:48:12,390
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 4, The opponent's valid strikes: 1)

2782
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:14,831
(Sae Rok's valid strikes: 4, The opponent's valid strikes: 2)

2783
01:48:15,131 --> 01:48:16,501
Keep going.

2784
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:19,400
(The opponent focuses on the body.)

2785
01:48:19,401 --> 01:48:21,071
Keep going.

2786
01:48:21,271 --> 01:48:22,570
(However, Sae Rok defends with her long reach.)

2787
01:48:22,571 --> 01:48:24,341
- Keep going.
- Try again.

2788
01:48:24,471 --> 01:48:25,641
Keep going.

2789
01:48:25,941 --> 01:48:27,280
There you go. One more. Do it now.

2790
01:48:27,281 --> 01:48:29,011
(She does the one-two.)

2791
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:32,350
(Sae Rok does the one-two without stopping.)

2792
01:48:32,351 --> 01:48:33,721
There you go. That's good.

2793
01:48:40,021 --> 01:48:41,091
Do it again.

2794
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:42,121
There you go.

2795
01:48:44,061 --> 01:48:46,600
(The jab landed well.)

2796
01:48:46,601 --> 01:48:48,601
(Staggering)

2797
01:48:51,571 --> 01:48:54,371
(It's Sae Rok's chance to finish off the opponent.)

2798
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:56,670
There you go. Again.

2799
01:48:56,671 --> 01:48:59,041
- What are you doing?
- Why did you stop?

2800
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:00,310
Why did you wait?

2801
01:49:00,311 --> 01:49:01,940
Sae Rok, why did you wait?

2802
01:49:01,941 --> 01:49:03,850
- Keep going!
- Sae Rok, why did you wait?

2803
01:49:03,851 --> 01:49:06,721
(Meanwhile, the opponent recovers.)

2804
01:49:07,281 --> 01:49:10,020
(She pushes Sae Rok to a corner.)

2805
01:49:10,021 --> 01:49:11,151
Yes. That's it.

2806
01:49:11,651 --> 01:49:13,290
Pivot. There you go.

2807
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:14,460
She dodged well.

2808
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:15,690
That's good. She dodged all the attacks.

2809
01:49:15,691 --> 01:49:16,891
She dodged all the attacks. She didn't get hit.

2810
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:19,261
That's it. She didn't get it.

2811
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:20,430
Now is the time.

2812
01:49:20,431 --> 01:49:21,431
(Time passes without more attacks.)

2813
01:49:21,432 --> 01:49:22,930
Footwork.

2814
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:24,370
- Go in there!
- Go in there!

2815
01:49:24,371 --> 01:49:25,730
- Go!
- Go!

2816
01:49:25,731 --> 01:49:27,941
- Don't rest!
- The opponent is recovering!

2817
01:49:33,381 --> 01:49:35,941
(Sae Rok keeps trying the one-two.)

2818
01:49:36,981 --> 01:49:37,981
Keep punching.

2819
01:49:37,982 --> 01:49:39,180
(But the wait drags on again.)

2820
01:49:39,181 --> 01:49:40,251
Keep punching.

2821
01:49:42,581 --> 01:49:44,591
Don't rest. Not much time remains.

2822
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:47,721
There you go. That's it.

2823
01:49:47,791 --> 01:49:49,021
Keep punching hard.

2824
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:52,260
(Sae Rok's last one-two)

2825
01:49:52,261 --> 01:49:53,330
That's it.

2826
01:49:53,331 --> 01:49:54,530
(Sae Rok's last one-two)

2827
01:49:54,531 --> 01:49:55,901
That's it.

2828
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:57,700
Ten seconds!

2829
01:49:57,701 --> 01:50:00,340
- Ten seconds! That's it!
- Ten seconds!

2830
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:02,100
- Corner her!
- Ten seconds!

2831
01:50:02,101 --> 01:50:04,040
- Pressure her!
- That's it.

2832
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:05,240
Push.

2833
01:50:05,241 --> 01:50:07,040
Push.

2834
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:08,411
(Fierce struggle)

2835
01:50:09,711 --> 01:50:10,811
Stop.

2836
01:50:11,911 --> 01:50:14,251
(The match ends with Sae Rok's valid strike)

2837
01:50:14,281 --> 01:50:16,791
(Round 2 ends.)

2838
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:18,390
Did you give it your all?

2839
01:50:18,391 --> 01:50:19,460
Gosh, I lost.

2840
01:50:19,461 --> 01:50:20,561
Your punches landed.

2841
01:50:21,721 --> 01:50:24,031
(The opponent seems to be disappointed.)

2842
01:50:24,291 --> 01:50:28,301
(Sae Rok poured out her energy.)

2843
01:50:29,731 --> 01:50:32,301
- Keum Sae Rok, you did well!
- Keum Sae Rok, you did well!

2844
01:50:33,241 --> 01:50:34,900
(Only the result remains.)

2845
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:35,901
Attention.

2846
01:50:36,671 --> 01:50:37,710
Your hands.

2847
01:50:37,711 --> 01:50:42,881
(The two boxers gave the match all their might.)

2848
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:45,711
(They wait for the result nervously.)

2849
01:50:46,051 --> 01:50:48,681
(The referees tallies the scores carefully.)

2850
01:50:48,951 --> 01:50:51,720
(It's the most nerve-racking moment.)

2851
01:50:51,721 --> 01:50:52,721
Keum Sae Rok!

2852
01:50:52,722 --> 01:50:54,761
(This time, the cheer captain leads...)

2853
01:50:54,861 --> 01:50:56,991
(the match of cheers.)

2854
01:50:57,231 --> 01:50:59,391
(Will it be the opponent who pressed Sae Rok fiercely?)

2855
01:50:59,431 --> 01:51:01,630
(Will it be Sae Rok who threw one-two punches?)

2856
01:51:01,631 --> 01:51:03,570
- Kim Bo Min, let's go!
- Let's go!

2857
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:05,731
- Keum Sae Rok, let's go!
- Let's go!

2858
01:51:06,001 --> 01:51:07,901
(The two boxers' match was fierce.)

2859
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:11,541
(Who will be the winner of this match?)

2860
01:51:14,281 --> 01:51:21,321
(Keum Sae Rok wins.)

2861
01:51:23,791 --> 01:51:26,161
(Moved)

2862
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:31,961
(Keum Sae Rok advances to the finals.)

2863
01:51:33,431 --> 01:51:34,461
Thank you.

2864
01:51:40,371 --> 01:51:41,700
Sae Rok, you did well.

2865
01:51:41,701 --> 01:51:42,840
You ran out of stamina.

2866
01:51:42,841 --> 01:51:44,671
(Sae Rok, you did well.)

2867
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:46,041
You won.

2868
01:51:46,141 --> 01:51:49,381
(Sae Rok shows a big smile after coming down.)

2869
01:51:49,711 --> 01:51:50,850
She did so well.

2870
01:51:50,851 --> 01:51:52,451
(How about the people who cheered for her?)

2871
01:51:52,851 --> 01:51:53,950
(Crying)

2872
01:51:53,951 --> 01:51:55,881
Seriously. She did so well.

2873
01:51:56,421 --> 01:51:59,051
(Totally moved)

2874
01:51:59,091 --> 01:52:00,291
She did so well.

2875
01:52:01,191 --> 01:52:02,861
Why are you crying?

2876
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:06,561
Coach Ji Hoon is coaching her right away.

2877
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:09,200
Didn't you see your opponent stagger?

2878
01:52:09,201 --> 01:52:10,930
- I didn't know.
- With another punch,

2879
01:52:10,931 --> 01:52:12,631
she would've gone down.

2880
01:52:13,371 --> 01:52:14,840
Let's do more training for stamina.

2881
01:52:14,841 --> 01:52:16,611
(Let's do more training for stamina!)

2882
01:52:17,371 --> 01:52:18,570
- It's over.
- It's over.

2883
01:52:18,571 --> 01:52:20,411
- Everyone won.
- Everyone won.

2884
01:52:21,111 --> 01:52:23,151
(Iron Girls meet again.)

2885
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:27,081
Why are you crying?

2886
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:28,521
Why are you crying?

2887
01:52:29,791 --> 01:52:31,320
Why are you crying?

2888
01:52:31,321 --> 01:52:32,520
Seriously.

2889
01:52:32,521 --> 01:52:33,661
(The members were as nervous as Sae Rok.)

2890
01:52:34,191 --> 01:52:36,260
(Relieved that everyone has advanced to the finals,)

2891
01:52:36,261 --> 01:52:37,890
Seriously, I...

2892
01:52:37,891 --> 01:52:39,391
(they become emotional.)

2893
01:52:39,631 --> 01:52:42,031
You won!

2894
01:52:42,161 --> 01:52:44,030
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Seriously.

2895
01:52:44,031 --> 01:52:45,801
Let's hug the coach. Let's do a group hug.

2896
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:47,641
We won!

2897
01:52:47,971 --> 01:52:49,200
(Congratulations.)

2898
01:52:49,201 --> 01:52:51,010
(All members of Iron Girls advanced to the finals.)

2899
01:52:51,011 --> 01:52:52,910
Seriously, you did so well.

2900
01:52:52,911 --> 01:52:54,580
- All of us did it.
- Seriously.

2901
01:52:54,581 --> 01:52:56,211
This is unbelievable.

2902
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:57,680
This is unbelievable!

2903
01:52:57,681 --> 01:52:59,580
Coach has sweated so much.

2904
01:52:59,581 --> 01:53:00,581
I was nervous.

2905
01:53:00,582 --> 01:53:02,821
A round of applause for Coach Ji Hoon.

2906
01:53:02,951 --> 01:53:04,450
We should throw him in the air.

2907
01:53:04,451 --> 01:53:05,791
- No.
- He's heavy.

2908
01:53:06,221 --> 01:53:07,291
You know,

2909
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:09,890
everyone did an amazing job.

2910
01:53:09,891 --> 01:53:11,790
- This is unbelievable!
- We have the future.

2911
01:53:11,791 --> 01:53:13,301
We have the future.

2912
01:53:13,461 --> 01:53:14,701
Thank you for your hard work.

2913
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:16,131
Sae Rok, thank you for your hard work.

2914
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:18,371
I can't believe it. What's up with Iron Girls?

2915
01:53:18,731 --> 01:53:19,871
This is unbelievable!

2916
01:53:19,941 --> 01:53:21,370
The boxers must be exhausted.

2917
01:53:21,371 --> 01:53:22,440
They have a match tomorrow.

2918
01:53:22,441 --> 01:53:23,441
Let's talk...

2919
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:24,441
- Let's go.
- as we rest in the waiting room.

2920
01:53:24,442 --> 01:53:25,571
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2921
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:26,710
We won!

2922
01:53:26,711 --> 01:53:28,310
I can't believe it.

2923
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:29,440
Boxing is so much fun.

2924
01:53:29,441 --> 01:53:30,510
It's unbelievable.

2925
01:53:30,511 --> 01:53:32,181
- It's unbelievable.
- It's so much fun.

2926
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:33,920
Did you foresee this result?

2927
01:53:33,921 --> 01:53:35,120
Oh, my gosh. It was this hand.

2928
01:53:35,121 --> 01:53:36,221
I won't wash this hand.

2929
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:38,290
It was this hand for me.

2930
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:39,590
- It was this hand for me too.
- To be honest, I prayed a lot.

2931
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:41,290
I thought I had taken a lot of punches.

2932
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,990
But I hoped that my opponent took my punches...

2933
01:53:42,991 --> 01:53:44,730
and prayed, "Please raise my hand."

2934
01:53:44,731 --> 01:53:45,830
"Please raise my hand."

2935
01:53:45,831 --> 01:53:48,100
Seriously. At the front,

2936
01:53:48,101 --> 01:53:49,870
a referee raises the plaque first.

2937
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:51,200
- Then your hand gets raised.
- That's right.

2938
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:53,001
Although I had seen the plaque,

2939
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:54,840
I just stood there...

2940
01:53:54,841 --> 01:53:57,340
- without taking it in.
- You didn't see that it was red.

2941
01:53:57,341 --> 01:53:58,540
No. I was in a daze.

2942
01:53:58,541 --> 01:54:00,081
I was out of it.

2943
01:54:00,281 --> 01:54:01,741
So, when my hand got raised,

2944
01:54:01,841 --> 01:54:03,051
I became emotional.

2945
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:04,750
My eyes turned hot.

2946
01:54:04,751 --> 01:54:05,810
I had tears.

2947
01:54:05,811 --> 01:54:07,120
I felt a bit of pressure,

2948
01:54:07,121 --> 01:54:09,620
- because they both had won.
- Right.

2949
01:54:09,621 --> 01:54:11,690
- We could tell.
- "What if I lose?"

2950
01:54:11,691 --> 01:54:13,861
"What am I going to do?"

2951
01:54:14,021 --> 01:54:15,990
I couldn't help but feel that way.

2952
01:54:15,991 --> 01:54:18,930
I feels like all your hard work...

2953
01:54:18,931 --> 01:54:20,800
- paid off.
- Yes.

2954
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:23,200
That joy is worth investing your efforts into.

2955
01:54:23,201 --> 01:54:25,071
That's right. I think I screamed.

2956
01:54:25,231 --> 01:54:27,000
There's not much besides boxing...

2957
01:54:27,001 --> 01:54:30,540
where you can feel this level of dopamine rush.

2958
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:32,110
- What are you going to do?
- It's so fun.

2959
01:54:32,111 --> 01:54:33,111
(In Ah is already addicted to boxing.)

2960
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:34,911
We won. Let's go!

2961
01:54:35,441 --> 01:54:36,811
We won!

2962
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:39,280
- Yes.
- My first win ever.

2963
01:54:39,281 --> 01:54:40,920
- Gosh.
- It's really incredible.

2964
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:42,751
I'm feeling so much pressure.

2965
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:44,850
You know what I thought?

2966
01:54:44,851 --> 01:54:46,391
"Gosh. The heavens helped me out."

2967
01:54:47,891 --> 01:54:49,790
"This is fate."

2968
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:51,931
- Right.
- The heavens gave us...

2969
01:54:52,031 --> 01:54:53,960
this opportunity so that all four of us can fight tomorrow.

2970
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:57,701
To be honest, I wouldn't care if you lose tomorrow.

2971
01:54:57,931 --> 01:55:01,300
You all showed me your best efforts today,

2972
01:55:01,301 --> 01:55:02,301
so I'm pleased with that.

2973
01:55:02,302 --> 01:55:03,870
- We'll do our best tomorrow too.
- Just do your best.

2974
01:55:03,871 --> 01:55:05,610
- Okay.
- Got it? Good.

2975
01:55:05,611 --> 01:55:08,681
For four champions. Two, three.

2976
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:10,380
- KO!
- Iron!

2977
01:55:10,381 --> 01:55:13,081
- Girls!
- Girls!

2978
01:55:15,781 --> 01:55:17,050
I'm going all out tomorrow.

2979
01:55:17,051 --> 01:55:18,851
(Will there be a champion among the Iron Girls?)

2980
01:55:19,287 --> 01:55:22,197
(This is the beginning.)

2981
01:55:22,797 --> 01:55:25,297
(The long-awaited final match is here.)

2982
01:55:26,197 --> 01:55:28,996
(They're full of...)

2983
01:55:28,997 --> 01:55:33,707
(nerves and fear.)

2984
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,807
(I want to win.)

2985
01:55:37,047 --> 01:55:39,077
(I refuse to lose.)

2986
01:55:40,217 --> 01:55:47,557
