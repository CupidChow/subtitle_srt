1
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:36,261
(Iron Girls had their first full sparring.)

2
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,771
(It was their first experience with the actual sparring.)

3
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:45,441
(They realized the need to improve their sparring skills.)

4
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,971
(The day after the full sparring)

5
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:54,011
(A model student, Sae Rok came to the boxing gym early.)

6
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,581
- I have a question.
- Okay.

7
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,850
When I had supervised sparring,

8
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,391
my opponent made the move in an aggressive way.

9
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:04,060
But yesterday, both my opponent and I...

10
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,961
My opponent was waiting for me to attack.

11
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,261
Should I attack first then?

12
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,531
When the opponent attacks, you can counterattack.

13
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,031
When the opponent doesn't attack, you can make her attack.

14
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,500
Sae Rok, you just need to learn an applied technique...

15
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,341
- to win.
- Will I be able to win?

16
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,671
Today, you'll learn a cross-counter...

17
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:23,841
- and an attack, okay?
- Okay.

18
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:25,740
(The opponent waited for Sae Rok's attack...)

19
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,511
(and threw a cross-counter.)

20
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,250
(Cross-counter is a hook you throw at the timing...)

21
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:32,081
(of the opponent's attack.)

22
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,650
(Right hook)

23
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,091
(It's a timing-sensitive technique Sae Rok needs.)

24
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:39,721
Watch. Jab, jab. Then you throw a right hook.

25
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:42,461
- Do I do it like this?
- Yes.

26
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,100
The opponent's attack will go like this.

27
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,431
When you throw a right hook, this will be the situation.

28
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:49,501
I thought I had to link the arm.

29
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,700
- So I do this instead.
- Cross the arm and punch.

30
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,641
- Yes. Cross the arm and punch.
- I see.

31
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,970
Throw a right hook.

32
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,271
- A right hook?
- There you go.

33
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,441
Cross the arm.

34
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,041
Punch. It's similar. This is it.

35
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,651
That's why you need a right hook.

36
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,651
You'll now learn an attacking pattern.

37
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,921
You need to put it to use.

38
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,020
(Inducing an attack)

39
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,420
(Backstepping)

40
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,491
Then you do this.

41
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,361
(Move forward to induce an attack.)

42
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:16,391
(When the opponent attacks, throw a right hook.)

43
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,160
(An attacking pattern of punching after creating an opening)

44
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,931
That's it. That's the timing, okay?

45
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,230
- Push, push. There you go.
- Push, push, punch.

46
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:24,740
(The cross-counter training begins to improve her attacking skills.)

47
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,701
Push. Punch. There you go.

48
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,710
(Sae Rok's training log: I had my first lesson...)

49
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,740
(after the first full sparring and learned the right hook...)

50
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,780
(with the mindset of honing the technique over time.)

51
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,850
(While it's exhausting and hard, it'll be nice to make it my own.)

52
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:37,051
(I'm practicing this technique endlessly all day long.)

53
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:41,221
(Endless cross-counters)

54
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,291
(I used all of my energy today as well.)

55
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,120
(One, two, backstep, one, two)

56
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:50,161
(Uie's training is focused on the one-two.)

57
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,961
(In the full sparring, she mostly threw one-twos.)

58
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:56,471
(But the accuracy of Uie's punches was lacking.)

59
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:02,271
(To improve herself, she practices the one-two.)

60
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:04,011
(Halting)

61
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,541
You need to stay calm.

62
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,610
You're too hasty whenever I see you attack.

63
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,050
"How should I attack?"

64
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,450
"How should I do it? Oh, no." That's how you appear.

65
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,521
- That's why I become a roe deer.
- Exactly.

66
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,191
- I'll be calm.
- Okay.

67
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:17,720
(One, two)

68
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:21,331
(She focuses on her footwork and resumes training.)

69
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,901
Punch, punch. You're much faster.

70
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,201
You're much stronger.

71
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,530
(After fixing the footwork, Uie's one-two becomes fast and precise.)

72
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,671
There you go. Good.

73
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,541
Throw a jab in the end.

74
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,471
After doing this, you switch hands.

75
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,111
In this situation, do a two.

76
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,741
Punch. Then go back.

77
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,181
It'll be difficult to handle.

78
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,271
You'll be a boxer who's difficult to handle.

79
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,520
(Uie's training log: I need to make my killer move.)

80
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:46,720
(I don't need anything else. Confidence is number 1!)

81
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,351
(You can do it, Uie!)

82
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,560
(She focuses on making her one-two stronger.)

83
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,931
You're beginning to do it well.

84
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:57,100
(Next day)

85
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,131
Come on up.

86
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,430
You'll just make light touches.

87
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:03,501
- Practice the timing.
- The timing.

88
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:08,711
(Today, the members will have a live sparring session.)

89
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,881
(Uie versus Sae Rok)

90
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,881
(The tall girls' match of the reach is neck-and-neck.)

91
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,681
(Today, she shows the footwork of a boxer, not a roe deer.)

92
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,841
Uie, do what you've learned.

93
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,691
There you go.

94
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,260
(One, two)

95
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,261
There you go.

96
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:26,461
(Keep the opponent in place with the front hand...)

97
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,461
(and attacking with the backhand)

98
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:28,931
You can hit her easily.

99
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,560
There you go. Come on.

100
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:32,721
(Sae Rok can't go in easily.)

101
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,130
Sae Rok, what should you do when she attacks?

102
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,201
Cross the arm.

103
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,141
(She attempts a cross-counter.)

104
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,311
It was good, but your movement was too big.

105
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:46,041
- There you go.
- Good.

106
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,951
(Sae Rok throws a cross-counter and a left hook.)

107
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,981
Stop. Nice.

108
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,581
- My goodness.
- Well done.

109
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,751
- Thanks to practice, - I can't keep going.

110
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,691
- your one-two became natural.
- I can't keep going.

111
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,891
My goodness. Sae Rok.

112
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,531
Your punches are very strong.

113
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,131
- But don't lower your guard.
- Okay.

114
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,530
Go. Let's begin.

115
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,730
(This time, it's Uie versus In Ah)

116
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,741
Do it lightly. It's light sparring.

117
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:12,671
There you go.

118
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,340
(Same jab, different reach)

119
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:15,610
There you go. Good.

120
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,971
There you go. Okay.

121
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,480
(She dodges Uie's attack...)

122
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,281
(by backstepping...)

123
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,661
(and counterattacks right away.)

124
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:25,051
(The body shot combination)

125
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:26,880
(Down, up)

126
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,021
There you go.

127
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,521
(As for Uie, )

128
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,690
There you go. That's good.

129
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,720
(she attacks with a long jab.)

130
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:33,761
Nice timing.

131
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,191
(Jab)

132
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,401
(Jab)

133
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:38,900
(Uie is a tough opponent.)

134
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,031
She's strong.

135
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,031
That's how you learn.

136
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,940
- Stop.
- Stop.

137
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:45,641
- Okay. Well done.
- It was no joke.

138
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,711
Everyone has improved so much.

139
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,391
You guys aren't afraid of the punches.

140
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,141
Not anymore. All of you guys.

141
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,610
Okay. The training ends here.

142
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,911
(Today's training ends.)

143
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,711
- It was fun.
- Keep improving your stamina.

144
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:00,451
(The boxing gym is more crowded than usual.)

145
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:03,120
(At a corner, Sae Rok is putting on a headgear.)

146
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:04,291
Tell me if your ears hurt.

147
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,230
(In Ah is warming up.)

148
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:10,531
(Sae Rok)

149
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:11,831
My senior boxer.

150
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:14,700
I'm in trouble.

151
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,901
Please teach me a lesson.

152
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:19,200
It'll be a good practice for both of you.

153
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:20,241
Let's go.

154
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,571
This is Round One. Go.

155
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:26,410
(The direction of her jab is different!)

156
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,451
There you go.

157
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,181
Be a bit more daring.

158
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,351
You need to move forward in a daring way.

159
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,221
- Go.
- One-two.

160
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:35,990
(One gets blocked...)

161
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,321
(and two doesn't reach her.)

162
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:38,690
Keep going.

163
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,820
One more time.

164
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:42,031
(Sae Rok's attacks continue to get blocked.)

165
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,030
There you go. Okay. Good job.

166
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,161
There you go. One, two.

167
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,700
- Well done.
- There you go.

168
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:48,970
Do the one-two.

169
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,371
- Do the one-two.
- Do the one-two.

170
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,771
- Two.
- Do the high-low combination.

171
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,641
- There you go.
- Two.

172
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:56,970
(She succeeds in landing a blow.)

173
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,781
- One-two.
- Stop.

174
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:01,581
(Disappointed)

175
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,610
I was surprised to see that she was left-handed.

176
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,751
She's left-handed.

177
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:07,651
Okay. Let's begin.

178
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,250
- Good.
- Do the high-low combination.

179
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:10,860
Let's go.

180
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:13,021
- There you go.
- Two.

181
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,931
- Do the one-two.
- Two.

182
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,130
- Two.
- There you go.

183
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,230
(Following the order, she lands the one-two attack successfully.)

184
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,261
One, two.

185
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,930
- Move your feet.
- There you go.

186
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,071
Organize your moves.

187
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,671
(She does a cross-counter successfully.)

188
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,970
- Do a counter - There you go. All right.

189
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,241
(Unlike Round 1, Sae Rok seizes control.)

190
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,210
- Do the footwork.
- Throw it forward.

191
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:34,280
Sae Rok, do the footwork.

192
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,721
What are you doing? Do the footwork.

193
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:39,050
(While Sae Rok's feet are halted)

194
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,667
- One more time. One, two.
- Do the footwork.

195
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,020
There you go. Okay.

196
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:43,891
(The opponent goes for the opening.)

197
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,820
Pour out your remaining energy.

198
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,331
- To the face.
- Two.

199
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:48,760
- Come on.
- One-two to the face.

200
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,700
(Sae Rok pours out her remaining energy.)

201
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,901
There you go.

202
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,560
There you go.

203
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:54,630
- Do a counter.
- Now.

204
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,071
- Okay.
- Do a counter now.

205
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:57,271
- Now!
- Two.

206
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,840
- Not much time remains.
- There you go.

207
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,001
- A bit more.
- There you go.

208
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,070
- Okay.
- Stop. Bow.

209
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,071
Well done.

210
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:05,511
(The sparring was fierce until the end.)

211
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:06,810
Well done.

212
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,051
(Sae Rok)

213
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:09,580
We have high expectations.

214
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,751
(Her legs give out.)

215
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:13,480
- You did very well.
- You barely hit her in Round One.

216
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,950
But almost all of your two punches landed in Round Two.

217
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:15,951
That's right.

218
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:17,761
- You told me to throw a two.
- Yes.

219
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,790
I went, "Is this the right time?" But when I threw a punch,

220
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,031
- it landed.
- Right?

221
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,330
Without the coaches,

222
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,931
I don't know when it's the right time to attack.

223
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,477
You need to learn it through practice.

224
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,301
The timing is hard.

225
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:30,431
Push back your hair.

226
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,841
(In Ah is preparing for sparring.)

227
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,740
- In Ah.
- In Ah, good luck.

228
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:35,741
(In Ah's 2 months of experience...)

229
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:36,940
(versus the opponent's 7 months of experience)

230
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:39,040
- Do what you want to do, In Ah.
- Get ready.

231
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,951
Let's begin. Go.

232
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,021
(In Ah does the footwork with patience.)

233
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,350
No. Close the distance.

234
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,421
- There you go.
- Okay.

235
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,921
(A straight punch)

236
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:50,291
Keep your guard up.

237
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,737
(She blocks with her left hand to dodge the attack.)

238
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,860
(In Ah attacks without any hesitation.)

239
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,107
- There you go.
- Keep your guard up.

240
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,930
(Jab, two)

241
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:58,831
- There you go.
- Keep your guard up.

242
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,601
(The opponent's one-two)

243
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,001
Come on.

244
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:05,971
There you go.

245
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:07,910
(The opponent is taken aback by her strong punches.)

246
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:08,911
Don't take those punches.

247
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:10,010
Your feet shouldn't stop moving.

248
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:11,251
Keep going. What are you doing?

249
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,910
(Scary)

250
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,150
Don't halt your feet.

251
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:15,311
Keep moving.

252
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,211
- There you go.
- Stop.

253
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,451
(The opponent gets punched in the jaw.)

254
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,451
(Standing eight count due to a strong blow to the face)

255
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,991
(In Ah is flustered by the situation she hasn't experienced.)

256
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,130
- You can't talk.
- Okay.

257
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,660
All right. Resume. Spar.

258
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,730
(Round 1 resumes.)

259
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:33,630
Do the moves you practiced.

260
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:34,931
- There you go.
- There you go.

261
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:36,031
Stop.

262
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,071
- There you go.
- Stop.

263
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:45,340
(It's another standing eight count.)

264
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,611
Okay. Let's resume.

265
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:48,350
Keep your guard up.

266
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:49,727
(Sparring resumes after checking with the coaches and the boxer.)

267
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,120
- Stop. Okay.
- Well done.

268
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,350
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

269
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:54,321
(Round 1 ends.)

270
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:56,321
Keep up with the footwork.

271
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:58,761
When you guys are close together, go for a double hook.

272
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,190
- A double hook.
- The last round.

273
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,060
The last round. Box.

274
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,991
(Round 2 begins.)

275
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:06,600
(Parry)

276
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,730
(After attempting an attack, she pivots to dodge a blow.)

277
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,771
Turn.

278
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:11,871
- There you go.
- Good.

279
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:13,971
There you go.

280
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,370
- Left hand.
- Don't stop.

281
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:16,511
Left hand.

282
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,841
All right.

283
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,280
(One, two, hook, hook)

284
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:20,480
There you go.

285
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,450
(One, two, hook, hook)

286
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,511
That's it.

287
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,120
(She throws punches in succession.)

288
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,690
- There you go.
- Stop.

289
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,021
(The 3rd standing 8 count)

290
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay. Well done.

291
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,221
Are you okay?

292
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,160
Are you okay?

293
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,290
(It was the biggest crisis in 7 months of her boxing life.)

294
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,761
- What is it?
- I hit her too hard.

295
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,747
- She can go for another round.
- I hit you too hard.

296
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:42,531
- That's how it is.
- You did well.

297
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,141
You did well.

298
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:45,900
Why don't you have another round?

299
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,301
(Why don't you have another round?)

300
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:48,541
- What?
- One more round.

301
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,880
There's an opponent of a different style,

302
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,041
so let's have one more round.

303
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,441
- Okay.
- It's an opportunity.

304
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,180
You did incredibly well.

305
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,181
I loved how you defended yourself while attacking.

306
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:59,820
I thought you'd duck after putting your guard up.

307
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,397
Still, you did well to put your guard up.

308
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:02,620
Still, I did the dodge and hit.

309
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,990
- Well done.
- You did that well.

310
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,420
After landing a punch, you need to pivot.

311
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:07,607
You did well with other things.

312
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,930
(The opponent's 2 years of experience...)

313
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,330
(versus In Ah's 2 months of experience)

314
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,101
All right. Let's begin.

315
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,760
Do it lightly. Box.

316
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:15,031
(Round 1 begins.)

317
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:16,770
Go.

318
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,601
Use a lot of jabs. Do it slowly.

319
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,241
(Will In Ah do well with 2 months of experience?)

320
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,581
(Dodge, hit)

321
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:26,240
You're good.

322
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,950
(In Ah uses various techniques from the start.)

323
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,081
Do it right away.

324
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,020
- Okay.
- Low.

325
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,181
- Low.
- There you go.

326
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,390
(Feint, low, high)

327
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,751
There you go. Punch.

328
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,120
Too big.

329
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,691
- Keep moving your feet.
- Punch.

330
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,520
There you go.

331
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:41,861
- Good.
- That's how you do it.

332
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,701
(In Ah takes a blow.)

333
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,600
(Simba Seol awakens.)

334
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,700
- There you go.
- There you go.

335
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:49,000
- There you go.
- Again.

336
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,500
- Okay.
- Okay. Now, together.

337
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,200
- One more time. There you go.
- There you go.

338
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,400
Good. Punch again.

339
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:54,611
- Punch again.
- The inside.

340
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:55,940
(The opponent collapses.)

341
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,211
- All right.
- Are you okay?

342
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,181
- Are you okay?
- Breathe. Are you okay?

343
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:01,621
- Breathe.
- You're doing well.

344
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,280
- Another jab.
- Go in.

345
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,520
(They exchange blows in a scary manner.)

346
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:10,090
- Don't stop.
- Punch again.

347
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,120
Do it again.

348
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,590
- Stop.
- Are you okay?

349
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,091
- Stop.
- Are you okay? What's wrong?

350
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:15,930
What's wrong? Is it your contact lens?

351
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,701
(Worried)

352
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:21,070
Her nose is bleeding, so let's stop here.

353
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,131
Okay.

354
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,600
(Due to the nosebleed, the sparring ends abruptly.)

355
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:24,840
Are you okay?

356
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:26,477
(Due to the nosebleed, the sparring ends abruptly.)

357
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,341
- Her nose is bleeding.
- Are you really okay?

358
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,110
Please get her some tissue paper.

359
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,881
- Tissues, please.
- Press the nose.

360
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:36,011
(It's the first time a sparring led to bleeding.)

361
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:38,480
(In Ah's opponent, In Ah)

362
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,621
(Bowing)

363
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,990
- Are you okay?
- Both of us sparred passionately.

364
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:44,351
(Both of us sparred passionately.)

365
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,920
It should've gone until the end. It's too bad.

366
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,591
Seriously.

367
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,930
(I got a nosebleed while sparring.)

368
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:53,061
(The opponents sparred in a cool way.)

369
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,070
I think I should be good to In Ah.

370
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,430
- The boxing king, Seol In Ah.
- Everyone, watch out.

371
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:57,941
To In Ah... At ease.

372
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,741
You're cute.

373
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:02,771
I'm going to tell Ju Hyun and Uie...

374
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,170
- that In Ah...
- It's a secret.

375
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,141
Already gave someone a nosebleed.

376
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:08,150
You did well. But I understand that you feel bad.

377
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:09,281
I feel so bad.

378
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:11,851
- But we both used what we learned.
- Right.

379
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,380
- We did well.
- You did very well.

380
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:15,020
- You too.
- Seriously,

381
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,891
she's something else.

382
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,660
(In Ah)

383
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:23,661
(In Ah continues to train diligently even afterward.)

384
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:25,060
Until the end.

385
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:28,500
(In Ah's training log: Morning: boxing training)

386
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:32,171
(Afternoon: 5km of running, 10 sets of the 60m uphill interval)

387
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:36,241
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun trains to fix her punches.)

388
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,111
Stretch your arm from there when you throw a jab.

389
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,541
Jab.

390
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:41,881
Jab.

391
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,680
(Ju Hyun's training log: I've practically become a zombie...)

392
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,690
(due to the insane schedule, but I went to box before the play.)

393
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,721
(Let's cheer up and do this! Let's persevere!)

394
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:52,491
After the play,

395
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,161
I'm running with Bokddeong.

396
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,960
(Ju Hyun's training log:)

397
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,807
(Jump roping and running in my spare time is the way to go!)

398
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:01,130
(I jump-roped before practice for the play.)

399
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,201
(People looked at me funny.)

400
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,500
You're good.

401
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,117
(They train every day as if it's an actual match.)

402
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,170
(As they throw and take punches, )

403
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:12,411
(the girls become as hard as iron.)

404
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:16,081
(How will they do with the next sparring?)

405
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:19,321
(The hot sun shines down.)

406
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,320
(The haven of water sports...)

407
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,421
(that'll cool down the heat, )

408
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:29,031
(Gapyeong)

409
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,730
(An outdoor pool where you can play in the water)

410
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:32,861
Today's weather...

411
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,870
I'm looking forward to the barge.

412
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:37,401
(What are Iron Girls doing here?)

413
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:39,200
Are you guys wearing matching clothes?

414
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,270
Please come here.

415
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,910
How did you guys wear matching clothes?

416
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,711
We'll protect you guys today.

417
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,010
We're lifeguards.

418
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,657
(They enter with the lifeguards' protection.)

419
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,481
(The thought of playing in the water)

420
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,020
I'm so happy.

421
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,751
This is incredible.

422
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,450
Will we play in the water today?

423
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,790
What's this?

424
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,320
- This place is so nice.
- What's this?

425
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,521
(A big pool)

426
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,331
I love it.

427
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:03,461
Play some music.

428
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:04,731
Where's the DJ?

429
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:07,600
It has been a while since I entered with so much excitement.

430
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:10,400
I've never been this excited in Season Two.

431
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,170
- I wanted to play in the water.
- Hello.

432
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:14,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,671
Why are we here?

434
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,210
- Are we going into the pool?
- I'm so excited.

435
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,210
Ju Hyun and I are here as lifeguards.

436
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,211
How did you guys wear matching clothes?

437
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,750
- Aren't we playing today?
- Wait. Hold on.

438
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,921
First, our Sae Rok got a haircut.

439
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,890
(Sae Rok with bobbed hair)

440
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,320
- Why did you get a haircut?
- The thing is,

441
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm going to get my hair cut every time I spar.

442
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,560
(Her hair will get shorter as she spars.)

443
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,130
When you win or lose? Every time?

444
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,200
Every time.

445
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:41,030
I'm so excited to be at a pool. It feels good to see the water.

446
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,001
- Are we here to play in the water?
- Why?

447
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,301
I really don't want to train here.

448
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:47,910
- I hate it.
- It's too hot.

449
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:48,971
There they are.

450
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:50,741
Hello.

451
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:52,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

452
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,010
- Hello.
- What's all that?

453
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:56,051
- Hello.
- I packed our lunch.

454
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,780
- Hello, Captain.
- But it looks quite heavy.

455
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,521
It's light. It's just lunch. Like sandwiches.

456
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:03,791
The veins on your arms are standing out.

457
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,521
(The veins on his arms show how heavy it is.)

458
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,891
- What?
- Pass it on.

459
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,560
I think it has dumbbells in it.

460
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,030
- No.
- I bet they are sandbags.

461
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:15,101
- Sand... My goodness.
- What's this?

462
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,231
Gosh, this is too heavy.

463
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,501
(The lunch is thrown to the ground.)

464
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,070
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

465
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:22,040
- How are you feeling?
- I'm suddenly feeling uneasy.

466
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,481
Why? You don't have to be like that.

467
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,311
You are dressed like you're here to ride a banana boat.

468
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,851
Are there four of you?

469
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,810
- For a banana boat?
- Yes.

470
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:32,280
- We made a reservation.
- We're four.

471
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:33,320
- A banana boat?
- A banana boat and...

472
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,520
- Or a peanut boat? Which one?
- Yes.

473
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,891
- Both.
- Peanut?

474
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,220
If you try both, I'll give you a 50 percent discount.

475
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:39,290
He's good.

476
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,767
(They feel more energetic thanks to Captain Kim.)

477
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,061
Why did you bring heavy things to a swimming pool?

478
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:45,901
We want to have fun today.

479
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,100
- I know.
- Because we've worked hard.

480
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,140
- It could be like a reward.
- "Reward?"

481
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,370
- Something like chocolate.
- I did expect that a little.

482
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:54,541
- I see.
- Right.

483
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,241
I know. You can think we are having fun.

484
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:00,281
We will train while thinking we're having fun.

485
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,610
And you guys...

486
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:03,711
I got fooled.

487
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,220
Listen. We call it training,

488
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:07,821
but it's actually a rest.

489
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,091
We will just have fun.

490
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,290
You will have fun in the water.

491
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,690
I won't call it training.

492
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,990
If you call it training, you'll get a penalty. We're having fun.

493
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,061
- It sounds fun.
- We will have fun.

494
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,700
(Forcing themselves to be energetic)

495
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,230
Seriously, we will have fun.

496
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,870
You will be a little out of breath, though.

497
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:24,177
- Since we're having fun anyway.
- I look forward to it.

498
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:26,700
I brought some stuff so you could have fun in the water.

499
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:28,610
- It must be sandbags.
- Let's not do this in the water.

500
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:30,210
But it's different in the water.

501
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,781
Go ahead and open it.

502
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:38,012
(What on earth did they find in the bags?)

503
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,089
But it's different in the water. Go ahead and open it.

504
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:47,126
(What on earth did they find in the bags?)

505
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:49,665
- I can't believe this.
- What are these?

506
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,695
It's chocolate.

507
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,465
This bag has weight plates in it.

508
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,572
(This bag has weight plates in it.)

509
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,405
Do you have a luxury belt? I'll give you one.

510
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,835
- My goodness.
- A luxury belt.

511
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:57,976
- Which brand is it?
- What?

512
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:00,536
- It's the C brand.
- This is unbelievable.

513
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:02,975
I can't believe this.

514
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,116
(The trio of luxury water toys)

515
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,346
- Are they to sink us in the water?
- What?

516
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,685
Or are they to put me down?

517
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,086
No, it's not like that.

518
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,756
I suddenly lost my will to live.

519
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:15,656
Let's do this then.

520
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,056
There are about 3 to 4 games.

521
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:20,425
If you finish them quickly, I'll let you ride a banana boat.

522
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:21,726
- Really?
- Are you serious?

523
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:24,796
- Yes. I'll give you a ride.
- My gosh.

524
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:27,936
You'll probably wonder why you are doing this.

525
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:30,306
You are feeling a lot of pain here and there.

526
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,505
- Right? You have a wrist problem.
- Yes. And my knees.

527
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,675
- I got a shot.
- Knees.

528
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:35,175
- Knees and ankles.
- Knees.

529
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:37,045
- Knees and calves.
- Ankles. Calves.

530
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:38,275
- You all have problems.
- Yes.

531
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:39,916
When you play in the water,

532
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:42,645
you're less affected by gravity.

533
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:43,885
So they train a lot...

534
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,116
in the water to reduce the risk of joint injuries.

535
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:48,625
Famous international athletes...

536
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:52,226
like Ronaldo and Kim Min Jae also train a lot in the water.

537
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,525
(Water resistance reduces the strain on joints...)

538
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:55,695
(and increases muscle strength, )

539
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,242
(cardiopulmonary function, and resilience.)

540
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,436
(It is widely used in rehabilitation training.)

541
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,436
MMA fighters also train a lot in water.

542
00:19:04,536 --> 00:19:06,505
Here's the first game, which is fun.

543
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,176
(The fun first game)

544
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,175
It will be really fun. You'll be in the water.

545
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:11,296
- Okay.
- Isn't it exciting?

546
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,645
(It's exciting.)

547
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:16,916
When you play in the water, you jump around a lot.

548
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,515
You will run in place by raising your knees like that.

549
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:20,732
(The first game, underwater running in place)

550
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:21,825
While keeping your guard up.

551
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,466
You'll do it for 1 minute and 30 seconds.

552
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,106
There will be a 30-second break.

553
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,616
It will be over after five rounds.

554
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,395
- Okay. Let's hurry.
- That will be it.

555
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:30,526
- Let's go into the water.
- Okay.

556
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:32,236
- Let's just go.
- Let's go.

557
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,766
I think it will be cool.

558
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,806
- Think of it as a warm-up.
- Okay.

559
00:19:37,836 --> 00:19:39,005
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

560
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,906
All right, everyone. Ju Hyun says it's cold.

561
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:43,976
You won't feel cold after 1 minute and 30 seconds.

562
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,275
Ready.

563
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:46,276
(Round 1 begins.)

564
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,686
Raise your knees. Faster. Good.

565
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,986
(Jumping)

566
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,585
Your knees should be above the surface of the water.

567
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:56,826
- The water is too deep.
- What?

568
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:59,596
Your knees should be up like this.

569
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,526
See? Like this.

570
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,026
- Like this.
- He's annoying.

571
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,596
It's been 35 seconds. Do this.

572
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,706
- This is so easy.
- It's been only 35 seconds?

573
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:09,805
Jump.

574
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,876
- That's it. Nice, Ju Hyun.
- Jump.

575
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,745
(Furious knee kicks)

576
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,875
- This is hard.
- You have 15 seconds left.

577
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:17,876
(Groaning)

578
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:19,676
Keep your guard up.

579
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,346
What kind of training is this?

580
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,986
(They are groaning here and there.)

581
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:27,686
(Fighting against water resistance)

582
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,556
Two, one.

583
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,725
(Round 1 is over.)

584
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,456
Okay. Rest.

585
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,966
Captain, it is not easy to raise...

586
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:36,826
my knees above the water.

587
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,096
It's so easy for me.

588
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,796
That's because you're tall.

589
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,405
- It's the height.
- You're tall.

590
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,005
- What?
- You're taller than us.

591
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:44,006
- Taller than you?
- Yes.

592
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,836
I didn't think of that. All right.

593
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,005
- It's hot.
- I know, right?

594
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,806
- It's hot.
- I'm feeling warm.

595
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:53,276
All right. The 30 seconds are over. Ready.

596
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,586
(Round 2 begins.)

597
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:59,456
It's important to keep your guard up.

598
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:07,226
(The guard march suddenly begins.)

599
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,766
(Why can't they do this when it's so easy?)

600
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:12,296
(He's so annoying.)

601
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,136
(Captain's morale-boosting show)

602
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:15,266
He's so annoying.

603
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,666
Like this.

604
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,176
Captain, you look like Larva in the water.

605
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,106
(100 percent identical)

606
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:26,315
- I love it.
- He's so good.

607
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:28,746
- Why is he so excited?
- This is hilarious.

608
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,485
Raise your knees higher. Above the surface of the water.

609
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,646
- I just can't do it.
- They should come up like this.

610
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:34,985
- I can't.
- This is really hard.

611
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,232
(Jumping excitedly until the very end)

612
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:38,396
(Round 2 is over.)

613
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,825
(Staggering)

614
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:43,026
This is my first time seeing Uie struggle in the water.

615
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:45,936
(She's usually the happiest one in the water.)

616
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,596
Season Two just isn't for me.

617
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:49,906
You're improving a lot.

618
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,476
Nothing about it suits me.

619
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,956
Do you still think this isn't an exercise?

620
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:55,705
Ju Hyun, was this not enough for you?

621
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:56,906
(She has no energy to answer.)

622
00:21:57,006 --> 00:21:58,606
Why not? This is a good exercise for me.

623
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,275
Captain, you're annoying.

624
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,316
I am?

625
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:03,916
Faster.

626
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:05,856
Faster.

627
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:07,516
- Captain.
- Faster.

628
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,756
- Faster.
- Come on, Captain!

629
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:10,926
Faster.

630
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,626
Faster.

631
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:14,256
- Faster.
- What?

632
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:15,695
All right. Faster.

633
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:17,616
(The annoying captain forces them to go faster.)

634
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:24,036
(With the punishment, he's become a real drowning Larva.)

635
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,435
(Round 4 begins.)

636
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,446
All right. Raise your knees.

637
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:29,646
- That's it.
- My gosh.

638
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,246
There you go. The water should splash like that.

639
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:34,246
We are having fun.

640
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:35,915
We are having fun.

641
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,616
Good, In Ah.

642
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:40,516
(Round 5 begins.)

643
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:42,726
- Darn it!
- Keep your guard up.

644
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:45,656
(Let's try our best to have fun.)

645
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:47,425
(We are having fun.)

646
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:50,126
There are people who envy us even at this very moment.

647
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:55,836
(The fun game makes them smile.)

648
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,306
All right.

649
00:22:58,006 --> 00:23:01,576
Good. Imagine that your opponent is right here.

650
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,646
(The first game is over.)

651
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,716
(This is killing me.)

652
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:08,146
(She has no energy to stand.)

653
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,645
- This is so much fun.
- It's fun, isn't it?

654
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:10,716
It's really fun.

655
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:12,315
(She wants to go home.)

656
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:13,815
Weren't we supposed to be on a boat?

657
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,855
All right. It's fun, isn't it?

658
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,256
We're playing in the water.

659
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,426
Everyone, here's the second game.

660
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,665
- Are you giving us a bag as a gift?
- I have...

661
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,266
something small in my hand.

662
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,165
It's like a swim ring.

663
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,135
You have a swim ring when you play in the water.

664
00:23:29,136 --> 00:23:30,735
I'll give you one each.

665
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:32,435
- No way.
- A swim ring.

666
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:34,435
- Take one. Pass it on.
- Pass it on.

667
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,345
- This is heavy.
- It's a swim ring.

668
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,805
- It's a sponge.
- It's heavy even in the water.

669
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,046
- What?
- Let me explain.

670
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:42,346
All right. This is a 2.5kg weight plate.

671
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:44,986
Boxers train like this a lot.

672
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,386
(Plate training to help with the forearm muscles)

673
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,826
(Effective exercise for strengthening your punches)

674
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:53,356
With this weight plate, you will run back and forth.

675
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,696
This is 25m.

676
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:58,636
It's 50m if you go back and forth. Do 10 laps, and it's over.

677
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,005
All right. Let's chant together before we start.

678
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,736
I say, "Fun game," and you say, "It's fun!"

679
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,805
Fun game!

680
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:08,105
- It's fun.
- It's fun.

681
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,445
Your voices are too quiet.

682
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,145
You should ride a banana boat after this.

683
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,845
Fun game!

684
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:15,716
- It's fun.
- It's fun.

685
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,986
Start!

686
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:20,856
It's all about speed.

687
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:22,356
It's all about speed.

688
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,025
I can't move forward.

689
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:25,055
(The second game is harder than they thought.)

690
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:26,155
Gosh, this is hard.

691
00:24:26,156 --> 00:24:27,496
Good. Go forward like that.

692
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,606
(It's not easy because of the weight of the plate and water resistance.)

693
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,536
(Going one step at a time, with difficulty)

694
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:36,066
My shoulder blades hurt.

695
00:24:36,906 --> 00:24:38,435
You're working out well.

696
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,676
(Here are the shoulder blades.)

697
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:41,276
Gosh, my shoulder blades.

698
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,546
This is crazy.

699
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:46,916
(They are groaning here and there.)

700
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,585
Hang on.

701
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:50,245
(Even Uie, the Stamina Queen, is struggling too.)

702
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:51,316
(Groaning)

703
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:52,856
(Moaning)

704
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:55,656
(She can't stretch out her arms.)

705
00:24:55,886 --> 00:24:58,325
(Passing the halfway point)

706
00:24:58,326 --> 00:24:59,455
Faster.

707
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,096
This is a really fun game.

708
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:02,796
It feels like I'm getting wings.

709
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,295
This is really fun.

710
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,566
(They finished one lap.)

711
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:06,866
(Groaning)

712
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,165
All right.

713
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,135
Which part of your body hurts the most now?

714
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:12,096
Biceps, triceps, shoulder blades, and lower back.

715
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:13,836
- Biceps and triceps.
- All right.

716
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:15,605
Biceps, triceps, neck, trapezius, shoulders,

717
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,145
- and head.
- Biceps and triceps.

718
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:18,615
Biceps, triceps, back.

719
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:19,752
(All their muscles are stimulated.)

720
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,016
Gosh, my back hurts.

721
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:22,845
- My biceps hurt.
- Good.

722
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:23,915
- My triceps hurt.
- You shouldn't...

723
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,315
spread your elbows out to the sides.

724
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,515
My biceps.

725
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,716
My shoulder blades.

726
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:29,356
My shoulder blades.

727
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:31,056
(Groaning)

728
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:32,426
(Groaning)

729
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:33,756
(Groaning)

730
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:35,225
My biceps hurt.

731
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,425
My triceps hurt too.

732
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:37,595
My shoulder blades hurt too.

733
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,065
- My abs hurt.
- Your abs hurt?

734
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,095
(Groaning)

735
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,806
- It's the 5th lap.
- The 5th lap.

736
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,406
(This is when they are nearing their limit.)

737
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,706
This is really tough.

738
00:25:47,976 --> 00:25:50,005
(Everyone is exhausted, )

739
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,815
(so they're becoming quiet.)

740
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,746
Make it longer.

741
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:55,916
You are not doing it right.

742
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:58,126
(Uie suddenly starts laughing?)

743
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:00,016
What's that? That's not how you do it.

744
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:02,496
- What's wrong with him?
- You can't win like this.

745
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:04,456
I'm suddenly feeling better.

746
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:06,195
I think I'm getting runner's high.

747
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:07,696
(I think I'm getting runner's high.)

748
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:10,326
Captain, I'm getting runner's high.

749
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:12,666
What? That's great.

750
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,036
- I'm getting runner's high.
- That's a good thing.

751
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:16,866
- That's great.
- What's with her?

752
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,736
- Over here.
- She's unbelievable.

753
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,676
She's unbelievable.

754
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:23,645
I'm suddenly feeling so good.

755
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:24,746
You're doing a great job.

756
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:26,746
Uie is scaring me.

757
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:31,146
(She continues training while laughing.)

758
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,366
This is what you need during a match.

759
00:26:34,016 --> 00:26:36,756
Uie has been consumed by adrenaline.

760
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:40,296
Uie, you should do ten laps here before going to a match.

761
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:44,366
In Ah is getting something too.

762
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:46,836
She's not tired anymore. She's holding it with one hand.

763
00:26:47,196 --> 00:26:48,406
I have only two laps left.

764
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,036
I have only two laps left.

765
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:51,565
All right.

766
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,336
(Good news amidst the pain)

767
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:56,406
I'm almost there.

768
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,146
I'm finishing the eighth lap.

769
00:26:58,446 --> 00:26:59,576
Do it right. One, two.

770
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:00,746
I can do this.

771
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,385
The last one!

772
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:04,585
- The last lap?
- The last.

773
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,555
- Is this your last lap, Ju Hyun?
- The last one!

774
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:09,155
Ju Hyun is doing well. That's impressive.

775
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:10,255
She's a go-getter.

776
00:27:10,256 --> 00:27:13,896
(She has improved her strength a lot in two months.)

777
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:15,425
- Okay.
- Okay. The last.

778
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,696
One, two.

779
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:19,136
(She's definitely good at long-term things.)

780
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,495
Uie!

781
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:21,812
(Cardiovascular Endurance Queen, Uie)

782
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,035
(Uie is finished.)

783
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:24,336
The first place.

784
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:27,136
The second place, Ju Hyun.

785
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:28,846
Sae Rok, are you done?

786
00:27:29,576 --> 00:27:31,816
- You can do this.
- The third place.

787
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:33,315
Last.

788
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:34,575
- The last lap.
- Hang in there, In Ah.

789
00:27:34,576 --> 00:27:36,286
- You can do this, In Ah!
- Go, In Ah!

790
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:38,655
(Passing the last halfway point)

791
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,356
The last lap. Hurry.

792
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,785
Come here, Wet Simba.

793
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:42,955
You got this.

794
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:43,956
(Welcome)

795
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:45,225
My love.

796
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,425
Come here.

797
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:48,296
(In Ah is finished.)

798
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:50,895
(As if throwing a Frisbee, )

799
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:52,856
(she throws the 2.5kg weight plate nonchalantly.)

800
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,065
(We did a good job.)

801
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,666
Good work.

802
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,435
Even though you are playing tough games,

803
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:00,336
your faces are brightening up.

804
00:28:00,736 --> 00:28:02,676
I suddenly started feeling great.

805
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,405
- She's strange.
- The thing is...

806
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:05,845
Positive energy is contagious.

807
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:08,715
She's spreading positive energy.

808
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:10,186
I thought I was being strange.

809
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:13,315
- She's no joke.
- You know, Mayweather...

810
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,826
- and Pacquiao fought in 12 rounds.
- Yes.

811
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,556
Uie should have 12 rounds.

812
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:21,025
- Right.
- Uie will win...

813
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:23,095
- only after 12 rounds.
- Right. Two rounds aren't enough.

814
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,296
Right. It's too short.

815
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,335
- You're amazing.
- Anyway,

816
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:27,766
the second game is over.

817
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,206
- Yes!
- The second game.

818
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,605
What's the next game?

819
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:31,805
All right. The third...

820
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:33,135
Good. Guys,

821
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,105
she calls it a game.

822
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:36,305
I'll give her a bonus ofseven points.

823
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:38,006
- Yes!
- The third game.

824
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:39,875
You know the combination.

825
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:41,115
From routine one...

826
00:28:41,116 --> 00:28:42,585
- To routine 8.
- to routine 8.

827
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,146
You will simplify them.

828
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,455
You will be doing the routines from 1 to 6.

829
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,586
- In the water?
- In the water.

830
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,485
(The routine training in the water)

831
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:52,155
- Jab, jab.
- Jab.

832
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:53,555
One, two.

833
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:55,025
- Jab, jab.
- Jab.

834
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,326
One, two. Harder.

835
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,495
(They are trying the routines in the water for the first time.)

836
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,766
Forward.

837
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,665
(Punching is difficult due to the water resistance.)

838
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,866
Harder.

839
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,276
One, two.

840
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,775
- This is really hard.
- Jab.

841
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,045
- Jab, jab.
- Jab, jab.

842
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,245
- One, two.
- One, two.

843
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:11,405
- Jab, jab.
- Jab, jab.

844
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,575
- One, two.
- One, two.

845
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,915
Okay. Round Two.

846
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,516
This is Round Two.

847
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,645
Round Two. Get ready.

848
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,155
Round Two has begun. Ready, start.

849
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:22,226
(Jab, jab, one, two, with dumbbells)

850
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:24,885
(It feels heavier due to the water resistance and dumbbells.)

851
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:27,556
- Jab, jab, one, two.
- Jab, jab, one, two.

852
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:29,296
Start.

853
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:33,595
(The sound of a dolphin bursting out in pain)

854
00:29:33,596 --> 00:29:34,735
Good.

855
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:37,235
(Routine 2: One, two, hook, two)

856
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:39,935
(Routine 3: One, two, hook, hook)

857
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:40,936
- Jab, jab.
- Jab, jab.

858
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,275
(A splash created by a full-power punch)

859
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,575
Ready.

860
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,746
Okay.

861
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,576
You should create a splash.

862
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:49,746
Create a splash

863
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,616
(Giggling)

864
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,686
(What was that?)

865
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,026
- Create a splash - Create a splash

866
00:29:57,386 --> 00:30:01,026
(The song rubs off on her.)

867
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,565
- This is fun.
- Is it fun?

868
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:06,996
Create a splash

869
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,306
(Create a splash)

870
00:30:09,536 --> 00:30:11,976
(To the beat of the song)

871
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,935
(Routine 4: One, two, uppercut, hook)

872
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:17,605
(Routine 5: One, two, uppercut, uppercut, hook, hook)

873
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:21,616
(Routine 6: One, two, hook, two, dodge, hit)

874
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,545
(Dumbbells create even stronger splashes.)

875
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,415
You guys are doing well.

876
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,585
The last one.

877
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,525
Make it faster. So I can't see your hands. Ready.

878
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,586
Go.

879
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:33,895
(For the last lap, they put their 100 percent in.)

880
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:35,155
Okay. Put them down.

881
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:38,195
All right. The third game is over.

882
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:39,236
Oh, dear.

883
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:41,696
All right. We have the last game left now.

884
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,606
You just did shadowboxing in the water.

885
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,035
Now,

886
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:47,736
you'll go completely into the water.

887
00:30:47,836 --> 00:30:49,475
While holding your breath,

888
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:50,746
you'll practice shadowboxing.

889
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:53,176
For about five seconds, you should try...

890
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,846
to stretch your fist with all your might in the water.

891
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:58,515
You'll come up to the surface to catch your breath for a while.

892
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:01,616
Then you dive back down and practice your punches.

893
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:04,002
There will be only 1 round, which is 3 minutes long.

894
00:31:04,026 --> 00:31:05,595
- I'll give you swimming goggles.
- Okay.

895
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:07,296
(Putting on the swimming goggles)

896
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:09,966
To help you stay in the water,

897
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:12,096
I'll give you a diving belt.

898
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,336
Pass it on.

899
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:15,605
(Ready to dive with goggles and diving belts)

900
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:16,906
All right, everyone.

901
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,905
- I'll show you what to do.
- Okay.

902
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:20,105
(Captain Dong Hyun, a former marine, gives a demonstration.)

903
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:21,976
I don't come out until someone touches me.

904
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:23,975
I lose track of time.

905
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:25,575
- You should touch me.
- Yes.

906
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:26,975
Tell me if you're bored.

907
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,246
- Okay.
- Then I'll come up.

908
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,045
(He's talking too much.)

909
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:31,085
Come on.

910
00:31:31,086 --> 00:31:33,585
- I'm doing this for you.
- Okay.

911
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,526
- I get it.
- I'll do it.

912
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:39,856
(I'm a Marine, who is good at diving.)

913
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,966
(How good is Captain Kim at diving then?)

914
00:31:47,596 --> 00:31:48,706
What?

915
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:50,106
We didn't call you.

916
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,665
(Only 3 seconds?)

917
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,605
We didn't call you.

918
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:55,275
- Go back down.
- You didn't?

919
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:56,405
You know what?

920
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:58,086
I knock my opponent down in three seconds.

921
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,776
I can finish things only with eight punches.

922
00:32:00,846 --> 00:32:02,645
While you shadowbox, if your opponent is down,

923
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:03,945
- you can come up.
- Okay.

924
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:05,855
- Like I did.
- Let's go.

925
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:07,585
If you finish this, the training is over.

926
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:08,725
- Okay.
- Okay?

927
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:09,825
Ready.

928
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:10,885
Start.

929
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,726
(The 3-minute underwater shadowboxing starts.)

930
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:18,566
(Underwater shadowboxing where they fight against buoyancy)

931
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,906
(While imagining a real match, )

932
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:29,406
(they throw punches carefully.)

933
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:30,746
Okay.

934
00:32:30,747 --> 00:32:32,676
(After taking a breath, they go back in.)

935
00:32:34,716 --> 00:32:41,556
(Everyone comes up for a breath.)

936
00:32:42,886 --> 00:32:44,356
She's holding for a long time.

937
00:32:44,726 --> 00:32:49,465
(In Ah doesn't come out of the water.)

938
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,106
She's holding her breath for a long time.

939
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:57,036
(Relaxed)

940
00:32:57,306 --> 00:32:58,565
Gosh, In Ah.

941
00:32:58,566 --> 00:32:59,575
(In Ah)

942
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:00,736
What's with In Ah?

943
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:01,976
Hey, In Ah.

944
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,706
- You're the best.
- Why?

945
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:05,616
- It's been almost one minute.
- Really?

946
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:06,976
Start again.

947
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:09,885
It's been one minute.

948
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,146
(1 minute has passed.)

949
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:12,816
Go. One, two.

950
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:19,026
(Underwater mitt work)

951
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:23,996
(Her punches are strong even in the water.)

952
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,296
(Out of breath)

953
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,506
KO. Go back in.

954
00:33:33,106 --> 00:33:34,505
It's been two minutes.

955
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:36,105
(It's been 2 minutes.)

956
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,306
Last one minute.

957
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:39,046
(Groaning)

958
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:42,886
(It's getting harder to hold their breath.)

959
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:44,815
Why are three minutes so long?

960
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:46,915
All right. By practicing holding your breath,

961
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,956
you are improving your cardiorespiratory endurance.

962
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:51,785
Focus.

963
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:52,995
Hold your breath.

964
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:58,366
(It is hard even for Cardiovascular Endurance Queen.)

965
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,365
(The 3 minutes are over.)

966
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:01,735
Okay. Last 30 seconds.

967
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:03,736
(Last 30 seconds?)

968
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:08,846
(The 3 minutes are already over.)

969
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,846
Keep going. It's almost over.

970
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:14,916
(Ju Hyun, let's spar.)

971
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:19,755
(They are sparring without knowing that it's over.)

972
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,216
You're sparring in the water.

973
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:27,896
(Uie and In Ah begin sparring as well.)

974
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,796
(He's just watching them.)

975
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:34,296
(The four of them continue sparring, unaware of the situation.)

976
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,105
Come on. You're almost there.

977
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:37,412
(It's been 4 minutes since they went underwater.)

978
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:39,436
Last few seconds.

979
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:41,776
Last few seconds.

980
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:43,275
Wait. Is it not over yet?

981
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,406
No, last few seconds.

982
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:46,876
This is it. Last few seconds.

983
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:49,486
This is the last part. Just a few seconds.

984
00:34:50,016 --> 00:34:51,085
Last few seconds.

985
00:34:51,086 --> 00:34:52,362
(Dong Hyun keeps mumbling about the time to drag it out.)

986
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:53,515
Are you pranking us?

987
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:55,455
What are you talking about? You're almost there.

988
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:57,102
- It hasn't been 3 minutes yet?
- Come on. You've got 5 seconds.

989
00:34:57,126 --> 00:34:59,296
Come on. It's 5, 4...

990
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,795
(Busted, he hastily begins the countdown.)

991
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:05,666
Come on. 3, 4, 5.

992
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,466
(Dong Hyun is stalling again.)

993
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,436
Two, one.

994
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:15,505
(The underwater shadowboxing is over after about 5 minutes.)

995
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:18,346
Nice. Good job.

996
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:21,446
You did great.

997
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,486
You were actually in there for two extra minutes.

998
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:25,956
No wonder it was exhausting.

999
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,215
You all worked so hard today.

1000
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:30,186
Feel free to play in the water. Do you want to?

1001
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:31,825
- No.
- You're hungry, aren't you?

1002
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:33,125
(Forget about playing in the water. We're exhausted.)

1003
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:35,126
- We're done.
- Good job today.

1004
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:41,466
(This is what you get for extending our time underwater!)

1005
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:45,805
You should ride the banana boat.

1006
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:46,875
We'll let you ride on it.

1007
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,336
We don't want to.

1008
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,975
Now it’s time to get serious with training.

1009
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,656
(What is next on their training schedule?)

1010
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:57,386
(The first competition is 30 days away.)

1011
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:59,515
(Once again)

1012
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:01,285
I can't believe we're back here again.

1013
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,825
This place feels like home now...

1014
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:03,932
because we come here so often.

1015
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,802
Should we start wrapping our hands? Let's do it.

1016
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:06,826
Okay.

1017
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,896
(Exhaling)

1018
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,266
(As always, Uie is nervous.)

1019
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,765
Uie and I were talking earlier,

1020
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:19,705
and we briefly mentioned the competition.

1021
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:21,735
From that moment, her hands started to shake and she began sweating.

1022
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,016
And then she took cheongsimhwan.

1023
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:25,745
Why would you take...

1024
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:29,186
I've been so nervous that I reached a whole new level of tension.

1025
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:31,186
- Really?
- I'm actually calmer now.

1026
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,255
I have this strange feeling that I'm going to tear up that day.

1027
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:38,225
- Right.
- I would feel strange.

1028
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,155
You might not understand, but for me,

1029
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:44,596
I feel my fingertips tingle, and that feeling spreads to my toes.

1030
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:46,095
- Because you're nervous.
- Yes.

1031
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,466
Goodness. You're worse than I am.

1032
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:50,465
- Seriously.
- If you're nervous...

1033
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,066
I wish I could feel nervous.

1034
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:54,975
Being nervous is so fun.

1035
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:56,546
You're welcome to take Uie's.

1036
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:01,346
Being nervous is what releases dopamine and adrenaline.

1037
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:03,185
That leads you to forget about the pain,

1038
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,046
and you get to be fully in that moment.

1039
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,456
I think she is addicted to dopamine.

1040
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:09,385
(Gwang Bok doesn’t let nervousness get to her.)

1041
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:11,026
How are we so different?

1042
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:14,195
(The two men appear, ready to heighten their nervousness.)

1043
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:16,396
Hello.

1044
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:17,496
- Hello.
- Hello.

1045
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:19,335
(The team greets them loudly.)

1046
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:21,396
- Hello.
- You're in good spirits today.

1047
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:23,236
The team has good vibes.

1048
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:24,706
- Hello.
- Hello.

1049
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:27,606
The competition is right around the corner.

1050
00:37:27,736 --> 00:37:31,406
Today is finally our second full sparring.

1051
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:32,515
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1052
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,636
(Their second full sparring)

1053
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:39,185
(The memories of their first full sparring)

1054
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:45,425
(The memories of getting hit)

1055
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:50,266
(The memories of the pain)

1056
00:37:50,826 --> 00:37:54,536
(And today)

1057
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,166
(It's time to get back in the ring.)

1058
00:37:58,836 --> 00:38:01,376
(Let's see how much the Iron Girls have grown.)

1059
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:03,405
Experiences like this one are very necessary.

1060
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,505
- Okay.
- Right.

1061
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,315
Martial art should be the thing martial artists do the most.

1062
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:07,545
Other trainings are important, of course.

1063
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,115
- In Ah and I...
- Yes?

1064
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:11,686
Sparred separately.

1065
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:15,985
But In Ah got her opponent to get a nosebleed.

1066
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:17,762
(She drew blood from her opponent's nose twice.)

1067
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:21,326
(Simba Seol is showing her claws.)

1068
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:24,466
That rumor spread nationwide, so even I...

1069
00:38:24,526 --> 00:38:26,595
- Even I watched that video.
- Gosh.

1070
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,665
- You did?
- I was shocked.

1071
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:31,065
I was amazed while watching the video, and I screamed out loud.

1072
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:32,505
She's really amazing.

1073
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,135
She really is amazing.

1074
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:36,476
- She is so fascinating.
- In my first sparring,

1075
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:39,045
you all saw that I got hit a lot.

1076
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:40,746
I was knocked out too.

1077
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,885
So for two weeks, I trained hard with determination.

1078
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,516
I never wanted to experience that again.

1079
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:46,115
Having learned such a huge lesson,

1080
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,556
I practiced even harder.

1081
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:50,825
I'm thankful that we're on the same team.

1082
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:53,396
I made a promise to myself a few days ago...

1083
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:55,126
to get on In Ah's good side.

1084
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:58,826
That explains why Sae Rok was treating In Ah so well.

1085
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:00,965
- Sae Rok!
- She was like, "In Ah."

1086
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,035
"In Ah, come here. Are you all right?"

1087
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,282
So I knew something was going on.

1088
00:39:04,306 --> 00:39:07,635
I know you probably wouldn't be as nervous as the first sparring,

1089
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,645
- but you still must be nervous.
- Yes.

1090
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,245
Treat today’s practice as if it were a real match.

1091
00:39:11,246 --> 00:39:13,315
- Let's take this seriously.
- Okay.

1092
00:39:13,316 --> 00:39:15,415
You'll be joined by athletes today.

1093
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:18,416
The most experienced one has been boxing for 11 months.

1094
00:39:18,446 --> 00:39:21,956
The least experienced one has been boxing for two months.

1095
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:23,355
- That's similar to us.
- "Two months?"

1096
00:39:23,356 --> 00:39:25,385
You've been up against people...

1097
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:26,795
- with such long careers.
- That's right.

1098
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:27,895
So now you're not sure about someone with 11 months.

1099
00:39:27,896 --> 00:39:29,565
- "That shouldn't be bad." - Wait.

1100
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,225
Wait. I mean, two months...

1101
00:39:32,226 --> 00:39:36,105
But by now, you should all know that what matters most...

1102
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:37,505
is how well you trained.

1103
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:39,405
To prepare for their competitions,

1104
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:42,335
- they've sparred 2 to 3 times.
- So they've been sparring.

1105
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,046
- That's a lot.
- Guys, do you remember?

1106
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,845
Whether or not they'll make good opponents...

1107
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,375
is something we should consider...

1108
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:49,745
- Yes!
- after meeting them.

1109
00:39:49,746 --> 00:39:50,746
- Yes.
- Okay.

1110
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,845
(The athletes approach the Iron Girls.)

1111
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:54,156
- Here they come.
- Here they come.

1112
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:56,726
Hello.

1113
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:58,526
- Hello.
- Hello.

1114
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,156
- Hello.
- Hello.

1115
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:02,896
- Hello.
- Hello.

1116
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:07,996
(The four mysterious athletes)

1117
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:13,135
(What kind of opponents are they?)

1118
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:15,475
- Hello. Please come here.
- Hello.

1119
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:17,196
They look like they're going to be so good.

1120
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:19,175
- They look so strong.
- They look like they'll be good.

1121
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:20,846
The last one looks really strong.

1122
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:22,585
The last one looks really strong.

1123
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,616
First, please introduce yourself.

1124
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:28,555
I've been boxing for two months,

1125
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,236
and I'm an office worker. I am Lim Eun Ji.

1126
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:35,696
(The first fighter)

1127
00:40:36,196 --> 00:40:39,835
(Lim Eun Ji, with 2 months of boxing experience)

1128
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:41,265
It doesn't feel like she boxed for two months.

1129
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:43,635
I have a good eye, and the way I see it,

1130
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:45,735
she doesn't give two-months vibes.

1131
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:46,852
(She exudes the vibe of a fighter from her build.)

1132
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:48,636
Have you ever played any other sport?

1133
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:50,476
I used to be a taekwondo athlete.

1134
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:52,676
(She almost had us fooled.)

1135
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:54,815
Her footwork must be insane.

1136
00:40:54,816 --> 00:40:57,045
I've been an athlete for about 20 years.

1137
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:58,522
(On top of that, she's been an athlete for about 20 years.)

1138
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,715
(Silenced)

1139
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:03,585
I won the World Taekwondo Junior Championships in high school.

1140
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,656
Did you say "World?"

1141
00:41:04,956 --> 00:41:05,996
"World?"

1142
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,326
"World."

1143
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,546
She had prepared for the Olympics. Tell us more.

1144
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,126
I was a youth national team member.

1145
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:13,665
As a senior athlete,

1146
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,466
I came in fourth place at the national team qualifiers.

1147
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,205
(She has an impressive career.)

1148
00:41:18,206 --> 00:41:19,236
That's insane.

1149
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:22,205
She has competed on the world stage.

1150
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:23,575
Right. The world stage.

1151
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:26,045
Can you show us your boxing position and kick?

1152
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:28,946
Can we see how you gain the upper hand? Just a sneak peek.

1153
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:31,316
- Did you prepare something?
- No, can you...

1154
00:41:31,386 --> 00:41:32,956
- Me?
- Can you hold this here?

1155
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:34,786
The mitt.

1156
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:36,226
Wait.

1157
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:38,856
You don't make mistakes, right?

1158
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,626
I've seen people miss and kick the hand instead, many times.

1159
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,326
No, I'm just going to do a roundhouse kick.

1160
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,235
(All eyes are on Eun Ji to see if she makes a mistake.)

1161
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,636
I'll just do a quick one.

1162
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:58,946
(The kick sent the glove flying out of the ring in an instant.)

1163
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:01,316
(Their jaws drop.)

1164
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:04,816
(The other fighters are shocked too.)

1165
00:42:05,216 --> 00:42:07,686
(But Eun Ji, herself, remains unfazed.)

1166
00:42:07,856 --> 00:42:09,186
I had such a strong grip on it.

1167
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,486
- The impact was...
- We could tell it was heavy.

1168
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,225
(He didn't even open his hand.)

1169
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:17,596
But boxing and taekwondo...

1170
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:19,995
because one is about the arms, the other is about the legs.

1171
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,166
- You're still doing footwork.
- Don't lie!

1172
00:42:22,396 --> 00:42:24,906
- You're still doing footwork.
- Don't lie!

1173
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,505
- You still do footwork.
- Right. You do footwork.

1174
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:28,005
The footwork may be similar,

1175
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:29,175
but they're completely different sports.

1176
00:42:29,176 --> 00:42:31,646
We were told that footwork is everything.

1177
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,775
- In boxing, footwork is everything.
- He said footwork is everything.

1178
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,845
"In boxing, footwork is everything. Punches come from footwork."

1179
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,286
"Punches come from footwork."

1180
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,786
Also, I noticed your form.

1181
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:42,486
Are you left-handed?

1182
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:43,855
I'm ambidextrous,

1183
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,856
but I fought from a left stance in taekwondo.

1184
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:48,895
- Are you left-handed in boxing too?
- Yes.

1185
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,195
She is a southpaw. We're doomed.

1186
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:51,525
- That's going to be tricky.
- They don't have that experience.

1187
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:52,795
- This will be our first.
- That's going to be tricky.

1188
00:42:52,796 --> 00:42:53,895
I am curious.

1189
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,665
- I'm really curious too.
- I'm looking forward to seeing it.

1190
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,735
- I look forward to it.
- Can the next fighter...

1191
00:42:57,736 --> 00:42:58,765
introduce herself, please?

1192
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:01,975
Hello, I've been boxing for eight months now.

1193
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:03,706
My name is Seol In Hee.

1194
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:09,016
(The second fighter)

1195
00:43:09,346 --> 00:43:12,816
(Seol In Hee, with 8 months of boxing experience)

1196
00:43:12,986 --> 00:43:17,156
I began boxing with the goal of losing weight.

1197
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:19,995
I've lost about 10kg.

1198
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:21,526
- That's amazing.
- "10kg?"

1199
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:23,695
- You lost 10kg?
- That's so impressive.

1200
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,865
I didn't think I'd be able to lose this much.

1201
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:28,336
But I can feel my stamina improving a lot,

1202
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:30,505
and it's starting to be fun for me.

1203
00:43:30,506 --> 00:43:32,905
If you're having fun, you must be good.

1204
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:34,836
Which part of it is fun for you?

1205
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:37,106
- Well...
- Hitting your opponent?

1206
00:43:37,546 --> 00:43:39,515
That too.

1207
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,275
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1208
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:42,615
I don't know that feeling.

1209
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,885
Doesn't she sound like a master?

1210
00:43:44,886 --> 00:43:46,116
The vibe she's giving off.

1211
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:47,586
She's kind of like us.

1212
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:50,286
(Meanwhile, next to the confident athele...)

1213
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,796
(these two boxers await their turn.)

1214
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,356
The two of you seem to be so nervous.

1215
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,796
Your faces are so red.

1216
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:01,136
(They can't hide their nervousness.)

1217
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:03,736
Your faces are so red.

1218
00:44:03,866 --> 00:44:05,335
The thing is,

1219
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:07,775
you can't let things like that fool you.

1220
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:08,976
- Right.
- In the match,

1221
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:10,975
(My bad)

1222
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:11,976
That's right.

1223
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:14,816
I see a lot of athletes in the waiting room.

1224
00:44:14,976 --> 00:44:16,645
They seem so nervous there,

1225
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:18,562
but then, in the ring, they turn into different people.

1226
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:19,755
- That's right.
- That's true.

1227
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:22,456
On the other hand, someone who is confident can perform poorly.

1228
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,855
For now, they say they're nervous.

1229
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:27,456
Let's hear who these two people are.

1230
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:29,666
Who will be the one who has 11 months of experience?

1231
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,995
Hello, I have been boxing for 11 months,

1232
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:34,635
and my name is Kim Yu Bin.

1233
00:44:34,636 --> 00:44:38,035
I'm an office worker, and I'm training in boxing.

1234
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:39,166
Gosh, 11 months?

1235
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:42,006
(The third fighter)

1236
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:46,216
(11 months of boxing experience, Kim Yu Bin)

1237
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:48,075
I heard that...

1238
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,745
you guys have 2 to 11 months of experience.

1239
00:44:49,746 --> 00:44:51,516
Then you must be the most experienced.

1240
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:53,385
Do you also have experience in competitions?

1241
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:54,855
Yes. This March,

1242
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:56,986
I attended the community sports competition,

1243
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:58,225
but I wasn't able to win.

1244
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,126
Unfortunately, I lost on points.

1245
00:45:00,926 --> 00:45:02,296
I lost on points,

1246
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:06,136
so I do want my hand to be raised one day.

1247
00:45:07,096 --> 00:45:08,235
That's cool.

1248
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:09,766
- You're my style.
- How cool.

1249
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:11,135
Were you nervous then?

1250
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:12,166
I was so nervous.

1251
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:14,235
Were you more nervous then or now?

1252
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:15,806
I think I'm more nervous now.

1253
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:18,246
- How cute.
- You're cute.

1254
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:20,416
You already want to fight, don't you?

1255
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,745
I'd rather just get it over with quickly.

1256
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:24,286
You'd rather?

1257
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,256
How did you first get into boxing?

1258
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:30,425
I was just watching videos about boxing and the matches,

1259
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,896
- and they looked so cool.
- Yes.

1260
00:45:32,956 --> 00:45:36,526
I was wanting to start exercising, so I just decided to go with boxing.

1261
00:45:37,396 --> 00:45:39,295
Do you know that even when you were smiling,

1262
00:45:39,296 --> 00:45:40,972
your eyes changed when you talked about boxing?

1263
00:45:40,996 --> 00:45:42,035
Me?

1264
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:43,235
You're a bit scary.

1265
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:45,166
She has the eyes of a fighter.

1266
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:47,905
- I can feel it.
- She's a bit hunched,

1267
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:50,045
and she talks like this.

1268
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:52,105
- She's ready to throw a punch.
- I mean,

1269
00:45:52,106 --> 00:45:54,576
why is your left foot out?

1270
00:45:55,346 --> 00:45:56,585
Let me tell you in advance.

1271
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:57,846
You need to watch out.

1272
00:45:57,986 --> 00:46:00,886
Hello, I am a university student.

1273
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:03,276
I have been boxing for eight months, and I am Lim Sun Woo.

1274
00:46:05,156 --> 00:46:08,426
(The fourth fighter)

1275
00:46:08,656 --> 00:46:12,366
(8 months of boxing experience, Lim Sun Woo)

1276
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:15,296
I attended the community sports competition twice.

1277
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:17,905
(Two times in 8 months?)

1278
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:19,365
My record is two fights, one win and one loss.

1279
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:20,905
- Two fights, 1 win and 1 loss?
- Yes.

1280
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,305
That's cool.

1281
00:46:22,306 --> 00:46:23,375
She's good.

1282
00:46:23,376 --> 00:46:25,076
It's so cool that she can even say that.

1283
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:26,546
I used to do...

1284
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,175
another sport.

1285
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:30,215
What was it?

1286
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:32,115
When I was in my third year of middle school,

1287
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:33,685
in order to relieve stress from studying,

1288
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:35,416
I went to a jiu-jitsu gym.

1289
00:46:35,786 --> 00:46:38,325
What? When you were in your third year of middle school?

1290
00:46:38,326 --> 00:46:39,485
(Excuse me. You went where?)

1291
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:42,755
I'm currently a blue belt.

1292
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:43,825
That's so good.

1293
00:46:43,826 --> 00:46:44,865
You're so good.

1294
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:46,146
You did it for more than a year.

1295
00:46:46,996 --> 00:46:48,235
You're so good.

1296
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:49,705
(It's very difficult to advance in jiu-jitsu.)

1297
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,735
You did jiu-jitsu, and then?

1298
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:53,376
While doing jiu-jitsu, I did MMA too.

1299
00:46:53,706 --> 00:46:56,405
(You also did mixed martial arts?)

1300
00:46:56,406 --> 00:46:58,822
I also attended the community sports competition for MMA once.

1301
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:00,176
- In MMA?
- Yes.

1302
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:02,275
- Did you win?
- Yes, well...

1303
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:03,745
I did win on points,

1304
00:47:03,746 --> 00:47:05,686
but I was really bad then.

1305
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:09,515
But luckily, I was able to win.

1306
00:47:09,516 --> 00:47:11,562
(She was a fighter who experienced a win on points.)

1307
00:47:11,586 --> 00:47:14,125
No wonder your lower abdomen looks strong.

1308
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,095
- Yes, she has a great body.
- It seems different.

1309
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:18,072
(Her build and aura were impressive from the beginning.)

1310
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:20,735
- She's a true martial artist.
- Exactly.

1311
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:21,935
Don't be tricked by the eight months of boxing experience.

1312
00:47:21,936 --> 00:47:23,805
- Her eight years in boxing...
- She's an elite.

1313
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:27,076
When she said she was nervous, she was just pretending to.

1314
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:29,776
She melted my heart, but...

1315
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,546
- She won't be easy.
- They are all so strong.

1316
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,015
And now, they sent over...

1317
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:36,445
- the match list.
- The most important part.

1318
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,546
- The match list.
- The match list.

1319
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:41,355
- Why are you holding it?
- I will announce it.

1320
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:43,426
The weight class and age were taken into account...

1321
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:45,155
when setting the match list.

1322
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:46,396
It was done fairly.

1323
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:48,826
For the first match,

1324
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:50,266
Keum Sae Rok,

1325
00:47:50,596 --> 00:47:51,725
please step forward.

1326
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:53,366
(Sae Rok in the Blue Corner)

1327
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:54,735
Your opponent is...

1328
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:56,305
(Red Corner)

1329
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,435
Lim Eun Ji.

1330
00:47:57,436 --> 00:48:01,206
(Eun Ji in the Red Corner)

1331
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:04,645
(Astounded)

1332
00:48:04,646 --> 00:48:05,846
No way.

1333
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:08,446
(The former member of the youth taekwondo national team)

1334
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:10,715
Stand facing each other for the face-off.

1335
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:11,785
Stand close.

1336
00:48:11,786 --> 00:48:13,492
- It's a southpaw again. Gosh.
- A southpaw.

1337
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,615
- Goodness.
- She's a southpaw.

1338
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:16,056
Goodness. What do I do?

1339
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,525
- I'm already baffled.
- She's already baffled.

1340
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:19,586
Sae Rok.

1341
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:21,232
- Don't chicken out.
- It's all about energy.

1342
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:22,355
Sae Rok, your eyes!

1343
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,126
(She turns her Spirited Sae Rok mode on.)

1344
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:28,296
They have similar height.

1345
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:30,636
- You're right.
- She's tall.

1346
00:48:30,736 --> 00:48:32,096
- Please face forward.
- Yes, sir.

1347
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,175
(Keum Sae Rok versus Lim Eun Ji, Round 1)

1348
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:37,205
(Age: 32, 34)

1349
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,375
(Height: 169cm, 171cm)

1350
00:48:38,376 --> 00:48:39,376
(Experience: 2 months, 2 months)

1351
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:41,375
Uie and Seol In Hee.

1352
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,815
(Uie versus Seol In Hee, Round 2)

1353
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:44,762
(Age: 37, 27, Height: 172cm, 160cm, Experience: 2 months, 2 months)

1354
00:48:44,786 --> 00:48:46,245
Seol In Ah and Lim Sun Woo.

1355
00:48:46,246 --> 00:48:47,485
(Seol In Ah versus Lim Sun Woo, Round 3)

1356
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:49,432
(Age: 29, 22, Height: 167cm, 164cm, Experience: 2 months, 8 months)

1357
00:48:49,456 --> 00:48:51,885
Park Ju Hyun against Kim Yu Bin.

1358
00:48:51,886 --> 00:48:52,925
(Park Ju Hyun versus Kim Yu Bin, Round 4)

1359
00:48:52,926 --> 00:48:54,155
(Age: 30, 25, Height: 166cm, 157cm, Experience: 2 months, 11 months)

1360
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:56,125
Today's sparring won't have an outcome.

1361
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:58,595
And it will have the same rules as last time.

1362
00:48:58,596 --> 00:49:01,195
However, I heard that there is a slight difference, like time.

1363
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:02,335
Today's sparring...

1364
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:04,606
will consist of 2 rounds of 2 minutes.

1365
00:49:04,706 --> 00:49:06,305
- It's two minutes today?
- Yes.

1366
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,535
If you go to the competition,

1367
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:09,975
you have to fight seriously as soon as it begins.

1368
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:11,575
Two minutes of sparring is like...

1369
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:15,916
a minute and 30 seconds in the competition.

1370
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:20,485
That's why in order to train the strength for that time,

1371
00:49:20,486 --> 00:49:22,286
it is even often trained up to three minutes.

1372
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:25,285
And the rest time will be 40 seconds.

1373
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:26,286
- Okay.
- Okay.

1374
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:27,495
Great, then...

1375
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:29,016
- please prepare for the match.
- Yes.

1376
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:32,795
(The Iron Girls' second sparring)

1377
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:34,595
The first match.

1378
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,735
Lim Eun Ji and Keum Sae Rok.

1379
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:37,866
Please step forward.

1380
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:39,975
(The first fighter is Sae Rok.)

1381
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,275
It could be tight.

1382
00:49:41,276 --> 00:49:42,376
It's okay.

1383
00:49:42,736 --> 00:49:43,805
How is this?

1384
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:44,806
It's good.

1385
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:46,207
(She nervously puts on the gloves.)

1386
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:48,076
Let's go.

1387
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:50,486
(Feeling the tension)

1388
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:51,745
I can do it.

1389
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:52,986
(I can do it!)

1390
00:49:53,316 --> 00:49:54,856
Let's try the footwork today.

1391
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:58,825
(Since it is her second time doing the full sparring, )

1392
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:01,025
(Sae Rok is determined on another level.)

1393
00:50:01,026 --> 00:50:02,625
Sae Rok, seriously,

1394
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:04,025
- you have no reason to be nervous.
- Yes.

1395
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:05,895
- Just stay calm.
- Okay.

1396
00:50:05,896 --> 00:50:07,096
- Alright?
- Yes.

1397
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,295
Turn, backstep, backstep, two, backstep, two.

1398
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:10,805
If you keep that going,

1399
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:12,206
you have much better footwork.

1400
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:14,076
Just remember that.

1401
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:16,905
(She has only 2 months of experience in boxing, )

1402
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:18,882
(but she conquered the world with her taekwondo skills.)

1403
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:23,845
(And she is a southpaw, which is more challenging.)

1404
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,886
Her footwork is amazing. Her taekwondo footwork.

1405
00:50:27,656 --> 00:50:29,655
Taekwondo athletes are so swift.

1406
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:32,055
They can spin so quickly.

1407
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:33,926
I saw her for a second, and she is amazing.

1408
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:37,465
(A tough opponent, )

1409
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:40,196
(but she cannot step back.)

1410
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,535
Please come here. Enter.

1411
00:50:42,536 --> 00:50:44,965
(It is time to start the match.)

1412
00:50:44,966 --> 00:50:46,305
Please play fair.

1413
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:48,035
It's 2 rounds of 2-minute sparring.

1414
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:49,175
Please play fair,

1415
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:50,575
and no attacking the back of the head.

1416
00:50:50,576 --> 00:50:51,776
And of course, you can't kick.

1417
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:54,076
Even if you're confused, you can't kick.

1418
00:50:54,716 --> 00:50:55,745
Back to your corners.

1419
00:50:55,746 --> 00:50:57,886
(Back to their own corners)

1420
00:50:58,018 --> 00:50:59,177
Back to your corners.

1421
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:01,387
(Back to their own corners)

1422
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:02,488
Deep breath.

1423
00:51:02,788 --> 00:51:05,057
Take it easy, okay?

1424
00:51:05,058 --> 00:51:06,628
Think of it as a lesson.

1425
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:08,128
Let's go, Sae Rok.

1426
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:09,357
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1427
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,558
(Sae Rok is ready to fight.)

1428
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:12,997
Don't get nervous, starting now.

1429
00:51:12,998 --> 00:51:14,068
Okay.

1430
00:51:14,568 --> 00:51:15,667
Box!

1431
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:16,968
(Round 1 begins.)

1432
00:51:17,098 --> 00:51:18,168
Box!

1433
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:26,277
(Sae Rok tries to attack first.)

1434
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:27,548
(Stepping back)

1435
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:31,647
That's it.

1436
00:51:31,648 --> 00:51:32,778
Let's go.

1437
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:34,218
Push forward. It's too far.

1438
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,248
Step forward.

1439
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:38,817
(Sae Rok's parry)

1440
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:40,228
(Parry, two, stepping back again)

1441
00:51:40,428 --> 00:51:42,108
(Her opponent counterattacks immediately.)

1442
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:44,398
Gosh, look at her footwork. It's crazy.

1443
00:51:44,698 --> 00:51:46,728
Her footwork is great, so she can shuffle well.

1444
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:50,737
(You can quickly tell that her feet are quick.)

1445
00:51:50,738 --> 00:51:52,868
She's using taekwondo skills in boxing.

1446
00:51:53,038 --> 00:51:54,538
She's using taekwondo footwork.

1447
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:56,577
- Her footwork is amazing.
- Throw it.

1448
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:58,258
She's so good at shuffling. She's too far.

1449
00:51:58,678 --> 00:52:00,977
(With the ex-taekwondoist's footwork, )

1450
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:03,018
(Sae Rok is having a hard time from the beginning.)

1451
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:05,848
(The opponent attacks quickly.)

1452
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:10,088
(She got hit with a straight punch.)

1453
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:12,358
(She attacks and quickly adjusts the distance.)

1454
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:17,357
(Due to the opponent's swift transitions, )

1455
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:19,928
(she can only keep the opponent in check.)

1456
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,198
Go up.

1457
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:23,337
Step forward.

1458
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:24,368
It should be this side.

1459
00:52:24,468 --> 00:52:25,697
Throw it.

1460
00:52:25,698 --> 00:52:26,908
(She needs to attack now.)

1461
00:52:28,468 --> 00:52:29,608
Watch the feet.

1462
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:32,278
- That's it.
- Push forward.

1463
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:34,808
(1 valid strike)

1464
00:52:36,078 --> 00:52:37,678
(2 valid strikes)

1465
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:41,047
- It's okay.
- You have to go in.

1466
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:42,118
You can do it.

1467
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:43,887
Just don't lose the tension.

1468
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:45,617
(But...)

1469
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:48,227
(The opponent quickly steps back...)

1470
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,728
(and attacks right away.)

1471
00:52:51,058 --> 00:52:53,598
(The punch comes in with a long reach.)

1472
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:56,697
- Throw it.
- That was close.

1473
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:58,668
Use your waist. Go lower.

1474
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:00,007
- You can do it.
- Good.

1475
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:01,637
- That's it.
- Good.

1476
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:02,667
Use your fist.

1477
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:05,538
(She gets hit with a straight punch.)

1478
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,277
(She was able to make a valid strike with a jab.)

1479
00:53:09,278 --> 00:53:10,818
- That's it.
- Go on.

1480
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:12,077
You can go forward.

1481
00:53:12,078 --> 00:53:15,687
(The two fighters look for the right timing.)

1482
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,218
- You can do it.
- Go for it.

1483
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:19,587
(Feint)

1484
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:20,758
- With the hand.
- That's it.

1485
00:53:22,128 --> 00:53:26,767
(After keeping in check, )

1486
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:30,038
(another valid strike)

1487
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:34,768
(Spending more time on checking the opponent)

1488
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,468
That's right.

1489
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:40,478
(A heavy straight)

1490
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:41,608
Again.

1491
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,689
- That's right.
- You have to fight back right away.

1492
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:46,548
Watch the opponent coming.

1493
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,818
(Waiting for a chance to attack again)

1494
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:50,618
That's it. Good.

1495
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:52,894
The opponent is good at dodging. She's too far.

1496
00:53:52,918 --> 00:53:54,628
That's far enough for a kick.

1497
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:56,364
They're boxing, but that's far enough for a kick.

1498
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:58,028
Do your footwork. Have the composure.

1499
00:53:58,098 --> 00:53:59,928
- Yes. Nice jab.
- Yes.

1500
00:54:01,098 --> 00:54:02,468
(Sae Rok jabs first.)

1501
00:54:02,728 --> 00:54:05,137
(Valid strike 1, 2, 3)

1502
00:54:05,138 --> 00:54:06,567
(The opponent's series of counterattacks)

1503
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:07,568
Fight on!

1504
00:54:08,308 --> 00:54:11,838
(After attacking, she keeps on check again.)

1505
00:54:13,478 --> 00:54:14,508
Ten seconds.

1506
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:16,918
Turn around.

1507
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:18,978
Stop. Again.

1508
00:54:19,748 --> 00:54:20,817
Turn around.

1509
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:23,048
(Sae Rok lost her balance.)

1510
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:24,258
Okay. Box!

1511
00:54:24,758 --> 00:54:25,818
Go, Sae Rok.

1512
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:27,787
Watch her fists.

1513
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:30,598
(Keep faking without giving up to the end)

1514
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:32,928
- Stop.
- It's okay.

1515
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:35,198
(Sighing)

1516
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:38,438
(Sighing with regret)

1517
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:40,367
- It's okay.
- You can do it.

1518
00:54:40,368 --> 00:54:41,968
Sae Rok, it's okay. It's only Round One.

1519
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:44,778
- She's good at backing up.
- The opponent has good footwork.

1520
00:54:45,278 --> 00:54:46,638
She's very good at backing up.

1521
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:48,808
She won't give me a chance to throw a punch.

1522
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:51,377
The opponent keeps staying still and punches quickly.

1523
00:54:51,378 --> 00:54:53,178
So while jabbing,

1524
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:56,217
try sliding and hitting, okay?

1525
00:54:56,218 --> 00:54:57,657
It's okay. You're doing great. Take a deep breath.

1526
00:54:57,658 --> 00:54:59,364
(Planning to attack with dodge and hit in Round 2)

1527
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:00,458
Punch a lot.

1528
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:03,927
Your left hand is too low.

1529
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:05,998
Keep your chin down.

1530
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:08,827
Don't jab. Go two-one-two.

1531
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:10,497
- Don't use one-two anymore.
- Okay.

1532
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:11,538
She's so fast.

1533
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:14,938
(Catching her breath calmly)

1534
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,438
(Round 2 begins.)

1535
00:55:17,638 --> 00:55:19,678
- Go for two.
- Two!

1536
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:20,978
Don't give up.

1537
00:55:26,378 --> 00:55:28,388
One-two. You got it.

1538
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:31,387
(The opponent makes a sudden series of attacks.)

1539
00:55:31,388 --> 00:55:32,587
(Valid strike 1)

1540
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:35,257
(The opponent makes a sudden series of attacks.)

1541
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:36,258
(Valid strike 2)

1542
00:55:38,298 --> 00:55:41,398
(Sae Rok tries to attack despite getting hit.)

1543
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:44,897
Use your fists.

1544
00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:45,938
Turn around.

1545
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:47,438
(Valid strike)

1546
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:48,959
(They throw punches at the same time.)

1547
00:55:49,738 --> 00:55:51,837
(But due to the opponent's long reach, )

1548
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:53,108
(Sae Rok's punch didn't reach.)

1549
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,347
Look how she backs out.

1550
00:55:54,348 --> 00:55:55,878
She's reading the footwork.

1551
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:57,318
Sae Rok, you can do the same.

1552
00:55:57,918 --> 00:55:59,518
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

1553
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:02,188
(Sae Rok makes a feint to make the opponent attack.)

1554
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:04,458
(The opponent fell for Sae Rok's feint.)

1555
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:06,218
You should've thrown a hook.

1556
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:07,227
(However, she missed her chance while hesitating.)

1557
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:08,858
You have to fight back.

1558
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,157
Wait for her to come in.

1559
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:12,257
(When Sae Rok throws a two...)

1560
00:56:12,258 --> 00:56:14,568
Oh, her foot...

1561
00:56:14,968 --> 00:56:17,237
(She tries to kick by instinct.)

1562
00:56:17,238 --> 00:56:19,698
Don't raise your foot.

1563
00:56:21,008 --> 00:56:22,008
(Reorganizing her footwork)

1564
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:24,208
- Go.
- You can do it.

1565
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:25,784
When she goes back, you can go back too.

1566
00:56:25,808 --> 00:56:27,578
Go back. Cut her out.

1567
00:56:27,748 --> 00:56:28,748
(Valid strike 1)

1568
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:29,947
(Valid strike 2)

1569
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:31,148
(Valid strike 3)

1570
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:32,348
(Valid strike 4)

1571
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,348
(Valid strike 5)

1572
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:35,948
(5 constant valid strikes)

1573
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:39,358
(After attacking, she backs out.)

1574
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:41,398
- Gosh. She's fast.
- Don't stop your footwork.

1575
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:44,658
- Keep your guard up.
- You can do it.

1576
00:56:47,468 --> 00:56:48,527
(Looking for the timing)

1577
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:50,298
Your opponent is just as tired.

1578
00:56:52,968 --> 00:56:54,267
Keep punching.

1579
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:55,814
- Keep punching.
- Keep trying one-two.

1580
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:57,598
Throw your one-two. Why aren't you doing it?

1581
00:56:57,978 --> 00:56:59,338
- Give it a try.
- Punch.

1582
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:00,547
Keep your guard up.

1583
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:01,977
Try. That's right.

1584
00:57:01,978 --> 00:57:03,308
(The slugfest begins.)

1585
00:57:05,418 --> 00:57:06,418
Punch.

1586
00:57:06,648 --> 00:57:08,687
Try. That's right.

1587
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:10,418
Punch. Yes.

1588
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:13,318
Keep your guard up.

1589
00:57:13,988 --> 00:57:15,908
It's better to get in there. Yes, that's better.

1590
00:57:15,988 --> 00:57:17,897
Yes, it's better to get in there.

1591
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:19,757
Get in there. That's it.

1592
00:57:19,758 --> 00:57:21,097
- Get in there. That's better.
- Okay.

1593
00:57:21,098 --> 00:57:22,968
Get in there. Yes. That's better.

1594
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:26,398
(Sae Rok continues pushing the opponent.)

1595
00:57:26,468 --> 00:57:28,468
- Yes. Don't back out.
- Get in there.

1596
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,738
That's it.

1597
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:32,738
(Her punch accuracy is dropping.)

1598
00:57:32,878 --> 00:57:34,808
Try. It's okay.

1599
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:36,107
- Get in there.
- You can do it.

1600
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:38,348
- Yes! Get in there.
- Yes.

1601
00:57:39,378 --> 00:57:43,188
(A perfectly landed valid strike)

1602
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:45,458
- Yes! Get in there.
- Yes.

1603
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:46,717
Keep your guard up.

1604
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:48,658
(Cross-counter)

1605
00:57:49,288 --> 00:57:50,628
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

1606
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:53,728
- Ten seconds.
- Go in.

1607
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:55,798
- Good.
- Yes.

1608
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,468
(A brutal physical fight continues.)

1609
00:58:00,468 --> 00:58:02,538
(She keeps an eye on the opponent...)

1610
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,084
(and continues to throw a punch without giving up.)

1611
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:07,848
(Round 2 ends.)

1612
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:09,568
- Okay.
- Sae Rok, you were energetic.

1613
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:12,317
Good job.

1614
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:13,918
Good job, Keum Sae Rok.

1615
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:16,548
You tried until the end. Good job.

1616
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:19,257
Sae Rok, you were so dogged.

1617
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:21,187
She was a tough opponent.

1618
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:23,227
- She was so picky.
- That was really hard.

1619
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,258
- She was very hard.
- She was a picky opponent.

1620
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,167
She was pickier than those who learned boxing for fun...

1621
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:29,488
- for 3 or 4 years.
- He's right.

1622
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:31,768
Just for being good at backing up...

1623
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:33,938
A boxer like her is hard to defeat.

1624
00:58:34,038 --> 00:58:36,037
Sae Rok, you had a very good experience today.

1625
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:37,108
That's true.

1626
00:58:37,278 --> 00:58:40,078
Let's bring in the coaches and the boxers.

1627
00:58:40,178 --> 00:58:42,878
That was a great game. Let's give it up for them.

1628
00:58:43,408 --> 00:58:45,048
- Gosh.
- That was amazing.

1629
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:46,878
(Shaking her head)

1630
00:58:47,018 --> 00:58:49,718
She's very good at backing up.

1631
00:58:50,018 --> 00:58:51,488
She showed fancy footwork.

1632
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:55,027
- When I attacked, it didn't work.
- Right.

1633
00:58:55,028 --> 00:58:57,198
So it was really frustrating and upsetting.

1634
00:58:57,828 --> 00:59:00,548
I'm not sure if boxing and taekwondo have the same kind of footwork.

1635
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:02,327
You were like a professional boxer.

1636
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:03,648
- Your footwork was...
- Totally.

1637
00:59:03,768 --> 00:59:05,238
- Gosh.
- It was crazy.

1638
00:59:05,738 --> 00:59:07,337
I was deceived by your two months of experience.

1639
00:59:07,338 --> 00:59:09,214
(The scary taekwondo footwork is rare in boxing.)

1640
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:12,107
This is why footwork is important in boxing.

1641
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:13,108
- Okay?
- Yes.

1642
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:15,408
It was victory to her feet.

1643
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:17,958
And she put on a series of blows that I'd always wanted to do.

1644
00:59:18,678 --> 00:59:20,317
It was the best.

1645
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,218
Let's hear from Lim Eun Ji. How was it?

1646
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:26,717
Even though she doesn't have much experience,

1647
00:59:26,718 --> 00:59:28,857
she was very enthusiastic.

1648
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,558
And above all, her stamina is very good.

1649
00:59:31,898 --> 00:59:32,898
Me?

1650
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:34,028
(Giggling)

1651
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:37,668
Her stamina was so good that I couldn't concentrate at the end.

1652
00:59:37,738 --> 00:59:39,468
As it went...

1653
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,937
- Your stamina is very good.
- Yes.

1654
00:59:41,938 --> 00:59:44,607
Sae Rok had good stamina near the end.

1655
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:45,708
- Right.
- Yes.

1656
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:49,208
I did my best to do the footwork...

1657
00:59:49,308 --> 00:59:51,048
compared to before.

1658
00:59:51,378 --> 00:59:54,217
- I often waited and hit...
- Yes.

1659
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:55,787
Until now.

1660
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:57,687
I wanted to be aggressive...

1661
00:59:57,688 --> 01:00:02,087
and fight with enthusiasm until the end today.

1662
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:03,587
Is that why you went for it near the end?

1663
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:04,627
- I see.
- Good job.

1664
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:06,528
Even if I get hit,

1665
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:08,527
just keep my guard up...

1666
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:10,268
and hit the opponent for at least once.

1667
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,837
(Sae Rok's second full sparring results:)

1668
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,377
(Due to lack of stamina, her footwork was rather timid.)

1669
01:00:17,378 --> 01:00:22,108
(Her footwork became enthusiastic and aggressive.)

1670
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:27,948
(Strengths: Instinctive sense of distance for a chance to attack)

1671
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:32,317
(Points to improve: Her front foot lost balance...)

1672
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,788
(which resulted in a big punch.)

1673
01:00:37,028 --> 01:00:38,627
- Because it's sparring, - Yes.

1674
01:00:38,628 --> 01:00:40,127
There's no win or loss.

1675
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:42,067
You're both winners.

1676
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:43,428
Let's give it up for them.

1677
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:46,067
Thank you.

1678
01:00:46,068 --> 01:00:48,167
You had good experience.

1679
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,737
(Good job.)

1680
01:00:49,738 --> 01:00:52,478
Good job. Now, let's get ready for the second game.

1681
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:55,408
Seol In Hee and Uie, please come forward.

1682
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:59,018
(The most nervous moment)

1683
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:01,518
- You know you can do it.
- Yes.

1684
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:04,857
- Are you nervous?
- No, I'm okay.

1685
01:01:04,858 --> 01:01:05,918
No need to be nervous.

1686
01:01:06,118 --> 01:01:07,787
As always, once it's over, it's no big deal.

1687
01:01:07,788 --> 01:01:09,187
Imagine you're sparring against us.

1688
01:01:09,188 --> 01:01:10,188
Okay.

1689
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:21,908
(Uie's opponent...)

1690
01:01:22,408 --> 01:01:24,338
(has 8 months of boxing experience.)

1691
01:01:24,978 --> 01:01:28,348
(The person with solid basic skills)

1692
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:31,248
Don't let your legs move or you can't make a continuous blow.

1693
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:32,978
Turn your waist.

1694
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:39,518
(It's time for the two fighters to enter the ring.)

1695
01:01:39,858 --> 01:01:41,757
Think of it as if you're going to throw 100 punches.

1696
01:01:41,758 --> 01:01:43,488
- Just do it.
- Okay.

1697
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:45,857
Enter. Come forward.

1698
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:46,928
Uie, you can do it.

1699
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,768
It's Seol In Hee versus Uie.

1700
01:01:50,198 --> 01:01:51,667
Play fair.

1701
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:53,908
As you saw, it's 2 rounds of 2 minutes.

1702
01:01:54,038 --> 01:01:55,738
- Corner.
- Good luck.

1703
01:01:56,668 --> 01:01:58,037
Think about your goal.

1704
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:00,847
(Uie prepares for the game more calmly than usual.)

1705
01:02:00,848 --> 01:02:02,048
Go, Kim Yu Jin.

1706
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:04,147
(Uie's ready to play.)

1707
01:02:04,148 --> 01:02:05,178
Okay?

1708
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:06,478
Okay.

1709
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:08,188
Box.

1710
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:10,088
(Round 1 begins.)

1711
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,658
(The two fight from the start.)

1712
01:02:19,098 --> 01:02:21,168
Punch.

1713
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:23,968
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

1714
01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:25,838
(They exchange valid strikes.)

1715
01:02:26,068 --> 01:02:27,137
(Valid strike)

1716
01:02:27,138 --> 01:02:29,908
(Uie attacks one more time.)

1717
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,818
(The two fighters attack with enthusiasm.)

1718
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:34,447
That's right.

1719
01:02:34,448 --> 01:02:36,978
(Valid strike on each other again)

1720
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:40,718
(The opponent's strong straight)

1721
01:02:40,918 --> 01:02:43,858
Don't get too close. Fight using only jabs.

1722
01:02:44,558 --> 01:02:48,988
(Uie calculates the distance and waits for a chance to jab.)

1723
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,458
(They punch at the same time.)

1724
01:02:52,658 --> 01:02:54,327
(Valid strike)

1725
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:57,008
(Uie succeeds in making a valid strike thanks to the gap in reach.)

1726
01:02:57,768 --> 01:03:00,098
When you jab, her punch breaks.

1727
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:03,338
Focus on jabs. Yes. Just focus on your jabs.

1728
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:05,577
- Dodge, dodge, punch.
- Yes.

1729
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:08,278
(Followed by one-two)

1730
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:15,487
(One, two, one, two)

1731
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:17,257
Yes. You got it.

1732
01:03:17,258 --> 01:03:18,988
- Focus.
- She has good stamina.

1733
01:03:19,158 --> 01:03:20,158
Punch.

1734
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:23,058
(Endless jab using her endless stamina)

1735
01:03:23,658 --> 01:03:24,727
- Punch.
- You got it.

1736
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:26,357
(Jab again)

1737
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:28,067
- Good job.
- Punch.

1738
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:29,127
She has good stamina.

1739
01:03:29,128 --> 01:03:30,428
Jab is all she needs.

1740
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:33,537
(She attempts one jab after another.)

1741
01:03:33,538 --> 01:03:35,738
The opponent is flustered.

1742
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:38,238
The opponent is getting tired.

1743
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:41,078
- She has good stamina.
- Push her.

1744
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:43,147
Push her.

1745
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:45,377
- Focus.
- You have the power.

1746
01:03:45,378 --> 01:03:47,177
(Uie focuses and waits for a chance to attack.)

1747
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:48,248
Keep going.

1748
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:51,058
(Valid strike)

1749
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:54,988
(Valid strike 1, 2)

1750
01:03:56,728 --> 01:03:59,798
Don't let the opponent rest. She wants to rest.

1751
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:01,997
- Yes.
- Don't let her rest.

1752
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:04,268
She's resting. If you let her rest, she'll come at you.

1753
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:05,798
That's right.

1754
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:07,908
(Uie's one-two, the opponent's body shot)

1755
01:04:08,808 --> 01:04:10,808
You have to go in. You can do it.

1756
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,138
That's it.

1757
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:17,348
(She throws a jab where it is open.)

1758
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:22,287
(Taking a deep breath)

1759
01:04:22,288 --> 01:04:23,418
Yes. Try again.

1760
01:04:24,118 --> 01:04:25,358
Yes. Again.

1761
01:04:25,558 --> 01:04:28,687
One more time.

1762
01:04:28,688 --> 01:04:29,688
(Valid strike 1)

1763
01:04:29,689 --> 01:04:31,257
(She's hit by the opponent's strike big time.)

1764
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:32,538
(Valid strike 1, Valid strike 2)

1765
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:35,267
(But Uie continues to jab.)

1766
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:36,398
(Valid strike 3)

1767
01:04:37,768 --> 01:04:40,468
(The opponent dashes fiercely.)

1768
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:43,307
(Counterattacking with endless one-two)

1769
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:44,907
Turn around. Yes.

1770
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:46,707
Get in there right away.

1771
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:48,377
(The exhausted opponent keeps a distance.)

1772
01:04:48,378 --> 01:04:49,577
She's just as exhausted.

1773
01:04:49,578 --> 01:04:50,718
Keep going. That's right.

1774
01:04:51,718 --> 01:04:52,718
Again.

1775
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:54,218
- Push harder.
- Try it again.

1776
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:58,858
(Uie continues to punch without a break.)

1777
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:03,188
(Round 1 ends.)

1778
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:06,027
(Finishing up with a buzzer beater)

1779
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:07,157
Good job.

1780
01:05:07,158 --> 01:05:08,998
- Right on the bell.
- Good job.

1781
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:11,844
I think the opponent got hit by her jab like 30 times.

1782
01:05:11,868 --> 01:05:13,737
Wasn't that like 40 times?

1783
01:05:13,738 --> 01:05:14,968
She was good.

1784
01:05:15,238 --> 01:05:17,608
Your shoulders are too tight.

1785
01:05:17,938 --> 01:05:19,307
Just relax and jab.

1786
01:05:19,308 --> 01:05:22,147
You're facing all the attacks...

1787
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:24,117
because you're so stiff.

1788
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:25,177
Okay.

1789
01:05:25,178 --> 01:05:27,147
Just make a feint and go for one-two.

1790
01:05:27,148 --> 01:05:29,447
If you make four punches, you're guaranteed to hit her.

1791
01:05:29,448 --> 01:05:31,287
One, two, three, and four. Okay?

1792
01:05:31,288 --> 01:05:32,318
Yes.

1793
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:35,658
Don't be nervous. That's not what you usually do.

1794
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,498
If you see your chance, get close immediately.

1795
01:05:38,728 --> 01:05:40,257
And don't just wait.

1796
01:05:40,258 --> 01:05:42,267
Don't back out.

1797
01:05:42,268 --> 01:05:43,568
You have to push her.

1798
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:47,867
We only have two things to do. Parrying and the body shot.

1799
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:49,138
- Yes.
- Okay?

1800
01:05:49,508 --> 01:05:51,714
- Kim Yu Jin, you're doing great.
- Do you have stamina left?

1801
01:05:51,738 --> 01:05:52,977
Make sure to use it all.

1802
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:54,877
- Use up your stamina.
- Use it all up.

1803
01:05:54,878 --> 01:05:56,208
You're doing great.

1804
01:05:57,308 --> 01:05:59,278
(Round 2 begins.)

1805
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,458
Last two minutes.

1806
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:07,757
Something big is coming. That's right.

1807
01:06:07,758 --> 01:06:08,788
Cross.

1808
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,198
(Valid strike 1, 2)

1809
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:14,797
(Due to the gap in reach, only Uie's strike was valid.)

1810
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:16,598
(Valid strike 4, 5)

1811
01:06:18,468 --> 01:06:21,238
- Yes. Just one-two.
- Yes.

1812
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:25,007
(Uie's continuous jab)

1813
01:06:25,008 --> 01:06:28,748
- Yes.
- Yes. Again.

1814
01:06:29,348 --> 01:06:30,507
Yes.

1815
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:33,248
(The opponent's strong straight)

1816
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:39,558
(Fighting back with a continuous jab)

1817
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:44,158
(Uie slowly takes over the flow by cornering the opponent.)

1818
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:48,498
If she touches your lead hand, go for two, one, two.

1819
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,097
Punch.

1820
01:06:51,098 --> 01:06:54,108
(The opponent tries the body blow.)

1821
01:06:54,508 --> 01:06:56,337
She's going for the body because she can't reach the face.

1822
01:06:56,338 --> 01:06:57,368
Make a deep punch.

1823
01:06:58,108 --> 01:07:02,948
(Uie avoids the attack with quick footwork.)

1824
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:04,477
Make a deep punch.

1825
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,778
(The opponent continues to look for a chance to attack.)

1826
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:09,418
(Valid strike)

1827
01:07:09,419 --> 01:07:10,748
(A huge gap in reach)

1828
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:14,088
- Do what you practiced.
- Okay.

1829
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:18,358
(The opponent's body shot)

1830
01:07:21,728 --> 01:07:23,828
(A heavy hook)

1831
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:26,568
(Counterattacking with a jab)

1832
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:29,308
- Gosh. Her jab is crazy...
- Yes!

1833
01:07:29,608 --> 01:07:30,608
Yes.

1834
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:34,248
(Uie's endless one-two begins again.)

1835
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:38,018
(Accurate one-two)

1836
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:42,888
(The opponent's unyielding straight)

1837
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,818
Try it again.

1838
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:47,888
(Followed by the body shot)

1839
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:52,258
(The opponent keeps a distance again.)

1840
01:07:53,628 --> 01:07:55,628
Uie, your opponent is resting.

1841
01:07:55,728 --> 01:07:56,868
She's coming in.

1842
01:07:56,928 --> 01:07:58,198
- Cross. Yes.
- Yes.

1843
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:02,008
(Succeeding in attacking before the opponent)

1844
01:08:03,338 --> 01:08:07,138
(Punching at the same time)

1845
01:08:08,048 --> 01:08:09,048
(Going for the body)

1846
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:11,648
(Fighting back with a jab)

1847
01:08:13,148 --> 01:08:14,248
Again.

1848
01:08:15,688 --> 01:08:16,717
Try it one more time.

1849
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:19,018
(Both fighters don't give up until the end.)

1850
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:20,817
Quickly. Yes. Again.

1851
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:22,688
Punch again. Again.

1852
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:24,227
- Stop.
- Okay.

1853
01:08:24,228 --> 01:08:26,457
(Round 2 ends.)

1854
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,127
Good job.

1855
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:29,398
Go to your...

1856
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:32,137
You can go now. You can greet her now.

1857
01:08:32,138 --> 01:08:34,208
Uie, that was great.

1858
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,868
Good job. That was good.

1859
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,008
- Good job. That was amazing.
- You made like 40 valid jabs.

1860
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:41,808
That was a fun game.

1861
01:08:42,278 --> 01:08:44,948
You grew so much.

1862
01:08:45,478 --> 01:08:46,478
(Uie's strength was evident in this game.)

1863
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,918
You're warmed up now that Round Two is over.

1864
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:52,018
See? When you punch 2 or 3 times, you get to hit her.

1865
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:54,227
Now that Round Two is over, you're warmed up.

1866
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:55,428
What do I do?

1867
01:08:55,858 --> 01:08:58,258
I should play one round before the competition.

1868
01:08:58,758 --> 01:09:00,027
Good job.

1869
01:09:00,028 --> 01:09:02,067
(Something only Stamina Queen can say)

1870
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:04,068
- That was impressive.
- Really?

1871
01:09:04,368 --> 01:09:05,568
That was impressive.

1872
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,238
You didn't dodge.

1873
01:09:08,638 --> 01:09:10,268
Gosh. How do you do that?

1874
01:09:10,468 --> 01:09:11,808
Her reach is so long.

1875
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:14,977
That's like getting hit even before approaching her.

1876
01:09:14,978 --> 01:09:16,147
(Bouncing off like this)

1877
01:09:16,148 --> 01:09:18,647
So if we meet a boxer like her...

1878
01:09:18,648 --> 01:09:20,917
- and decide to get close to her, - We have to do this.

1879
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:22,287
We must keep getting closer endlessly.

1880
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:23,547
If we get closer and back out,

1881
01:09:23,548 --> 01:09:24,587
- it's our loss.
- True.

1882
01:09:24,588 --> 01:09:25,888
We must not back out.

1883
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:27,457
- We need more stamina.
- First of all,

1884
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,328
that was a truly wonderful game.

1885
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,628
She was the one I wanted to avoid the most.

1886
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:37,198
Just as I expected, the gap in reach was huge.

1887
01:09:37,598 --> 01:09:42,238
I was planning to go for the body...

1888
01:09:43,468 --> 01:09:46,378
She came up with a good strategy.

1889
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:48,847
- But Uie's stamina was too good.
- Exactly.

1890
01:09:48,848 --> 01:09:50,177
She was probably unaware of it.

1891
01:09:50,178 --> 01:09:51,878
- She kept punching nonstop.
- Right.

1892
01:09:51,978 --> 01:09:55,348
I was expecting her to get tired in Round Two.

1893
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:57,858
She can do ten rounds no problem.

1894
01:09:58,118 --> 01:09:59,218
Twelve rounds.

1895
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:00,958
Uie, how was it?

1896
01:10:01,188 --> 01:10:04,328
To be honest, for my first sparring,

1897
01:10:05,128 --> 01:10:08,368
I told the coach that I'd use up all my stamina.

1898
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:10,927
I had to keep taking steps and move back and forth.

1899
01:10:10,928 --> 01:10:13,268
But I couldn't do that at all in my first sparring.

1900
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:17,777
Today, I wanted to punch as much as I could.

1901
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:20,308
When it was over, I tasted blood in my throat.

1902
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,347
I was very thankful today.

1903
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:24,578
I could tell that you gave your all.

1904
01:10:24,978 --> 01:10:27,147
(In the last sparring, she couldn't use up...)

1905
01:10:27,148 --> 01:10:31,258
(all her stamina due to simple attacks.)

1906
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:37,188
(In her sparring today, she punched endlessly.)

1907
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:42,428
(Uie made countless valid strikes.)

1908
01:10:42,668 --> 01:10:46,168
At this rate, your opponents will become similar.

1909
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:49,507
Eventually, you'll be able to predict the jab.

1910
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:51,477
Then you'll have to back out and get closer again.

1911
01:10:51,478 --> 01:10:53,538
Right now, you keep getting closer.

1912
01:10:53,608 --> 01:10:55,977
So you get hit from time to time.

1913
01:10:55,978 --> 01:10:56,978
- Right.
- I did.

1914
01:10:56,979 --> 01:10:59,317
If you practice going in and out,

1915
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:01,387
you'll be able to use your rear hand more.

1916
01:11:01,388 --> 01:11:03,917
You were able to take the lead...

1917
01:11:03,918 --> 01:11:05,788
- in this sparring.
- Okay.

1918
01:11:06,618 --> 01:11:09,328
All Uie did was jab and one-two.

1919
01:11:10,488 --> 01:11:12,427
Yet, the opponent was helpless.

1920
01:11:12,428 --> 01:11:14,427
(Uie's second full sparring results:)

1921
01:11:14,428 --> 01:11:15,927
(Strengths: Threw one-twos that were 100 percent accurate.)

1922
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:17,398
(Improved in continuous attacks)

1923
01:11:17,568 --> 01:11:19,897
You have a good body condition,

1924
01:11:19,898 --> 01:11:21,767
yet you kept getting closer.

1925
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:24,168
- You were kind of hasty.
- Okay.

1926
01:11:25,138 --> 01:11:27,237
When you punched 2 or 3 times, it all worked.

1927
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:28,847
- Really?
- Yes. One-two.

1928
01:11:28,848 --> 01:11:30,878
And the best part was the jab.

1929
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:34,077
Every time you jabbed, you hit her.

1930
01:11:34,078 --> 01:11:35,548
That's what you need to work on.

1931
01:11:36,348 --> 01:11:38,058
Get ready for the third match.

1932
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:39,958
Seol In Ah versus Lim Sun Woo.

1933
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,328
This is the main event.

1934
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:43,858
This is the main event.

1935
01:11:44,428 --> 01:11:46,297
- The big match.
- The main event.

1936
01:11:46,298 --> 01:11:49,328
(Captain Kim can't stay still.)

1937
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:51,138
It's going to be bloody.

1938
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:52,498
It's going to be bloody.

1939
01:11:54,038 --> 01:11:55,068
Gosh.

1940
01:11:56,138 --> 01:11:59,508
(The boxer of the soon-to-be bloody game)

1941
01:11:59,908 --> 01:12:01,647
- The look in her eyes...
- She has a great form.

1942
01:12:01,648 --> 01:12:02,977
- And she's very good.
- What?

1943
01:12:02,978 --> 01:12:04,777
Her form does not look like an amateur's.

1944
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:05,878
- Really?
- She's good.

1945
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:08,888
(The opponent with a unique posture)

1946
01:12:10,048 --> 01:12:12,488
(Stamina and agility from MMA and jiu-jitsu)

1947
01:12:12,788 --> 01:12:13,788
(The fighter with a fierce look)

1948
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,728
They look like they'll both be brutal.

1949
01:12:16,888 --> 01:12:18,098
Play as hard as you can.

1950
01:12:18,658 --> 01:12:20,158
- Don't go easy on her.
- Okay.

1951
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:23,297
Jiu-jitsu is...

1952
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,837
- Yes.
- one-on-one.

1953
01:12:24,838 --> 01:12:27,937
Jiu-jitsu and MMA fighters are strong.

1954
01:12:27,938 --> 01:12:29,638
And that makes their punches strong.

1955
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,138
- Gosh.
- It's going to be a long match.

1956
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,378
Maybe I should've gone first.

1957
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:36,308
I'm like a dessert after the main dish.

1958
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:38,047
- Right. The main event...
- After the main course,

1959
01:12:38,048 --> 01:12:40,178
- the dessert.
- The dessert after the main course.

1960
01:12:40,318 --> 01:12:42,348
- This is the main course.
- I'll be sweet.

1961
01:12:42,448 --> 01:12:43,618
That sounds good.

1962
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:45,858
- Done.
- Your nose?

1963
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,018
It's fine.

1964
01:12:48,258 --> 01:12:49,758
(Glancing)

1965
01:12:51,528 --> 01:12:54,498
(The opponent is warming up on the ring.)

1966
01:12:54,628 --> 01:12:55,998
She's good.

1967
01:12:56,468 --> 01:12:59,338
She's good. She's very good.

1968
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:01,637
In Ah, try everything you want.

1969
01:13:01,638 --> 01:13:03,608
- Okay.
- Go, Seol In Ah.

1970
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:04,837
You're our pride.

1971
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:05,937
(Entering the ring with the girls' support)

1972
01:13:05,938 --> 01:13:07,108
Don't worry.

1973
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:08,378
Take a deep breath.

1974
01:13:08,379 --> 01:13:10,378
(Bracing herself by taking a deep breath)

1975
01:13:10,448 --> 01:13:12,848
Be aware of getting beaten. It's okay.

1976
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:15,087
Some days, you hit. And some days, you get hit.

1977
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:17,488
- Just play at ease.
- The third...

1978
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,757
The third sparring will begin.

1979
01:13:21,758 --> 01:13:22,857
Fighters, come forward.

1980
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,087
(Blue Corner: Seol In Ah)

1981
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:25,488
In Ah's eyes turned deadly serious.

1982
01:13:26,828 --> 01:13:28,127
(Red Corner: Lim Sun Woo)

1983
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:30,468
Lim Sun Woo and Seol In Ah.

1984
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:31,897
- Play fair.
- Thank you.

1985
01:13:31,898 --> 01:13:33,737
Please don't get too excited or enraged.

1986
01:13:33,738 --> 01:13:36,337
- But give it your all.
- Understood.

1987
01:13:36,338 --> 01:13:39,278
The opponent's eyes are just as serious.

1988
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:40,678
She must be nervous.

1989
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:43,808
The fighters in this round are about the same height.

1990
01:13:44,348 --> 01:13:46,918
(Their serious eyes intensify the atmosphere.)

1991
01:13:47,318 --> 01:13:48,388
Touch gloves.

1992
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:49,548
Corner.

1993
01:13:51,788 --> 01:13:52,818
Okay?

1994
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:54,188
Okay?

1995
01:13:54,658 --> 01:13:55,687
Box!

1996
01:13:55,688 --> 01:13:57,658
(Round 1 begins.)

1997
01:13:58,828 --> 01:14:00,388
- Look at her eyes.
- Good luck, In Ah.

1998
01:14:00,758 --> 01:14:02,198
Her eyes are dead serious.

1999
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:04,328
She's good.

2000
01:14:05,298 --> 01:14:07,838
(The two size each other up with feisty footwork.)

2001
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:09,808
Good luck. Nice footwork.

2002
01:14:10,068 --> 01:14:11,378
- Punch. Good.
- Okay.

2003
01:14:11,608 --> 01:14:13,408
- Okay.
- Yes, good.

2004
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:16,478
- That's it.
- In Ah's strong.

2005
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:20,578
(In Ah's right hook and the opponent's one-two)

2006
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,517
In Ah has gotten really strong. That's it.

2007
01:14:22,518 --> 01:14:24,317
- Go.
- Keep your pace.

2008
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:25,588
- Go for it.
- That's it.

2009
01:14:27,018 --> 01:14:28,658
(Low)

2010
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:32,398
(In Ah's aggressive attacks)

2011
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:34,597
(The opponent dodges with a weave.)

2012
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:35,928
That was great, In Ah.

2013
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:38,397
- Okay, turn.
- Nice one.

2014
01:14:38,398 --> 01:14:39,738
Nice turn.

2015
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:43,037
That's it. Good.

2016
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:45,608
(The two trade fierce blows.)

2017
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:47,708
In Ah's punches are really strong.

2018
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:49,808
(Looking for an opening while moving with footwork)

2019
01:14:50,178 --> 01:14:51,447
Punch. Just like that.

2020
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:53,478
(After a few exchanges)

2021
01:14:54,018 --> 01:14:55,117
Try...

2022
01:14:55,118 --> 01:14:57,387
(The opponent dodges and punches.)

2023
01:14:57,388 --> 01:14:58,718
Turn.

2024
01:14:59,558 --> 01:15:00,558
Yes.

2025
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:02,188
(The opponent's swift duck and hook)

2026
01:15:03,988 --> 01:15:06,158
(Another cross-counter)

2027
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,827
- Yes. Nice one.
- Yes.

2028
01:15:08,828 --> 01:15:11,967
(In Ah's punch came a step faster.)

2029
01:15:11,968 --> 01:15:14,098
Good. That was a good feint.

2030
01:15:14,538 --> 01:15:16,738
(His jaw dropped at the beautiful sight.)

2031
01:15:17,168 --> 01:15:18,508
Her punch is so strong.

2032
01:15:18,778 --> 01:15:20,178
- Good job.
- Amazing.

2033
01:15:20,508 --> 01:15:22,608
The opponent tried to approach with style,

2034
01:15:22,808 --> 01:15:25,248
but was stunned by In Ah's punch.

2035
01:15:25,518 --> 01:15:27,847
From what I see, the opponent can't do anything.

2036
01:15:27,848 --> 01:15:28,918
She's totally taken aback.

2037
01:15:29,318 --> 01:15:31,188
(In Ah is waiting for the opponent to attack.)

2038
01:15:31,988 --> 01:15:33,948
Attack when the opponent throws a jab. Right way.

2039
01:15:34,018 --> 01:15:36,228
- That's it. Yes.
- All the way through.

2040
01:15:36,358 --> 01:15:37,828
(Jab)

2041
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:39,758
(Body hook)

2042
01:15:39,928 --> 01:15:41,367
I told you to fight back.

2043
01:15:41,368 --> 01:15:44,398
(While taking a hit, In Ah counters with a right hook.)

2044
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:48,308
(In Ah drives the opponent to the corner with her footwork.)

2045
01:15:48,368 --> 01:15:50,668
(The opponent maintains her footwork.)

2046
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:54,308
(She's regaining her rhythm.)

2047
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,248
The opponent is waiting.

2048
01:15:56,308 --> 01:15:58,247
Right now. Yes, that's it.

2049
01:15:58,248 --> 01:15:59,948
- Nice one.
- Well done.

2050
01:16:00,048 --> 01:16:01,518
(One, two)

2051
01:16:01,888 --> 01:16:03,888
(One, counter, right hook)

2052
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:05,818
(Left hook)

2053
01:16:06,618 --> 01:16:08,187
(Ducking)

2054
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:12,028
(The opponent throws punches with various techniques, then retreats.)

2055
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:13,498
Easy.

2056
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,398
Just like that. Great job.

2057
01:16:15,598 --> 01:16:16,698
Well done.

2058
01:16:17,298 --> 01:16:19,238
(However)

2059
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:22,668
(Like a predator stalking its prey, )

2060
01:16:23,508 --> 01:16:25,978
(Simba Seol waits and throws a full-power punch.)

2061
01:16:26,138 --> 01:16:27,678
(Putting her guard up right away)

2062
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:29,177
In Ah's too strong.

2063
01:16:29,178 --> 01:16:31,107
(When she takes a hit, )

2064
01:16:31,108 --> 01:16:33,648
(In Ah fires back even harder.)

2065
01:16:33,778 --> 01:16:34,947
(Taking one hit)

2066
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:37,217
(Counterattack 1)

2067
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,757
(Counterattack 2)

2068
01:16:38,758 --> 01:16:40,687
(Counterattack 3)

2069
01:16:40,688 --> 01:16:42,157
(Counterattack 4)

2070
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:43,657
(Counterattack 5)

2071
01:16:43,658 --> 01:16:45,228
(Counterattack 6)

2072
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:47,858
(Countering many times over)

2073
01:16:48,998 --> 01:16:52,438
(The savage beast in the ring)

2074
01:16:52,698 --> 01:16:54,567
(A jaw-dropping scene)

2075
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:55,707
I need popcorn.

2076
01:16:55,708 --> 01:16:57,238
In Ah is unbelievable.

2077
01:16:57,468 --> 01:16:58,738
In Ah is... Gosh.

2078
01:16:59,808 --> 01:17:01,477
Keep watching her.

2079
01:17:01,478 --> 01:17:02,778
Easy. That's it.

2080
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:04,248
Yes. Move.

2081
01:17:04,608 --> 01:17:06,777
Hit her the moment you get close.

2082
01:17:06,778 --> 01:17:08,218
Get close. Punch. Yes.

2083
01:17:08,318 --> 01:17:10,787
- Punch. Again. That's it.
- Nice.

2084
01:17:10,788 --> 01:17:12,887
That's it.

2085
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:16,327
(In Ah throws punches with all she's got in the last 10 seconds.)

2086
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:18,998
- Go in. Yes.
- In Ah.

2087
01:17:19,098 --> 01:17:20,497
Stop!

2088
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:22,768
(Round 1 ends.)

2089
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:26,638
(In Ah was so immersed that she missed the bell.)

2090
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:28,968
Hurry. Get ready.

2091
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,208
Breathe.

2092
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:31,838
Well done. Now breathe.

2093
01:17:34,438 --> 01:17:36,508
(While In Ah is catching her breath)

2094
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:39,318
Deep breaths. Take a deep breath.

2095
01:17:39,648 --> 01:17:41,118
You're doing well.

2096
01:17:41,318 --> 01:17:43,548
Throw a right hand while keeping your guard up.

2097
01:17:44,288 --> 01:17:47,358
One more time. Inhale deeply.

2098
01:17:48,288 --> 01:17:50,928
(Meanwhile, one man is still in a daze.)

2099
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:54,027
- We should breathe as well.
- That was crazy.

2100
01:17:54,028 --> 01:17:56,798
- Breathe.
- That just now was insane.

2101
01:17:57,528 --> 01:17:58,537
In Ah...

2102
01:17:58,538 --> 01:17:59,567
(Speechless)

2103
01:17:59,568 --> 01:18:00,597
Gosh.

2104
01:18:00,598 --> 01:18:03,568
If I worked for the UFC,

2105
01:18:03,808 --> 01:18:05,138
I'd scout her as a fighter.

2106
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:07,738
Her eyes and style are...

2107
01:18:07,938 --> 01:18:09,247
She's really good.

2108
01:18:09,248 --> 01:18:10,384
(The other team watched closely as well.)

2109
01:18:10,408 --> 01:18:13,118
You're not using any feints, are you?

2110
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,447
I might get hit.

2111
01:18:14,448 --> 01:18:16,587
Throw in some feints.

2112
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:18,717
The opponent is hitting you low and high.

2113
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:19,957
- I saw it.
- Right?

2114
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,487
- When she jabs at your abdomen… - She ducked and weaved.

2115
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:25,128
When she jabs at your abdomen, counterattack.

2116
01:18:25,258 --> 01:18:27,097
She's going to throw a jab at your abdomen.

2117
01:18:27,098 --> 01:18:28,698
- And use some feints.
- Okay.

2118
01:18:29,328 --> 01:18:32,038
(Round 2 strategy: Use feints and counter when jabbed)

2119
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:34,438
(Round 2 begins.)

2120
01:18:34,598 --> 01:18:36,408
Hang in there. Get through Round Two.

2121
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:39,308
(The opponent attacks right away.)

2122
01:18:40,908 --> 01:18:42,207
(In Ah counterattacks.)

2123
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,608
In Ah's punches are way too strong.

2124
01:18:43,748 --> 01:18:46,178
- Yes.
- Break!

2125
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:50,918
(Their bodies entangled, the fighters end up in a clinch.)

2126
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:52,457
(Clinch: When locked together, )

2127
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,587
(the fighters must break apart on the referee's command)

2128
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:55,888
Break!

2129
01:18:56,088 --> 01:18:58,928
That's the kind of fighting we want to see. Nice.

2130
01:19:00,798 --> 01:19:03,498
Punch. Yes, that footwork was great.

2131
01:19:03,928 --> 01:19:07,667
(The one looking for a chance to attack)

2132
01:19:07,668 --> 01:19:10,268
(The one waiting for a chance to counterattack)

2133
01:19:10,338 --> 01:19:11,577
Punch.

2134
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:13,438
- That's it.
- Yes. Punch.

2135
01:19:13,938 --> 01:19:15,978
Easy. Keep watching.

2136
01:19:16,678 --> 01:19:18,748
- Punch. That's it.
- Okay.

2137
01:19:19,348 --> 01:19:22,647
(After overpowering her opponent with a one-two combo, )

2138
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:24,588
(In Ah steps back.)

2139
01:19:25,688 --> 01:19:27,317
(In Ah uses her footsteps to move in and out.)

2140
01:19:27,318 --> 01:19:28,858
Your in-and-out is on point.

2141
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:33,628
(However, the opponent isn't an easy one.)

2142
01:19:34,628 --> 01:19:36,168
- Punch.
- Punch. Yes.

2143
01:19:36,228 --> 01:19:39,098
- That's it. Well done. Cover up.
- Yes.

2144
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:40,738
(Valid strike)

2145
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,238
(Valid strike 2)

2146
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,238
(Valid strike 3)

2147
01:19:44,768 --> 01:19:46,678
(The punches land hard until the final one.)

2148
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:48,348
Again.

2149
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:52,718
(The opponent doesn't give in and throws a high-low combination.)

2150
01:19:53,218 --> 01:19:54,377
Hold on!

2151
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:57,018
(The opponent landed valid strikes with incredible concentration.)

2152
01:19:57,318 --> 01:19:58,617
(A closely matched fight between the two)

2153
01:19:58,618 --> 01:20:00,187
- Good job.
- Hang in there.

2154
01:20:00,188 --> 01:20:01,788
- Punch.
- Yes. Well done.

2155
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:04,788
(Valid strikes landed almost simultaneously.)

2156
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:07,457
Great job. Keep punching.

2157
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:10,128
(Another clinch situation)

2158
01:20:10,668 --> 01:20:12,068
- Break!
- Again.

2159
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:14,237
I'm going on.

2160
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:15,868
(Captain Kim steps inside just in case.)

2161
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:18,878
Go for it. Hit low.

2162
01:20:18,978 --> 01:20:20,277
Hang in there, In Ah!

2163
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:22,048
- Try it again! Come on!
- Hang in there!

2164
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:24,917
(The two have met...)

2165
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:28,048
(their match.)

2166
01:20:28,748 --> 01:20:31,617
(After a relentless flurry of exchanges, )

2167
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,718
(the fighters' footwork gradually slow down.)

2168
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:36,888
(Exhausted, both fighters' guards are down.)

2169
01:20:37,058 --> 01:20:38,658
Endure it, In Ah.

2170
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:40,228
Create an opening.

2171
01:20:40,598 --> 01:20:42,728
Okay. Here she comes. Keep your eyes on her.

2172
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:45,137
Yes. One more time.

2173
01:20:45,138 --> 01:20:46,668
- Keep going.
- That's it.

2174
01:20:47,038 --> 01:20:49,168
- Punch. Yes, right away.
- Nice.

2175
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,468
- Endure it!
- Throw a hook!

2176
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:54,138
(In Ah's hook lands perfectly.)

2177
01:20:55,578 --> 01:20:57,448
Keep watching her, Sun Woo.

2178
01:20:58,318 --> 01:20:59,448
(One, two)

2179
01:21:00,348 --> 01:21:02,918
(As their arms tangle and her guard drops, )

2180
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,588
(the opponent lands a clean left hook.)

2181
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,958
(The strong punch...)

2182
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,128
(makes In Ah freeze for a moment.)

2183
01:21:12,328 --> 01:21:14,328
(She's unable to move and is defenseless.)

2184
01:21:15,498 --> 01:21:17,668
(Meanwhile, the opponent keeps pressing the attack.)

2185
01:21:18,968 --> 01:21:22,068
(In Ah is left stunned.)

2186
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:24,607
(At that moment)

2187
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:26,508
- In Ah, ten more seconds.
- Let's go.

2188
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:28,747
- Hurry up.
- Ten seconds.

2189
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:30,408
- Your hands.
- Ten seconds.

2190
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:34,548
(An intense hook)

2191
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:36,887
(As soon as she heard "10 seconds,")

2192
01:21:36,888 --> 01:21:39,318
(Simba Seol snapped awake.)

2193
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:44,528
(Throwing a flurry of punches after cornering the opponent)

2194
01:21:44,688 --> 01:21:45,758
Keep going.

2195
01:21:46,558 --> 01:21:48,967
(Round 2 ends.)

2196
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:50,298
Okay, stop.

2197
01:21:50,868 --> 01:21:52,737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2198
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:54,178
(The two put on a passionate fight.)

2199
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:56,738
- Well done.
- Thank you.

2200
01:21:56,838 --> 01:21:59,508
(Boxer In Ah displayed incredible power.)

2201
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:03,708
(The ring is still buzzing with energy.)

2202
01:22:04,278 --> 01:22:06,648
(This man was very impressed.)

2203
01:22:07,318 --> 01:22:09,218
- Goodness.
- Goodness.

2204
01:22:09,618 --> 01:22:11,047
- Really.
- My gosh.

2205
01:22:11,048 --> 01:22:13,358
(Meanwhile, In Ah...)

2206
01:22:15,758 --> 01:22:17,327
(catches her breath after giving it her all.)

2207
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:18,358
Well done.

2208
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,567
The fight just now deserved UFC bonus money.

2209
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:24,248
(Said by former UFC fighter Kim Dong Hyun)

2210
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:26,167
(The other star of this epic fight)

2211
01:22:26,168 --> 01:22:27,768
- Was it tough?
- She's strong.

2212
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,678
- Good job.
- Her punches are strong.

2213
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:32,108
- Did it hurt?
- Her straight punches did.

2214
01:22:32,438 --> 01:22:34,477
This fight should have happened in the UFC.

2215
01:22:34,478 --> 01:22:35,708
You almost knocked me out.

2216
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:37,548
- Unbelievable.
- That was...

2217
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:39,718
Gosh, but...

2218
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:42,748
Even before asking how it went,

2219
01:22:42,918 --> 01:22:46,188
I must say it was amazing and truly an honor to witness...

2220
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:50,058
a match full of class and powerful punches in our sparring...

2221
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,057
and amateur community sports competition.

2222
01:22:52,058 --> 01:22:54,657
Also, having watched this match for free...

2223
01:22:54,658 --> 01:22:57,097
makes me a winner.

2224
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,974
Please give these two fighters a round of applause.

2225
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:01,467
(Another big round of applause to the two fighters)

2226
01:23:01,468 --> 01:23:04,868
Really, that was...

2227
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:07,537
The opponent is a very talented fighter.

2228
01:23:07,538 --> 01:23:08,878
She's incredible.

2229
01:23:09,248 --> 01:23:10,848
So Lim Sun Woo.

2230
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:13,148
You're an expert.

2231
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:14,848
How was it?

2232
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:15,948
First off...

2233
01:23:16,518 --> 01:23:18,288
- I was taken aback.
- I see.

2234
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:20,157
Her straight punch was so strong...

2235
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:22,287
- it made me dizzy.
- Yes, we could tell.

2236
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:24,328
- Her punches pack a lot of power.
- I see.

2237
01:23:24,428 --> 01:23:28,097
- I always watch my opponent's eyes.
- Of course.

2238
01:23:28,098 --> 01:23:29,997
Usually, when I throw a punch,

2239
01:23:29,998 --> 01:23:33,098
- they blink or retreat.
- Right.

2240
01:23:33,398 --> 01:23:35,567
But In Ah's eyes would suddenly sharpen,

2241
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:38,478
- Right? I know.
- and she'd strike back.

2242
01:23:38,738 --> 01:23:40,507
- She was no joke.
- I see.

2243
01:23:40,508 --> 01:23:41,508
That's it.

2244
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:45,748
(Even against the opponent's heavy punches, )

2245
01:23:46,678 --> 01:23:48,648
(In Ah's eyes remained unshaken.)

2246
01:23:49,248 --> 01:23:51,148
(She's no joke.)

2247
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:53,588
I'm very competitive myself,

2248
01:23:53,688 --> 01:23:55,127
but she's on another level.

2249
01:23:55,128 --> 01:23:56,287
- She's extremely competitive.
- Right?

2250
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,828
She's known as the lion around here.

2251
01:23:58,128 --> 01:23:59,797
What the rest of us talked about was...

2252
01:23:59,798 --> 01:24:01,427
how Sun Woo must have come well-prepared.

2253
01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:02,797
Her footwork and stance...

2254
01:24:02,798 --> 01:24:04,167
- are on an expert level.
- She's the best.

2255
01:24:04,168 --> 01:24:06,668
She must have come intending to showcase all her techniques.

2256
01:24:06,738 --> 01:24:09,637
When she took a hit, she tried to hide it,

2257
01:24:09,638 --> 01:24:11,737
but we could tell that Sun Woo was shaken.

2258
01:24:11,738 --> 01:24:12,978
She needed to attack,

2259
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,707
but she hesitated, worried she might get hit again.

2260
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:16,748
Exactly.

2261
01:24:17,778 --> 01:24:20,178
(From her eyes...)

2262
01:24:20,378 --> 01:24:22,618
(to her footwork...)

2263
01:24:22,648 --> 01:24:23,648
Again.

2264
01:24:23,649 --> 01:24:25,158
(and technique, )

2265
01:24:25,818 --> 01:24:27,418
(Sun Woo came fully armed.)

2266
01:24:28,828 --> 01:24:30,158
(But In Ah's full-power punch...)

2267
01:24:34,358 --> 01:24:37,998
(made Sun Woo pause for a moment.)

2268
01:24:38,298 --> 01:24:41,868
The way In Ah throws her punches is really shrewd.

2269
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:43,967
Her right hand is sharp.

2270
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:45,308
Really.

2271
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:47,737
With a payback-twice mindset, In Ah skipped the footwork.

2272
01:24:47,738 --> 01:24:50,177
Once she stepped in, she never backed away.

2273
01:24:50,178 --> 01:24:52,177
- It was, "Come at me." - That's true.

2274
01:24:52,178 --> 01:24:53,778
Gosh. Seriously.

2275
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:56,388
It was my first time in the ring for a sparring session.

2276
01:24:56,988 --> 01:24:59,988
I needed to break the fighters apart in the clinch.

2277
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:01,957
But I got scared I might get hit.

2278
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:05,558
I believe today was a valuable experience.

2279
01:25:05,628 --> 01:25:08,597
In real community sports competitions,

2280
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:10,767
- clinches are very common.
- Is that so?

2281
01:25:10,768 --> 01:25:11,798
Well done.

2282
01:25:13,438 --> 01:25:15,137
(In Ah's second full sparring results:)

2283
01:25:15,138 --> 01:25:16,607
(Strengths: Knockout-level punching power)

2284
01:25:16,608 --> 01:25:19,438
(Intimidating eyes that dominate the opponent)

2285
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:25,317
(Finding her rhythm by moving in and out at will)

2286
01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:29,248
(Throwing far more punches than before)

2287
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:31,487
(Points to improve:)

2288
01:25:31,488 --> 01:25:34,987
(Guard and stamina decline sharply in the second half)

2289
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:38,528
(Must train proper energy management and conditioning)

2290
01:25:39,998 --> 01:25:41,727
You two were amazing.

2291
01:25:41,728 --> 01:25:45,697
I'm sad to end this interview.

2292
01:25:45,698 --> 01:25:48,038
- It was such an impressive match.
- Thank you.

2293
01:25:48,168 --> 01:25:50,237
I want to watch it again in a heartbeat.

2294
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:52,137
- We need to fight as well.
- Sir, there are...

2295
01:25:52,138 --> 01:25:53,914
- more matches left.
- Oh, right. My apologies.

2296
01:25:53,938 --> 01:25:56,107
- Sorry.
- Coach.

2297
01:25:56,108 --> 01:25:57,977
- We still have more?
- Ju Hyun needs to fight.

2298
01:25:57,978 --> 01:25:59,077
Wasn't this the main event?

2299
01:25:59,078 --> 01:26:00,977
- There's dessert.
- Is there?

2300
01:26:00,978 --> 01:26:03,517
- You can't skip dessert.
- Right, I absolutely can't.

2301
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:04,747
- It's not over yet.
- No.

2302
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:07,417
- We have one more match to go.
- What?

2303
01:26:07,418 --> 01:26:08,888
There's one match left.

2304
01:26:09,128 --> 01:26:11,588
- Get ready for the last match.
- Here's the dessert.

2305
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:12,828
The dessert.

2306
01:26:13,028 --> 01:26:14,898
Park Ju Hyun and Kim Yu Bin.

2307
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:18,528
- Gosh.
- Park Ju, I got my energy from you.

2308
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:20,668
- Show her what you've got.
- One at a time.

2309
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:22,808
Go all out.

2310
01:26:23,068 --> 01:26:24,408
How do I do that?

2311
01:26:24,968 --> 01:26:26,237
Remember what you've learned?

2312
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:29,348
Stay wide awake and put those techniques to use. Got it?

2313
01:26:30,508 --> 01:26:32,347
Dodge, punch, hook,

2314
01:26:32,348 --> 01:26:33,618
- Turn.
- Correct.

2315
01:26:33,978 --> 01:26:35,887
The opponent might attack at random.

2316
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:38,388
Keep that in mind. What should you do?

2317
01:26:38,658 --> 01:26:40,487
- Two.
- Yes, hit and retreat.

2318
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:42,008
- Then, punch, punch. Yes.
- One, two.

2319
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:43,728
Throw lots of cross-counters.

2320
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:45,088
Watch her torso.

2321
01:26:47,058 --> 01:26:48,128
Stay calm.

2322
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:50,427
- Good?
- Yes.

2323
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:51,468
Watch her torso.

2324
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,568
(Yu Bin's eyes have changed.)

2325
01:26:55,238 --> 01:26:57,538
(She starts warming up.)

2326
01:26:58,308 --> 01:26:59,538
That's it. Nice.

2327
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:03,147
When the opponent throws a jab, counter with a hook.

2328
01:27:03,148 --> 01:27:05,978
Yes. Moving from low to high works well.

2329
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:08,818
When the opponent jabs, counter cross right away.

2330
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:11,068
Exactly, but move your front foot back as you do it.

2331
01:27:11,118 --> 01:27:12,118
Punch. That's it.

2332
01:27:12,318 --> 01:27:14,487
Throw a series of punches. Once she's caught, go all in.

2333
01:27:14,488 --> 01:27:15,558
- Understood.
- Good.

2334
01:27:15,928 --> 01:27:18,828
All right, here's the last sparring session.

2335
01:27:19,298 --> 01:27:21,457
I'm excited to see how it'll turn out.

2336
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:22,828
Fighters, to the center.

2337
01:27:24,428 --> 01:27:26,668
Do your best.

2338
01:27:26,898 --> 01:27:29,268
The arena is on fire right now.

2339
01:27:29,438 --> 01:27:32,278
Keep that energy going and give it your all. Okay?

2340
01:27:32,338 --> 01:27:34,138
- Focus on techniques. Corner.
- Okay.

2341
01:27:35,138 --> 01:27:36,607
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.
- Good luck, Park Ju Hyun.

2342
01:27:36,608 --> 01:27:38,248
- You can do it, Ju Hyun.
- Park Ju.

2343
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:40,818
Okay?

2344
01:27:41,618 --> 01:27:42,618
Box!

2345
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:43,787
- Go for it!
- Good luck!

2346
01:27:43,788 --> 01:27:44,818
Okay.

2347
01:27:48,418 --> 01:27:50,628
- Nice.
- That was insane.

2348
01:27:53,098 --> 01:27:57,098
(The opponent strikes with unstoppable force.)

2349
01:27:57,168 --> 01:27:59,798
- She's good.
- Well done.

2350
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:01,738
(Valid strike 1, Valid strike 2)

2351
01:28:02,408 --> 01:28:04,068
(Valid strike 3, Valid strike 4)

2352
01:28:04,908 --> 01:28:05,908
(Valid strike 5)

2353
01:28:05,909 --> 01:28:07,078
(A barrage of punches)

2354
01:28:08,608 --> 01:28:10,007
- Use your stamina.
- Hit more.

2355
01:28:10,008 --> 01:28:11,777
- Turn.
- Turn.

2356
01:28:11,778 --> 01:28:14,547
- Turn. That's it.
- Good job.

2357
01:28:14,548 --> 01:28:16,748
- Turn. That's it.
- Good job.

2358
01:28:16,788 --> 01:28:18,318
(She pivots using her footwork.)

2359
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,318
Turn. That's it.

2360
01:28:21,158 --> 01:28:23,827
Yes. Focus when you launch the first attack.

2361
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:25,427
(The opponent charges in once again.)

2362
01:28:25,428 --> 01:28:26,758
Just like that.

2363
01:28:27,758 --> 01:28:30,568
(The opponent's movement was big.)

2364
01:28:30,968 --> 01:28:32,697
(Ju Hyun sees an opening...)

2365
01:28:32,698 --> 01:28:34,468
(and lands a precise jab.)

2366
01:28:34,638 --> 01:28:36,337
- That's it.
- That was nice.

2367
01:28:36,338 --> 01:28:38,808
- Yes, again!
- Ju Hyun!

2368
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:42,548
- Yes, again!
- Good job, Park Ju Hyun!

2369
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,778
Nice one.

2370
01:28:43,948 --> 01:28:45,347
She attacked well. Nice, Ju Hyun.

2371
01:28:45,348 --> 01:28:46,348
- Yes.
- Yes.

2372
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:48,378
(She waits for the timing, then jabs.)

2373
01:28:48,678 --> 01:28:50,818
(Even when the opponent attacks)

2374
01:28:51,148 --> 01:28:52,287
I knew you'd do great.

2375
01:28:52,288 --> 01:28:54,387
Ju Hyun, have faith in your stamina.

2376
01:28:54,388 --> 01:28:55,788
It's natural to take a hit.

2377
01:28:56,688 --> 01:28:59,458
Turn. Just like that.

2378
01:29:00,358 --> 01:29:01,428
(Valid strike)

2379
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:03,518
(Refusing to retreat, she fires a straight.)

2380
01:29:03,628 --> 01:29:04,667
(After blocking, )

2381
01:29:04,668 --> 01:29:07,198
(she immediately lands a jab.)

2382
01:29:08,038 --> 01:29:09,918
(The calmer the mad boxer, the scarier she is.)

2383
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:11,788
You're good at jabbing and then retreating.

2384
01:29:13,138 --> 01:29:14,677
(The match continues.)

2385
01:29:14,678 --> 01:29:16,808
- Two. Try a two.
- Yes.

2386
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,617
(She jabs...)

2387
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:22,718
(and then falls back.)

2388
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:27,718
(Ju Hyun is displaying remarkable focus.)

2389
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:30,088
The opponent is getting tired. Go for it.

2390
01:29:30,328 --> 01:29:32,758
- Go for it when she's tired. Yes.
- That's it.

2391
01:29:33,798 --> 01:29:35,497
(A straight through the opponent's guard)

2392
01:29:35,498 --> 01:29:36,527
(Dodging)

2393
01:29:36,528 --> 01:29:38,527
Nice. Again.

2394
01:29:38,528 --> 01:29:40,097
Here she comes. Dodge.

2395
01:29:40,098 --> 01:29:41,898
- Yes.
- Nice one.

2396
01:29:41,968 --> 01:29:43,008
Hit again.

2397
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,678
- Dodge and punch. That's it.
- Nice.

2398
01:29:46,038 --> 01:29:48,578
(Gwang Bok cuts through sharply.)

2399
01:29:48,738 --> 01:29:50,978
Great. Well done. Again.

2400
01:29:51,078 --> 01:29:52,377
Gosh. Here we go again.

2401
01:29:52,378 --> 01:29:53,624
(Captain Kim is impressed again.)

2402
01:29:53,648 --> 01:29:55,987
- Here she comes. Punch. That's it.
- Yes.

2403
01:29:55,988 --> 01:29:57,048
Good.

2404
01:29:57,588 --> 01:29:59,487
- Punch. Just like that.
- You have to go in.

2405
01:29:59,488 --> 01:30:01,458
- Turn. Go in again.
- That's it.

2406
01:30:02,428 --> 01:30:04,257
- Good.
- Go for it.

2407
01:30:04,258 --> 01:30:05,697
- Hang in there.
- Yes.

2408
01:30:05,698 --> 01:30:07,257
(Ju Hyun's counter leaves her opponent dazed.)

2409
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:08,758
Yes. Good job.

2410
01:30:10,668 --> 01:30:11,767
Nice, Park Ju Hyun!

2411
01:30:11,768 --> 01:30:13,128
- Just like that.
- Hang in there.

2412
01:30:13,838 --> 01:30:16,737
(Ju Hyun's powerful straight punch)

2413
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:17,767
You can see the stamina gap.

2414
01:30:17,768 --> 01:30:19,977
- Good.
- You're doing good.

2415
01:30:19,978 --> 01:30:21,578
Gosh. Nice.

2416
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:24,107
- That's it.
- Good one, Park Ju Hyun.

2417
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:25,917
- Nice. Use some feints.
- She's getting tired.

2418
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:27,378
- Nice.
- Yes.

2419
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:30,087
(After landing an accurate jab, )

2420
01:30:30,088 --> 01:30:31,348
(she dodges.)

2421
01:30:31,488 --> 01:30:33,618
- Yes.
- Keep going.

2422
01:30:34,618 --> 01:30:35,728
Well done.

2423
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:37,428
That's it. Nice.

2424
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:39,958
Ten more seconds.

2425
01:30:39,998 --> 01:30:41,557
Ju Hyun, keep watching her.

2426
01:30:41,558 --> 01:30:42,628
Punch.

2427
01:30:43,928 --> 01:30:45,427
In and out.

2428
01:30:45,428 --> 01:30:47,198
- Focus. Hook.
- Hit her. That's it.

2429
01:30:48,138 --> 01:30:49,838
Stop. Well done.

2430
01:30:50,038 --> 01:30:51,407
- You're good.
- Great job.

2431
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:53,737
(Ju Hyun walks in with an intense look.)

2432
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:55,578
- Hang in there.
- Well done.

2433
01:30:55,678 --> 01:30:57,307
Endure it, Ju Hyun. Okay?

2434
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:58,994
- You're amazing, Park Ju Hyun.
- That was crazy.

2435
01:30:59,018 --> 01:31:01,847
You did well. All your jabs are landing, right?

2436
01:31:01,848 --> 01:31:03,047
You feel it too, don't you?

2437
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:07,158
Your opponent's movements are way too big.

2438
01:31:07,518 --> 01:31:08,717
- You have...
- Are mine wide too?

2439
01:31:08,718 --> 01:31:10,627
No, they're not, which is why it's even better.

2440
01:31:10,628 --> 01:31:14,127
Got it? When she moves in, jab and punch. Sounds good?

2441
01:31:14,128 --> 01:31:16,088
(Stay calm and deliver precise jabs and punches.)

2442
01:31:16,768 --> 01:31:19,468
- Stay calm. It's okay.
- Stay calm, okay?

2443
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:20,667
- Your right swings are too big.
- Your hooks...

2444
01:31:20,668 --> 01:31:22,307
- are way too big.
- It's too big.

2445
01:31:22,308 --> 01:31:25,207
Your hooks are perfectly timed whenever the opponent jabs.

2446
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,278
But your movement is too big, and it misses her.

2447
01:31:27,408 --> 01:31:29,048
Make the hooks shorter.

2448
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:31,398
- Ju Hyun, you're doing great.
- Well done.

2449
01:31:31,578 --> 01:31:33,217
- This is the main event.
- Yes, this is the main event.

2450
01:31:33,218 --> 01:31:34,524
- This is the main event.
- Ju Hyun, punch.

2451
01:31:34,548 --> 01:31:36,887
All right, Ju Hyun. The main event.

2452
01:31:36,888 --> 01:31:37,918
- Go.
- Go for it.

2453
01:31:41,018 --> 01:31:42,287
- Keep moving.
- Dodge.

2454
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,928
(The opponent takes the first move and attacks.)

2455
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:46,397
Focus.

2456
01:31:46,398 --> 01:31:48,458
(As planned, the opponent moves in aggressively.)

2457
01:31:48,998 --> 01:31:51,098
(Against the opponent digging low)

2458
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:52,938
Nice.

2459
01:31:52,998 --> 01:31:54,397
- Hang in there.
- That's it.

2460
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:56,038
- Yes, just like that. Nice.
- Endure it.

2461
01:31:56,068 --> 01:31:57,068
Good.

2462
01:31:57,138 --> 01:31:59,638
- Good.
- Nice.

2463
01:31:59,838 --> 01:32:00,977
- Well done.
- Yes.

2464
01:32:00,978 --> 01:32:03,548
Your strikes are too big. Keep them tight.

2465
01:32:04,078 --> 01:32:06,547
- Endure it.
- Nice. Watch her closely.

2466
01:32:06,548 --> 01:32:07,778
(Exchanging heavy punches)

2467
01:32:08,778 --> 01:32:10,518
- Keep watching her. Good.
- Nice, Ju Hyun.

2468
01:32:10,988 --> 01:32:12,047
An immediate straight.

2469
01:32:12,048 --> 01:32:13,658
What do you do when she attacks? Punch.

2470
01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:15,518
- Endure it.
- Punch.

2471
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:16,927
You've got to punch when that happens.

2472
01:32:16,928 --> 01:32:19,158
(The opponent's hook)

2473
01:32:19,828 --> 01:32:23,697
(A strong right hook, )

2474
01:32:23,698 --> 01:32:25,297
(followed by a left hook)

2475
01:32:25,298 --> 01:32:26,738
(Ju Hyun counters with a hook.)

2476
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:29,308
- That's it.
- Yes, keep going.

2477
01:32:29,738 --> 01:32:31,968
(Park Ju Hyun, the Iron Girls' tough fighter)

2478
01:32:32,778 --> 01:32:34,678
(The opponent is as tough as her.)

2479
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:37,278
(An intense war of nerves between two tough fighters)

2480
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:39,178
Nice one.

2481
01:32:39,348 --> 01:32:40,617
Yes.

2482
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:42,418
- Turn.
- Don't do that.

2483
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:45,488
- Well done.
- Watch your abdomen.

2484
01:32:45,758 --> 01:32:48,588
It's okay. Try again.

2485
01:32:49,028 --> 01:32:50,888
That's it. Well done.

2486
01:32:51,088 --> 01:32:52,127
Another jab.

2487
01:32:52,128 --> 01:32:53,457
(Straight)

2488
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,628
(She dodges right away.)

2489
01:32:54,898 --> 01:32:56,297
That was great just now. Again.

2490
01:32:56,298 --> 01:32:57,927
You're doing really well.

2491
01:32:57,928 --> 01:33:00,868
Watch her closely as you jab. She's coming. Jab.

2492
01:33:01,338 --> 01:33:02,568
Attack her. Again.

2493
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:04,668
Here she comes. That's it.

2494
01:33:04,908 --> 01:33:07,338
(Landing 2 jabs without hesitation)

2495
01:33:07,408 --> 01:33:09,278
Turn. Exactly. Good job.

2496
01:33:09,408 --> 01:33:11,678
- Move in. Try it.
- She's got amazing spirit.

2497
01:33:12,418 --> 01:33:14,678
- She's calm and fighting well.
- Well done.

2498
01:33:14,778 --> 01:33:15,987
- She watches, then strikes.
- Punch, pivot.

2499
01:33:15,988 --> 01:33:17,047
Keep going.

2500
01:33:17,048 --> 01:33:19,888
(Ju Hyun never takes her eyes off her opponent.)

2501
01:33:20,518 --> 01:33:22,458
- Move in again. That's it.
- Attack.

2502
01:33:22,688 --> 01:33:23,857
She's worn out.

2503
01:33:23,858 --> 01:33:25,558
- Move in.
- Attack her.

2504
01:33:25,728 --> 01:33:27,857
- You can do it, Ju Hyun.
- Try again.

2505
01:33:27,858 --> 01:33:28,998
- That's it.
- Yes.

2506
01:33:29,628 --> 01:33:30,728
More. This is your chance.

2507
01:33:31,328 --> 01:33:33,097
- Try again.
- She's tired.

2508
01:33:33,098 --> 01:33:35,337
- Do your thing, Ju Hyun.
- Push her into a corner.

2509
01:33:35,338 --> 01:33:37,438
Okay. Again. Corner her.

2510
01:33:38,268 --> 01:33:40,008
(Ju Hyun seems tired as well.)

2511
01:33:40,638 --> 01:33:42,408
(She must maintain her focus.)

2512
01:33:43,678 --> 01:33:46,078
(Here goes Park Gwang Bok.)

2513
01:33:46,648 --> 01:33:47,917
(Jab)

2514
01:33:47,918 --> 01:33:48,918
(Dodge)

2515
01:33:48,919 --> 01:33:50,747
(Another jab)

2516
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:52,658
(Dodging again)

2517
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,287
Well done. That's it.

2518
01:33:54,288 --> 01:33:56,658
(Ju Hyun's jabs are perfectly accurate.)

2519
01:33:56,888 --> 01:33:57,927
Try again.

2520
01:33:57,928 --> 01:34:00,528
(She even lands a low attack.)

2521
01:34:00,628 --> 01:34:02,909
- One last time. The last one.
- Well done, Park Ju Hyun.

2522
01:34:03,128 --> 01:34:04,597
(One last time?)

2523
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:05,938
The last one.

2524
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:08,098
Good. Well done.

2525
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,368
(Round 2 ends with Ju Hyun's jab.)

2526
01:34:12,408 --> 01:34:14,237
You did an amazing job.

2527
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:16,408
(The ring is buzzing even hotter.)

2528
01:34:16,808 --> 01:34:18,078
Well done.

2529
01:34:18,308 --> 01:34:19,647
- Great work.
- Gosh.

2530
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,347
- Good job.
- Park Ju.

2531
01:34:21,348 --> 01:34:23,347
- She was amazing.
- You were awesome.

2532
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:25,318
- Why are you so good?
- That was the main event.

2533
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,387
We had a double main event today.

2534
01:34:27,388 --> 01:34:28,418
(The most excited member)

2535
01:34:29,018 --> 01:34:30,087
(The last match was like a surprise gift.)

2536
01:34:30,088 --> 01:34:31,427
A round of applause, please.

2537
01:34:31,428 --> 01:34:33,348
- You fought really well.
- She was really good.

2538
01:34:33,928 --> 01:34:35,828
(Yu Bin gave it her all.)

2539
01:34:36,568 --> 01:34:38,568
(Her legs give out the moment the match ends.)

2540
01:34:40,868 --> 01:34:41,937
Give her some water.

2541
01:34:41,938 --> 01:34:43,214
(She fought until the end, even when exhausted.)

2542
01:34:43,238 --> 01:34:44,768
Right now...

2543
01:34:45,108 --> 01:34:46,308
Well...

2544
01:34:46,678 --> 01:34:49,708
Yu Bin looks completely worn out.

2545
01:34:50,108 --> 01:34:51,707
But still,

2546
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:54,418
compared to how long she has trained...

2547
01:34:54,648 --> 01:34:56,487
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2548
01:34:56,488 --> 01:34:57,717
How was the sparring session?

2549
01:34:57,718 --> 01:35:01,117
She did way better than I expected.

2550
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:03,628
- She's also got good stamina.
- Right.

2551
01:35:03,758 --> 01:35:05,797
Her spirit is impressive.

2552
01:35:05,798 --> 01:35:06,958
"Her spirit?"

2553
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:09,427
She threw many punches.

2554
01:35:09,428 --> 01:35:10,527
She landed many punches.

2555
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:12,398
It wasn't easy to close the distance.

2556
01:35:12,538 --> 01:35:13,637
It was tough.

2557
01:35:13,638 --> 01:35:16,138
But still, Yu Bin attacked...

2558
01:35:16,568 --> 01:35:19,677
with a fierce spirit from the very beginning.

2559
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:21,807
As I have a small figure,

2560
01:35:21,808 --> 01:35:23,807
I tried to move in low...

2561
01:35:23,808 --> 01:35:25,978
- and throw in some hooks.
- I see.

2562
01:35:26,348 --> 01:35:28,277
I took multiple hits when approaching low.

2563
01:35:28,278 --> 01:35:30,788
That really surprised me.

2564
01:35:30,848 --> 01:35:32,918
I thought getting hit would throw her off,

2565
01:35:33,058 --> 01:35:34,488
but it didn't.

2566
01:35:34,658 --> 01:35:37,227
She may not be as skilled, but she's got the spirit.

2567
01:35:37,228 --> 01:35:39,698
Her spirit is at a pro-level.

2568
01:35:41,128 --> 01:35:42,567
(During the supervised sparring, )

2569
01:35:42,568 --> 01:35:44,968
(Ju Hyun couldn't keep her eyes on the opponent's punches.)

2570
01:35:45,968 --> 01:35:47,498
(The mad boxer was afraid of punches.)

2571
01:35:47,838 --> 01:35:49,238
Keep watching.

2572
01:35:49,738 --> 01:35:51,037
- That's it.
- You're doing great.

2573
01:35:51,038 --> 01:35:53,077
(Now, even when punches come right at her face, )

2574
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:54,908
(she maintains a poker face.)

2575
01:35:56,078 --> 01:35:58,378
(Even after a series of punches, )

2576
01:35:59,448 --> 01:36:00,978
(unfazed, she doesn't blink...)

2577
01:36:01,518 --> 01:36:04,588
(and dominates her opponent.)

2578
01:36:04,888 --> 01:36:07,487
She said I threw many punches,

2579
01:36:07,488 --> 01:36:10,058
but I felt like she landed more than I did.

2580
01:36:10,358 --> 01:36:13,198
She kept coming at me and had serious guts.

2581
01:36:13,328 --> 01:36:17,698
In terms of the number of punches, Yu Bin threw more.

2582
01:36:17,998 --> 01:36:20,337
Ju Hyun kept her calm throughout the rounds.

2583
01:36:20,338 --> 01:36:21,338
- Yes.
- Exactly.

2584
01:36:21,339 --> 01:36:23,208
She kept her composure, watched until the end,

2585
01:36:23,668 --> 01:36:25,107
countered whenever attacked,

2586
01:36:25,108 --> 01:36:26,607
- and threw jabs.
- That was unbelievable.

2587
01:36:26,608 --> 01:36:27,937
- You were really good at it.
- Yes.

2588
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:29,278
I felt a thrill for a moment.

2589
01:36:29,378 --> 01:36:31,247
I dodged her punch...

2590
01:36:31,248 --> 01:36:33,177
when it was this close.

2591
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:34,417
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

2592
01:36:34,418 --> 01:36:37,388
At that moment, I was impressed with myself.

2593
01:36:38,118 --> 01:36:40,187
- "Gosh. I didn't get hit." - The star of the match.

2594
01:36:40,188 --> 01:36:42,158
I experienced that feeling just one time.

2595
01:36:42,758 --> 01:36:44,328
That's right.

2596
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:47,858
(Ju Hyun quickly evaded the punch coming straight for her face.)

2597
01:36:48,998 --> 01:36:51,168
(Impressed)

2598
01:36:51,698 --> 01:36:53,898
(Actually, even after the one time Ju Hyun remembers, )

2599
01:36:54,438 --> 01:36:57,108
(she dodged several more punches like in a movie.)

2600
01:36:58,668 --> 01:37:00,278
Gosh, that felt good.

2601
01:37:01,478 --> 01:37:03,177
- It...
- That felt amazing.

2602
01:37:03,178 --> 01:37:05,148
You should always remember that feeling.

2603
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,877
- Remember it.
- It felt great.

2604
01:37:06,878 --> 01:37:09,687
Boxers can actually hear...

2605
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,647
their opponent's punches coming,

2606
01:37:11,648 --> 01:37:14,518
which feels like slow motion and gives them a thrill.

2607
01:37:14,588 --> 01:37:16,358
I felt the thrill at that moment.

2608
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:17,727
Yes, well done.

2609
01:37:17,728 --> 01:37:18,888
- You stayed calm.
- I agree.

2610
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:22,427
(Ju Hyun's second full sparring results:)

2611
01:37:22,428 --> 01:37:26,737
(Strengths: Has grown into a composed boxer...)

2612
01:37:26,738 --> 01:37:31,207
(who watches and dodges her opponent's punches)

2613
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:35,908
(Strikes with jabs, retreats, and even lands effective hits)

2614
01:37:37,348 --> 01:37:39,547
(Points to improve:)

2615
01:37:39,548 --> 01:37:44,247
(Must work on combinations beyond jabs)

2616
01:37:44,248 --> 01:37:48,988
(Must practice various attack routes through repeated routine training)

2617
01:37:49,828 --> 01:37:52,327
(Footwork when retreating from attacks is still awkward.)

2618
01:37:52,328 --> 01:37:56,768
(Must practice retreating quickly and smoothly)

2619
01:37:56,968 --> 01:37:58,997
First off, I must apologize.

2620
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:02,637
I made a slip of the tongue,

2621
01:38:02,638 --> 01:38:05,107
calling it a dessert round after the main event.

2622
01:38:05,108 --> 01:38:07,578
- Apologize.
- Yes, I apologize.

2623
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:09,037
- Really.
- It was the main dish.

2624
01:38:09,038 --> 01:38:10,407
It was a double main event.

2625
01:38:10,408 --> 01:38:12,877
Thank you to the two boxers for giving us...

2626
01:38:12,878 --> 01:38:14,978
such an amazing match for free.

2627
01:38:15,148 --> 01:38:16,487
- Well done, Park Ju.
- Seriously.

2628
01:38:16,488 --> 01:38:17,947
- Yes, for real.
- Good job.

2629
01:38:17,948 --> 01:38:19,757
You were really cool.

2630
01:38:19,758 --> 01:38:20,887
Great work.

2631
01:38:20,888 --> 01:38:23,928
- Thank you. Great work today.
- Get some rest.

2632
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:27,727
(All 8 boxers were stars in today's ring.)

2633
01:38:27,728 --> 01:38:29,627
- Great work.
- Thank you.

2634
01:38:29,628 --> 01:38:30,798
Thank you.

2635
01:38:30,898 --> 01:38:31,967
- You were amazing.
- Really?

2636
01:38:31,968 --> 01:38:33,697
It's time to replay the matches.

2637
01:38:33,698 --> 01:38:35,398
(After the second full sparring, )

2638
01:38:35,938 --> 01:38:38,267
(the Iron Girls have gathered.)

2639
01:38:38,268 --> 01:38:39,378
What's that?

2640
01:38:39,638 --> 01:38:40,878
Lemon juice.

2641
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,908
Lemon juice is trending right now.

2642
01:38:44,648 --> 01:38:46,817
You can drink lemon juice on an empty stomach these days.

2643
01:38:46,818 --> 01:38:48,748
- It won't hurt your stomach.
- It's good.

2644
01:38:48,878 --> 01:38:50,317
- Would you like one?
- It's refreshing.

2645
01:38:50,318 --> 01:38:52,287
(Everyone shares the delicious and healthy drink.)

2646
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,518
- Oh, my.
- It's good, right?

2647
01:38:53,888 --> 01:38:55,957
- That just now was cute.
- "Oh, my."

2648
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:57,027
(What's next on the schedule?)

2649
01:38:57,028 --> 01:38:59,857
- It's finally time for a review.
- Yes.

2650
01:38:59,858 --> 01:39:01,398
(Sparring strategic analysis)

2651
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:05,568
(Closely reviewing the match footage...)

2652
01:39:06,038 --> 01:39:10,208
(to objectively assess one's own play...)

2653
01:39:10,768 --> 01:39:15,078
(and refine strategies)

2654
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:18,207
You've had your second full sparring session.

2655
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:21,777
You may not fully remember your match.

2656
01:39:21,778 --> 01:39:22,887
- True.
- So far.

2657
01:39:22,888 --> 01:39:26,188
Not being able to remember it is amusing.

2658
01:39:26,388 --> 01:39:29,117
That's natural, but you must review it.

2659
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:31,427
- Only then will you get better.
- Understood.

2660
01:39:31,428 --> 01:39:34,427
It's hard to watch your own match.

2661
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:35,928
I know that very well.

2662
01:39:36,028 --> 01:39:38,428
I find it difficult to watch my own matches too.

2663
01:39:38,698 --> 01:39:40,737
It's like rubbing salt into the wound.

2664
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:42,298
- So true.
- I understand that feeling.

2665
01:39:42,868 --> 01:39:44,567
But wouldn't rubbing salt into the wound...

2666
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:46,978
make it worse and harder to recover?

2667
01:39:47,408 --> 01:39:48,977
Rubbing salt into the wound is...

2668
01:39:48,978 --> 01:39:51,977
What I mean is that it hurts like rubbing salt into the wound.

2669
01:39:51,978 --> 01:39:53,577
- Right.
- Watching your match.

2670
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:55,447
How about disinfectant instead of salt?

2671
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,747
Spraying disinfectant on a wound hurts at the moment,

2672
01:39:57,748 --> 01:39:58,988
but it helps it heal faster.

2673
01:40:00,058 --> 01:40:01,818
(I'm the original Mentality Kim.)

2674
01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:03,087
It's going to be...

2675
01:40:03,088 --> 01:40:04,357
- an important session.
- Let's do this.

2676
01:40:04,358 --> 01:40:05,387
- Yes.
- Yes.

2677
01:40:05,388 --> 01:40:08,797
Let's watch Keum Sae Rok's match first.

2678
01:40:08,798 --> 01:40:10,928
- Sae Rok is about to fight.
- She's getting ready.

2679
01:40:11,368 --> 01:40:13,537
Back then, I never expected her to be that good.

2680
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:15,338
- True.
- Look at her retreat.

2681
01:40:15,998 --> 01:40:18,067
- I got hit right away.
- Almost immediately.

2682
01:40:18,068 --> 01:40:20,107
(Sae Rok attacked with a one-two combo.)

2683
01:40:20,108 --> 01:40:22,008
Okay. Sae Rok got hit, right?

2684
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:23,377
After her one-two.

2685
01:40:23,378 --> 01:40:24,754
(Sae Rok was immediately countered.)

2686
01:40:24,778 --> 01:40:26,318
Was her movement too big?

2687
01:40:26,378 --> 01:40:28,017
Correct. That was the reason.

2688
01:40:28,018 --> 01:40:31,047
She put too much weight on her front foot,

2689
01:40:31,048 --> 01:40:32,187
causing her punch to be too big.

2690
01:40:32,188 --> 01:40:34,418
That's why she couldn't block the counter.

2691
01:40:34,618 --> 01:40:37,358
(A big movement)

2692
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:43,868
(Sae Rok loses her balance and is pushed backward.)

2693
01:40:44,268 --> 01:40:47,538
(How are Sae Rok's other straight punches?)

2694
01:40:47,868 --> 01:40:50,568
Look. Her back foot comes off the ground...

2695
01:40:50,868 --> 01:40:52,067
as she punches.

2696
01:40:52,068 --> 01:40:53,177
(Her weight is on her front foot.)

2697
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:56,247
(She loses her balance again.)

2698
01:40:56,248 --> 01:40:58,047
Sae Rok should watch for these things,

2699
01:40:58,048 --> 01:41:00,117
realize when she was nervous,

2700
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:02,888
and work on improving them. Got it?

2701
01:41:03,418 --> 01:41:07,118
In terms of quality, Sae Rok's punches were much better.

2702
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:09,988
Your footwork was weak, but your punches were excellent.

2703
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:13,528
You've got good form. Your guard is up too.

2704
01:41:13,858 --> 01:41:16,968
You found that rhythm in order to land a good punch.

2705
01:41:17,098 --> 01:41:19,028
You have your guard up. Nice.

2706
01:41:19,638 --> 01:41:20,667
Good feints.

2707
01:41:20,668 --> 01:41:22,198
(The real jab)

2708
01:41:22,438 --> 01:41:23,744
- Rocky Keum.
- But I couldn't reach her.

2709
01:41:23,768 --> 01:41:26,037
I threw a feint, but it didn't reach her.

2710
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:27,538
(I'm also frustrated.)

2711
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:29,978
(What's wrong with me?)

2712
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:32,577
(After feinting, she went for a one-two combo.)

2713
01:41:32,578 --> 01:41:33,918
She was too far away.

2714
01:41:35,278 --> 01:41:36,587
They seem too far apart.

2715
01:41:36,588 --> 01:41:38,348
Left-handers naturally keep their distance.

2716
01:41:38,548 --> 01:41:40,734
The distance is even wider because she used to do taekwondo.

2717
01:41:40,758 --> 01:41:42,188
She dodges really swiftly.

2718
01:41:42,718 --> 01:41:44,987
I can relate since I'm left-handed,

2719
01:41:44,988 --> 01:41:46,087
especially with footwork.

2720
01:41:46,088 --> 01:41:47,297
There's always some distance,

2721
01:41:47,298 --> 01:41:49,527
but it's greater between a left-hander and a right-hander.

2722
01:41:49,528 --> 01:41:51,567
It's hard to reach the opponent.

2723
01:41:51,568 --> 01:41:53,467
You just have to barge in and fight.

2724
01:41:53,468 --> 01:41:55,737
Against an opponent like her, you just have to move in...

2725
01:41:55,738 --> 01:41:58,007
and block her from punching and dodging.

2726
01:41:58,008 --> 01:42:02,078
(Southpaw: a left-handed fighter, Orthodox: a right-handed fighter)

2727
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:03,907
You fought against a difficult opponent.

2728
01:42:03,908 --> 01:42:07,548
And yet, you did well, staying calm and watching her until the end.

2729
01:42:07,648 --> 01:42:10,748
Instinctively, Sae Rok adjusted...

2730
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:13,017
to the distance in Round Two.

2731
01:42:13,018 --> 01:42:14,258
- Did I?
- Let's watch.

2732
01:42:15,588 --> 01:42:18,657
(She kept moving around and tried to launch attacks.)

2733
01:42:18,658 --> 01:42:21,657
Well done. That was a good strike.

2734
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:23,467
(Feint 1, 2, 3)

2735
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:24,798
Did you see that?

2736
01:42:26,198 --> 01:42:27,367
That was praiseworthy.

2737
01:42:27,368 --> 01:42:28,498
- Indeed.
- Do you know why?

2738
01:42:28,598 --> 01:42:31,407
You stayed focused, looking for an opening to strike.

2739
01:42:31,408 --> 01:42:32,938
The distance was too wide,

2740
01:42:32,978 --> 01:42:36,178
so you used feints to create a chance to hit.

2741
01:42:36,278 --> 01:42:38,077
Those moves were great.

2742
01:42:38,078 --> 01:42:40,718
To add to the coach's compliments,

2743
01:42:40,778 --> 01:42:42,517
the opponent was trying to counterattack,

2744
01:42:42,518 --> 01:42:45,487
but because Sae Rok kept striking, the opponent couldn't move in.

2745
01:42:45,488 --> 01:42:47,488
- That's why a flurry is important.
- I see.

2746
01:42:47,918 --> 01:42:49,117
(After getting used to the distance, Sae Rok...)

2747
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:51,958
(chased after her, launching a fierce attack.)

2748
01:42:52,858 --> 01:42:54,227
Those moves were good.

2749
01:42:54,228 --> 01:42:56,528
The repeated strikes flustered the opponent.

2750
01:42:57,268 --> 01:42:59,968
The flurry made her panic. That's what you should aim for.

2751
01:43:00,098 --> 01:43:02,168
Look at how she continues to strike.

2752
01:43:02,368 --> 01:43:03,667
- The opponent...
- She's taken aback.

2753
01:43:03,668 --> 01:43:04,807
- panics.
- She does.

2754
01:43:04,808 --> 01:43:06,208
Exactly. You get it, right?

2755
01:43:06,538 --> 01:43:07,877
Then I should...

2756
01:43:07,878 --> 01:43:10,548
practice the footwork and backsteps that...

2757
01:43:10,748 --> 01:43:12,647
the opponent is good at.

2758
01:43:12,648 --> 01:43:13,648
That'd be great.

2759
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:15,918
With that, you'll be a tough opponent.

2760
01:43:15,978 --> 01:43:18,117
Let's take in everything that will make us stronger.

2761
01:43:18,118 --> 01:43:19,317
- Exactly.
- Okay.

2762
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,157
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Good.

2763
01:43:21,158 --> 01:43:22,217
Well done.

2764
01:43:22,218 --> 01:43:23,458
- Well done.
- Okay.

2765
01:43:23,858 --> 01:43:26,028
Let's check out the next one.

2766
01:43:27,128 --> 01:43:28,128
Uie.

2767
01:43:28,328 --> 01:43:30,397
- Uie.
- Her stamina is insane.

2768
01:43:30,398 --> 01:43:32,128
You did what you wanted from the start.

2769
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:34,438
(Jab, one, two)

2770
01:43:34,768 --> 01:43:36,568
One, two.

2771
01:43:36,608 --> 01:43:38,507
Can you feel that your one-two improved a lot?

2772
01:43:38,508 --> 01:43:40,538
- Seriously.
- The one-two.

2773
01:43:40,638 --> 01:43:42,037
- I don't know.
- Don't you know?

2774
01:43:42,038 --> 01:43:43,278
- Watch.
- From the start...

2775
01:43:43,808 --> 01:43:45,007
(Uie)

2776
01:43:45,008 --> 01:43:49,218
(During the first full sparring that took place last time, )

2777
01:43:49,918 --> 01:43:51,787
(her punches either missed the target...)

2778
01:43:51,788 --> 01:43:54,918
(or were too weak.)

2779
01:43:55,288 --> 01:43:57,488
(How was she today?)

2780
01:43:58,058 --> 01:43:59,527
(She threw the one-two at the right timing.)

2781
01:43:59,528 --> 01:44:00,797
(Valid strike 1)

2782
01:44:00,798 --> 01:44:01,898
That was so fast.

2783
01:44:02,128 --> 01:44:04,467
The opponent kept taking jabs. Can you see that?

2784
01:44:04,468 --> 01:44:06,767
The red headgear kept going up.

2785
01:44:06,768 --> 01:44:08,568
Yes. She kept taking jabs.

2786
01:44:09,098 --> 01:44:11,337
(Uie has grown into someone with the strong one-two.)

2787
01:44:11,338 --> 01:44:13,637
- She's strong.
- As you can see,

2788
01:44:13,638 --> 01:44:15,937
you kept following your opponent.

2789
01:44:15,938 --> 01:44:17,107
You kept following her.

2790
01:44:17,108 --> 01:44:19,548
- There's no need to do that.
- I should make her come to me.

2791
01:44:19,678 --> 01:44:20,947
(Uie)

2792
01:44:20,948 --> 01:44:27,288
(She followed her opponent around in order to attack.)

2793
01:44:27,358 --> 01:44:29,458
Uie, you got close to the opponent.

2794
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:31,557
I don't want you to think,

2795
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:32,957
- "Should I not do that?" - Okay.

2796
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:34,457
It's good to get close to the opponent,

2797
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:37,328
but you need to move back quickly after landing a blow.

2798
01:44:37,468 --> 01:44:39,328
- I want you to do that.
- It'll be cool.

2799
01:44:39,598 --> 01:44:42,037
- So I shouldn't keep my distance.
- That's right.

2800
01:44:42,038 --> 01:44:44,407
This boxer's punches were too big.

2801
01:44:44,408 --> 01:44:45,538
You'll know from the video.

2802
01:44:45,968 --> 01:44:47,207
Her movements were too big.

2803
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,207
But had they been a bit smaller,

2804
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:51,878
- you could've gotten hit.
- I could've gotten hit.

2805
01:44:52,348 --> 01:44:54,118
In that case,

2806
01:44:54,218 --> 01:44:56,317
you need to defend yourselves...

2807
01:44:56,318 --> 01:44:58,047
- while maintaining your style.
- Okay.

2808
01:44:58,048 --> 01:45:00,458
- That's why I'm telling you this.
- Okay.

2809
01:45:00,718 --> 01:45:03,558
(Uie continued to follow her around in Round 2.)

2810
01:45:04,088 --> 01:45:06,558
See? You took a blow just now. That was what I meant.

2811
01:45:06,658 --> 01:45:08,027
That could happen.

2812
01:45:08,028 --> 01:45:11,097
You could've won by sticking to Routine One.

2813
01:45:11,098 --> 01:45:12,927
One, two, backstep, one, two.

2814
01:45:12,928 --> 01:45:13,998
That's right.

2815
01:45:14,598 --> 01:45:17,507
Uie, you were a difficult opponent for this boxer.

2816
01:45:17,508 --> 01:45:19,067
- That's right.
- Of course. She's very tall.

2817
01:45:19,068 --> 01:45:21,138
Yes. You were a very difficult opponent.

2818
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:26,078
(The opponent threw punches that were high and big.)

2819
01:45:26,578 --> 01:45:30,048
(The more Uie moved back, the more the punches fell short.)

2820
01:45:30,718 --> 01:45:31,718
There you go.

2821
01:45:31,788 --> 01:45:33,757
(The opponent was flustered by the punches that fell short.)

2822
01:45:33,758 --> 01:45:34,817
She was flustered again.

2823
01:45:34,818 --> 01:45:36,827
You don't need to move closer in such situations.

2824
01:45:36,828 --> 01:45:39,087
- I see. Seriously, I should wait.
- Yes.

2825
01:45:39,088 --> 01:45:40,427
Move back and forth.

2826
01:45:40,428 --> 01:45:42,357
- I don't need to waste energy.
- That's right.

2827
01:45:42,358 --> 01:45:43,898
That's what I'm talking about.

2828
01:45:43,998 --> 01:45:46,097
You need to create a distance that'll bring the opponent's attack.

2829
01:45:46,098 --> 01:45:47,597
But that doesn't mean...

2830
01:45:47,598 --> 01:45:49,537
you should be close enough to take the opponent's punch.

2831
01:45:49,538 --> 01:45:51,337
- Okay.
- Move back and forth,

2832
01:45:51,338 --> 01:45:54,077
so that you can dodge the opponent's punches.

2833
01:45:54,078 --> 01:45:55,237
Then it'll be very difficult for the opponent.

2834
01:45:55,238 --> 01:45:58,847
The only attacks of yours that landed were jabs and one-twos.

2835
01:45:58,848 --> 01:45:59,947
- That's right.
- Yes.

2836
01:45:59,948 --> 01:46:02,617
- But...
- Still, she couldn't come closer.

2837
01:46:02,618 --> 01:46:04,717
- That's right.
- Okay. I'll practice harder.

2838
01:46:04,718 --> 01:46:07,058
- "Rule the world through jabs." - That's right.

2839
01:46:07,288 --> 01:46:09,257
- You remember that, right?
- Yes. Rule the world through jabs.

2840
01:46:09,258 --> 01:46:11,387
Uie will be that person.

2841
01:46:11,388 --> 01:46:13,757
Yes. You see why jabs are important, right?

2842
01:46:13,758 --> 01:46:15,257
- Yes.
- Your jabs landed today.

2843
01:46:15,258 --> 01:46:17,428
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

2844
01:46:18,298 --> 01:46:19,838
- Okay.
- She doesn't disappoint.

2845
01:46:19,898 --> 01:46:22,637
Let's move on to the next strategic analysis.

2846
01:46:22,638 --> 01:46:24,507
I'm sure it's your first time seeing it.

2847
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:26,067
Didn't I ask for popcorn?

2848
01:46:26,068 --> 01:46:27,107
(In Ah)

2849
01:46:27,108 --> 01:46:28,637
She was cool from that moment.

2850
01:46:28,638 --> 01:46:30,908
- She's practically flying.
- In Ah took a body blow.

2851
01:46:31,408 --> 01:46:34,218
I don't feel anything from a blow to the stomach.

2852
01:46:34,848 --> 01:46:36,378
She's unfazed. Punch.

2853
01:46:37,048 --> 01:46:38,488
You did an amazing job just now.

2854
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:40,358
You seized the timing.

2855
01:46:40,488 --> 01:46:41,987
You read the timing instinctively.

2856
01:46:41,988 --> 01:46:44,758
When the opponent attacked, In Ah took it.

2857
01:46:45,028 --> 01:46:46,958
That fight continued on.

2858
01:46:47,058 --> 01:46:50,127
And both fighters had their own rhythms.

2859
01:46:50,128 --> 01:46:51,297
- That's right.
- Yes.

2860
01:46:51,298 --> 01:46:52,327
- You can see that, right?
- Yes.

2861
01:46:52,328 --> 01:46:53,837
- Right now.
- The opponent is so fast.

2862
01:46:53,838 --> 01:46:56,437
The opponent moved in, but... Then In Ah moved in.

2863
01:46:56,438 --> 01:46:57,808
How did In Ah move in?

2864
01:46:58,038 --> 01:46:59,268
- She used footwork.
- Yes.

2865
01:46:59,608 --> 01:47:01,677
That deserves a compliment.

2866
01:47:01,678 --> 01:47:03,708
Whether or not you attacked,

2867
01:47:03,778 --> 01:47:06,278
you kept the opponent at a certain distance.

2868
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,748
Also, I stopped the video to praise something In Ah did.

2869
01:47:12,648 --> 01:47:14,057
Punch, turn, punch.

2870
01:47:14,058 --> 01:47:15,358
(Pivot, one, two)

2871
01:47:15,718 --> 01:47:18,238
Did you see that? She threw a punch right after turning around.

2872
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:20,228
It might look like nothing,

2873
01:47:20,328 --> 01:47:22,088
but this is what we've talked about nonstop.

2874
01:47:22,828 --> 01:47:24,168
It's fun.

2875
01:47:24,568 --> 01:47:27,137
It was your match. You did it.

2876
01:47:27,138 --> 01:47:30,168
While you did much better than I expected...

2877
01:47:30,608 --> 01:47:32,437
(Was there a problem?)

2878
01:47:32,438 --> 01:47:33,908
Toward the end,

2879
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:36,648
you lost momentum.

2880
01:47:36,748 --> 01:47:37,908
You'll be able to see that.

2881
01:47:39,778 --> 01:47:40,977
She stopped here.

2882
01:47:40,978 --> 01:47:43,147
- Strangely, she stood motionless.
- Watch.

2883
01:47:43,148 --> 01:47:44,724
- Her stamina ran out.
- I took a heavy blow.

2884
01:47:44,748 --> 01:47:47,587
That's right. I wondered why In Ah did that.

2885
01:47:47,588 --> 01:47:50,158
(Her guard was completely down.)

2886
01:47:50,888 --> 01:47:54,358
If you hadn't allowed the last blow, it would've been perfect.

2887
01:47:54,798 --> 01:47:56,827
A lion falls asleep at times.

2888
01:47:56,828 --> 01:47:58,768
- In Ah always do that.
- Yes.

2889
01:47:58,828 --> 01:48:00,997
She did that last time. Even during the first sparring,

2890
01:48:00,998 --> 01:48:02,267
she suddenly went...

2891
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:03,738
She has those moments.

2892
01:48:04,408 --> 01:48:10,048
(During the first full sparring, In Ah suddenly stopped.)

2893
01:48:12,748 --> 01:48:19,517
(She was knocked down in the end.)

2894
01:48:19,518 --> 01:48:22,087
It could be a sudden drop in stamina...

2895
01:48:22,088 --> 01:48:24,528
or spirits.

2896
01:48:24,628 --> 01:48:25,957
- I don't think it was my stamina.
- That's right.

2897
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,027
- I think I lost my spirits.
- It's like falling asleep.

2898
01:48:28,028 --> 01:48:29,427
- When I take too many punches...
- It happens so suddenly.

2899
01:48:29,428 --> 01:48:33,228
Toward the end, I took about four punches.

2900
01:48:33,338 --> 01:48:36,198
- Then I heard a ring.
- She became furious.

2901
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:39,468
I heard the alarm and raised my guard again.

2902
01:48:40,778 --> 01:48:43,778
(Alarm)

2903
01:48:44,548 --> 01:48:47,218
(Simba Seol was awakened in the last 10 seconds.)

2904
01:48:47,918 --> 01:48:51,017
(She wakes up and pours out the attacks.)

2905
01:48:51,018 --> 01:48:52,247
It was a painful experience.

2906
01:48:52,248 --> 01:48:54,957
- "Had I done this," - I was lacking.

2907
01:48:54,958 --> 01:48:56,587
- "I could've hit her." - That's right.

2908
01:48:56,588 --> 01:48:58,487
- You need that regret.
- I totally have it.

2909
01:48:58,488 --> 01:49:01,227
If you have such regrets, it means that you've improved.

2910
01:49:01,228 --> 01:49:02,298
- Okay.
- Okay.

2911
01:49:02,428 --> 01:49:04,397
- Next is...
- Gosh.

2912
01:49:04,398 --> 01:49:06,327
- We have...
- Another main event remains.

2913
01:49:06,328 --> 01:49:08,014
- the main dessert.
- The double main event.

2914
01:49:08,038 --> 01:49:09,537
She did really well.

2915
01:49:09,538 --> 01:49:11,438
The main dessert, Ju Hyun.

2916
01:49:11,568 --> 01:49:13,537
Let's watch Ju Hyun's match.

2917
01:49:13,538 --> 01:49:14,937
(Ju Hyun's strategic analysis starts.)

2918
01:49:14,938 --> 01:49:16,178
It was so much fun.

2919
01:49:16,538 --> 01:49:18,647
The opponent was very aggressive.

2920
01:49:18,648 --> 01:49:19,877
She moved in aggressively.

2921
01:49:19,878 --> 01:49:21,117
I was flustered at first.

2922
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:23,148
I bet you were flustered. She moved in right away.

2923
01:49:23,388 --> 01:49:24,488
If you watch the video,

2924
01:49:25,318 --> 01:49:28,188
Ju Hyun dodges the attacks languidly.

2925
01:49:30,458 --> 01:49:33,258
Since she was too close, I had to turn.

2926
01:49:33,358 --> 01:49:35,258
You turned and retreated instinctively.

2927
01:49:35,898 --> 01:49:37,428
Look at that. She moved back.

2928
01:49:37,528 --> 01:49:39,998
Did you see that just now?

2929
01:49:40,468 --> 01:49:43,407
It's a technique you see from a skilled boxer.

2930
01:49:43,408 --> 01:49:45,407
They can punch and step back.

2931
01:49:45,408 --> 01:49:47,907
- She did that.
- Is there a boxer in my family?

2932
01:49:47,908 --> 01:49:48,977
What was that?

2933
01:49:48,978 --> 01:49:50,577
When the opponent approached her with rock,

2934
01:49:50,578 --> 01:49:52,478
she responded with jazz.

2935
01:49:52,678 --> 01:49:53,848
I'm a woman of jazz.

2936
01:49:53,918 --> 01:49:55,478
She did it languidly.

2937
01:49:55,818 --> 01:49:59,118
(The opponent's style was rock.)

2938
01:49:59,648 --> 01:50:03,088
(Ju Hyun's style was jazz.)

2939
01:50:03,928 --> 01:50:06,387
(The musician in the boxing scene., )

2940
01:50:06,388 --> 01:50:09,658
(the jazz boxer, Park Ju Hyun)

2941
01:50:09,828 --> 01:50:13,398
This is what you need to notice from Ju Hyun's match.

2942
01:50:13,438 --> 01:50:15,038
- She didn't punch hard.
- That's right.

2943
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:16,937
- That's right.
- Really?

2944
01:50:16,938 --> 01:50:18,938
- Punch, hit, punch.
- She kept going...

2945
01:50:19,168 --> 01:50:20,877
(Punch, backstep)

2946
01:50:20,878 --> 01:50:22,938
She punched and stepped back.

2947
01:50:23,008 --> 01:50:24,508
She kept doing that.

2948
01:50:24,908 --> 01:50:26,747
Her movements were kept small, right?

2949
01:50:26,748 --> 01:50:29,077
Since her movements were small, she received a chance.

2950
01:50:29,078 --> 01:50:30,618
But the opponent's movements were big.

2951
01:50:30,848 --> 01:50:33,658
"I'll beat her!" That was why her movements were big.

2952
01:50:35,188 --> 01:50:36,257
Ju Hyun expected it.

2953
01:50:36,258 --> 01:50:38,428
Her movements were big.

2954
01:50:38,588 --> 01:50:41,258
- You noticed that quickly...
- That's right.

2955
01:50:41,298 --> 01:50:44,128
And adjusted your movements. That's why I'm praising you.

2956
01:50:44,698 --> 01:50:46,697
The opponent received big damage. Do you know why?

2957
01:50:46,698 --> 01:50:48,337
- She took the hits while moving in.
- The timing. That's right.

2958
01:50:48,338 --> 01:50:50,538
- Timing is very important.
- That's right.

2959
01:50:51,038 --> 01:50:52,207
(A precise jab)

2960
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:53,578
(Staggering)

2961
01:50:54,278 --> 01:50:55,278
(Thanks to the perfect timing, )

2962
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:56,677
(she gave her opponent a big damage without using much strength.)

2963
01:50:56,678 --> 01:50:59,207
In terms of a punch, 70 percent is up to the strength,

2964
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:01,177
and 30 percent is up to the timing.

2965
01:51:01,178 --> 01:51:03,047
Together, they make 100 percent.

2966
01:51:03,048 --> 01:51:04,117
- Well done.
- I really felt it today.

2967
01:51:04,118 --> 01:51:07,887
If my movements are big, my punches won't reach the target.

2968
01:51:07,888 --> 01:51:10,358
Each opponent...

2969
01:51:10,428 --> 01:51:12,787
had prepared for the competition.

2970
01:51:12,788 --> 01:51:14,127
They did incredibly well.

2971
01:51:14,128 --> 01:51:15,897
You guys went against the opponents who had boxed for 1 to 3 years...

2972
01:51:15,898 --> 01:51:17,527
by putting on the gloves...

2973
01:51:17,528 --> 01:51:19,167
and punching them in the face in the ring.

2974
01:51:19,168 --> 01:51:21,397
- It's incredibly hard to do.
- That's right.

2975
01:51:21,398 --> 01:51:22,697
In any case, you guys did well.

2976
01:51:22,698 --> 01:51:25,268
- The next training...
- Okay.

2977
01:51:25,438 --> 01:51:29,108
Will involve a special place and a special person.

2978
01:51:29,138 --> 01:51:30,578
Will it be training?

2979
01:51:31,448 --> 01:51:32,448
It'll be a play.

2980
01:51:33,548 --> 01:51:36,217
- It'll be a fun play.
- Forget about a play!

2981
01:51:36,218 --> 01:51:38,288
But you'll run out of breath.

2982
01:51:38,518 --> 01:51:40,048
In any case, you guys did well today.

2983
01:51:40,118 --> 01:51:42,187
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2984
01:51:42,188 --> 01:51:43,527
(What's the play that'll make them run out of breath?)

2985
01:51:43,528 --> 01:51:45,927
- We've improved so much.
- Thank you.

2986
01:51:45,928 --> 01:51:47,088
Thank you for your hard work.

2987
01:51:47,312 --> 01:51:49,620
(What's the place that makes Iron Girls exclaim?)

2988
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,220
(Iron Girls in Phuket)

2989
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:53,960
(We're here to play.)

2990
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:56,060
(Will we finally get a vacation?)

2991
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:57,129
(Let's move!)

2992
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:58,650
(Let's set off to enjoy the vacation.)

2993
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:01,260
(Run over here fast!)

2994
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:03,330
(They become flustered.)

2995
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,430
(I'm the head coach of the Pirate Camp.)

2996
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:06,770
("Pirate Camp?")

2997
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,900
(Pirates who are crazy about exercising)

2998
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:10,710
(Mixed strength training)

2999
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:12,309
(What's this?)

3000
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:14,190
(Training of the legendary level of difficulty)

3001
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:15,840
(Because of the scary head coach, )

3002
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,280
(Iron Girls get knocked out.)

3003
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:20,410
(In the Pirate Camp, will they be able to return home?)

3004
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,620
(The first competition is just 10 days away.)

3005
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,119
(Full sparring sessions...)

3006
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,920
(with foreign athletes)

3007
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,759
(It's their final practice run before the first match.)

3008
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,659
(Ireland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Thailand)

3009
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,636
(They will be facing athletes from 4 different countries...)

3010
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:35,600
(as representatives of Korea.)

3011
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,429
(Even after blow...)

3012
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:40,070
(upon blow, )

3013
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:42,310
(the mysterious foreign athletes...)

3014
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,710
(respond with wild intensity.)

3015
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:47,910
Box!

3016
01:52:47,911 --> 01:52:50,010
(Which country will come out on top?)
