1
00:00:00,594 --> 00:00:03,394
(One day in early summer when the heat wave began)

2
00:00:03,764 --> 00:00:06,564
(Kwon Sung Min, Seoul Physical Education Middle School)

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:09,964
(Jung Ju Hyeong, former member of the national boxing team)

4
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:13,074
(With them, Iron Girls had...)

5
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,304
(two sessions of supervised sparring.)

6
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:18,944
(They punched and got punched in the ring...)

7
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:23,414
(and discovered their own possibilities.)

8
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,754
(Iron Girls were taught what they could do to improve.)

9
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:29,383
I have a very important announcement.

10
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:30,824
Okay. What is it?

11
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,654
- At the end of June, - Okay.

12
00:00:32,854 --> 00:00:34,624
You'll have an actual spar.

13
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:35,823
Full sparring.

14
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:38,264
- It'll practically be a match. - What?

15
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,293
Two participants will box for real without holding back.

16
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:41,433
- It'll be a match. - Yes.

17
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:42,663
- It'll be a mock test. - Okay.

18
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,104
- A mock CSAT. - Okay.

19
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:48,243
(Iron Girls are training after the two supervised sparring)

20
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:51,544
(Analyzing the video of the spar with the coach)

21
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:53,974
I got punched a lot.

22
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:56,514
Ju Hyeong just went,

23
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:59,584
"Punch, punch!" Seriously.

24
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:01,623
I lack the physical strength.

25
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:04,324
When I get punched left and right, I can't do anything.

26
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:07,664
I actually gave it a try.

27
00:01:07,964 --> 00:01:10,263
It worked well. I could dodge.

28
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:11,264
That's right.

29
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:14,293
The thing is, I still don't have a sense of distance.

30
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:15,803
- That's right. - For that,

31
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:17,973
- you'll continue to train. - Is there a way to improve?

32
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,333
You'll continue to train.

33
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:22,203
Even when my arm...

34
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:23,943
can't reach the target, I start from here.

35
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:26,044
- Even when I do it gently... - That's right.

36
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:30,114
(Now, they practice as if it's an actual match.)

37
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:34,984
(They wear headgear even during practice.)

38
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:38,623
(They spar with each other.)

39
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:39,653
(Sae Rok, In Ah)

40
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:44,494
(Through method boxing, they practice exchanging punches.)

41
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,233
(In Ah)

42
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:49,934
Don't turn your face. Don't do that.

43
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,304
That happens when you raise your head.

44
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,004
There you go.

45
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:59,014
(Her chin becomes defenseless when she raises her head.)

46
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:02,944
(And she has a habit of turning her face when she gets punched.)

47
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:08,254
(On top of that, she keeps dropping her guard.)

48
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:09,683
(In Ah)

49
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:10,983
Keep your guard up.

50
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,153
You keep dropping your guard.

51
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,993
You shouldn't do that.

52
00:02:14,994 --> 00:02:17,734
(Defenseless)

53
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:21,404
(Her problematic habits persist even during practice.)

54
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:25,134
(No more mistakes.)

55
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,434
- I'll keep my hand up like this. - Yes.

56
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,674
You're so determined. Seriously.

57
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,713
(In Ah's training log: Will you keep dropping your guard?)

58
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:35,913
(Will you keep your chin up?)

59
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:37,954
(Do you want to get punched? Come to your senses.)

60
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:39,383
(She diligently does physical therapy for her knees.)

61
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,454
- You're here again. - I'm here again.

62
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:43,383
This reminds me of last year.

63
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,523
(In Ah's training log: My knees are improving.)

64
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:45,853
(Taking good care of the body is an athlete's responsibility!)

65
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:47,123
(I want to keep my knees and mind healthy and get good results.)

66
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,193
(In Ah)

67
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:51,664
(She trains to improve her stamina.)

68
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,093
(In Ah's training log: I ran 5.5km and did 5 sets of sprints...)

69
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:55,503
(with Coach Ji Hoon and Captain Kim.)

70
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,744
(I felt like I would throw up. I felt like I would cry.)

71
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,504
(She does basic training diligently for her posture.)

72
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:02,243
(In Ah's training log: Boxing training of the netherworld)

73
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:03,903
(I thought I could go home after running for 1 hour and 10 minutes, )

74
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:05,173
(but he made me box for 1 hour and 20 minutes.)

75
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:06,573
(Hades exists in the real world beyond the myth.)

76
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:07,574
(In Ah, Coach)

77
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:08,813
(Training for the actual match is the most important.)

78
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,143
It was too big.

79
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:11,414
(In Ah)

80
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:13,414
There you go.

81
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,454
(A punch to the stomach)

82
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:21,963
It's okay. You need to keep going.

83
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,094
My stomach hurts.

84
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:24,863
- Does your stomach hurt? - Did you take a punch there?

85
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:28,364
(In Ah collapses after taking a punch to the stomach.)

86
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,303
- Was it the pit? - It wasn't a hard blow.

87
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,043
(Painful coughs)

88
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,043
- It didn't seem like a hard blow. - It was a bad spot.

89
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,773
The timing must've been bad.

90
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,494
(The timing of the punch must've been bad.)

91
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:43,883
I'm okay.

92
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,914
(I'm okay.)

93
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,523
Hold your breath when your stomach gets punched.

94
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:49,583
(Hold your breath when your stomach gets punched.)

95
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:51,664
You double over when you take a punch as you inhale.

96
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:52,694
That's right.

97
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,563
I didn't even consider it a punch.

98
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:55,993
I thought it was a light touch.

99
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,763
I was inhaling...

100
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,664
- when it came. - That was when the punch came.

101
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:01,134
Get up.

102
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,203
(In Ah's training log: I found out why Ju Hyun cried...)

103
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,403
(after a punch in the stomach. I got punched in the stomach...)

104
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,373
(during supervised sparring and ended up collapsing.)

105
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,574
(I couldn't stop coughing.)

106
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,914
(Thankfully, In Ah regains her pace.)

107
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,513
(In Ah's training log: My mindset was, )

108
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:16,083
("Enjoy what you can't avoid. No one can beat someone...")

109
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,160
("who enjoys what she does. Let's do this properly.")

110
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:19,953
(In Ah is becoming stronger.)

111
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:20,984
There you go.

112
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,583
Slowly. Both sides.

113
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,954
You need to look.

114
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,354
Hurry up and look.

115
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:28,474
- I'm scared. - Look when you get punched.

116
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:29,663
- Hurry up. - I'm scared.

117
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:30,824
You need to do it.

118
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,194
I can't look.

119
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:33,763
You need to look. Look until the end.

120
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,403
(She's too scared to look at her opponent.)

121
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,464
There you go.

122
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,774
(During the first supervised sparring, )

123
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:43,604
(she moved forward with her head hung low.)

124
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:46,844
(During the second supervised sparring, )

125
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:50,144
(she continued to look down.)

126
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:55,924
(Ju Hyun needs to overcome her fear of getting punched.)

127
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,123
(Next day as well, she receives training to face her fear.)

128
00:04:58,124 --> 00:04:59,594
Punch, punch. There you go.

129
00:05:00,054 --> 00:05:01,124
There you go.

130
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,463
- All right. - It's too much.

131
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:03,863
Why is it scary even when you stand still?

132
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:04,864
Listen.

133
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,334
You shouldn't be scared.

134
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:07,564
Again.

135
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:09,803
(Ju Hyun's training log: I want to overcome the fear...)

136
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:10,933
(of getting punched, but it's scary.)

137
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,033
(Today, I practiced dodging and attacking with my eyes open.)

138
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,573
(Until the day I keep my eyes open, )

139
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:16,414
(I won't look away, even if my legs give out.)

140
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:18,774
Punch!

141
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,044
(Ju Hyun's boxing mate is Actor Lee Sang Yi.)

142
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:22,743
You need to look as you punch.

143
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:23,784
Look as you punch.

144
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:28,984
(Sang Yi points out the same problem.)

145
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,153
(Ju Hyun's training log: Today, Sang Yi tapped on my stomach...)

146
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:32,223
(as he took punches from me.)

147
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:33,693
(I'll train hard so that I can use...)

148
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,774
(the footwork and punches I've learned in the ring.)

149
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:36,964
(Until the day her fear disappears, she will keep practicing.)

150
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,294
There you go.

151
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,434
Stomach.

152
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:47,943
(Sae Rok asks so many questions.)

153
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:49,343
(Now, I know what's happening.)

154
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,784
(So I'll put my guard up to the side to prepare for a punch.)

155
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:56,644
What do I do if the distance is far like now?

156
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,354
- Do I need to get closer? - Yes.

157
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,183
What do you do if you take a punch...

158
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,524
after doing this?

159
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,594
(Sae Rok keeps asking questions and getting advice on sparring.)

160
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:08,494
As for me,

161
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:11,194
- I learn by watching you. - Why?

162
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,064
I watch you as I jump rope.

163
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,933
And I can see that my body is tense.

164
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:17,304
You're a total learner.

165
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,203
I'm making an effort.

166
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:20,373
You learn so diligently.

167
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:22,150
(Her desire to learn burns bright during stamina training.)

168
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,803
(Sae Rok's training log: Coach Ji Hoon and In Ah told me...)

169
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:24,873
(that my stamina improved a lot.)

170
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,373
(I didn't notice it, but it was nice to receive a compliment.)

171
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:28,060
(I feel like I'm getting closer to boxing! It's hot!)

172
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:29,644
We need to do the ladder exercise.

173
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:32,783
My legs are weak,

174
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,514
so I really need to do the ladder exercise.

175
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:40,554
(Now, she's capable of assessing herself.)

176
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,123
(Sae Rok's training log: I can't do the footwork quickly...)

177
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,233
(because my legs are heavy. Doing the ladder exercise...)

178
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,114
(to practice moving my feet quickly will help!)

179
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,263
(She looks for problems even during sparring.)

180
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,334
How cool.

181
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:52,833
(Sae Rok's bad habit)

182
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:53,873
It's too big.

183
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:56,604
(Big movements)

184
00:06:57,904 --> 00:07:01,584
(She flexes her muscles to punch hard.)

185
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:02,813
Don't try to punch hard.

186
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,283
(As if she's loading a gun, )

187
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,554
(her movements become big.)

188
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:11,624
(Because of the big preparation, )

189
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:15,264
(the opponent can figure out her attacking patterns easily.)

190
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,764
(Punch! Punch, punch!)

191
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:22,904
(Keep the movements short and simple!)

192
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:25,103
There you go. Good.

193
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:27,273
(The next day, she does method sparring with In Ah.)

194
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,704
Nice posture. There you go.

195
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:31,543
(Her movements are...)

196
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,944
(still big.)

197
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:35,914
Stop.

198
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:37,914
You're doing this again.

199
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:39,214
Use your waist.

200
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:40,954
Okay.

201
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:41,984
Again.

202
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:43,753
(Use the waist, not the arms!)

203
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,754
Good.

204
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,654
- Okay. - That's it.

205
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,494
Use the waist only.

206
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,323
(She repeatedly practices punching with her waist.)

207
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,363
There you go.

208
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:53,870
(She repeatedly practices punching with her waist.)

209
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,603
(Sae Rok's training log: I figured it out! The brakes!)

210
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,333
(I needed to step on the brakes with my left foot...)

211
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,873
(and punch with the waist, not the arms, )

212
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,155
(for a bigger impact and a stronger punch! I get it now!)

213
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,843
(Sae Rok's training log: I won't do the one-two with my arm.)

214
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:06,043
(I won't forget to twist my waist. I'll practice the routines...)

215
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:07,844
(so that they'll become mine. Let's do this.)

216
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:15,384
(Her movements become much smaller and simpler.)

217
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:18,393
(Before adjustments)

218
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:20,793
(After adjustments)

219
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,793
(Sae Rok's training log: I figured out the brakes...)

220
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,914
(a few days ago. I could put it into practice today.)

221
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:29,934
(As she keeps records every day, her movements change.)

222
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,333
(Her training logs are filled with words!)

223
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,734
(Rocky is a model student in the Iron School's Boxing Club.)

224
00:08:37,204 --> 00:08:40,714
(Uie also trains passionately.)

225
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,344
I want to steal your soul.

226
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:47,714
(Her passion burns hotter after sparring.)

227
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:50,154
- Coach, I really want to do well. - Okay.

228
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:51,953
My legs are the biggest problem, right?

229
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:53,254
Yes. But...

230
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,964
they'll get better if you practice a lot.

231
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,964
(Her faltering footwork was the biggest problem.)

232
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,194
(Hopping)

233
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:03,604
(She became a roe deer when she got flustered.)

234
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:07,504
(What Uie needs the most is footwork training.)

235
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,204
(Standing awkwardly)

236
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,474
I became a roe deer again.

237
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:17,043
(She shows the roe deer footwork again.)

238
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,313
(Uie, Sae Rok)

239
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:20,583
(When she practiced sparring with Sae Rok, )

240
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,183
(her footwork was bad.)

241
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:23,284
(Staggering)

242
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:28,364
Don't do what you did just now!

243
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,394
Don't move your back foot like this.

244
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:31,663
From here, slide.

245
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,463
If the opponent is too far, move closer like this.

246
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:36,503
(It's hard for her to fix her footwork.)

247
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,003
(Uie)

248
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:39,304
Your movements are too big.

249
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,633
The back foot...

250
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,574
shouldn't move like this.

251
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:45,274
Hold on.

252
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,114
Uie, you keep doing this.

253
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:49,244
That's why you do the kangaroo footwork.

254
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:51,383
Why don't you do this?

255
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,824
(Despite the continued practice, she can't control her legs.)

256
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,083
(She drags her back foot again.)

257
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:58,294
You're doing it again.

258
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:04,124
(Her confidence level falls.)

259
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:08,203
Sparring will be a disaster at this rate.

260
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:09,234
Come on.

261
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,273
Punch, punch! That's how you do it.

262
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:14,273
Punch like this, okay?

263
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:15,394
(Uie plops down in the end.)

264
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:19,744
(She resumes her training.)

265
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,483
Come on.

266
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:23,713
(But she continues to struggle mentally.)

267
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,053
It's okay. Cheer up.

268
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,694
(But she continues to struggle mentally.)

269
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:32,254
(Uie is someone who perseveres in any situation.)

270
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:37,824
(But boxing is too difficult.)

271
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:43,034
(Since Uie is exhausted, they take a break.)

272
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,604
(She bursts into tears in the end.)

273
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,773
- It's so annoying. - Why?

274
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,074
What's wrong?

275
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,944
It's annoying because I can't do it.

276
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,773
Why are you crying?

277
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:56,014
I really can't do it.

278
00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:57,844
I can't do anything.

279
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:03,284
(Uie still has many things to overcome.)

280
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,423
You must be thinking,

281
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:07,894
"Why did I ever agree to do this?"

282
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,564
I can't help but become sensitive.

283
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,834
That's how it is.

284
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,693
All right. Good luck.

285
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:19,734
(She picks herself up and resumes the training.)

286
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:23,473
(In Ah)

287
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,913
(They collapse multiple times.)

288
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:27,573
(Ju Hyun)

289
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:32,983
(They collapse multiple times.)

290
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,384
(In Ah, Sae Rok)

291
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,554
(Getting back up)

292
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:42,263
(But they get back in the end.)

293
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:44,564
(Uie)

294
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,233
(Sae Rok)

295
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:54,174
(Iron Girls have the fighting spirit.)

296
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:59,644
(The intensity of their training increases.)

297
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:05,953
(They grit their teeth for the 2 weeks of training.)

298
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:13,324
(June)

299
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:18,224
(Will Iron Girls do well in the first full sparring?)

300
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,904
(After 2 weeks of passionate training, )

301
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:24,744
(they come to a place that's full of green plants.)

302
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:29,944
(Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province)

303
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:35,384
(Is this a university campus?)

304
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,953
(What are they doing here?)

305
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:42,684
- Hello. - Hello.

306
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:45,794
Boxers walk!

307
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,963
(They appear with a lot of noise.)

308
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:51,663
(Boxing became a part of Iron Girls' lives.)

309
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:53,093
You guys have good energy today.

310
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:54,933
- You guys seem like boxers now. - Yes.

311
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:56,634
How is training going these days?

312
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,373
- Sparring still scares me. - Sparring.

313
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,473
- That's right. - Thinking about it scares me.

314
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,603
- Getting punched scares you. - Yes.

315
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:03,903
On top of that,

316
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:06,313
- everyone is struggling mentally. - Why?

317
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:08,213
The more we get into boxing,

318
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:09,583
- the more frustrated we become. - It's hard.

319
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:10,943
Our bodies don't move as we want.

320
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,813
- That's right. - I feel like...

321
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:14,583
we've reached our limits.

322
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:15,684
I had the same experience.

323
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:17,083
"Am I doing well?

324
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,123
I had a vague sense of fear.

325
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:20,554
- That's right. - That's right.

326
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:22,464
- That's right. - But when I had a match,

327
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:25,023
my opponent struggled more than I expected.

328
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:27,433
I could see the opponent's punches at times.

329
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:29,033
That made me think, "I'm doing well."

330
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,433
- "I've done well." - How cool.

331
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,503
You'll gain that confidence...

332
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:33,603
during the match.

333
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,173
- We know that they trained hard. - Yes.

334
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,173
- I really hope that happens. - I got goosebumps.

335
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,473
Even if it's just once.

336
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:39,543
(What they desperately need in this moment is confidence.)

337
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:41,273
"How am I seeing punches coming? I want to feel this.

338
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:43,443
- I hope that will happen. - Right.

339
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,884
Please make sure the opponent won't feel that way.

340
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,184
- Of course. - Don't worry about that.

341
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,223
(By the way, this place is...)

342
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:51,923
I guess a festival is taking place here.

343
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,454
There are a lot of people.

344
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,624
(Crowded)

345
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:58,994
It says it's a competition.

346
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:00,733
Really?

347
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,404
(A competition? What competition?)

348
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,134
It says "boxing stadium."

349
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:05,834
Boxing stadium.

350
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:10,003
(Today is...)

351
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,843
(the day of the community sports boxing competition...)

352
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:14,213
(Community Sports Boxing Competition)

353
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,714
(that takes place here.)

354
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:21,754
(Boxers are gathering 1 by 1 to participate in the competition.)

355
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:25,994
(They are busy getting ready for the matches.)

356
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,794
We are not participating, are we?

357
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,214
- Did you bring your mouthpiece? - Today...

358
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:33,063
Today?

359
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,463
(We were told we'd be sparring, but it's a competition?)

360
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:35,634
Why are we here today?

361
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:38,404
Before you participate in a competition...

362
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,033
How things happen at a competition.

363
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,334
- I see. - Right.

364
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:44,844
And what kind of mindset the boxers have as they fight.

365
00:14:45,174 --> 00:14:47,373
You will be able to see those things with your own eyes.

366
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:48,713
- With our own eyes? - Yes.

367
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,383
I really needed this.

368
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,083
- Right. - In Season One,

369
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,084
we got to watch...

370
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:54,653
- a triathlon before we started. - Exactly.

371
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:55,923
But in this season...

372
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,523
When you watched a triathlon,

373
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,493
you thought, "This is so cool. I want to try it."

374
00:14:59,494 --> 00:15:01,253
But you would've wanted to quit if you watched a boxing match first.

375
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,624
- Oh, no. What do we do? - That's why...

376
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,370
- It was all planned out. - You wouldn't want to do it.

377
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,393
If you watched it, you wouldn't want to do it.

378
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,863
That's why we watched matches...

379
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,133
- only on YouTube every day. - We do that a lot.

380
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:15,104
- To see how other athletes do it. - Okay.

381
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,374
People from all over the country...

382
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:20,214
will be participating in this competition.

383
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,813
- There are about 240 people. - My gosh. That's a lot.

384
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,984
From all over the country?

385
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:29,924
(Participants are divided by age and weight class.)

386
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:34,324
About 24 female boxers will be competing.

387
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:38,463
(Boxers are gathered for the championship.)

388
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:39,863
(2025 Jincheon Mayor's Cup Boxing Tournament, Winner)

389
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,464
(2025 Jincheon Mayor's Cup)

390
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:44,303
This is interesting. When we watched the triathlon,

391
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,333
there weren't many female participants.

392
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,373
- Right. - That's true.

393
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:48,294
Boxing also has a lot fewer female participants.

394
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:50,244
Everyone, let's box together.

395
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,543
- No. After we finish this... - No!

396
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,073
Then women from all over the country...

397
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:55,313
would come to beat you, Sae Rok.

398
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:58,283
About 50 people would be competing in your weight class.

399
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,883
- Later. - Tell them to start later.

400
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,214
Start later.

401
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:03,723
Since there are many people, they started early in the morning.

402
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:04,883
- Already? - The matches have started.

403
00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:06,053
So, you should be paying...

404
00:16:06,054 --> 00:16:08,593
close attention to the matches in your weight class.

405
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:09,823
- Okay. - Let's go.

406
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,944
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

407
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:12,294
- Our seniors. - Let's go.

408
00:16:12,694 --> 00:16:13,793
I'm nervous.

409
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,734
It will be fun.

410
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:18,233
Once you go in, the atmosphere...

411
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:19,234
Right.

412
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,204
(Entering the stadium)

413
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,144
My gosh. What do we do?

414
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:26,714
This is crazy.

415
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:30,543
They're doing it. What do we do?

416
00:16:30,544 --> 00:16:31,954
- How do we watch this? - Go up.

417
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:36,223
(The tension of the participants before the game)

418
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:39,724
Don't be nervous.

419
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:43,824
(The stadium is heated with their burning passion.)

420
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:49,903
(A place where only the strong survive)

421
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:50,934
That's it.

422
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:54,273
(It's their first time watching the community sports competition.)

423
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:57,974
(What kind of participants will there be?)

424
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,869
- When you enter... - They must be really nervous.

425
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,470
- Imagine we will be doing this. - You should watch this closely.

426
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,070
This is Ring B, and this is Ring A.

427
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,570
- Will they be held simultaneously? - Yes, simultaneously.

428
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
Look at that.

429
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,510
Do you see the table over there?

430
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,549
That's the glove room.

431
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,649
(Glove room)

432
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,520
You put on the headgear and gloves there and wait.

433
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,859
Do they have their own gloves?

434
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,059
No, they use the provided ones.

435
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,459
I see.

436
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,059
(For safety and fairness, they put on gloves and headgear...)

437
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,730
(in the glove room before a match.)

438
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,229
- Go get them! - Let's go!

439
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,600
(Before the match, the head referee checks the gear once again.)

440
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,109
Coach, they are scoring the match now, right?

441
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,139
- Yes, they are. - They're doing it, right?

442
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,750
Do you see the referees there?

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,350
A boxing ring has 1 head referee, 3 assistant referees,

444
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,619
and one judge.

445
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,340
(Judge, 3 assistant referees, head referee)

446
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,589
Boxing is scored on a 10-point scale.

447
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,289
(Boxing uses a 10-point scale.)

448
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,530
In each round, the dominant fighter receives 10 points,

449
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,100
and the opponent receives a score between 9 and 6.

450
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,829
If the difference between the two fighters is close,

451
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,839
the score is 10 to 9.

452
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,739
If the difference is evident, it's 10 to 8.

453
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,710
If 1 fighter wins unilaterally, it's 10 to 7 or 10 to 6.

454
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,180
After the match is over,

455
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,179
the three assistant referees submit their score sheets.

456
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,349
(The referee collects them and passes them to the judge.)

457
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,919
The judge collects them...

458
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,249
and decides on the final winner.

459
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,730
(The main referee collects them and passes them to the judge.)

460
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,500
(The winner is announced by raising a red or blue sign.)

461
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,630
What is their weight class?

462
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
Minus 75kg.

463
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,639
(Men's minus 75kg division)

464
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,110
Round One.

465
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,640
- They look really big. - The 75kg division is big.

466
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,880
Be bold. That's it.

467
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,250
Good.

468
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,550
That's it.

469
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,949
(A left hook from the beginning)

470
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,090
(Amazed)

471
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,190
(Blue continues to strike.)

472
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,130
That's it.

473
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,530
You should block it.

474
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,959
What are the scoring criteria?

475
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,270
In boxing, a valid hit is called...

476
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,799
a clean hit.

477
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,239
(If the front of the glove directly touches...)

478
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,699
(the opponent's face or torso, it's a clean hit.)

479
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,369
A hit that clearly touches the face...

480
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,240
or the stomach.

481
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,439
(Below the belt, the back, the back of the neck and head are not valid.)

482
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,449
Hits below the belt...

483
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,750
are not counted.

484
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,390
(Hitting the guard is also not considered valid.)

485
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay.

486
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,559
Keep going. The last one. That's it.

487
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,999
(Blue's continuous attack)

488
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,300
- It's done. - Oh, no.

489
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,630
(Here comes the continuous hitting.)

490
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,439
The punch is crazy.

491
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,870
How is he punching so many times?

492
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,239
Good. Continue.

493
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Get out of it.

494
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,149
Keep going.

495
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,480
How can amateurs be so good?

496
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,149
(After the continuous hitting, )

497
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,260
(the match is stopped.)

498
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,929
(Then the referee starts counting.)

499
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,930
What was that, Coach?

500
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,429
Because of the continuous hitting...

501
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,329
So, the referee asks if he's okay?

502
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,099
If he holds out, will the match resume?

503
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,400
It's called standing eight count.

504
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,270
It's a down.

505
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,709
It's like a knockout.

506
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,369
(A count is given when a valid lands...)

507
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,939
(with a clear impact to the face or stomach.)

508
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,280
- Can you continue? - Yes.

509
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,249
(If the fighter can continue, the match resumes...)

510
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,550
(after counting from 1 to 8.)

511
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,149
Two standing eight counts in a round...

512
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,220
ends the fight.

513
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,359
- Is it over? - It's over.

514
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,589
(In a pro match, it's called a TKO.)

515
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,190
Let's say your opponent is down.

516
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,160
And you're told to wait in a corner.

517
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,660
In that case, you can't go back to your corner.

518
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,469
(When the opponent is down)

519
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,470
Over here.

520
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,510
(Blue was about to go back to his corner.)

521
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,510
- You should go over there. - Really?

522
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,350
(When the opponent is down, move to the neutral corner.)

523
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,049
- It is never allowed? - No.

524
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,749
- Because... - You must not do that.

525
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,119
If you go to your corner,

526
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,020
you can hear your coach's instructions.

527
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,519
Talking about strategies at that moment is not fair.

528
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,490
So you should go to the white corner.

529
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,959
Coach, I wish it would happen to me.

530
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,659
I want to be told to go to the white corner.

531
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,369
I see. That feels great.

532
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,399
I know. I want to see the referee...

533
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,299
- count to eight to the opponent. - It feels great.

534
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,470
- Let's see what the results are. - Okay.

535
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,170
A down significantly affects the score.

536
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,610
It's okay to...

537
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,609
(The blue corner wins.)

538
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,019
With one standing eight count,

539
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,820
you're highly likely to lose by decision.

540
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,289
So you should duck or get out of it quickly.

541
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,889
- Or you should try a punch. - Right. Try hitting.

542
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,890
- Do you understand? - Yes.

543
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,411
A standing eight count is significant.

544
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
(After the match is over)

545
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,200
You should go to the other corner and pay respect...

546
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,340
to the opponent's coaches before coming back.

547
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,540
- That's so cool. - That's good manners.

548
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,109
(The next match of the minus 75kg division continues.)

549
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,410
Get closer.

550
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,710
Nice!

551
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,700
- It didn't reach him. - I think it's over.

552
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,990
Stop.

553
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,120
- Nice! - Stop.

554
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,590
- Nice! - Stop.

555
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,230
(Knocked down by a hook)

556
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,540
(Shocked)

557
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,610
I'm scared.

558
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,980
(Reading their faces)

559
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,450
Hang on. I think it was a bad idea to bring you guys here.

560
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,179
This isn't a community sports competition, is it?

561
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,660
It is a community sports competition.

562
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,889
I was worried about you...

563
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,120
because its level has increased a lot.

564
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,230
(Shocked by the vivid scene before their eyes)

565
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,429
(Another men's match)

566
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,730
Round One.

567
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,839
(A powerful hook in an instant)

568
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,610
He's so good. Isn't he a pro?

569
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,910
(One more blow)

570
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,580
He's bleeding.

571
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,319
He's bleeding.

572
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,750
(A common situation in a striking combat sport)

573
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,460
(Standing eight count with a nosebleed)

574
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,929
You could bleed.

575
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,500
You know, you get punched in the face.

576
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,029
- You get punched in the face. - Right.

577
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,100
(Understanding)

578
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,840
(A fighting spirit where he doesn't stop even when bleeding)

579
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,710
Don't be afraid.

580
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,110
- You can do this. - Don't be afraid.

581
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,450
In Ring A, the elementary school division is starting.

582
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,779
(They were about to cry, but they smile right away.)

583
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,980
How adorable.

584
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,049
- The elementary school kids. - They're so cute.

585
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,859
(An elementary school division match is taking place in the other ring.)

586
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,760
(Fluttering)

587
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,029
(Being healed)

588
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,260
Hang on.

589
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,969
They're so lovely.

590
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,600
This is quite therapeutic.

591
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,740
(If you think they're just cute, you are mistaken.)

592
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,780
(Seriousness and focus hidden within the cuteness)

593
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,779
(Red attacks aggressively.)

594
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,050
Even elementary school children are fighting like that.

595
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,589
They're good.

596
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,690
(Impressed)

597
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,760
They are learning about life at that age.

598
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,529
The women's matches are about to begin.

599
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,776
- It's the women's matches. - They are in your weight division.

600
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
(The future opponents who may compete with them)

601
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,870
They could be your opponents.

602
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,470
Women's general division.

603
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
It's us.

604
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,969
They're the 51kg division.

605
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,270
Minus 51kg division.

606
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,709
That's the lowest weight class, right?

607
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,809
The lowest weight class.

608
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,909
(There are different weight classes for each competition.)

609
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,609
(Jicheon Competition, Women's Weight Class Standards)

610
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,309
(Minus 51kg, minus 54kg, minus 57kg, )

611
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,649
(minus 60kg, and minus 65kg)

612
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,420
What is the minus 51kg division?

613
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,019
- It should be until 51.00kg. - That's right.

614
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,749
The weight shouldn't be over 51kg,

615
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,920
- not even by 100g. - Okay.

616
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,219
- Even with clothes of 100g? - Right.

617
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,230
(Curious)

618
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,630
Look at the muscles.

619
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,799
(Strong muscles of the minus 51kg division)

620
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,630
The women's minus 51kg division.

621
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,069
- It's beginning. - Red corner.

622
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,839
She's so slim.

623
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,899
The blue corner.

624
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,240
(She's so slim.)

625
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,039
(The match of the women's minus 51kg division begins.)

626
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,740
It's started. Focus.

627
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,659
(Blue delivers a decisive blow from the start.)

628
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,090
My goodness. That was great.

629
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,429
Stop.

630
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,400
(Standing eight count)

631
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,930
Three, four...

632
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,929
- I got goosebumps. - The red corner is...

633
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,970
really...

634
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,070
(The match resumes.)

635
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,640
Stop.

636
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,149
- Guard. - Stop.

637
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,050
- No. - Blue is so good.

638
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,449
It's over now.

639
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,980
- Is it over? - Yes, it's over.

640
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,689
Is it over?

641
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,149
- Is it over? - It's over.

642
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,260
The red...

643
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,129
The red corner is...

644
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,259
- She's middle-aged. - She's relatively old.

645
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,460
- She's middle-aged. - Aren't they divided by age?

646
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,969
There's no age division.

647
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,530
- No age division? - She's middle-aged.

648
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,939
- She's middle-aged. - She's so cool.

649
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,580
(A surprising twist that no one expected)

650
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,739
She's amazing.

651
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,269
Her challenge is unbelievable.

652
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,909
You are so cool!

653
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,979
She's impressive.

654
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,610
She's a lot older...

655
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,179
- than her opponent. - My gosh.

656
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,350
(There's no age limit to a new challenge.)

657
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,789
(Another match of the minus 51kg division)

658
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,390
Blue has powerful punches.

659
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,659
She's really good.

660
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,130
This is it.

661
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,559
(A slugfest from the beginning)

662
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,500
This is all about stamina now.

663
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,669
It happens so fast.

664
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,269
It's been only about 30 seconds.

665
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,769
Right. That's what they intended.

666
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,839
They played that way.

667
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,110
Now let's see...

668
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,369
who wins.

669
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,510
(They relentlessly exchange punches.)

670
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,609
The blue corner is fighting well.

671
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,780
It's neck-and-neck.

672
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,849
- Blue punched well just now. - Twice.

673
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,750
They are neck-and-neck.

674
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,019
Stop.

675
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,150
(The match is over.)

676
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,860
(Fighting fiercely until the very end)

677
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,200
- They fought well. - They gave it their all.

678
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,200
- It was so fierce. - Yes. They fought well.

679
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,899
When the number of valid hits is equal,

680
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,699
the one who continued to advance...

681
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,410
and led the attack earns more points.

682
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,369
Instead of constantly defending...

683
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,379
and punching after getting hit,

684
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,139
- you should strike first. - That's right.

685
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,110
So, it's also important not to get pushed back.

686
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,380
This is the 54kg division.

687
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,849
Watch it while thinking about your weight.

688
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,810
(The match of the minus 54kg division continues.)

689
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,290
You will see...

690
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,730
why it's divided into weight classes every 3kg, 4kg, or 5kg.

691
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,999
(The match of the minus 54kg division begins.)

692
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
It's under 54kg, right?

693
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,730
Yes.

694
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,969
(The red corner with low hitting accuracy)

695
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,970
(Punching)

696
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,269
(On the other hand, blue has accurate counterattacks.)

697
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,409
(Taken aback by the heavy punches)

698
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,640
She's really good.

699
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,350
The 54kg division is totally different.

700
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,450
The punches are getting heavier.

701
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,049
Next up is the 60kg division.

702
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,620
(The match of the minus 60kg division begins.)

703
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,120
(Punching)

704
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,560
(Stronger punches)

705
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,100
They're different.

706
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,430
It's so heavy.

707
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:39,700
It's really heavy.

708
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,570
(The match of the minus 65kg division continues.)

709
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,269
(The punches become stronger by weight.)

710
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,769
- Do you see the difference? - Yes.

711
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,170
This is why you reduce your weight.

712
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,256
They are totally different. How can they be so different?

713
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,010
What do I do? I have to lose weight.

714
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,649
I have to reduce my weight no matter what.

715
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,779
(I have to reduce my weight no matter what.)

716
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,790
I don't think I can handle those punches.

717
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,466
This is my first time watching a community sports competition.

718
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,420
It's a lot more intense than I thought.

719
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,200
I think I will be like that.

720
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,229
Look at the little girl. She's watching her sister.

721
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,529
I think I'll be just like her.

722
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,469
I see. I guess it's someone she knows.

723
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,900
- Is it her older sister? - Yes.

724
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,509
- Is it her older sister? - Yes.

725
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,670
Oh, no.

726
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,040
Do you want your sister to stop boxing?

727
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,639
She doesn't want her to box.

728
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,379
I know how she feels.

729
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,709
She just can't watch this.

730
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,110
- Right over there... - She's cute.

731
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,280
But her sister is smiling.

732
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,389
I know.

733
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,050
She won.

734
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,360
Congratulations.

735
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
- Thank you. - Really?

736
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,030
She's amazing.

737
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,300
(We are proud of our daughter.)

738
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,200
I love how serious people are.

739
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,030
- Look. It's different. - It's an amateur match, but...

740
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,939
Everyone is so serious.

741
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,269
(Amazed)

742
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,739
They are smiling happily.

743
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,310
They must be so happy now.

744
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,810
They are doing this because they love it.

745
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,809
They really love it.

746
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,810
(They have fought their own battle, regardless of win or loss.)

747
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,609
- They are amazing. - It's great.

748
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,949
(They have fought their own battle, regardless of win or loss.)

749
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,720
After watching this,

750
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,820
- I want to work even harder. - I know.

751
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,859
Let's go train now, Coach.

752
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
(Fully motivated)

753
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,359
We should have a meeting about what we watched.

754
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,660
- Okay. - All together.

755
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,399
(Iron Girls are gathered together again in another place.)

756
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,869
You watched real boxing matches...

757
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,270
for the first time today.

758
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,540
How was it?

759
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,399
- It's so hard. - What do you mean?

760
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,509
I feel like I fought too.

761
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,739
- Right. That's how I feel. - I see.

762
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,139
- Why am I so exhausted? - I know.

763
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,409
I'm exhausted too.

764
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,879
When I watched the first match,

765
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,049
- I felt a little sick. - Me too.

766
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,049
- When I saw the blood... - Right.

767
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,679
I was like, "How am I going to watch this?"

768
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,119
But as I was watching it,

769
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,449
- I came to enjoy it. - Right.

770
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,919
Those things you told us that we didn't listen carefully to.

771
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,419
"Find your own rhythm."

772
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,329
"You shouldn't stop your footwork."

773
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,359
I didn't understand why back then.

774
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,699
I just couldn't find my footwork.

775
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,829
But after I watched the game,

776
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,300
I realized...

777
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,699
how you'd lose your balance...

778
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,229
and your stance...

779
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,299
if the opponent punched you...

780
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,539
when you had poor footwork.

781
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,770
That's what I learned.

782
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,239
I'm really glad that we're here today.

783
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,109
- Seriously. - I'm really glad...

784
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,979
- that we watched it. - Me too.

785
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,979
Until the first match,

786
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,579
we have about one month left.

787
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
(Already?)

788
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,979
I think it's time...

789
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,790
to decide on your weight class now.

790
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,389
I'd like to hear...

791
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,390
your opinions and what the coach thinks.

792
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,290
(A pain every boxer experiences at least once)

793
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,000
(The pre-match weigh-in)

794
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,129
(If you weigh more than your requested class, )

795
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,070
(you are disqualified right away.)

796
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,480
(You must strictly control your weight to pass the weigh-in.)

797
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,510
(The competition Iron Girls will be competing in)

798
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,809
(High school and 20s, 30s and above)

799
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,079
(Divided by age group)

800
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,689
(Weight classes)

801
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,220
(Then they are divided into weight classes.)

802
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,359
(What about In Ah, who is 29 years old?)

803
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,759
(What about Uie, Sae Rok, and Ju Hyun?)

804
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,799
(What are the Iron Girls' weight classes?)

805
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,969
Ju Hyun.

806
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,300
Is your weight still the same?

807
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,470
I'm 53kg now.

808
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,439
(Ju Hyun's body composition, Height: 166cm)

809
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,509
(Muscle-Fat Analysis)

810
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,669
(Weight: 53.91kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 23.34kg)

811
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,679
(Body Fat Mass: 11.05kg)

812
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,009
(With this weight, she should be in the minus 54kg division.)

813
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,010
Can you lose weight?

814
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
To 51kg?

815
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,579
(Can she lose more weight?)

816
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,519
Isn't it too much for you?

817
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,289
Let's say you lose 5kg...

818
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,989
from your current weight.

819
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,990
Your muscle mass won't be reduced, though.

820
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,629
You won't lose your muscle mass.

821
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,329
While maintaining the muscle mass,

822
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,429
if you reduce your weight...

823
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,659
and recover it,

824
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,630
you will have stronger punches.

825
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,029
(I see.)

826
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,830
Have you lost weight to 51kg recently?

827
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,840
- About 2 or 3 months ago, - Yes?

828
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,910
I was 49kg while shooting a drama.

829
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,039
But I didn't lose weight by working out.

830
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,349
I didn't work out or eat.

831
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,149
By the way, I've been watching you,

832
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,679
and you don't eat rice at all, Ju Hyun.

833
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,749
There's a perception...

834
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,589
- that carbs make you gain weight. - That's right.

835
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,089
But the human body runs on carbs.

836
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,819
Carbs are the fuel for the brain and other organs.

837
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,959
That's how important the power of carbs is.

838
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,729
I've never been on a diet that included carbs.

839
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,270
You have to eat carbs.

840
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,299
Does it allow me to lose more weight?

841
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
No, it doesn't. But you need strength.

842
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,539
You need strength...

843
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,709
to train every day...

844
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,969
and to make the techniques you learn during it yours.

845
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,979
When you are caught up with losing weight,

846
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,650
your performance drops.

847
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,020
I'll eat carbs...

848
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,779
and achieve the desired weight.

849
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,390
Provided that you'll stick to the diet and workout,

850
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,659
you'll go for minus 51kg, Ju Hyun.

851
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,960
- Minus 51kg? - Yes.

852
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,029
(Ju Hyun: Minus 51kg)

853
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,089
(Ju Hyun's goal: Entering the minus 51kg weight class...)

854
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,659
(after losing weight through a balanced diet and workout.)

855
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,729
- What about you, In Ah? - I'll go for the 54kg...

856
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,976
- after losing a little weight. Yes. - It's the 54kg weight class, then?

857
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,539
I also need to lose weight.

858
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,839
- You do. - About 2.6kg or 2.7kg.

859
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,110
But of everyone here, I have the lowest...

860
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,010
- body fat percentage. - Yes.

861
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,579
I don't know why.

862
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,679
What percentage is it?

863
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,210
- I have 26 to 27kg of muscle mass. - I see.

864
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:57,528
That's crazy.

865
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,058
(In Ah's muscle mass is shocking.)

866
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,268
She has the ideal body to be an athlete.

867
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:03,668
Exactly. Seriously.

868
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:04,938
You can't really control your muscle mass.

869
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:06,838
This is what I thought.

870
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,068
We do boxing training once a day.

871
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,809
On top of that, I'll run 5km every day.

872
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,978
- That's great. - I'm serious.

873
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:14,249
Go for it.

874
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:16,248
It'll be great to do a lot of cardio.

875
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,079
You'll lose weight quickly that way.

876
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,049
In Ah will enter the 20s division...

877
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,765
- and the 54kg weight class. - The 54kg weight class division.

878
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:23,818
(In Ah: Minus 54kg)

879
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:26,628
(In Ah's goal: Competing in the 54kg weight class division...)

880
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,728
(by losing weight through steady cardio)

881
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:32,959
I weigh 53kg with clothes on.

882
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,798
(Uie's body composition, Height: 172cm)

883
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:36,538
(Weight: 52.4kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 22.9kg)

884
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:38,468
(Body Fat Mass: 10.4kg)

885
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,509
Honestly, I should compete in...

886
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,378
the minus 54kg division,

887
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,038
considering my strength.

888
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,308
For more than ten years,

889
00:34:47,309 --> 00:34:49,578
I've never been under 51kg.

890
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,879
If I weigh under 51kg,

891
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:54,448
I have no idea what I'll be like.

892
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,318
Pushing yourself too hard...

893
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,058
when you've never done it before...

894
00:34:58,059 --> 00:34:59,888
- isn't right. Seriously. - Yes.

895
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,889
You're right.

896
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,859
To be honest, while working out these days,

897
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,769
I've been surviving through food.

898
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:10,038
(Food is more important than losing weight for Sae Rok.)

899
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,968
- Of course. - Between you two,

900
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:13,908
who weighs more?

901
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:16,068
Right now, we weigh the same.

902
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,838
(Sae Rok's body composition, Height: 169cm)

903
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,538
(Weight: 53.2kg, Skeletal Muscle Mass: 21.9kg)

904
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:21,108
(Body Fat Mass: 13.1kg)

905
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:23,278
In my opinion, you should keep your condition...

906
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,418
while enhancing your performance through training...

907
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,259
- to fight with more strength. - You're right.

908
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,819
- I have a question. - Okay.

909
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:31,789
If I enter the minus 54kg weight class division,

910
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:34,728
isn't it better to be 54kg than 53kg?

911
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:35,729
- You're right. - Yes.

912
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,628
- We have to gain 1kg. - You have to gain weight.

913
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,028
- In fact, it's hard to gain weight. - It's harder.

914
00:35:40,029 --> 00:35:41,998
It's hard. Gain as much weight as you can...

915
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:44,138
- to reach 54kg. - In that case...

916
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,738
I'm losing body fat constantly,

917
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,769
but my muscle mass stays the same at 23kg.

918
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:51,738
Before the match,

919
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,078
I'll increase 1kg of muscle mass.

920
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,485
- That sounds great. - That's amazing.

921
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,078
- That's going to be amazing. - I'll increase the muscle mass.

922
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,118
She's not the type to gain muscle easily.

923
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,819
She gets flexible and lean muscles.

924
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:04,158
You'll do more weight training...

925
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,459
and increase muscle mass. That will be the best.

926
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:07,889
Now, Sae Rok.

927
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:10,728
Sae Rok should reduce her body fat percentage.

928
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,428
Yes. It's much easier to lose fat...

929
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:13,728
than increase your muscle mass.

930
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,628
- Will one month be enough, though? - Yes.

931
00:36:15,629 --> 00:36:16,798
- It's enough. - It's totally enough.

932
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,498
- She can just change her diet. - In that case...

933
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:19,539
- Really? - Yes.

934
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:20,769
Go for it, Sae Rok.

935
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,539
- Yes. - You can cut out fries.

936
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:26,038
You 2 should prepare for the 54kg weight class division.

937
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:28,178
- With a strong determination, - Yes.

938
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:29,419
You'll enter the 54kg division.

939
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:30,749
(Uie and Sae Rok: minus 54kg)

940
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,078
(Uie and Sae Rok's goal: Entering the minus 54kg division..)

941
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,748
(by increasing weight to add more power to their punches)

942
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,218
(Iron Girls' weight class goals)

943
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:38,288
(Ju Hyun and In Ah's goal is to lose weight.)

944
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,728
(Uie and Sae Rok's goal is to gain weight.)

945
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:45,529
Today, instead of using our body in a workout,

946
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,468
we used...

947
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,298
- lots of our brain power. - We thought a lot.

948
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:51,068
So we'll call it a day.

949
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:52,738
(Today's training ends here.)

950
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:53,968
- That's it for today's training. - What? Why?

951
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,008
- It's over. - Are we going home?

952
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,538
- Yes. That's simple. - I think we'll meet again soon.

953
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:58,155
- Why? Are we not working out? - It's because...

954
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,849
you have a full spar tomorrow.

955
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,348
- Manage your body. - Gosh.

956
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,378
Get ready for the real match tomorrow.

957
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:05,619
That's amazing.

958
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,688
- That's new. - I feel uncomfortable.

959
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:07,689
Is this real?

960
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,148
Are we going home while the sun is still up?

961
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:11,618
Actually, the formal training is over,

962
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:12,888
- but you have homework to do. - What is it?

963
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:14,788
Yes. You have some homework to do.

964
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:16,128
- Go back to your place... - Let's do it.

965
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,898
- and finish your homework. - Okay.

966
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:19,998
- You have the spar tomorrow. - What will the homework be?

967
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:21,868
- Is it... - What if the homework...

968
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:23,398
to run 20km?

969
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:26,239
Forget about the homework. Let's do the group workout...

970
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,338
and go home after that.

971
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:28,638
- We can do that. - That's it.

972
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,338
- Let's do it here. - Let's stay and do it.

973
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,478
Let's do it all together.

974
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:33,879
(Today, they're really heading back in broad daylight.)

975
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,748
Is it really okay to come back in the afternoon?

976
00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:38,025
(They still can't believe they're checking in now.)

977
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,318
Gosh.

978
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:41,548
- What is it? - It's a new place again.

979
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:42,989
This place is pretty.

980
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,059
Iron Girls always have nice accommodations.

981
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,089
You're right.

982
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,328
Today's place looks big.

983
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:51,098
- Yes. - Our dogs would love this place.

984
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:53,199
- Exactly. It's pretty. - This place is so pretty.

985
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,229
Honestly, this place is beautiful.

986
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,339
- This is nice. It's amazing. - Goodness.

987
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:00,568
(Amazed)

988
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,908
- Goodness. - Gosh.

989
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:05,079
Look how pretty this place is!

990
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,149
Gosh.

991
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,349
It's awesome.

992
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:11,319
Hold on. What is that bell?

993
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:14,289
What is that bell?

994
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,248
(Why is there a bell in the lodging?)

995
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:18,689
We're doing it here. It's an indoor training.

996
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,358
Go back to your place...

997
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,329
(And finish your homework.)

998
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,899
(The homework is...)

999
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:29,098
It's 30 minutes of cardio.

1000
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,098
And 8 rounds of 3-minute boxing routines.

1001
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,015
(Today's homework: 30-minute cardio, 8 rounds of 3-minute boxing routine)

1002
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,408
Gosh. What? We do it in the lodging?

1003
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:37,238
They want us to do things that are related to boxing,

1004
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,239
even when we're relaxing.

1005
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:40,049
(Disappointed)

1006
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,409
- Then... - Let's do it!

1007
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:43,949
Let's go.

1008
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,018
This is really small.

1009
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,659
(What are they pulling out to do cardio?)

1010
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:52,759
- Take these out. - Yes. Take the feet out.

1011
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,889
Put on the pedals.

1012
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,599
- Will it turn into a bicycle? - Yes.

1013
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,399
It won't take up much space.

1014
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,729
In Ah, let's do it on level three.

1015
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:03,838
- Let's go. - Do it.

1016
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,839
- Go. - Go.

1017
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,769
Okay. Start.

1018
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,338
- Start. - Let's go.

1019
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,608
(Starting their homework)

1020
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:12,709
(Routine 1: Jab, jab, one, two, backstep, one, two)

1021
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,349
(Ju Hyun and Uie repeat 8 kinds of routines, 3 minutes each.)

1022
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:19,218
(In Ah and Sae Rok do 30 minutes of cardio on indoor bicycles.)

1023
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,918
We're on level three.

1024
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:23,435
(In Ah and Sae Rok do 30 minutes of cardio on indoor bicycles.)

1025
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:25,099
Do you have any tips on riding a bicycle?

1026
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:26,418
Please tell me.

1027
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:27,939
- A tip for riding a bicycle... - Yes?

1028
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:29,858
Instead of rounding your back,

1029
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,999
- activate your core. - Tighten my core?

1030
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,898
Since it doesn't have handles, it's easier to engage my core.

1031
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:36,898
And feel it, Sae Rok. You can feel it in your glutes.

1032
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:38,499
- I can totally feel it. - It's amazing.

1033
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,739
(Thanks to Iron In Ah, they're doing proper cardio.)

1034
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:46,849
(Doing their best)

1035
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:48,808
(Staring)

1036
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,219
- Suddenly, - Yes?

1037
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,029
I feel like I'm watching Iron Girls while riding an indoor bicycle.

1038
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:55,348
- Yes. That's what it feels like. - Right?

1039
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,119
- Right? - That's exactly how I feel.

1040
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:58,535
Aren't you going to get it together?

1041
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,865
- Are you not going to sweat? - Right?

1042
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,028
Do your best!

1043
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:02,559
- Right? - That's exactly how I feel.

1044
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,458
- This is fun. - I'm watching it in real time.

1045
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:05,459
Yes.

1046
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,069
Give us some popcorn.

1047
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:08,669
Popcorn and Coke.

1048
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,069
I'll have my revenge.

1049
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,138
Park Ju, you've seen the matches today, haven't you?

1050
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:15,459
Practice while thinking that you're punching the opponent.

1051
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,639
Yes. I'm aiming at one spot and throwing my punches at it.

1052
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:20,409
The opponent is dead now.

1053
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,149
One, two. One, two, hook, two.

1054
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,688
It'll be perfect if you lower your head.

1055
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:30,095
- Just a little. That's right. - Good. You're looking awesome.

1056
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,119
One, two.

1057
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,088
(Round 3)

1058
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,629
We have to do this lots of times.

1059
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,329
Turn.

1060
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,749
- You can do it! - This is getting tougher.

1061
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:41,229
One, two.

1062
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:42,499
Jab, one, two.

1063
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:43,669
(Round 5)

1064
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,268
(Until the routine sticks to their body)

1065
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:47,008
(Round 6)

1066
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,009
One, two.

1067
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:49,908
- One, two. - You have to throw a jab.

1068
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:51,339
- One, two. - One, two.

1069
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,209
Hook, one, two.

1070
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,779
Engage your lower back.

1071
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:59,279
Five, four, three,

1072
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:01,419
two, one.

1073
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:03,589
(The 30 minutes are over.)

1074
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:06,989
(They went all out.)

1075
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:08,359
We're done.

1076
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,799
Let's put on our shoes quickly.

1077
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,329
(They're back on it after switching places.)

1078
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,268
(In Ah and Sae Rok repeat...)

1079
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,845
(8 kinds of routines for 3 minutes each.)

1080
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:18,068
(Staring)

1081
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:20,038
What? This is fun.

1082
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,469
- Gosh. This is... - Isn't it fun?

1083
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:23,168
- They must be the new members... - I know.

1084
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,309
For Season Two, right?

1085
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,978
Was she Keum Sae Rok?

1086
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,848
(She is full of energy.)

1087
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:30,149
I think Sae Rok has a pretty stance.

1088
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,078
Her throws look really strong too.

1089
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,989
- You're right. - She has great hooks.

1090
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:35,889
Sae Rok does.

1091
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,558
(Sae Rok maintains her angle sharply.)

1092
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:43,428
(In Ah maintains her angle sharply.)

1093
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:46,428
(Round 2)

1094
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:47,928
(Round 3)

1095
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:49,699
One, two, slide, hit, pivot.

1096
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:50,899
One, two.

1097
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,768
When you do the "one, two" after the shuffle,

1098
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:55,709
you have to do it really fast, Sae Rok.

1099
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:58,208
Shuffle. One, two.

1100
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:00,378
(They punch in perfect sync like a girl group.)

1101
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,548
That's how you get used to it.

1102
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:02,549
(Round 4)

1103
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,248
(Until every cell of my body remembers the routine)

1104
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,078
I'll be so sad if I lose.

1105
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,119
(Round 5)

1106
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:14,089
Jab, jab, one, two, slide, hit, pivot.

1107
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,159
One, two.

1108
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,458
- Let's go. - Just 20 more seconds.

1109
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:18,499
Go, Sae Rok.

1110
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:21,968
- Jab, jab, one, two, pivot. - Jab, jab, one, two, pivot.

1111
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:23,999
- One, two, shuffle, one, two. - Focus.

1112
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:25,468
One, two, pivot.

1113
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:27,469
- One, two, shuffle. - One, two, shuffle.

1114
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,238
(They all sweat together.)

1115
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,608
- Last. - Three,

1116
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:35,478
- two, one, - One, two...

1117
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,948
- One, two... - over.

1118
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:38,948
(The training is over.)

1119
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:39,949
That's it.

1120
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:41,749
Good job.

1121
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:44,089
Goodness.

1122
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,719
You did so well.

1123
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:49,989
That was fun.

1124
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:51,628
(Proud)

1125
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:52,798
Good job.

1126
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,969
- Ju Hyun is sweating. - I know.

1127
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:58,298
(Soaked in sweat)

1128
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,338
The end.

1129
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,208
It feels like I just got out of the shower.

1130
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:02,508
(That's how hard the 8-round routine is.)

1131
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:04,208
That's it. It's really the end.

1132
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,378
We did so well.

1133
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:07,609
- Gosh, it hurts. - I'm tired.

1134
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:08,879
Goodness.

1135
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:11,378
Good job.

1136
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:13,279
(They completely finish their homework.)

1137
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,888
Let's all take a shower here.

1138
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,488
- Just do it separately. - Why do you keep wanting...

1139
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,329
- to shower together? - Just do it separately!

1140
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:20,928
There are two bathrooms.

1141
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:22,188
Why would all 4 of us use 1 bathroom?

1142
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:26,428
Let's all take a shower together.

1143
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:28,829
Why do you want to shower together?

1144
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:33,138
(They finish showering on good terms.)

1145
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:34,568
Good night, guys.

1146
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:36,238
Sleep tight.

1147
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,379
I love you.

1148
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,049
Why can't I fall asleep?

1149
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:43,949
After the spar tomorrow,

1150
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:46,149
- we can just keep doing it. - Yes.

1151
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:48,489
It's all about experience.

1152
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:50,359
I should do well.

1153
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,158
- Good night. - Let's do it well...

1154
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,759
- without getting hurt. - Yes.

1155
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,298
Wake up.

1156
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:01,799
Good morning.

1157
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,198
We're going for the spar.

1158
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,139
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1159
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:09,109
This is it. We're really going.

1160
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:12,378
It feels like I'm conquering...

1161
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:14,208
all the local gyms.

1162
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:15,278
Yes.

1163
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,718
We need lots of sparring experience. Right?

1164
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,518
Even if we are ready,

1165
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,489
- Yes. - the opponent could be stronger.

1166
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,459
- Yes. - But let's not get intimidated.

1167
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:25,559
That's right.

1168
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:27,489
We can do it.

1169
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:29,388
(One person looks very intimidated.)

1170
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:30,828
- Are you nervous? - I'm nervous.

1171
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:32,198
I can feel your nervousness.

1172
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,769
- I'm so nervous. - Uie.

1173
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:35,029
Are you okay?

1174
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:36,868
I'm okay.

1175
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,398
- I had three sessions. - Yes.

1176
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:39,498
I was nervous 2 days ahead the 1st time,

1177
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:40,838
one day ahead the second time,

1178
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:42,438
- and today, I'm nervous on the day. - Yes.

1179
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,078
- You weren't nervous yesterday. - No.

1180
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,278
So you really are getting better.

1181
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,009
Yes, I can slowly get better, right?

1182
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:50,678
It's only a minute and a half for two rounds,

1183
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:52,018
but why am I so nervous?

1184
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,278
It's driving me crazy.

1185
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:54,625
(While fighting the tension, where did they arrive?)

1186
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:55,918
What? It's Woosuk University again.

1187
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:56,948
(What?)

1188
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:58,088
It's Woosuk University again.

1189
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:00,049
(They are back at the place they were yesterday?)

1190
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:04,698
It's the same place as yesterday.

1191
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:06,498
- Is this where we were yesterday? - Yes.

1192
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:08,428
This is really driving me crazy.

1193
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,938
Are we playing against Woosuk University players?

1194
00:45:10,939 --> 00:45:12,138
That's crazy.

1195
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:13,708
I will cry if that's true.

1196
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:14,938
No way.

1197
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:16,979
(Why are they back at the same place as yesterday?)

1198
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:18,579
Jab, jab, one, two.

1199
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:19,739
One, two, one, two.

1200
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,878
One, two, one, two, two, two, one, two.

1201
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:23,678
- Is this deja vu? - One, two, three, four,

1202
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,759
- five, six, seven. - Gosh.

1203
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:26,318
This is deja vu, right?

1204
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,949
I have a bad feeling.

1205
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:29,718
Why are we back here?

1206
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,458
- What? - Why are we back here?

1207
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:32,888
First of all,

1208
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:34,528
- we saw the match here yesterday. - Yes.

1209
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:35,588
(This was where the boxing competition was held.)

1210
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:36,928
The place where...

1211
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:38,499
the spar will be held...

1212
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:39,828
is here.

1213
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:40,868
(Sparring in the stadium?)

1214
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:42,828
- They didn't clear it out? - Then the ring wasn't cleared out?

1215
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:43,999
They didn't clear it out.

1216
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:46,139
It's an amazing chance.

1217
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,568
The feeling of...

1218
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,508
the mat on your feet,

1219
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:51,908
the feeling of the ring,

1220
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:53,279
and the height.

1221
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:55,578
Practicing on the same grounds...

1222
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:56,648
is great luck.

1223
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:58,249
- That's the best. - So we asked them...

1224
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,948
to clear it out a day later.

1225
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:01,819
Thank you so much.

1226
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:03,888
But the really important thing is,

1227
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,088
who are we...

1228
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:07,158
It's not the competitors from yesterday, right?

1229
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,989
Your opponent will be...

1230
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,798
As you expected, it will be...

1231
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,959
the player from yesterday's competition.

1232
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:15,529
The player from yesterday's competition.

1233
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:18,039
They were no joke.

1234
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,338
- Come on... - Guys.

1235
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:21,339
(In despair)

1236
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:23,608
(For the Iron Girls, )

1237
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:27,909
(there will be a special sparring session.)

1238
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:30,548
(Through sparring with experienced players...)

1239
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:32,719
(who have real experience, )

1240
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:36,848
(they will build match instincts.)

1241
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:38,388
Among them,

1242
00:46:38,389 --> 00:46:39,818
we recruited four players.

1243
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:41,058
Including the kids?

1244
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,128
- Middle and elementary school kids? - No.

1245
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:44,758
- No? - From the women's match.

1246
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:45,998
The kids seem nice.

1247
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,128
For the spar,

1248
00:46:47,129 --> 00:46:48,699
you need to have similar physiques.

1249
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:49,829
Sounds good.

1250
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,198
Captain Uie.

1251
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:52,998
- Let's hear your words. - For me,

1252
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:54,908
I keep habitually making...

1253
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:56,208
a jab and stopping there,

1254
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,238
with one movement,

1255
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,739
so Coach was always unsatisfied.

1256
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:01,378
I will try at least the one, two, one, two...

1257
00:47:01,379 --> 00:47:03,208
- Continuously? - up on the ring.

1258
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:05,518
For me, like I learned from Coach Ji Hoon,

1259
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,448
I want to hit, step aside...

1260
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,518
when they attack back,

1261
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,289
then go straight back to one, two.

1262
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:12,435
- Step aside, then one, two? - Step aside, then one, two.

1263
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:14,358
I will try to fix my guard.

1264
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:15,488
- For a better guard? - Yes.

1265
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:17,999
- I keep leaning or having it low. - It goes down.

1266
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,668
I will try to keep my guard up.

1267
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,398
For me, no matter who the opponent is,

1268
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:24,369
- I will kill them. - Great!

1269
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,068
- That's the best. - How cool!

1270
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:28,138
- Round of applause. - Let me try that again.

1271
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:29,438
- Let me try that again. - No, that's...

1272
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:31,138
- Just once more. - Ju Hyun,

1273
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,279
only you said that, okay?

1274
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:34,708
- Go away. - Come here.

1275
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:36,108
I will be sure to deliver this message...

1276
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:37,249
- to the opponent. - For me,

1277
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:39,148
no matter how tall, short,

1278
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:40,488
or equal the opponent is,

1279
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,149
I want to stick close.

1280
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,918
I keep getting scared of getting hit,

1281
00:47:44,919 --> 00:47:46,058
so I only ran away.

1282
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:47,118
So this time,

1283
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,688
- even if I get hit, - That's nice.

1284
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:50,609
- I will try to stay in. - That's cool, Park Ju.

1285
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,498
Even if it becomes my last memory.

1286
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,019
(Even if it becomes my last memory...)

1287
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,698
Are you also nervous,

1288
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:58,968
Coach?

1289
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:00,138
Since it will be our first time?

1290
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:01,808
- Sure. Of course, I'm nervous. - Of course.

1291
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:03,408
Coach really thinks of today...

1292
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:04,978
as an actual competition.

1293
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,278
Not only for you guys,

1294
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:08,579
- but for himself too. - Of course.

1295
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:10,278
He's also anxious about...

1296
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:11,648
whether you will do well.

1297
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:12,878
He's serious.

1298
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:14,688
I think Coach is the most nervous.

1299
00:48:14,689 --> 00:48:15,789
He's worried as well,

1300
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,318
- That's heartbreaking. - wondering how well you'll do.

1301
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:18,389
He's serious.

1302
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:19,618
Then let's go down.

1303
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:20,659
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1304
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:22,188
Don't look away...

1305
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:23,388
- when they make eye contact. - Yes.

1306
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:24,559
This is the real deal.

1307
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:26,898
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1308
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:28,729
(They head to the stadium.)

1309
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,668
It always feels weird to head to the venue.

1310
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:33,799
We're back here.

1311
00:48:34,339 --> 00:48:35,639
They didn't clear this out.

1312
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:38,939
(The ring unfolds before their eyes.)

1313
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:42,108
This was the venue yesterday.

1314
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:44,479
(This was where the fierce match was held yesterday.)

1315
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,625
- It's our first time down here. - A real stadium.

1316
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:48,519
This is the real stadium.

1317
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:49,948
- Amazing. - The real stadium.

1318
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:51,689
The ring is soft, isn't it?

1319
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:53,888
It's much softer...

1320
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,328
than where we practice.

1321
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:57,299
It's so soft.

1322
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:02,299
(One person is especially nervous.)

1323
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:04,968
Uie is about to die from nervousness.

1324
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:06,239
She's about to throw up.

1325
00:49:06,499 --> 00:49:07,808
I dry heaved about five times.

1326
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,638
Her philtrum keeps getting sweaty.

1327
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:10,978
Now...

1328
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:12,439
We're on the ring,

1329
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,478
but it can't just be us.

1330
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,448
- No, the opponent... - We will bring out...

1331
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:18,149
the opponents...

1332
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:20,079
who will be sparring with us.

1333
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:22,548
- Please come on out. - Our first opponents.

1334
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:24,218
- Please come on out! - Please come on out!

1335
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:25,388
Where are you?

1336
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:26,859
(Please come out.)

1337
00:49:27,659 --> 00:49:29,288
They are wearing uniforms.

1338
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:32,329
(They make a dramatic entrance in their uniforms.)

1339
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:35,599
(The impressive aura of the experienced boxers)

1340
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:38,139
There's a player I remember.

1341
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:40,398
- The second one was so good. - Yes.

1342
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:42,308
The second one was so good.

1343
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:44,008
- The 2nd one? - The 3rd one.

1344
00:49:44,009 --> 00:49:45,009
Who?

1345
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:46,878
This is wrong.

1346
00:49:46,879 --> 00:49:48,108
This is seriously wrong.

1347
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:51,419
These are the players who will be sparring with us.

1348
00:49:52,297 --> 00:49:53,796
This is wrong.

1349
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:55,036
This is seriously wrong.

1350
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:58,306
These are the players who will be sparring with us.

1351
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,636
Please introduce yourselves first.

1352
00:50:00,637 --> 00:50:04,376
Hello, I am a 24-year-old university student, Byeon Hyeon Bin.

1353
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:07,716
I first started in 2020,

1354
00:50:07,717 --> 00:50:09,716
but I was still attending university,

1355
00:50:09,717 --> 00:50:11,556
so my actual workout period is about three years.

1356
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:13,316
- Three years? - Yes.

1357
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:14,626
It has been about three years.

1358
00:50:14,627 --> 00:50:16,026
- Three whole years? - Yes.

1359
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:17,087
It's been three years.

1360
00:50:17,357 --> 00:50:20,127
(Dry heaving from nervousness)

1361
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:25,867
(Fast footwork and strong punches)

1362
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,636
(20s, minus 54kg division)

1363
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:30,206
(Byeon Hyeon Bin)

1364
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,576
The competition yesterday...

1365
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:33,736
was my first,

1366
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:36,447
but I was lucky enough to get first place.

1367
00:50:37,207 --> 00:50:38,817
That's cool.

1368
00:50:38,977 --> 00:50:40,476
After doing it, do you want to continue...

1369
00:50:40,477 --> 00:50:42,086
- or stop there? - For me,

1370
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:43,587
I came to love boxing even more.

1371
00:50:45,057 --> 00:50:46,457
When you beat them up?

1372
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:47,987
When you beat them up?

1373
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:49,856
- Okay. - She must have beaten them up.

1374
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:50,896
Next person.

1375
00:50:50,897 --> 00:50:52,296
Hello,

1376
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:55,526
I am a 31-year-old dental technician, Jeong Da I.

1377
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:56,796
- I see. - For me,

1378
00:50:56,797 --> 00:50:59,197
I have been taking it seriously for about a year and a half.

1379
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:04,577
(An out-boxer with an iron punch)

1380
00:51:05,037 --> 00:51:06,576
(30s, minus 54kg division)

1381
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:09,047
(Jeong Da I)

1382
00:51:09,077 --> 00:51:10,176
And your records?

1383
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:12,057
- One win and one loss. - One win and one loss?

1384
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:13,147
What about yesterday?

1385
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:14,216
I won.

1386
00:51:14,217 --> 00:51:15,347
- You won? - Yes.

1387
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,556
We have winners here.

1388
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:18,786
(We are sparring against these players!)

1389
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,286
I lost in the first match.

1390
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,326
She lost.

1391
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:22,986
But you still wanted to do it again.

1392
00:51:22,987 --> 00:51:25,026
What was the reason you tried again?

1393
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:26,096
Since I lost,

1394
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:28,296
I needed to try winning.

1395
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,126
Since you won yesterday, are you not going to do it?

1396
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:31,597
I can't say that.

1397
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:33,597
- I'll have to try. Yes. - Was it fun?

1398
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:34,767
Next.

1399
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:37,677
Hello. I'm Ju Jung In. I'm 36.

1400
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:40,407
I'm a flash animator. I draw.

1401
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:41,847
She's an artist.

1402
00:51:41,907 --> 00:51:42,946
How much experience do you have?

1403
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,877
About a year and two months.

1404
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:47,647
One win and two losses.

1405
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:52,587
(Sharp punch and eyes)

1406
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:54,686
(30s, minus 51kg division)

1407
00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:56,926
(Ju Jung In)

1408
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,957
I heard there was a reason you learned to box.

1409
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:02,596
I have three children.

1410
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:05,136
- I got married early. - That's so cool.

1411
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:07,137
And they're all boys.

1412
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,206
I realized I was running out of stamina,

1413
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:12,137
so I learned to box to improve my stamina.

1414
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:14,606
We go to the same gym.

1415
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:15,776
(Her three children are learning boxing as well.)

1416
00:52:15,777 --> 00:52:16,847
That's sweet.

1417
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,877
- Did your family come to watch? - Yes.

1418
00:52:19,347 --> 00:52:20,816
- You're such a cool mom. - But...

1419
00:52:20,817 --> 00:52:22,816
- the result wasn't that good. - No.

1420
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:24,856
How did your children react?

1421
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:26,116
Did they cry? Or...

1422
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:29,486
They didn't cry. They were like, "Why did you do that, Mom?"

1423
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:30,956
Boys are like that.

1424
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:33,256
- They don't ask if I'm okay. - Boys do that.

1425
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:34,996
- They also learned boxing. - Yes.

1426
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:36,466
- Her boys. - That's why.

1427
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:37,766
- Oh, no. - Next.

1428
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:41,406
Hello. I'm Kwon Seo Hee. I work as a rehab therapist.

1429
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,307
I'm 33.

1430
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:48,507
(The in-fighter whose specialty is battering.)

1431
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:50,376
(30s, minus 51kg division)

1432
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,577
(Kwon Seo Hee)

1433
00:52:52,717 --> 00:52:55,786
My experience in boxing...

1434
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:57,286
is six months.

1435
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:58,756
- It's pretty short. - Yes.

1436
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:02,026
I have a record of 1 win and 1 loss.

1437
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:04,496
It's only been 6 months, and you joined 2 competitions?

1438
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:06,096
Yes, I joined one last month.

1439
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:07,766
And another one in a row.

1440
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,166
- How was the result yesterday? - Yesterday,

1441
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,367
I lost, but if I were to give an excuse,

1442
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:13,836
I'm in my 30s,

1443
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:15,606
but my opponent was a high school student...

1444
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:18,076
who was preparing to become a pro athlete.

1445
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:21,147
So I made a concession for the student with a bright future.

1446
00:53:22,307 --> 00:53:24,177
- You were considerate. - That's cool.

1447
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:26,316
Are you planning to be considerate again today?

1448
00:53:26,317 --> 00:53:28,717
Today,

1449
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:30,447
- I won't be so considerate. - She's...

1450
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,917
I also have a bright future ahead.

1451
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:34,556
For your information,

1452
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:37,186
we have someone in the minus 51kg division.

1453
00:53:37,187 --> 00:53:39,307
When she was talking about her determination outside,

1454
00:53:39,357 --> 00:53:40,677
she said she'd kill her opponent.

1455
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:42,727
Wait.

1456
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,667
(The boxer of 2 months shows a fearless provocation)

1457
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:47,807
Please be considerate.

1458
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:49,766
She has a bright future.

1459
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,506
The players we're having today...

1460
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:54,006
have more experience than us.

1461
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:55,346
There will be a gap in skills.

1462
00:53:55,347 --> 00:53:57,406
Is it okay to spar with them today?

1463
00:53:57,407 --> 00:53:59,146
You're supposed to spar...

1464
00:53:59,147 --> 00:54:01,947
with someone better than you to improve.

1465
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:05,317
And it's hard to find someone with less experience than you.

1466
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:07,356
- Two months. - To find...

1467
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,256
- someone... - I heard you.

1468
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:11,226
- We know that. - to spar...

1469
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:12,696
with less experience...

1470
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:15,666
Who'd want to spar only after two months?

1471
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:16,667
We have no choice.

1472
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:17,836
- We have to do it. - Let's go.

1473
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,336
- Now, - Let's go.

1474
00:54:19,337 --> 00:54:21,067
You're left with real sparring.

1475
00:54:21,407 --> 00:54:22,867
(Nervous punch)

1476
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:24,236
It's making me nervous.

1477
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:26,277
We'll now reveal the sparring order...

1478
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:28,247
and the tournament bracket.

1479
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:30,106
I never expected to get a tournament bracket in my life.

1480
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:31,276
Me neither. This is my first time.

1481
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:32,447
Today's tournament bracket.

1482
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:34,116
The order is also important.

1483
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:35,587
Today's first spar.

1484
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:37,917
- Seol In Ah. - Yes.

1485
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:40,486
Versus Byeon Hyeon Bin.

1486
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:42,367
(First spar, Seol In Ah versus Byeon Hyeon Bin)

1487
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:44,796
One second. Back up.

1488
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:46,173
- Face off 1st. - She's in her 20s.

1489
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:47,256
Face each other.

1490
00:54:47,257 --> 00:54:48,797
(The first face-off of their lives)

1491
00:54:49,397 --> 00:54:51,537
(Trying not to laugh to avoid losing)

1492
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:52,836
Look forward.

1493
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:54,267
Show your fight pose.

1494
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:56,536
(Discouraging the opponent with a fight pose)

1495
00:54:56,537 --> 00:54:57,667
Show your fight pose.

1496
00:54:57,707 --> 00:55:00,137
(I won't lose.)

1497
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:02,076
(Seol In Ah, Byeon Hyeon Bin)

1498
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:03,776
(Age 29, 167cm, Age 24, 158cm)

1499
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:05,217
(Experience, 2 months, 3 years)

1500
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:06,977
Second spar.

1501
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:09,747
Park Ju Hyun versus Kwon Seo Hee.

1502
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:12,916
- Oh, that is... - Come forward.

1503
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:13,917
Face each other.

1504
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:16,027
(Making eye contact to discourage the opponent)

1505
00:55:16,957 --> 00:55:18,126
(Shy)

1506
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:20,526
I'm embarrassed by it.

1507
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:21,627
- Look forward. - Okay.

1508
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:24,326
Show your fight pose.

1509
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:25,367
Show us.

1510
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,737
This isn't a dating show.

1511
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:29,836
(Park Ju Hyun, Kwon Seo Hee)

1512
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,536
(Age 30, 166cm, Age 31, 156cm)

1513
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,206
(Experience, 2 months, 6 months)

1514
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:34,947
The third spar.

1515
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,207
I'm getting more nervous.

1516
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:39,916
Uie versus Ju Jung In.

1517
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,317
(Third spar, Uie versus Ju Jung In)

1518
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:44,887
No.

1519
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:47,287
- What's she going to do? - Say hello.

1520
00:55:47,617 --> 00:55:48,927
Make brief eye contact.

1521
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:50,926
Look forward and show your fight pose.

1522
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:51,956
(Making a fight pose no matter how scared they are)

1523
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:54,397
- One, two. - Good. Show your energy.

1524
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:55,966
(Uie, Ju Jung In)

1525
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:57,266
(Age 37, 172cm, Age 35, 160cm)

1526
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:58,936
(Experience, 2 months, a year and 2 months)

1527
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:00,536
The last spar.

1528
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:02,836
Keum Sae Rok versus Jeong Da I.

1529
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:05,107
(Fourth spar, Keum Sae Rok versus Jeong Da I)

1530
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,976
The face-off.

1531
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:08,107
(The face-off is a must.)

1532
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,827
(Discouraging her opponent with her bright eyes)

1533
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:12,947
Look forward.

1534
00:56:13,017 --> 00:56:14,076
Show your fight pose.

1535
00:56:14,077 --> 00:56:16,787
(Spirited Sae Rok's confident fight pose)

1536
00:56:17,147 --> 00:56:18,286
(Keum Sae Rok, Jeong Da I)

1537
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:19,656
(Age 32, 169cm, Age 29, 161cm)

1538
00:56:19,657 --> 00:56:21,186
(Experience, 2 months, a year and 6 months)

1539
00:56:21,187 --> 00:56:23,726
It was decided by order of age.

1540
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,296
- Oh, that's why. - And...

1541
00:56:25,297 --> 00:56:26,696
if you were the same age,

1542
00:56:26,697 --> 00:56:28,966
the lighter weight went first. That's the order.

1543
00:56:28,967 --> 00:56:30,526
- We're following... - Right.

1544
00:56:30,527 --> 00:56:32,436
The real-life game rule.

1545
00:56:32,437 --> 00:56:34,067
- I have a question. - Okay.

1546
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:36,147
Are you going to decide who wins and who loses?

1547
00:56:36,237 --> 00:56:38,307
There's no win or lose in sparring.

1548
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,176
We don't decide on it,

1549
00:56:40,177 --> 00:56:43,776
but you will probably know.

1550
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:44,916
- Right. - True.

1551
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:47,216
Will there be TKO?

1552
00:56:47,217 --> 00:56:48,316
Yes, there is.

1553
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:50,786
Aside from raising your hand,

1554
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,587
everything will be the same as the real game.

1555
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,657
Yes, sir.

1556
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:56,356
Now, we'll warm up and begin.

1557
00:56:56,357 --> 00:56:58,626
- Start warming up. - Let's go.

1558
00:56:58,627 --> 00:56:59,797
(The warm-up time)

1559
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:05,497
(Getting ready to enter the ring)

1560
00:57:05,837 --> 00:57:07,137
I have a strategy.

1561
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,707
- I'll pretend to be shy... - Right.

1562
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:12,106
- and throw a hook. - Right.

1563
00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:14,307
Yes. Good idea.

1564
00:57:14,507 --> 00:57:16,746
- I'm so shy. - Yes. Good.

1565
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:17,776
Start acting.

1566
00:57:17,777 --> 00:57:19,897
- I've started already. - The game has already begun.

1567
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:21,816
I keep retching.

1568
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,377
(The eldest can't hide her expression.)

1569
00:57:23,487 --> 00:57:26,117
(She keeps sighing out of worry.)

1570
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:27,616
Don't be scared.

1571
00:57:27,617 --> 00:57:28,987
Trust yourself.

1572
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,627
All that sweat and tears you shed.

1573
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:34,497
(Punching)

1574
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:35,797
(Punching)

1575
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:38,297
I hear a sound I shouldn't hear.

1576
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,136
I hear a sound I shouldn't hear in community competitions.

1577
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:44,707
(The opponents are warming up brutally.)

1578
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:46,406
(Speedy punches)

1579
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:48,077
They're getting ready like a real game.

1580
00:57:50,307 --> 00:57:53,177
(Captain Kim is watching them.)

1581
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:56,987
(Reading the opponents' strategy)

1582
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:58,357
(Glancing)

1583
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:01,557
(Uie warms up after checking her opponent.)

1584
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:05,327
(Jumping rope more seriously than ever)

1585
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:08,427
(Ju Hyun is also jumping rope.)

1586
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,066
(Mad)

1587
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:13,267
(Focused)

1588
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:14,667
Punch. Yes.

1589
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:16,667
Punch. Yes.

1590
00:58:16,937 --> 00:58:18,106
Punch. You got it.

1591
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,077
(Putting on savage eyes)

1592
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,576
(In Ah who's going first also starts warming up.)

1593
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:23,647
One, two.

1594
00:58:23,977 --> 00:58:24,977
Okay. One, two.

1595
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:27,577
(Discouraging her opponent with the mitt sounds)

1596
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:30,117
(Drawing attention)

1597
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:31,616
She's good.

1598
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:33,357
(Her opponent is getting nervous.)

1599
00:58:34,587 --> 00:58:37,256
(Soaked in sweat just from warming up)

1600
00:58:37,257 --> 00:58:38,327
- Ready to go up? - Yes.

1601
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:40,497
- See you, girls. - Good luck.

1602
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:42,667
- See you. - Do everything you want.

1603
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:44,526
Let's go.

1604
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:46,096
- Let's go. - Iron...

1605
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:47,637
- Girls! - Girls!

1606
00:58:48,137 --> 00:58:49,137
Let's do this!

1607
00:58:49,138 --> 00:58:50,206
Here I go.

1608
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:51,237
In Ah.

1609
00:58:51,977 --> 00:58:52,977
I love you.

1610
00:58:52,978 --> 00:58:54,513
(How will the Iron Girls do in their first real sparring?)

1611
00:58:54,537 --> 00:58:56,807
Now, the first game.

1612
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,677
Seol In Ah and Byeon Hyeon Bin. Please come up.

1613
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:01,716
(First full sparring after two months)

1614
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:03,217
Enter the ring.

1615
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:05,156
- Amazing. - Cool.

1616
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:07,787
Put your gloves on in your corners.

1617
00:59:08,657 --> 00:59:09,757
Put your gloves on.

1618
00:59:10,587 --> 00:59:12,426
The celebrities must be scared.

1619
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,666
This must be their first real spar.

1620
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:16,767
- Right. - It's no joke.

1621
00:59:17,367 --> 00:59:19,037
They must be very nervous.

1622
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:20,966
I trembled so much.

1623
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:23,036
I know. When I put on...

1624
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:25,437
the headgear for the first time, I couldn't be more nervous.

1625
00:59:26,877 --> 00:59:31,346
(Putting on the headgear is the most nervous moment)

1626
00:59:31,347 --> 00:59:32,477
- Is this okay? - Yes.

1627
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:35,116
(Now that she has the gear on, )

1628
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:38,387
(she's getting more nervous.)

1629
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:40,217
Gosh. I'm so nervous.

1630
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:43,357
- Just relax and breathe. - Yes.

1631
00:59:45,257 --> 00:59:46,326
Gosh.

1632
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:49,727
(It feels like her heart is going to explode.)

1633
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:53,737
(Restless)

1634
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:55,606
- Let's go, In Ah. - Here we go.

1635
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:56,837
- Okay. - Let's go, In Ah.

1636
00:59:57,237 --> 01:00:00,307
In a way, this is a real game for us.

1637
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:01,877
Consider this a real game.

1638
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:04,306
It's a real game that leaves no record.

1639
01:00:04,307 --> 01:00:07,277
So consider it a good experience.

1640
01:00:08,617 --> 01:00:11,286
(While In Ah with 2 months of experience...)

1641
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:14,517
(is warming up lightly...)

1642
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:16,557
Jump.

1643
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:19,256
Squat to warm up.

1644
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:21,667
Nice. She has good movements.

1645
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,967
Her lower body is crazy.

1646
01:00:25,097 --> 01:00:27,166
I think In Ah's opponent is the best.

1647
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:28,937
- Yes. I can tell. - It's obvious.

1648
01:00:29,207 --> 01:00:30,566
She also has the most experience.

1649
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,177
Yes. I saw her hitting the mitt.

1650
01:00:32,577 --> 01:00:33,707
She's strong.

1651
01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:35,646
(Captain Kim watched the opponents carefully...)

1652
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:37,277
(during practice.)

1653
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:38,616
Hey.

1654
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:41,277
(Aggressive mitt punching)

1655
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:44,417
(In Ah's opponent is so strong.)

1656
01:00:44,647 --> 01:00:46,687
(The skilled player acknowledged by Captain Kim...)

1657
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:49,287
(is In Ah's first full spar opponent.)

1658
01:00:49,827 --> 01:00:52,056
(There's tension in the air.)

1659
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:53,627
If you're ready,

1660
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:54,797
come to the center.

1661
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:57,767
It's 2 rounds of 1 minute and 30 seconds.

1662
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:00,366
This leaves no record.

1663
01:01:00,367 --> 01:01:01,637
Play with manners.

1664
01:01:01,907 --> 01:01:04,907
No cheating or punching in the back of the head.

1665
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:06,377
Touch gloves.

1666
01:01:06,507 --> 01:01:07,507
Corner.

1667
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:08,948
(Showing respect by touching gloves)

1668
01:01:09,947 --> 01:01:11,447
- Go show her. - Yes.

1669
01:01:11,817 --> 01:01:13,716
(Time left until spar)

1670
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:14,717
(10 seconds)

1671
01:01:14,718 --> 01:01:16,317
No pressure.

1672
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:17,847
Keep your lead hand up.

1673
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:21,626
(Catching her breath for the last time)

1674
01:01:21,627 --> 01:01:23,356
Ready? Box.

1675
01:01:23,357 --> 01:01:25,657
(Round 1 begins.)

1676
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,867
(In Ah's one-two)

1677
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:42,006
(Ducking)

1678
01:01:42,007 --> 01:01:43,276
(One, two)

1679
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:44,816
(Valid strike)

1680
01:01:44,817 --> 01:01:46,416
(Ducking, one, two)

1681
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,717
(The opponent's valid strike)

1682
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:51,216
(The opponent's blow)

1683
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:52,656
(In Ah counterattacks with a blow)

1684
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:54,857
(In Ah fights back in no time and pushes the opponent.)

1685
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:01,257
(Wait for her moment for the one-two.)

1686
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:03,926
(The opponent's straight punch)

1687
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:05,137
(In Ah's blow)

1688
01:02:05,437 --> 01:02:06,937
(Big steps)

1689
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:08,567
You got it.

1690
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,337
Good.

1691
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:11,777
She's good.

1692
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:14,277
She's not falling behind.

1693
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:17,707
(The two were waiting for the chance to attack.)

1694
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:20,176
(Battering in a flash)

1695
01:02:20,177 --> 01:02:21,917
- One more time. - That's right.

1696
01:02:22,387 --> 01:02:24,546
(In Ah's straight punch is valid.)

1697
01:02:24,547 --> 01:02:26,056
(Followed by the opponent's left hook)

1698
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:27,786
Okay. That's right. Keep your guard up.

1699
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:28,826
That was valid. Nice.

1700
01:02:28,827 --> 01:02:30,857
(Rushing to make a straight punch)

1701
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:32,726
(This is full sparring.)

1702
01:02:32,727 --> 01:02:34,196
(The right hook comes in real strong.)

1703
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,327
(Her punch is stronger than expected.)

1704
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,766
You need to turn.

1705
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:39,096
(Don't just stand there.)

1706
01:02:39,097 --> 01:02:40,237
And turn.

1707
01:02:40,337 --> 01:02:41,807
What do you do with your lead hand?

1708
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:45,306
(Jab after parrying)

1709
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:46,607
(Avoiding immediately)

1710
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:49,177
You got it.

1711
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:52,517
(A series of punches in a flash)

1712
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:55,587
(Brutal punch strength)

1713
01:02:57,917 --> 01:02:59,717
(Followed by close battering)

1714
01:03:00,187 --> 01:03:01,956
(Side)

1715
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:02,986
(Abs)

1716
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,457
(Face)

1717
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:05,956
She's good.

1718
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:06,996
(She's good.)

1719
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:08,026
Gosh.

1720
01:03:08,027 --> 01:03:09,567
(Full sparring is no joke.)

1721
01:03:12,737 --> 01:03:14,237
Ten seconds, In Ah. You can do it.

1722
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:15,837
Go, Seol In Ah.

1723
01:03:15,937 --> 01:03:18,137
Jab, jab, and punch.

1724
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:19,937
Go low.

1725
01:03:20,437 --> 01:03:21,476
Let's go.

1726
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:22,847
(The high-low combination attack)

1727
01:03:24,177 --> 01:03:25,346
Go high.

1728
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:27,076
(She blocked the low attack, )

1729
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:28,593
(but it's followed by the high attack instantly.)

1730
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:29,847
You need to turn.

1731
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:31,516
Again. Turn.

1732
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,717
Yes. Turn.

1733
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,156
(She manages to avoid...)

1734
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:37,656
(and throws a hook.)

1735
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:38,997
(She even succeeds in parrying.)

1736
01:03:39,327 --> 01:03:40,557
(Right hook)

1737
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:42,326
(Parry)

1738
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:43,666
(Round 1 ends.)

1739
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:44,727
You're good.

1740
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:48,567
(40 seconds of rest while supporting each other)

1741
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:50,306
Okay. To your corners.

1742
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:51,577
- Good job. - Corners.

1743
01:03:51,907 --> 01:03:54,067
- Good job. That was good. - In Ah, catch your breath.

1744
01:03:54,337 --> 01:03:55,406
Why is she so good?

1745
01:03:55,407 --> 01:03:56,506
(I know.)

1746
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:58,046
- She's so good. - She's amazing.

1747
01:03:58,047 --> 01:03:59,293
(Surprised to see In Ah's skills)

1748
01:03:59,317 --> 01:04:00,676
I'm going to die.

1749
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:02,397
(The next player couldn't be more nervous.)

1750
01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:05,287
(Meanwhile, In Ah's catching her breath.)

1751
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,987
(Sighing)

1752
01:04:08,287 --> 01:04:09,587
Good job. That was good.

1753
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:12,627
She bends as she comes in.

1754
01:04:12,797 --> 01:04:14,396
She attacks like this as she bends.

1755
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:15,427
So...

1756
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:17,666
try the jab and this.

1757
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:19,466
And the one-two.

1758
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:20,873
(Walk, punch, and fast one-two for Round 2)

1759
01:04:20,897 --> 01:04:23,336
- The opponent has a long reach. - Yes.

1760
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,806
- She's good at the one-two. - Yes.

1761
01:04:25,807 --> 01:04:27,576
- But no hook, upper, and blow. - Okay.

1762
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:29,176
It'll be easier for you if you keep the distance short.

1763
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:30,576
Keep your guard up. Lower your body.

1764
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:31,746
Keep close to her.

1765
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:33,347
- And try hook, upper, and blow. - Okay.

1766
01:04:35,487 --> 01:04:37,747
(Catching her breath for the last time)

1767
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:39,756
Give your all...

1768
01:04:39,757 --> 01:04:41,017
like you said.

1769
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,687
Let's go.

1770
01:04:42,757 --> 01:04:43,826
(Round 2 begins.)

1771
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:45,267
This is the last round. Go show her.

1772
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:52,367
(In Ah looks for her chance to attack.)

1773
01:04:52,797 --> 01:04:54,867
(Her opponent provokes her with her footwork.)

1774
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:57,507
Cut.

1775
01:04:57,867 --> 01:04:59,537
(The battering begins.)

1776
01:05:00,937 --> 01:05:02,176
(Battering again)

1777
01:05:02,177 --> 01:05:03,246
Turn.

1778
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:04,477
Yes. Good job.

1779
01:05:04,577 --> 01:05:06,246
(After a jab, )

1780
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:07,916
(she gets punched...)

1781
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,547
(and ducks.)

1782
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,756
(Strong right hook)

1783
01:05:12,757 --> 01:05:14,256
(Followed by jab)

1784
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:16,286
(She makes valid strikes in a row.)

1785
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,727
(She doesn't forget to guard.)

1786
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:19,427
High and low.

1787
01:05:19,657 --> 01:05:21,097
(The high-low combination)

1788
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:24,227
(The opponent's heavy hook)

1789
01:05:24,627 --> 01:05:26,036
- One more time. - Good job.

1790
01:05:26,037 --> 01:05:27,067
(Battering in a flash)

1791
01:05:27,437 --> 01:05:31,406
(The opponent's blow right in the spot)

1792
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:33,077
She's good.

1793
01:05:33,177 --> 01:05:34,507
Yes. She's really good.

1794
01:05:35,107 --> 01:05:38,516
(After the battering, her moves get bigger...)

1795
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:42,417
(as she feels rushed.)

1796
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:44,947
(The opponent's sudden attack)

1797
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:46,486
(Avoiding In Ah's one-two, )

1798
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:47,856
(and a body straight)

1799
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:49,927
(Staggering)

1800
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:56,967
(The two get closer again.)

1801
01:05:57,367 --> 01:05:58,566
(The opponent's left hook)

1802
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,396
(Right hook)

1803
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:01,436
(Screaming)

1804
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:03,106
One more time. Get in there.

1805
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:05,176
(One more right hook)

1806
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:06,676
One more time. Get in there.

1807
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:08,176
(The punch continues without stopping.)

1808
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:09,307
Yes. Get in there.

1809
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:11,407
Keep your guard up.

1810
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:15,547
(A series of pouring punches)

1811
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:18,957
Keep your guard up.

1812
01:06:19,257 --> 01:06:20,257
Footwork.

1813
01:06:20,258 --> 01:06:22,857
(Her footwork and moves clearly slowed down.)

1814
01:06:23,227 --> 01:06:24,227
(Once her guard is down, it won't come back up.)

1815
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:25,396
You can do it.

1816
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:27,057
(In Ah's punches are getting weaker too.)

1817
01:06:27,627 --> 01:06:28,827
In Ah's running out of energy.

1818
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:30,826
- You can do it, Seol In Ah. - You can do it, Seol In Ah.

1819
01:06:30,827 --> 01:06:32,036
Go, Seol In Ah!

1820
01:06:32,037 --> 01:06:33,136
(With the girls' support, )

1821
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:35,507
(she tries to come to her senses.)

1822
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:41,806
(The opponent attacks aggressively.)

1823
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:43,947
- Turn. - Keep your guard up.

1824
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:47,076
- Turn. - Hang in there.

1825
01:06:47,077 --> 01:06:49,486
(In Ah is facing the pouring punches.)

1826
01:06:49,487 --> 01:06:50,647
Hang in there.

1827
01:06:51,017 --> 01:06:52,517
- In Ah, don't give up. - Seol In Ah.

1828
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:53,987
In Ah.

1829
01:06:54,517 --> 01:06:55,556
Keep going.

1830
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:57,256
Keep your guard up.

1831
01:06:57,257 --> 01:06:58,287
Keep guarding.

1832
01:07:01,697 --> 01:07:04,267
(Her stamina must've reached its limit.)

1833
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:07,197
(Yet, she endures it until the end.)

1834
01:07:08,097 --> 01:07:10,536
(Her opponent doesn't miss her chance.)

1835
01:07:10,537 --> 01:07:12,407
Stop.

1836
01:07:14,177 --> 01:07:15,946
Keep guarding.

1837
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:17,007
Good job.

1838
01:07:18,877 --> 01:07:24,087
(This is how intense a real game is.)

1839
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,656
Stop.

1840
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:28,657
(In the end, it ends with a standing eight count.)

1841
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:31,856
(As soon as a down is announced, In Ah flops.)

1842
01:07:31,857 --> 01:07:33,027
Catch your breath.

1843
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,297
Now, one, two...

1844
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:40,067
(She pants.)

1845
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:42,167
She's down.

1846
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:44,067
Oh, my gosh.

1847
01:07:46,137 --> 01:07:47,276
She got beat a lot.

1848
01:07:47,277 --> 01:07:48,676
(Becoming restless from the unexpected situation)

1849
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:50,106
She got beat a lot.

1850
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,067
(Becoming restless from the unexpected situation)

1851
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:53,817
Catch your breath.

1852
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:55,317
Now, one,

1853
01:07:55,717 --> 01:07:56,846
two,

1854
01:07:56,847 --> 01:07:57,987
three...

1855
01:07:58,247 --> 01:07:59,287
Now, one,

1856
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:00,757
two...

1857
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:02,956
(When the count begins, )

1858
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:05,726
(In Ah gets back on her feet.)

1859
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:07,257
Are you okay? Six.

1860
01:08:07,857 --> 01:08:08,966
Seven. Catch your breath.

1861
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:11,626
(She calmly catches her breath.)

1862
01:08:11,627 --> 01:08:12,637
Go.

1863
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:15,607
Go.

1864
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:18,506
(After the count, )

1865
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:20,177
Go.

1866
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:24,707
(the game resumes.)

1867
01:08:27,077 --> 01:08:28,146
Box.

1868
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:30,317
(Round 2 resumes.)

1869
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:35,287
(As soon as it resumes, In Ah pours punches.)

1870
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:40,026
(Uppercut)

1871
01:08:40,027 --> 01:08:41,227
(Hook in the face)

1872
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:43,927
(Exchanging brutal punches)

1873
01:08:44,897 --> 01:08:46,597
- Ten seconds! - Ten seconds left.

1874
01:08:46,897 --> 01:08:48,537
In Ah, endure it.

1875
01:08:50,867 --> 01:08:54,307
(A tight game in the last 10 seconds)

1876
01:08:54,737 --> 01:08:56,907
(She gives her all.)

1877
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:00,116
(Even though she gets beaten...)

1878
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:02,686
(again and again, )

1879
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:06,757
(In Ah never gives up.)

1880
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:11,787
(She keeps attacking without stopping until the end.)

1881
01:09:12,097 --> 01:09:13,756
(Startled)

1882
01:09:13,757 --> 01:09:15,127
(Exclaiming)

1883
01:09:16,867 --> 01:09:18,266
(Round 2 ends.)

1884
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:19,396
Good job.

1885
01:09:19,397 --> 01:09:20,837
(Round 2 ends.)

1886
01:09:23,837 --> 01:09:25,067
Gosh, it's hard.

1887
01:09:26,137 --> 01:09:27,206
Seriously.

1888
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:29,346
(Seol In Ah is amazing.)

1889
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:30,507
Gosh, In Ah.

1890
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:32,547
Gosh, In Ah.

1891
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:33,777
Only after two months?

1892
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:35,077
- No way. - Gosh, In Ah.

1893
01:09:35,147 --> 01:09:36,186
Isn't she good enough to join...

1894
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:37,563
the community sports boxing competition now?

1895
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:39,256
- Isn't she good enough? - Yes.

1896
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:41,337
(Isn't she good enough to join the competition now?)

1897
01:09:42,087 --> 01:09:43,326
(Exclaiming)

1898
01:09:43,327 --> 01:09:44,527
I'm no match for her.

1899
01:09:45,427 --> 01:09:46,497
Good job.

1900
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:50,826
(In Ah finally takes a deep breath.)

1901
01:09:50,827 --> 01:09:53,067
In Ah, you did your best until the end.

1902
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,766
I heard cracking sounds in my jaw. It was crazy.

1903
01:09:56,767 --> 01:09:58,767
(I heard cracking sounds in my jaw. It was crazy.)

1904
01:09:59,977 --> 01:10:01,536
- You were amazing. - Thank you.

1905
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:02,847
I learned a lot from you.

1906
01:10:03,077 --> 01:10:04,247
I mean it.

1907
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:08,316
Hyeon Bin, how was it?

1908
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:09,586
I was surprised.

1909
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:11,086
I'm surprised to see...

1910
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:13,316
how strong she is, despite her small body.

1911
01:10:13,317 --> 01:10:16,057
I heard she only learned for two months.

1912
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:18,287
She's really dogged.

1913
01:10:18,627 --> 01:10:20,356
- Right. - I was amazed by it.

1914
01:10:20,357 --> 01:10:21,826
Because...

1915
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:23,626
after a standing eight count,

1916
01:10:23,627 --> 01:10:25,266
the player is often discouraged...

1917
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:27,636
and just guard and wait for the game to end.

1918
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:31,237
Yet, she went against you at the last minute.

1919
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:33,107
To be honest, it was ringing in my head.

1920
01:10:33,307 --> 01:10:34,776
So when she was beating me,

1921
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:35,906
I wanted to avoid it,

1922
01:10:35,907 --> 01:10:37,206
- but I couldn't come to my senses. - Right.

1923
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:39,916
So when the standing eight count began,

1924
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:41,793
I was relieved to take a break for eight seconds.

1925
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,146
So after the eight seconds of break,

1926
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,946
I told myself to get ready for ten seconds...

1927
01:10:44,947 --> 01:10:47,086
and gave my all as soon as it began.

1928
01:10:47,087 --> 01:10:48,156
That is...

1929
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:50,487
(When she went down on her knees after the battering, )

1930
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:52,456
(she got back on her feet in 2 seconds...)

1931
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:53,657
(out of the 8 counts.)

1932
01:10:54,057 --> 01:10:55,826
(Without giving up, )

1933
01:10:55,827 --> 01:10:58,797
(she braced herself.)

1934
01:10:59,197 --> 01:11:02,637
(When the bell rang to announce 10 seconds, )

1935
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:06,406
(In Ah gave her all...)

1936
01:11:06,407 --> 01:11:10,477
(and showed her endless spirit.)

1937
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:14,917
To tell you the truth,

1938
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:17,216
the strategy we prepared...

1939
01:11:17,217 --> 01:11:18,647
didn't work at all.

1940
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,156
(Good job, In Ah.)

1941
01:11:20,157 --> 01:11:22,686
Because we were told you learned for two months,

1942
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:25,556
we expected you to have no sense of distance.

1943
01:11:25,557 --> 01:11:28,356
We expected emotional punches.

1944
01:11:28,357 --> 01:11:31,397
But from Round One, she maintained her distance.

1945
01:11:32,097 --> 01:11:34,797
(Calculating the distance with jabs)

1946
01:11:35,097 --> 01:11:38,876
She calmly made good use of her basic techniques.

1947
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:39,953
(Calmly using her techniques)

1948
01:11:39,977 --> 01:11:45,146
(She even dared to close in and throw punches.)

1949
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:48,987
Little did we expect her to overwhelm us with her boxing.

1950
01:11:49,187 --> 01:11:50,716
She was full of surprises.

1951
01:11:50,717 --> 01:11:52,916
- I was taken aback. - Yes, same here.

1952
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,556
- She was amazing. - I did it.

1953
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:55,827
Exactly. Gosh.

1954
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:58,156
- Good job, Seol In Ah. - You did well, In Ah.

1955
01:11:58,157 --> 01:11:59,356
- It was fun. - You were great.

1956
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,926
Boxing has gotten so much more fun.

1957
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:04,197
Look forward to another spar. I'll come back stronger.

1958
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,336
(Feel free to come by anytime.)

1959
01:12:06,337 --> 01:12:07,737
I've learned so much from you.

1960
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:10,906
(In Ah's first actual sparring results:)

1961
01:12:10,907 --> 01:12:14,136
(Strengths: Making good use of her techniques and footwork)

1962
01:12:14,137 --> 01:12:19,746
(A final burst that catches her opponent off guard)

1963
01:12:19,747 --> 01:12:20,876
- Turn left and right. - Move.

1964
01:12:20,877 --> 01:12:24,316
(Weaknesses: Dropping her guard when tired...)

1965
01:12:24,317 --> 01:12:29,556
(leaves her open to a series of hits.)

1966
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,056
- I learned a tough lesson in life. - Good job.

1967
01:12:31,057 --> 01:12:33,627
You were super cool.

1968
01:12:33,757 --> 01:12:35,097
You're amazing at boxing.

1969
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:37,366
Well done, In Ah.

1970
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:40,166
- They're on a different level. - The way you finished strong...

1971
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,867
was really impressive.

1972
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:43,666
My chin hurts a lot.

1973
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,406
I saw your jaw take a solid hit.

1974
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:46,606
They're merciless.

1975
01:12:46,607 --> 01:12:48,353
Those girls will strike back just like you did.

1976
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:50,346
(A brutal review from the experienced person)

1977
01:12:50,347 --> 01:12:51,876
I'm dead scared.

1978
01:12:51,877 --> 01:12:53,117
(The next boxer feels anxious.)

1979
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:54,516
All right, the next match.

1980
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:57,587
Park Ju Hyun and Kwon Seo Hee, please step into the ring.

1981
01:12:57,987 --> 01:12:59,386
Keep glaring, and you can fluster them.

1982
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:01,156
After the standing eight count,

1983
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,257
- I pretended I was okay. - Earlier, you...

1984
01:13:03,457 --> 01:13:05,127
- You're the best. - Keep glaring.

1985
01:13:05,387 --> 01:13:06,497
Okay.

1986
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:08,526
Be aggressive.

1987
01:13:08,527 --> 01:13:10,067
- But keep calm. - Yes, sir.

1988
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,897
- Good luck. - Let's go.

1989
01:13:14,897 --> 01:13:18,136
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun...)

1990
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:22,277
(is warming up her body.)

1991
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:26,477
(Warming up her madness)

1992
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:28,746
(Keeping her eyes sharp...)

1993
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:31,586
(and warming up properly)

1994
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:32,757
Fighters, to the center.

1995
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:36,357
- Play fair. - Understood.

1996
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:37,527
Touch gloves.

1997
01:13:38,327 --> 01:13:39,327
Corner.

1998
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:46,897
(Ju Hyun's first full sparring session is about to begin.)

1999
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:52,407
(Trying to calm her nerves)

2000
01:13:52,437 --> 01:13:54,336
(Park Ju Hyun...)

2001
01:13:54,337 --> 01:13:55,606
(is ready to fight.)

2002
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:56,607
Box!

2003
01:13:57,507 --> 01:14:00,517
(Round 1 begins.)

2004
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:06,517
Pull down your chin. Low.

2005
01:14:07,017 --> 01:14:08,157
Focus on low.

2006
01:14:08,517 --> 01:14:09,957
(A simultaneous attack)

2007
01:14:10,357 --> 01:14:11,987
(Valid strike)

2008
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:13,357
(Valid strike)

2009
01:14:14,857 --> 01:14:16,526
(Ju Hyun delivers a series of hits.)

2010
01:14:16,527 --> 01:14:18,226
(Parrying and a straight punch)

2011
01:14:18,227 --> 01:14:19,397
That's it. Nice.

2012
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:21,097
Good job.

2013
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:22,737
Advance.

2014
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:25,407
Move forward. Yes.

2015
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:26,877
What now?

2016
01:14:28,077 --> 01:14:29,476
- Right away. Yes. - Good.

2017
01:14:29,477 --> 01:14:32,416
(A cross thrown in sync with the opponent)

2018
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,676
Go all the way.

2019
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,686
(Ju Hyun blocked the opponent's attack.)

2020
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:36,847
Try number five.

2021
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,317
That's it. You can do it.

2022
01:14:39,757 --> 01:14:41,657
(A flurry of punches in an instant)

2023
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:44,526
(A relentless series of strikes)

2024
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:46,627
It's okay, Ju Hyun. Put your guard up.

2025
01:14:50,897 --> 01:14:52,797
(Despite the nonstop attacks, )

2026
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:54,497
(Ju Hyun fights back.)

2027
01:14:54,498 --> 01:14:55,836
- That's it. - You're doing well.

2028
01:14:55,837 --> 01:14:56,907
- She's good. - Good luck.

2029
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:58,337
Go all the way.

2030
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:00,107
- Quickly. - Quickly. Turn.

2031
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:01,736
Turn. That's it.

2032
01:15:01,737 --> 01:15:02,776
(Incoming attacks)

2033
01:15:02,777 --> 01:15:03,977
(Flustered footwork)

2034
01:15:04,307 --> 01:15:06,976
(She lowers her head again.)

2035
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:08,016
Close in.

2036
01:15:08,017 --> 01:15:09,117
Watch her as you strike.

2037
01:15:10,447 --> 01:15:12,217
Keep your eyes on her before you jab.

2038
01:15:12,817 --> 01:15:14,556
- Yes. - Yes. Turn.

2039
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:16,387
(Hook)

2040
01:15:16,587 --> 01:15:18,456
- Turn. - That's it.

2041
01:15:18,457 --> 01:15:19,856
(A fierce exchange of blows)

2042
01:15:19,857 --> 01:15:22,227
(Using her entire body to throw a right hook)

2043
01:15:23,027 --> 01:15:24,666
Go all the way.

2044
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:25,967
(Right hook)

2045
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:29,036
Great one!

2046
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:30,536
That's it, Park Ju Hyun! Good job!

2047
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:32,037
- Look ahead. - Nice!

2048
01:15:33,177 --> 01:15:36,177
- Yes. Turn. - That's it.

2049
01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:40,047
(A flurry of blows as soon as the 10-second signal rings)

2050
01:15:40,717 --> 01:15:43,747
(After taking valid strikes while moving back, )

2051
01:15:44,117 --> 01:15:47,117
(Ju Hyun hits back with a straight punch.)

2052
01:15:47,317 --> 01:15:48,857
Go for it. You have her in the corner.

2053
01:15:49,287 --> 01:15:50,357
You've cornered her.

2054
01:15:51,427 --> 01:15:53,127
(A clinch battle begins.)

2055
01:15:54,997 --> 01:15:56,127
Turn.

2056
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:57,296
(The coach called for a pivot.)

2057
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:59,767
Turn. Stop.

2058
01:16:00,497 --> 01:16:02,367
- Turn. Stop. - Stop.

2059
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:05,137
(Finishing off after taking a series of punches)

2060
01:16:06,037 --> 01:16:07,106
Drink some water.

2061
01:16:07,107 --> 01:16:08,837
(Round 1 ends.)

2062
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,606
Don't turn around, okay, Ju Hyun?

2063
01:16:11,607 --> 01:16:13,807
(He first stresses that a complete spin is prohibited.)

2064
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:15,786
Breathe in as much as you can.

2065
01:16:15,787 --> 01:16:16,886
(Calmly regulating her breathing)

2066
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:19,587
What you're doing really well is...

2067
01:16:19,817 --> 01:16:22,726
hitting back even while the opponent is attacking.

2068
01:16:22,727 --> 01:16:24,357
Your straights are landing well.

2069
01:16:24,627 --> 01:16:27,527
Try following it up with a hook. Okay?

2070
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:30,077
That way, you'll hit the opponent without a doubt. Got it?

2071
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:31,966
All she throws are straight punches.

2072
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:33,396
That's all she does.

2073
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:35,396
This is her only move, so go with five. Like this.

2074
01:16:35,397 --> 01:16:37,037
- Good luck. It's the last round. - Okay.

2075
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,477
(Round 2 begins.)

2076
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:46,917
Nice.

2077
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:48,716
(The ongoing attacks...)

2078
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:50,817
(turn into a rapid exchange of blows.)

2079
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:53,156
(Ju Hyun's straight punch)

2080
01:16:53,157 --> 01:16:55,087
- Nice. - That's it.

2081
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,457
- Keep pressing. - Nice.

2082
01:16:58,357 --> 01:17:00,756
(A quick back-and-forth exchange of punches)

2083
01:17:00,757 --> 01:17:03,196
(Fierce)

2084
01:17:03,197 --> 01:17:05,227
- Nice. - That's amazing.

2085
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:07,297
Punch. That's it.

2086
01:17:07,597 --> 01:17:11,007
(Ju Hyun is instantly driven back.)

2087
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:15,307
(Powerful hooks come at her nonstop, )

2088
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:17,677
(followed by a straight punch.)

2089
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:20,747
- Yes. - Turn.

2090
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:22,787
Turn.

2091
01:17:25,547 --> 01:17:28,787
(Ju Hyun calmly resets her position.)

2092
01:17:30,657 --> 01:17:35,727
(The opponent dodges and throws hooks, but Ju Hyun fights back.)

2093
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,926
(They watch for the right timing, )

2094
01:17:38,927 --> 01:17:41,437
(and another flurry breaks out.)

2095
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:43,166
(The opponent dodges Ju Hyun's punch...)

2096
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:45,107
(and lands a hook to the face.)

2097
01:17:45,437 --> 01:17:46,977
(Valid strike)

2098
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:49,777
(Her sheer determination delivers a strike.)

2099
01:17:50,007 --> 01:17:52,176
Park Ju Hyun's really good. She's a fighter.

2100
01:17:52,177 --> 01:17:53,546
- Yes. - She fights all the way.

2101
01:17:53,547 --> 01:17:54,817
There are 40 seconds left.

2102
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:58,647
(Ju Hyun keeps her eyes on the opponent.)

2103
01:18:04,587 --> 01:18:06,996
(The opponent's right hook)

2104
01:18:06,997 --> 01:18:08,697
(Another right hook)

2105
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:14,567
(Ju Hyun has taken consecutive hits to the jaw and face.)

2106
01:18:14,997 --> 01:18:16,406
Stop.

2107
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:18,236
(A standing eight count is called.)

2108
01:18:18,237 --> 01:18:20,037
One, two,

2109
01:18:20,337 --> 01:18:22,177
three, four...

2110
01:18:22,377 --> 01:18:24,307
- Three, four... - Maybe it was a heavy shot.

2111
01:18:24,707 --> 01:18:26,417
No. You can do it, Ju Hyun.

2112
01:18:26,717 --> 01:18:28,547
One, two...

2113
01:18:28,893 --> 01:18:30,762
(Ju Hyun lowers her head as if in pain.)

2114
01:18:30,763 --> 01:18:33,063
(But...)

2115
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:36,829
(I don't give up easily!)

2116
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:40,899
(Zombie Boxer Park Ju Hyun)

2117
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:42,539
Eight. Are you okay?

2118
01:18:43,139 --> 01:18:44,208
Okay.

2119
01:18:44,209 --> 01:18:45,408
(Ju Hyun is ready to fight again.)

2120
01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:46,908
Start.

2121
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:49,679
(Round 2 resumes.)

2122
01:18:49,879 --> 01:18:51,909
There's not much time left. Go all out.

2123
01:18:53,749 --> 01:18:55,518
(Another flurry of punches)

2124
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:56,519
(Shifting in place)

2125
01:18:56,749 --> 01:18:57,788
(Hook)

2126
01:18:57,789 --> 01:18:59,618
(The opponent keeps throwing hooks in place.)

2127
01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:01,989
- That's it. Ten seconds. - Let's go, Park Ju Hyun.

2128
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:03,558
Nice one.

2129
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:05,899
(A straight lands through an open guard)

2130
01:19:07,099 --> 01:19:09,099
- Five seconds. - Close your guard.

2131
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:11,428
Yes, close it. All the way.

2132
01:19:11,429 --> 01:19:13,549
(Ju Hyun keeps fighting against a tireless opponent.)

2133
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:15,839
(Attacking and countering)

2134
01:19:16,469 --> 01:19:18,938
(The two players go all out until the end.)

2135
01:19:18,939 --> 01:19:20,279
Stop.

2136
01:19:20,379 --> 01:19:21,538
- Good job. - Okay.

2137
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,249
(Round 2 ends.)

2138
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:25,918
(Exhausted)

2139
01:19:25,919 --> 01:19:26,919
Nice, Park Ju Hyun.

2140
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,779
You fought until the very last second.

2141
01:19:30,219 --> 01:19:31,699
For someone who boxed for two months,

2142
01:19:31,919 --> 01:19:33,919
- she's good. - She has great power.

2143
01:19:35,419 --> 01:19:39,158
(Ju Hyun unleashed everything in her first full spar.)

2144
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:41,898
She has a good instinct for throwing punches.

2145
01:19:41,899 --> 01:19:44,075
- Ju Hyun is a natural fighter. - She's got a good punch.

2146
01:19:44,099 --> 01:19:46,069
Even without much technique,

2147
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:48,498
she manages to land punches through sheer determination.

2148
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:50,708
(A born-to-be fighter)

2149
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:52,338
Is my face okay?

2150
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:53,609
It's red.

2151
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:55,439
Ju Hyun.

2152
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,309
It hurts a lot.

2153
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:58,779
Great job.

2154
01:19:59,549 --> 01:20:00,549
Good work.

2155
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:02,119
I'm going to pretend like I'm okay.

2156
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:04,649
You did really well.

2157
01:20:04,889 --> 01:20:05,889
(Greeting with a poker face)

2158
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,388
- Please greet each other. - Okay.

2159
01:20:07,389 --> 01:20:08,389
Good job.

2160
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,189
I thought you were going to kill me.

2161
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:12,558
(The opponent's honest thoughts)

2162
01:20:12,559 --> 01:20:13,959
Is my face okay?

2163
01:20:14,029 --> 01:20:15,029
Yes.

2164
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,898
It's like I've been through plastic surgery.

2165
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,268
- What? - "Plastic surgery?"

2166
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:20,598
- Does it feel weird? Does it hurt? - It's like...

2167
01:20:20,599 --> 01:20:22,468
my tongue is stiff.

2168
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:23,538
Like you're still under?

2169
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:25,469
Exactly. It just feels weird.

2170
01:20:26,279 --> 01:20:29,279
I heard you were going to compete next month.

2171
01:20:29,349 --> 01:20:30,808
She's very daring.

2172
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:33,818
If she's only been training for two months,

2173
01:20:33,819 --> 01:20:35,419
if she keeps at it,

2174
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,589
she'll be able to take on any opponent.

2175
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:39,159
Really?

2176
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:40,689
She was cool.

2177
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:42,388
Ju Hyun is fearless...

2178
01:20:42,389 --> 01:20:43,928
- and aggressive, - Yes.

2179
01:20:43,929 --> 01:20:45,165
Looking me straight in the eyes.

2180
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:47,329
She fought while watching exactly how I was striking.

2181
01:20:47,429 --> 01:20:49,499
- Like a zombie, right? - Yes.

2182
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:53,669
(Facing her opponent without hesitation)

2183
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:56,638
(Focused)

2184
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,279
(No matter how many hits she takes, her eyes never leave her opponent.)

2185
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:04,808
(Zombie Boxer Park Ju Hyun)

2186
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:06,478
First off, she can take a hit well.

2187
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:07,619
Right.

2188
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,649
Even after getting hit twice in the jaw, her eyes were locked.

2189
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:12,388
I took a lot of hits, didn't I?

2190
01:21:12,389 --> 01:21:15,189
In fact, Ju Hyun took a lot of hits...

2191
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:17,488
- midway through the match. - Right?

2192
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:20,729
She subconsciously turned her body away.

2193
01:21:21,029 --> 01:21:22,498
(Right before the end of Round 1)

2194
01:21:22,499 --> 01:21:23,529
(Spinning)

2195
01:21:24,169 --> 01:21:27,139
(Ju Hyun spun all the way around.)

2196
01:21:27,499 --> 01:21:28,698
I remember spinning.

2197
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:29,708
I don't know why I did it.

2198
01:21:29,709 --> 01:21:31,238
It was my survival instinct.

2199
01:21:31,239 --> 01:21:32,938
During a fight, you shouldn't spin...

2200
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:34,379
or turn your back on the opponent.

2201
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:35,778
Exactly.

2202
01:21:35,779 --> 01:21:38,149
But still, she kept fighting back.

2203
01:21:38,509 --> 01:21:40,678
- How long did you box for again? - Six months.

2204
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:42,388
- She's got good power. - Right?

2205
01:21:42,389 --> 01:21:43,848
She's worked out a lot.

2206
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:45,958
Her strength comes from extensive...

2207
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:46,959
CrossFit training.

2208
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,988
(Groaning)

2209
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:49,229
It hurts a lot.

2210
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:50,789
- Where? - This...

2211
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:52,328
Where does it hurt?

2212
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:53,358
- Let me begin. - Okay.

2213
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:55,359
- My temple hurts the most. - Right.

2214
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:57,169
My jaw hurts too.

2215
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:58,498
My neck.

2216
01:21:58,499 --> 01:22:00,619
Even when my head jerked back, I pretended it didn't.

2217
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:01,999
I endured it,

2218
01:22:02,269 --> 01:22:03,409
but while feeling the pain.

2219
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:05,308
My arms hurt too.

2220
01:22:05,309 --> 01:22:06,949
Didn't I also get punched in the stomach?

2221
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,938
Like you were in a three-car collision?

2222
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:10,378
It hurts so much.

2223
01:22:10,379 --> 01:22:11,479
- It does. - But...

2224
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:14,248
Here's what I want to know.

2225
01:22:14,249 --> 01:22:15,278
During the fight,

2226
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:17,448
- you had numbers like we did. - Yes.

2227
01:22:17,449 --> 01:22:18,618
- What was the number? - Five.

2228
01:22:18,619 --> 01:22:19,689
- Five? - I remember.

2229
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:21,259
Try number five.

2230
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:23,429
(The coach kept calling for 5.)

2231
01:22:23,629 --> 01:22:24,828
- "What's five?" - Five...

2232
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:26,429
I thought, "What's five?"

2233
01:22:27,099 --> 01:22:28,828
- What was five? - Five was...

2234
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:31,299
hitting the lead hand,

2235
01:22:31,599 --> 01:22:33,368
then throwing a punch. That's what five was.

2236
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:34,438
It's different from our five.

2237
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:36,409
When he called out five,

2238
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:38,639
the only thing on my mind was "upper, hook."

2239
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:39,779
You do it too.

2240
01:22:40,509 --> 01:22:41,909
Like, "Number 128!"

2241
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:43,608
- Exactly. - "Hey, number one."

2242
01:22:43,609 --> 01:22:45,179
- Do it. - Yes.

2243
01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:47,218
(Ju Hyun's first full sparring results:)

2244
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:49,988
(Strengths: Using early focus to pick the right moments to attack)

2245
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:54,059
(Overcoming fear well and attacking proactively)

2246
01:22:54,489 --> 01:23:01,098
(Points to improve on: Learn techniques...)

2247
01:23:01,099 --> 01:23:04,898
(that aren't instinctive, )

2248
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:08,639
(such as the 360° spin or 2-handed punches)

2249
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:10,669
Let's start with the third match.

2250
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:13,238
Uie and Ju Jung In,

2251
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:14,439
to the center.

2252
01:23:14,879 --> 01:23:16,048
Let's not mess with Uie.

2253
01:23:16,049 --> 01:23:17,149
She's way too tense.

2254
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:19,748
(A rigid expression from nervousness)

2255
01:23:19,749 --> 01:23:20,978
Get your gear on.

2256
01:23:20,979 --> 01:23:22,218
Stay calm.

2257
01:23:22,219 --> 01:23:23,849
Stay calm, okay?

2258
01:23:25,489 --> 01:23:26,919
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

2259
01:23:27,589 --> 01:23:29,458
You scare me. You're always smiling.

2260
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:30,559
But right now...

2261
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:31,789
It's okay.

2262
01:23:32,129 --> 01:23:33,559
Take a deep breath.

2263
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:35,529
Breathe in.

2264
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:39,369
(Relaxing by taking deep breaths)

2265
01:23:39,769 --> 01:23:42,398
(While calmly preparing for the match)

2266
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:43,738
She's done a lot of sports.

2267
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:44,868
She has.

2268
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:45,908
Breathe in.

2269
01:23:45,909 --> 01:23:47,939
Breathe in deeply.

2270
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:49,648
Focus. Listen carefully.

2271
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:53,049
All right. We'll begin the third spar.

2272
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:54,348
(Calming herself down)

2273
01:23:54,349 --> 01:23:55,479
Fighters, to the center.

2274
01:23:56,519 --> 01:23:57,589
Good luck, Kim Uie!

2275
01:23:57,689 --> 01:23:59,019
You can do it!

2276
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,058
(Fighters, to the center.)

2277
01:24:01,059 --> 01:24:02,929
Keep your manners.

2278
01:24:03,559 --> 01:24:04,559
Corner.

2279
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,280
(A glove touch promising a respectful game)

2280
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:07,658
Okay.

2281
01:24:07,659 --> 01:24:10,229
(Both fighters are ready.)

2282
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:11,599
Box!

2283
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:12,769
Here they go.

2284
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:16,069
(How will Uie perform in the ring?)

2285
01:24:19,339 --> 01:24:20,408
Yes.

2286
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:22,209
(The opponent launches a sharp first strike.)

2287
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:24,649
(She lands a perfect right hook on Uie.)

2288
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:27,878
No, stay back.

2289
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:29,019
Look.

2290
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,489
Throw long jabs. Throw in many jabs.

2291
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:32,589
Jabs.

2292
01:24:33,389 --> 01:24:36,629
(Calmly measuring the distance again)

2293
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,499
(Launching a flurry using her long reach)

2294
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:40,858
Nice.

2295
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:42,599
(Right hook, left hook)

2296
01:24:42,969 --> 01:24:43,998
There she goes.

2297
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:45,498
(A precise strike to the face)

2298
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:47,239
(Uie lands her first valid strike.)

2299
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:52,338
(She rushed in...)

2300
01:24:52,339 --> 01:24:54,209
(and ended up taking a valid strike.)

2301
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:57,809
(As they close in, the opponent launches a flurry of strikes.)

2302
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:00,018
(Caught off guard by the counterattack)

2303
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:02,819
(Closing her eyes tightly)

2304
01:25:03,189 --> 01:25:04,249
Look at her.

2305
01:25:04,919 --> 01:25:06,759
Watch as you strike. Just like that.

2306
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:09,758
(Uie is timing her attack.)

2307
01:25:09,759 --> 01:25:10,858
You should've countered.

2308
01:25:10,859 --> 01:25:12,289
I told you always to counter.

2309
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:13,598
Punch.

2310
01:25:13,599 --> 01:25:15,659
(As soon as Uie jabs, the opponent counters.)

2311
01:25:16,369 --> 01:25:17,399
Yes.

2312
01:25:17,469 --> 01:25:19,268
Try double jabs and a low. Please.

2313
01:25:19,269 --> 01:25:20,699
Once again, with full force.

2314
01:25:21,269 --> 01:25:22,569
Exactly. One more time.

2315
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,438
(Body shot)

2316
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:26,478
(Left hook)

2317
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:28,379
(Uie keeps allowing valid strikes.)

2318
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:30,948
Your rear hand.

2319
01:25:30,949 --> 01:25:32,825
- Get your rear hand ready. - A long rear hand punch.

2320
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:33,878
At the most crucial moment.

2321
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:34,979
- Yes. - That's it.

2322
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:36,918
(Uie throws a powerful one-two.)

2323
01:25:36,919 --> 01:25:37,919
(Defending)

2324
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:39,188
Low. Good job.

2325
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:43,289
(The opponent immediately throws a hook.)

2326
01:25:43,789 --> 01:25:45,058
Remember your rear hand?

2327
01:25:45,059 --> 01:25:46,579
(Uie continues to probe with her jab.)

2328
01:25:46,929 --> 01:25:48,029
Yes.

2329
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:49,998
(After the parry, )

2330
01:25:49,999 --> 01:25:51,829
(she lands a straight.)

2331
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:54,498
That's right. Again.

2332
01:25:54,499 --> 01:25:56,109
(A clean strike to the face)

2333
01:25:56,969 --> 01:25:58,569
- She's good. - Right?

2334
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,079
Great job.

2335
01:26:00,409 --> 01:26:01,779
She's improved so much.

2336
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:03,779
The opponent is tired.

2337
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:06,479
Lead hand.

2338
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,519
- Yes. - That's it.

2339
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:09,018
(Valid strike)

2340
01:26:09,019 --> 01:26:10,289
(Both punches thrown at once)

2341
01:26:11,589 --> 01:26:15,258
(Uie's jab was so powerful that the opponent's head snapped back.)

2342
01:26:15,259 --> 01:26:16,458
Ten seconds.

2343
01:26:16,459 --> 01:26:17,689
- She's tired. Again. - Punch.

2344
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:19,458
Punch. That's it.

2345
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:20,528
- Again. - Again.

2346
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:21,729
Turn.

2347
01:26:22,459 --> 01:26:24,768
(The final flurry of punches in Round 1)

2348
01:26:24,769 --> 01:26:25,829
- Stop. - Okay.

2349
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:29,739
(Round 1 ends.)

2350
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:31,268
- She did an amazing job. - Really.

2351
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,029
- Great work. - How did she improve so much?

2352
01:26:33,179 --> 01:26:34,478
- That was cool. - Good job.

2353
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:35,579
She did really well.

2354
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:37,579
- Good job. - She was incredible.

2355
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:38,949
Here.

2356
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:41,148
You're doing great, Kim Uie.

2357
01:26:41,149 --> 01:26:42,919
(Taking deep breaths to catch her breath)

2358
01:26:43,749 --> 01:26:44,789
I can't reach her.

2359
01:26:45,419 --> 01:26:47,519
(Taken aback by Uie's long reach)

2360
01:26:48,019 --> 01:26:49,658
Try a feint against the opponent.

2361
01:26:49,659 --> 01:26:51,128
She's definitely going to punch.

2362
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:52,698
Strike first the moment she does. Okay?

2363
01:26:52,699 --> 01:26:53,758
Fool her.

2364
01:26:53,759 --> 01:26:55,328
Fool her no matter what. Got it?

2365
01:26:55,329 --> 01:26:56,768
Nice job walking in and hitting.

2366
01:26:56,769 --> 01:26:58,398
Don't punch right after moving in.

2367
01:26:58,399 --> 01:26:59,598
Move in, use a feint,

2368
01:26:59,599 --> 01:27:00,668
then hit.

2369
01:27:00,669 --> 01:27:01,999
Start fooling her.

2370
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,738
In Round Two, be more aggressive.

2371
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:05,408
Mix in hooks and body shots.

2372
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:07,038
Her reach is long, right?

2373
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:08,578
Hit after you move in. Okay?

2374
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:09,608
Keep your guard up, close the distance,

2375
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:10,648
and throw body shots.

2376
01:27:10,649 --> 01:27:11,978
Be messy. Understood?

2377
01:27:11,979 --> 01:27:13,478
- When I close the distance? - Yes, correct.

2378
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:14,579
She threw the most punches.

2379
01:27:16,489 --> 01:27:17,489
(Round 2 begins.)

2380
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:19,410
It's the last minute and 30 seconds. Keep it up.

2381
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:21,589
The fight is on.

2382
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:23,028
(The opponent immediately comes at Uie.)

2383
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,259
- Yes. - To the head first.

2384
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:27,958
(Responding to the hook with a one-two)

2385
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:29,499
- That's it. Good. - Yes.

2386
01:27:29,769 --> 01:27:30,798
Slip in and out.

2387
01:27:30,799 --> 01:27:32,119
(Both watch each other's timing.)

2388
01:27:32,769 --> 01:27:34,399
- That's it. Nice. - Okay.

2389
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:36,639
(Jab)

2390
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,968
(Straight)

2391
01:27:37,969 --> 01:27:39,739
(Jab)

2392
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,408
Nice.

2393
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:44,109
She finishes off with the one-two.

2394
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:46,779
Uie is really flexible.

2395
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:49,019
- Yes. - Good.

2396
01:27:49,749 --> 01:27:51,088
(A jab feint...)

2397
01:27:51,089 --> 01:27:53,019
(followed by a powerful straight)

2398
01:27:53,759 --> 01:27:55,759
- Yes. - Turn.

2399
01:27:55,889 --> 01:27:57,489
Good. She's improved a lot.

2400
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:00,129
Uie, concentrate on number one.

2401
01:28:00,799 --> 01:28:03,969
(Routine 1: One, two, backstep, one, two)

2402
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:08,198
(Using her long reach to throw one-twos)

2403
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:09,509
Hit hard. Yes.

2404
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:12,939
(A powerful hook from the opponent)

2405
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:14,639
Use your footwork.

2406
01:28:14,739 --> 01:28:15,978
Move in. Can you do it?

2407
01:28:15,979 --> 01:28:17,278
- That's it. Move in. - Good.

2408
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:19,578
(Impatient, her footwork becomes sloppy.)

2409
01:28:19,579 --> 01:28:21,819
Feint as you recall number one.

2410
01:28:23,019 --> 01:28:24,588
Move in. Go.

2411
01:28:24,589 --> 01:28:26,029
- That's it. One more time. - Punch.

2412
01:28:27,019 --> 01:28:28,459
(Feint)

2413
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:30,559
(After dodging)

2414
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,999
(A jab attacking using her long reach)

2415
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:41,869
Good.

2416
01:28:42,869 --> 01:28:44,268
Good. One more time.

2417
01:28:44,269 --> 01:28:48,109
(The opponent counters with a heavy hook.)

2418
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:50,109
The last 30 seconds.

2419
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:55,419
(Another hook comes at Uie.)

2420
01:28:56,519 --> 01:28:57,618
Nice one.

2421
01:28:57,619 --> 01:28:58,889
(Defending)

2422
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:04,289
Ten seconds.

2423
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,699
Number one. Do it again.

2424
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,329
Continue.

2425
01:29:08,499 --> 01:29:09,569
Go for it.

2426
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:13,599
(Uie sticks her one-twos until the end.)

2427
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:17,539
(Round 2 ends.)

2428
01:29:18,069 --> 01:29:20,138
The opponent can't reach her. Uie's reach is long.

2429
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:22,279
- Really. - It's just too long.

2430
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:25,609
(Shaking her head)

2431
01:29:27,249 --> 01:29:28,318
Well done.

2432
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:30,888
(The long 3 minutes are finally over.)

2433
01:29:30,889 --> 01:29:32,189
Breathe. Well done.

2434
01:29:36,829 --> 01:29:39,358
(Uie has given it her all.)

2435
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:40,429
Good job.

2436
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:41,659
She still has stamina.

2437
01:29:41,899 --> 01:29:43,629
Uie still has stamina.

2438
01:29:44,469 --> 01:29:45,798
Did she fight two rounds?

2439
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:47,099
Why did it end so quickly?

2440
01:29:47,269 --> 01:29:48,798
Those rounds flew by.

2441
01:29:48,799 --> 01:29:49,969
Wasn't it one minute long?

2442
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:53,838
(Uie is done with her first full sparring.)

2443
01:29:53,839 --> 01:29:57,548
It was my very first full sparring...

2444
01:29:57,549 --> 01:29:59,049
- with her. - Right.

2445
01:29:59,249 --> 01:30:01,019
The intensity was different.

2446
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:02,778
- She was strong. - Too strong.

2447
01:30:02,779 --> 01:30:03,888
Honestly,

2448
01:30:03,889 --> 01:30:05,649
there were moments when I wanted to give up.

2449
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:08,519
But I found myself keeping my eyes on her.

2450
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:11,358
- I felt intimidated, - Right.

2451
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:13,028
But still tried to throw punches.

2452
01:30:13,029 --> 01:30:14,228
When was that?

2453
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:16,198
When did you feel intimidated?

2454
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:17,398
After the flurry of punches,

2455
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:18,399
she glared at me.

2456
01:30:18,599 --> 01:30:20,399
I took many hits,

2457
01:30:20,569 --> 01:30:22,469
but still tried to keep my eyes on her.

2458
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:25,139
(Ju Jung In threw consecutive punches, )

2459
01:30:25,369 --> 01:30:26,808
(followed by...)

2460
01:30:26,809 --> 01:30:28,739
(a fierce glare.)

2461
01:30:29,379 --> 01:30:31,649
(Determined not to back down, Uie glared back.)

2462
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:34,718
Because she's tall,

2463
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:35,748
her one-twos...

2464
01:30:35,749 --> 01:30:37,118
hit really hard.

2465
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:38,389
- Really? - Yes.

2466
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:39,518
That's a first.

2467
01:30:39,519 --> 01:30:41,218
Is that so? Your punches hurt a lot.

2468
01:30:41,219 --> 01:30:42,419
- Really? - Yes.

2469
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,458
The intensity of her one-twos...

2470
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:46,189
was the same in both Rounds 1 and 2.

2471
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:47,729
She clearly has great stamina.

2472
01:30:47,799 --> 01:30:49,598
Here's what surprised me a bit.

2473
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:51,975
I wasn't sure how good she'd be after just two months of training.

2474
01:30:51,999 --> 01:30:54,669
But her balance was better than I expected.

2475
01:30:54,869 --> 01:30:56,198
Her ability to throw punches so well...

2476
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:57,738
- Thank you. - caught me off guard.

2477
01:30:57,739 --> 01:31:00,209
She put on her 1st boxing gloves just 2 months ago.

2478
01:31:00,379 --> 01:31:01,738
And this was her first full sparring session.

2479
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:03,878
- She's a fighter. - Thank you.

2480
01:31:03,879 --> 01:31:05,349
Jung In...

2481
01:31:05,609 --> 01:31:06,648
is great at throwing flurries of punches.

2482
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:08,048
- Right? - I was shocked.

2483
01:31:08,049 --> 01:31:10,218
She still needs more practice...

2484
01:31:10,219 --> 01:31:12,518
- I got scared. - responding to flurries.

2485
01:31:12,519 --> 01:31:13,818
Working on...

2486
01:31:13,819 --> 01:31:16,758
defense and moving out after the punches would help a lot.

2487
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:18,229
- You felt that, right? - Yes.

2488
01:31:18,329 --> 01:31:20,158
Still, you kept throwing punches consistently.

2489
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,599
There were many moments when your one-two timing was perfect.

2490
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:23,768
Your effort...

2491
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:24,928
to out-box...

2492
01:31:24,929 --> 01:31:26,499
using your height was impressive.

2493
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:30,268
Uie's footwork was rushed.

2494
01:31:30,269 --> 01:31:32,868
You should have kept calm and maintained proper footwork.

2495
01:31:32,869 --> 01:31:35,179
That's the only area that needs improvement.

2496
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:36,548
What I really envied was,

2497
01:31:36,549 --> 01:31:38,555
- "Concentrate on number 1." - "Concentrate on number 1."

2498
01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:40,049
That was so cool.

2499
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:41,819
She didn't need up to number eight.

2500
01:31:42,649 --> 01:31:44,089
(Uie, concentrate on number 1!)

2501
01:31:45,319 --> 01:31:47,889
(Uie's strength is her long reach.)

2502
01:31:48,259 --> 01:31:50,789
(Her one-two alone is menacing enough.)

2503
01:31:51,729 --> 01:31:54,529
(She can attack and defend with just the one-two.)

2504
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:57,228
It's an essential technique that everyone must learn.

2505
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:59,528
She must make it her specialty.

2506
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:00,969
It's already her specialty.

2507
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:03,539
I even wrote "One-two, Uie!" on her gloves.

2508
01:32:04,609 --> 01:32:05,938
It's one-two.

2509
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:07,409
- Number one is one-two. - One, two.

2510
01:32:07,539 --> 01:32:09,039
Great work.

2511
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,608
- Good job. - You were amazing.

2512
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:13,348
- You were great. - That was cool.

2513
01:32:13,349 --> 01:32:15,478
Hey, One-Two Uie.

2514
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:19,049
All right. Keum Sae Rok and Jeong Da I, step into the ring.

2515
01:32:20,219 --> 01:32:21,418
- You're confident, right? - Yes.

2516
01:32:21,419 --> 01:32:23,259
Good. Don't worry.

2517
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:25,519
All I need to do is stick to what the coach taught me.

2518
01:32:25,629 --> 01:32:26,729
Don't get frightened.

2519
01:32:27,099 --> 01:32:28,559
- Stay calm. - Yes, sir.

2520
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:30,198
- There's no need to rush. - Okay.

2521
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:31,805
- Watch your opponent's moves first. - Okay.

2522
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,439
- Tease her with your jabs. - Got it.

2523
01:32:34,699 --> 01:32:35,798
(Glancing)

2524
01:32:35,799 --> 01:32:38,169
- She's tall too. - Right?

2525
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:40,478
(Worried about Sae Rok's long reach)

2526
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:41,879
- She's too tall. - Block her jabs.

2527
01:32:42,039 --> 01:32:43,609
- We're not worried about her. - True.

2528
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:46,278
Relax, okay?

2529
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:47,518
(Sae Rok is ready to fight.)

2530
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:49,649
Fighters, to the center.

2531
01:32:50,849 --> 01:32:52,148
It's the last match.

2532
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:53,418
(Keum Sae Rok, the Iron Girls' last fighter)

2533
01:32:53,419 --> 01:32:55,188
You've watched the previous fights, right?

2534
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:56,429
Touch gloves.

2535
01:32:56,559 --> 01:32:57,929
- Go. - Good luck, Keum Sae Rok!

2536
01:32:58,459 --> 01:32:59,559
I have faith in you.

2537
01:33:00,859 --> 01:33:01,859
Okay.

2538
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:03,469
Okay?

2539
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:05,529
Box.

2540
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:07,269
(Round 1 begins.)

2541
01:33:08,099 --> 01:33:09,169
Good luck.

2542
01:33:12,809 --> 01:33:14,208
(Feeling out the opponent while gauging the distance)

2543
01:33:14,209 --> 01:33:15,279
Aim well.

2544
01:33:17,909 --> 01:33:19,679
(Coming in as Sae Rok attempts a parry)

2545
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:21,379
That's her style.

2546
01:33:21,579 --> 01:33:22,948
She fights like that.

2547
01:33:22,949 --> 01:33:25,389
The opponent comes in with a powerful rear-hand hook.

2548
01:33:27,419 --> 01:33:30,029
(A hook from an unfamiliar angle)

2549
01:33:30,589 --> 01:33:31,789
That's her style.

2550
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:34,958
(Taken aback)

2551
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:37,599
- Read your opponent. - With a powerful rear-hand hook.

2552
01:33:38,329 --> 01:33:41,569
(Sae Rok can't easily close in against the strong hook.)

2553
01:33:41,969 --> 01:33:43,408
Take a step.

2554
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,169
- Yes, that's it. - Yes, a left hook.

2555
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,408
(A reflexive hook from the opponent)

2556
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:49,279
Yes, follow it up with a left hook. Again.

2557
01:33:50,409 --> 01:33:53,049
Her punches are strong. She packs a punch.

2558
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:56,219
(Sae Rok searches for the moment to make a valid strike.)

2559
01:33:56,449 --> 01:33:57,449
Go for it.

2560
01:33:58,789 --> 01:34:01,089
Punch. That's it.

2561
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:02,519
Yes, nice.

2562
01:34:02,619 --> 01:34:03,629
(Parrying)

2563
01:34:04,589 --> 01:34:06,059
(Dodging the opponent's long hook)

2564
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:07,959
(Trying to attack right away)

2565
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:11,598
(Sae Rok responds to the hook...)

2566
01:34:11,599 --> 01:34:14,539
(with a jab.)

2567
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:17,238
Well done, Sae Rok. You're doing great.

2568
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:19,709
Well done. Strike first. Hit her before she does.

2569
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:21,079
Exactly.

2570
01:34:22,039 --> 01:34:23,208
(Feint)

2571
01:34:23,209 --> 01:34:25,178
Footwork. Exactly. One more time.

2572
01:34:25,179 --> 01:34:26,279
(Trying a straight)

2573
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:28,249
- Keep the footwork going. - One strong punch.

2574
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,389
You don't have to back up.

2575
01:34:31,489 --> 01:34:32,788
(The two fighters face off again.)

2576
01:34:32,789 --> 01:34:33,859
- Yes. - Okay.

2577
01:34:34,819 --> 01:34:36,559
(They land valid strikes at the same time.)

2578
01:34:37,859 --> 01:34:39,029
(Sae Rok's straight)

2579
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:41,929
(The opponent's right hook)

2580
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:43,629
It's a battle of heavy punches.

2581
01:34:43,799 --> 01:34:46,129
A strong punch after you line up a shot.

2582
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:48,538
Stop her jabs.

2583
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:50,709
Long reaches. Keep watching her.

2584
01:34:50,909 --> 01:34:52,369
- Go for it. - Move in.

2585
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:55,738
(A jab following a parry)

2586
01:34:55,739 --> 01:34:57,849
Yes. Now that you're landing your punches well,

2587
01:34:58,079 --> 01:34:59,308
she can't respond.

2588
01:34:59,309 --> 01:35:00,478
Okay. Stay calm.

2589
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:03,449
(Aiming at the opponent again)

2590
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:06,089
Reach out!

2591
01:35:06,349 --> 01:35:08,159
(The opponent lands a successful long hook.)

2592
01:35:08,889 --> 01:35:09,889
(Valid strike)

2593
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,429
Yes.

2594
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:12,958
- That's it. - Counterattack.

2595
01:35:12,959 --> 01:35:14,629
Hit her first. One more time.

2596
01:35:15,029 --> 01:35:16,129
Watch before you go in.

2597
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,928
(Looking for the opponent's opening)

2598
01:35:17,929 --> 01:35:19,569
- That's it. - Nice shot.

2599
01:35:19,969 --> 01:35:23,839
(Sae Rok quickly lands a successful attack.)

2600
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,968
- Okay, good. - Stop.

2601
01:35:25,969 --> 01:35:27,278
(Round 1 ends.)

2602
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:28,279
She's got good jabs.

2603
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:32,009
Good job.

2604
01:35:32,379 --> 01:35:33,879
You can throw more punches.

2605
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,549
From what I can see, the opponent...

2606
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:39,429
throws a hook every time you move in.

2607
01:35:39,519 --> 01:35:41,288
She counters whenever you throw a one-two.

2608
01:35:41,289 --> 01:35:42,289
What should you do?

2609
01:35:42,759 --> 01:35:48,458
(The opponent waits for Sae Rok's attack and responds with a hook.)

2610
01:35:48,459 --> 01:35:50,668
The opponent is waiting for your one-two.

2611
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:52,528
She counters whenever you throw a one-two.

2612
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:53,599
What should you do?

2613
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:56,139
Wait for her hook before you throw your punches.

2614
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:58,169
(Earlier in Round 1)

2615
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:02,139
(The opponent reacted to Sae Rok's feint.)

2616
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:03,979
(Take the lead.)

2617
01:36:04,579 --> 01:36:07,619
(But since she hesitated for a moment, )

2618
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:10,489
(her attack was blocked.)

2619
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:12,648
(Counter when the opponent throws a hook)

2620
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:14,389
Duck, okay? You must duck.

2621
01:36:14,859 --> 01:36:17,058
She's got a good hook and straight, right?

2622
01:36:17,059 --> 01:36:20,049
I've never been hit in the nose before.

2623
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:24,528
Okay.

2624
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,168
She's got a long reach, right?

2625
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:28,469
The opponent is waiting for your counter.

2626
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,369
Move in before she strikes.

2627
01:36:30,539 --> 01:36:31,968
Throw a hook after you move in.

2628
01:36:31,969 --> 01:36:33,279
Do the jab, jab, cross.

2629
01:36:34,279 --> 01:36:35,378
Jab, okay?

2630
01:36:35,379 --> 01:36:37,509
(This round is all about timing.)

2631
01:36:37,809 --> 01:36:39,979
(Round 2 begins.)

2632
01:36:41,579 --> 01:36:42,678
(Will Sae Rok take the lead?)

2633
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:44,119
The last minute and 30 seconds.

2634
01:36:46,789 --> 01:36:47,819
Yes.

2635
01:36:49,489 --> 01:36:52,429
(A heavy hook swings in again.)

2636
01:36:55,629 --> 01:36:56,668
It's okay.

2637
01:36:56,669 --> 01:36:59,398
(While hesitating at the opponent's hook timing)

2638
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:00,669
(Valid strike)

2639
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:02,839
It's okay.

2640
01:37:03,309 --> 01:37:06,979
(It's hard to find the right time to attack.)

2641
01:37:09,479 --> 01:37:12,279
- Punch hard. - Don't throw strikes mindlessly.

2642
01:37:12,449 --> 01:37:13,679
Your legs aren't moving.

2643
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:16,748
Don't throw strikes mindlessly.

2644
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:18,149
Your legs aren't moving.

2645
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:20,659
Do your footwork. Stick to your style.

2646
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:22,288
You're doing well.

2647
01:37:22,289 --> 01:37:23,929
- Slip it in. - Hit her first.

2648
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:26,559
Block her.

2649
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:27,958
(Sae Rok allowed...)

2650
01:37:27,959 --> 01:37:30,768
(a hook combo after her jab.)

2651
01:37:30,769 --> 01:37:33,029
The opponent is seizing the opportunity first.

2652
01:37:34,469 --> 01:37:36,269
- Block her. You must block her. - Yes.

2653
01:37:37,609 --> 01:37:39,509
(Valid strike)

2654
01:37:40,279 --> 01:37:41,508
(Valid strike)

2655
01:37:41,509 --> 01:37:42,879
Block her with confidence.

2656
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:45,049
Block her with confidence. Keep your head down.

2657
01:37:45,749 --> 01:37:47,619
The last 30 seconds. Go all out.

2658
01:37:47,749 --> 01:37:48,779
Give it your all.

2659
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:53,319
(Feeling each other out, looking for an opening)

2660
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:55,889
You can do it!

2661
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:57,458
- Go in. - You can do it!

2662
01:37:57,459 --> 01:37:58,859
- Go in! - That's it.

2663
01:37:58,929 --> 01:38:00,129
- Right way. Yes. - Yes.

2664
01:38:00,429 --> 01:38:01,829
- Right way. Yes. - That's it.

2665
01:38:03,099 --> 01:38:06,199
(Countering the opponent's hook with a one-two)

2666
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:09,468
(Throwing another one-two perfectly)

2667
01:38:09,469 --> 01:38:10,808
- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.

2668
01:38:10,809 --> 01:38:12,808
There are only ten seconds left. Move in fast.

2669
01:38:12,809 --> 01:38:13,838
Move in.

2670
01:38:13,839 --> 01:38:15,679
- Ten seconds. Move in. - Give it your all.

2671
01:38:16,579 --> 01:38:18,979
(Exchanging blows until the very end)

2672
01:38:20,349 --> 01:38:23,818
(Sae Rok keeps throwing punches even while taking hits.)

2673
01:38:23,819 --> 01:38:25,089
Give it your all.

2674
01:38:25,549 --> 01:38:27,219
- Give it your all. - Good.

2675
01:38:27,419 --> 01:38:29,289
- Stop. - Okay.

2676
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:30,929
Great work.

2677
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:35,799
Great job.

2678
01:38:38,169 --> 01:38:44,009
(Sae Rok stayed composed and saw the fight through.)

2679
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:46,469
Today's last sparring has ended.

2680
01:38:46,809 --> 01:38:49,379
It was different from the previous fights.

2681
01:38:49,609 --> 01:38:52,649
Until now, the fighters have been trading blows constantly.

2682
01:38:52,809 --> 01:38:55,579
But this time, each relied on one big weapon.

2683
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,088
It's as if they were loaded...

2684
01:38:57,089 --> 01:38:59,688
- and ready to punch. - Exactly.

2685
01:38:59,689 --> 01:39:00,689
What did you think?

2686
01:39:00,919 --> 01:39:02,888
- Her arms are so long. - I see.

2687
01:39:02,889 --> 01:39:04,528
They are too long.

2688
01:39:04,529 --> 01:39:05,829
(Smiling)

2689
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:08,629
I was going to counter with a cross,

2690
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:11,799
but she threw one at the same time. I was like, "Wait, what?"

2691
01:39:13,269 --> 01:39:16,169
(She jabbed as the opponent attacked...)

2692
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:20,509
(and instantly followed with a straight.)

2693
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:24,049
It felt like she was waiting for me to throw a one-two.

2694
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:26,849
I wanted to take the lead and move in.

2695
01:39:26,949 --> 01:39:29,049
- Right. - But that wasn't easy at all.

2696
01:39:29,249 --> 01:39:32,048
Our plan was to use the straight against her.

2697
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:34,988
During Round Two, she noticed our plan...

2698
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:37,088
and tried to counter it.

2699
01:39:37,089 --> 01:39:39,458
But Da I has been boxing for longer, so she landed more punches.

2700
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:40,998
I think that was the case.

2701
01:39:40,999 --> 01:39:41,999
You're right.

2702
01:39:43,059 --> 01:39:45,698
(Sae Rok's first actual sparring results:)

2703
01:39:45,699 --> 01:39:49,868
(Pulling the punch back as if loading it)

2704
01:39:49,869 --> 01:39:54,679
(Converting into quick, compact punches, powered by her hips)

2705
01:39:55,009 --> 01:39:58,748
(Strengths: Maintaining distance with jabs)

2706
01:39:58,749 --> 01:40:04,049
(Timing attacks using her footwork)

2707
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:09,988
(Points to improve on: Lacking combo follow-ups after the one-two)

2708
01:40:09,989 --> 01:40:14,429
(Must vary attack patterns more)

2709
01:40:14,829 --> 01:40:17,368
It felt like she gave me a clear mission.

2710
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:19,498
I'll work hard on studying...

2711
01:40:19,499 --> 01:40:22,338
how to dodge new patterns and counter them.

2712
01:40:22,339 --> 01:40:24,809
Next time, I'll make sure to use those techniques.

2713
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,639
Today, we had a meaningful time...

2714
01:40:27,809 --> 01:40:30,349
- before the competition. - Yes.

2715
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:32,908
Thank you for sparring with us beginners.

2716
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:34,949
- But you're not beginners. - No.

2717
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:36,849
I heard you were going to drop by, In Ah.

2718
01:40:37,049 --> 01:40:38,089
Yes.

2719
01:40:38,989 --> 01:40:41,018
I'll train hard for every hit I took today.

2720
01:40:41,019 --> 01:40:42,059
(I'll get my revenge.)

2721
01:40:42,089 --> 01:40:45,459
Thank you for joining our important sparring session.

2722
01:40:46,189 --> 01:40:47,198
I was genuinely shocked.

2723
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:48,759
Your punches were really painful.

2724
01:40:49,029 --> 01:40:51,899
Keep going with your one, two, hook,

2725
01:40:52,029 --> 01:40:53,699
- and you can win. - Really?

2726
01:40:54,099 --> 01:40:55,099
I'll win for sure!

2727
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,308
If you keep training like this,

2728
01:40:57,309 --> 01:41:00,538
you can definitely win.

2729
01:41:00,539 --> 01:41:02,138
- Even if you competed right now, - Yes?

2730
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:03,908
- you'd be flawless. - I see.

2731
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:05,348
But keep working hard...

2732
01:41:05,349 --> 01:41:07,418
and aim to win the next competition.

2733
01:41:07,419 --> 01:41:09,579
Take that same fierce look in your eyes...

2734
01:41:09,879 --> 01:41:11,989
to the competition.

2735
01:41:12,389 --> 01:41:14,119
- Got it. - Good job.

2736
01:41:14,559 --> 01:41:15,618
- KO! - KO!

2737
01:41:15,619 --> 01:41:18,629
- Iron Girls! - Iron Girls!

2738
01:41:18,759 --> 01:41:20,629
- Thank you. - Great work today.

2739
01:41:21,059 --> 01:41:23,429
(Well done, everyone!)

2740
01:41:32,109 --> 01:41:34,909
(After the first actual sparring)

2741
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:37,709
(How was the first sparring?)

2742
01:41:39,749 --> 01:41:40,818
It's on another level.

2743
01:41:40,819 --> 01:41:42,978
I thought, "It's so different from the supervised sparring."

2744
01:41:42,979 --> 01:41:44,289
"That person is here..."

2745
01:41:44,519 --> 01:41:46,489
"to do her thing."

2746
01:41:46,789 --> 01:41:48,659
My ears are still ringing.

2747
01:41:49,589 --> 01:41:52,789
Each punch was so powerful.

2748
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:58,598
(The intensity of the punch was something...)

2749
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:01,739
(she had never experienced.)

2750
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:03,708
I know what to do.

2751
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:04,808
Punch downward...

2752
01:42:04,809 --> 01:42:05,968
and use a feint...

2753
01:42:05,969 --> 01:42:08,079
in order to attack.

2754
01:42:08,179 --> 01:42:09,679
I know the theory.

2755
01:42:10,209 --> 01:42:14,618
(But the actual sparring was different from theory.)

2756
01:42:14,619 --> 01:42:16,018
"What do I need to do now?"

2757
01:42:16,019 --> 01:42:18,448
"What do I need to do to throw this boxer off?"

2758
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:19,518
"How can I throw a punch?"

2759
01:42:19,519 --> 01:42:20,695
I couldn't do the things I could do well.

2760
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:21,959
My footwork was a mess.

2761
01:42:22,989 --> 01:42:24,158
I thought, "I need to survive."

2762
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,719
"It'll be bad if I take another punch."

2763
01:42:26,289 --> 01:42:27,359
I wanted to quit.

2764
01:42:27,629 --> 01:42:28,828
I wanted to run away.

2765
01:42:28,829 --> 01:42:30,469
(I wanted to quit. I wanted to run away.)

2766
01:42:30,529 --> 01:42:31,868
As for me...

2767
01:42:31,869 --> 01:42:33,028
(And...)

2768
01:42:33,029 --> 01:42:34,239
Seriously,

2769
01:42:34,569 --> 01:42:36,598
whenever I do something,

2770
01:42:36,599 --> 01:42:38,068
(She had many thoughts after sparring.)

2771
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:39,509
I give it my best.

2772
01:42:39,869 --> 01:42:42,939
In swimming, my time became better.

2773
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:45,248
Moving forward for 800m or 1,500m...

2774
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:46,548
suddenly became easier.

2775
01:42:46,549 --> 01:42:47,879
Marathon was the same.

2776
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:49,479
When I kept running,

2777
01:42:50,249 --> 01:42:51,689
my time became better.

2778
01:42:51,819 --> 01:42:53,218
After months of effort,

2779
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:56,159
I could see the results with my own eyes.

2780
01:42:57,159 --> 01:42:59,688
"I knew that I could do it. I can do anything."

2781
01:42:59,689 --> 01:43:01,169
"I can do anything I put my mind to."

2782
01:43:01,529 --> 01:43:05,969
(Uie even overcame cycling, something she was afraid of.)

2783
01:43:06,429 --> 01:43:08,838
But saying, "Let's give it a go," doesn't work...

2784
01:43:08,839 --> 01:43:10,608
(But saying, "Let's give it a go," doesn't work...)

2785
01:43:10,609 --> 01:43:12,269
when it comes to boxing.

2786
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:17,049
No matter how hard I jump rope...

2787
01:43:17,509 --> 01:43:20,679
and practice the routines from 1 to 8 continuously...

2788
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:25,218
The moment I enter the ring,

2789
01:43:25,219 --> 01:43:26,749
(The moment she enters the ring, )

2790
01:43:27,059 --> 01:43:28,758
nothing works.

2791
01:43:28,759 --> 01:43:30,728
(she feels like her efforts disappear.)

2792
01:43:30,729 --> 01:43:32,659
Nothing works, so I think,

2793
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:34,828
"Where do I start over?"

2794
01:43:34,829 --> 01:43:37,629
"Seriously, where do I start over?"

2795
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:39,698
"What have I done in the past two months?"

2796
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:41,699
("What have I done in the past two months?")

2797
01:43:42,799 --> 01:43:45,285
To be honest, it's not the fear of the approaching competition.

2798
01:43:45,309 --> 01:43:47,208
My boxing skills that don't improve...

2799
01:43:47,209 --> 01:43:48,408
give me a harder time.

2800
01:43:48,409 --> 01:43:50,049
(Helplessness and frustration crush Uie.)

2801
01:43:50,179 --> 01:43:51,709
I can't see it with my eyes.

2802
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:53,818
That's...

2803
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:55,579
(She can't see the result of her hard work.)

2804
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:57,248
boxing.

2805
01:43:57,249 --> 01:43:59,329
(That's why it's more painful to challenge herself.)

2806
01:44:00,019 --> 01:44:01,758
Despite everything,

2807
01:44:01,759 --> 01:44:04,028
I'll enter the ring again.

2808
01:44:04,029 --> 01:44:05,158
(The reason she'll enter the ring again)

2809
01:44:05,159 --> 01:44:07,959
I don't think I'll ever forget that punch.

2810
01:44:08,859 --> 01:44:11,598
When my punch landed on the opponent's face,

2811
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:12,868
I was like,

2812
01:44:12,869 --> 01:44:16,438
"What?" That feeling was so strong.

2813
01:44:16,439 --> 01:44:18,145
(The skills she learned became hers and gave her a moment of awe.)

2814
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:19,849
It was satisfying. I thought, "It worked."

2815
01:44:20,039 --> 01:44:21,509
"It worked."

2816
01:44:21,739 --> 01:44:23,338
When I enter the ring,

2817
01:44:23,339 --> 01:44:25,309
miscellaneous thoughts disappear.

2818
01:44:25,409 --> 01:44:27,478
Only one goal enters my mind.

2819
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:29,318
"I'll beat that person!"

2820
01:44:29,319 --> 01:44:30,749
(I'll beat that person!)

2821
01:44:31,319 --> 01:44:32,319
It's fun.

2822
01:44:33,089 --> 01:44:35,388
It's fun when I take a punch and become annoyed.

2823
01:44:35,389 --> 01:44:36,858
It's fun when I take a punch...

2824
01:44:36,859 --> 01:44:38,028
and think that I learned a lesson.

2825
01:44:38,029 --> 01:44:39,965
(She learned that it was fun to throw and take punches.)

2826
01:44:39,989 --> 01:44:42,999
When I pour in all of my strength...

2827
01:44:43,099 --> 01:44:45,428
and feel like my heart is about to burst...

2828
01:44:45,429 --> 01:44:46,728
from fighting until the end,

2829
01:44:46,729 --> 01:44:47,938
it's satisfying.

2830
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:49,268
When I lie down...

2831
01:44:49,269 --> 01:44:50,868
as my breath comes out raggedly...

2832
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:51,938
(A sense of satisfaction comes at the end.)

2833
01:44:51,939 --> 01:44:54,379
There really is joy.

2834
01:44:54,979 --> 01:44:57,078
I can feel that my energy is changing,

2835
01:44:57,079 --> 01:44:59,148
so boxing is fun.

2836
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:00,748
I think it's the charm of boxing.

2837
01:45:00,749 --> 01:45:01,848
(She's beginning to learn the charm of boxing.)

2838
01:45:01,849 --> 01:45:03,478
I can't help but feel nervous.

2839
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:05,088
I can't help but feel pressured.

2840
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:06,148
I can't help...

2841
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:08,258
but worry about possible injuries.

2842
01:45:08,259 --> 01:45:09,288
However,

2843
01:45:09,289 --> 01:45:10,989
the die is cast.

2844
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:13,658
Being on Iron Girls, I often thought,

2845
01:45:13,659 --> 01:45:15,158
"Do we need to go that far?"

2846
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:17,229
"Do we need to exercise that much?"

2847
01:45:17,929 --> 01:45:19,498
I had that thought so many times.

2848
01:45:19,499 --> 01:45:21,498
It really isn't an easy show.

2849
01:45:21,499 --> 01:45:23,738
It's a documentary.

2850
01:45:23,739 --> 01:45:25,308
It really isn't a variety show.

2851
01:45:25,309 --> 01:45:27,439
It really isn't a variety show, to be honest.

2852
01:45:28,309 --> 01:45:29,379
However,

2853
01:45:29,839 --> 01:45:32,679
you need to do that much to get better.

2854
01:45:32,809 --> 01:45:33,818
I felt it...

2855
01:45:33,819 --> 01:45:35,249
when my stamina improved.

2856
01:45:35,379 --> 01:45:36,419
I...

2857
01:45:37,149 --> 01:45:38,319
witnessed it.

2858
01:45:39,589 --> 01:45:41,689
It can't be helped. There is no other answer.

2859
01:45:42,089 --> 01:45:44,058
Unless you practice like crazy,

2860
01:45:44,059 --> 01:45:45,288
(Unless you practice like crazy, you can't change.)

2861
01:45:45,289 --> 01:45:46,529
you can't change.

2862
01:45:46,759 --> 01:45:49,828
If I continue practicing diligently, it'll work out.

2863
01:45:49,829 --> 01:45:51,429
If I continue practicing diligently...

2864
01:45:51,499 --> 01:45:53,269
I could lose. But even if I lose,

2865
01:45:53,369 --> 01:45:55,369
I want to have a loss that isn't embarrassing.

2866
01:45:55,399 --> 01:45:57,638
I want to have a match that isn't embarrassing.

2867
01:45:57,639 --> 01:46:01,079
I want to have a match that isn't embarrassing to myself.

2868
01:46:01,539 --> 01:46:02,708
I've always been...

2869
01:46:02,709 --> 01:46:04,449
a slow person.

2870
01:46:05,509 --> 01:46:06,979
So I need to take...

2871
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:09,219
one step at a time.

2872
01:46:10,179 --> 01:46:12,488
I'll need to have 500 sparring sessions...

2873
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:14,689
before the first competition...

2874
01:46:15,289 --> 01:46:17,229
in order to overcome my fear.

2875
01:46:17,489 --> 01:46:19,088
I'll show what I can do.

2876
01:46:19,089 --> 01:46:20,729
(I'll show what I can do.)

2877
01:46:20,929 --> 01:46:21,929
I'm busy.

2878
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,229
I need to go and train.

2879
01:46:27,297 --> 01:46:29,567
(They look like main characters in a youthful movie.)

2880
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:31,776
(Where are the girls at?)

2881
01:46:31,777 --> 01:46:34,077
(Iron Girls in Gapyeong)

2882
01:46:34,507 --> 01:46:36,077
(However, )

2883
01:46:36,377 --> 01:46:38,917
(having fun isn't easy.)

2884
01:46:39,147 --> 01:46:41,187
(Is this the Iron Girls' way of having a vacation?)

2885
01:46:41,547 --> 01:46:44,257
(Today is the day they have fun in the water.)

2886
01:46:44,557 --> 01:46:46,517
(From a heavy tube that weighs 2.5kg...)

2887
01:46:47,017 --> 01:46:49,027
(to underwater sparring!)

2888
01:46:49,327 --> 01:46:51,487
(It's hard to tell if their laughter is fake or real.)

2889
01:46:51,557 --> 01:46:53,257
(Will Iron Girls' vacation...)

2890
01:46:53,627 --> 01:46:55,127
(end safely?)

2891
01:46:55,697 --> 01:46:57,367
(The time has come!)

2892
01:46:57,667 --> 01:46:59,067
In Ah, hold out.

2893
01:46:59,637 --> 01:47:01,306
Use a feint.

2894
01:47:01,307 --> 01:47:04,067
("A match you should pay to watch," Kim Dong Hyun)

2895
01:47:04,507 --> 01:47:06,237
Corner her!

2896
01:47:06,737 --> 01:47:08,376
I think we'll see blood today.

2897
01:47:08,377 --> 01:47:09,977
They'll keep going until they see blood.

2898
01:47:10,177 --> 01:47:12,647
("Tension that belongs in the finals," Kim Ji Hoon)

2899
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:15,517
(The competition is around the corner.)

2900
01:47:15,717 --> 01:47:18,717
(The second full sparring for the members' growth)

2901
01:47:19,157 --> 01:47:21,056
(Against opponents who are much faster...)

2902
01:47:21,057 --> 01:47:23,687
(and much stronger, )

2903
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:27,057
(they have movie-like matches.)

2904
01:47:27,397 --> 01:47:29,567
(Iron Girls are as serious as ever.)

2905
01:47:29,827 --> 01:47:33,537
(There's a rush of dopamine and adrenaline.)

2906
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,007
(What will be the result of the breathtaking match?)

2907
01:47:36,567 --> 01:47:38,576
(The mission is revealed on the board.)

2908
01:47:38,577 --> 01:47:40,237
Do...

2909
01:47:40,507 --> 01:47:42,706
(The unexpected mission changes up the atmosphere.)

2910
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:45,147
Is there someone else you want to talk to?

2911
01:47:45,477 --> 01:47:46,747
It's such a funny situation.

2912
01:47:47,247 --> 01:47:49,146
(What happened after the mission got revealed?)

2913
01:47:49,147 --> 01:47:51,057
(Date My Friend)
