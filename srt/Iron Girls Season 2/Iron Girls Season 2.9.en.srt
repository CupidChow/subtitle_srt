1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:11,318
(Cool waves welcome people...)

2
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:14,688
(at the relaxing beach.)

3
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,127
(Which place did the Iron Girls visit?)

4
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:20,328
(Cheering)

5
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,457
Hello.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,968
(Making a big fuss)

7
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,168
(The Iron Girls are especially excited.)

8
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,537
- Hello. - This is great.

9
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:31,867
- Isn't it like a foreign country? - Yes.

10
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:34,137
We're in a foreign country.

11
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,608
Welcome to Phuket.

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:39,348
- It's my first time in Phuket. - I love it.

13
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:43,278
(Iron Girls in Phuket, Thailand)

14
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:50,488
(The center of Southeast Asia, Thailand)

15
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:59,598
(Phuket is a vacation spot that represents Thailand.)

16
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:07,768
(What are the Iron Girls doing in Phuket?)

17
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:09,207
It's so cool.

18
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,537
We aren't in Korea.

19
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,247
- Isn't it great to be at the sea? - It's totally cool.

20
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:13,878
We really are in a foreign country.

21
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,577
It's totally cool.

22
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:16,777
- Aren't we going to play? - What?

23
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:17,778
Aren't we going to play?

24
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,417
(That's right. We came all the way to Phuket.)

25
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,087
This is what I want to tell you guys.

26
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:25,788
We came here to play. Why are we here?

27
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:28,458
(Will it be the first vacation for the Iron Girls?)

28
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,928
We came here to play,

29
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,678
but you might run out of breath a bit.

30
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:35,037
You might put something on your hands.

31
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,067
You might put something on like gloves.

32
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,567
But you can play.

33
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:42,538
However, you have 10 days until your 1st competition.

34
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,278
Your 1st competition is in 10 days.

35
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:45,707
I'm scared.

36
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,508
- Okay. Let's just train. - That's right.

37
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,147
The thing is, Phuket...

38
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:50,417
- is well-known for Muay Thai. - Yes.

39
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:53,217
Thus, the sports infrastructure is great.

40
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:55,858
Athletes from all over the world come here.

41
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:57,918
Many martial arts athletes come here.

42
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:03,898
(When you think of Phuket, the emerald-colored beaches...)

43
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:09,768
(and the relaxing atmosphere of a vacation come to mind.)

44
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:16,008
(But there's a different side of Phuket.)

45
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:18,907
(Thanks to the weather that's warm all year round...)

46
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:20,548
(and good sports infrastructure, )

47
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:23,847
(Phuket is the go-to place for off-season training...)

48
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,218
(for martial arts athletes around the world.)

49
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:34,428
(Captain Dong Hyun visits the place often for training.)

50
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,898
Athletes set up a camp before a competition.

51
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,927
- "A camp?" - We need to train hard...

52
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,698
and have a good match.

53
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:47,238
Thus, the theme of this Phuket trip will be the Iron Boot Camp.

54
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,378
"Boot camp?"

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,807
(Boxers around the world...)

56
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:56,348
(challenged the Iron Girls.)

57
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,517
(With only 10 days remaining until the competition, )

58
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:00,418
(they will have their last full sparring.)

59
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:04,888
(There's no place to escape.)

60
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:08,088
(What will be the result of the fierce match?)

61
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:13,728
(And who is the special coach who visited them?)

62
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,768
(Is this a dream or reality?)

63
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:18,137
No way!

64
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,408
Will I be in the ring with her?

65
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:20,568
Am I ready for this?

66
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:25,148
(A meeting with a world-class boxer is coming soon.)

67
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,678
With the mindset of preparing for a war,

68
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:30,518
you must participate in the Iron Boot Camp.

69
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,388
Let's just train.

70
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:35,587
Iron Girls never give up!

71
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:37,017
That's right. Can you do well?

72
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,057
- Victory is ours! - Yes.

73
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,228
- Let's go! - Okay. That's good.

74
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,128
But what's up with your outfit today?

75
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,967
Are you going to plant rice?

76
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,268
- Rice planting. - Are you?

77
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:48,567
Sae Rok, your outfit stands out.

78
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,838
Please.

79
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,767
I thought we were going to farm.

80
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,438
- Is that so? - Yes!

81
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,808
Is there a reason why your socks are blue?

82
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,078
Wearing the color of my passion, blue,

83
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,207
I'll defeat the opponent in the red team!

84
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,247
- You'll destroy the red team? - Yes.

85
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:04,417
Here's the red team!

86
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,647
(The red cornder is here.)

87
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:08,117
(I'll defeat her.)

88
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,187
That's great.

89
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:10,557
- Captain Uie. - Yes!

90
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:11,627
What do you think?

91
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:12,988
Just give us food!

92
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,527
Tasty food!

93
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,627
I want to eat pu pad pong karee!

94
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:17,628
Same here!

95
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,067
As soon as you complete the mission,

96
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,668
tasty food will be provided at all times.

97
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,637
- All right! - Let's go!

98
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,568
Now, to the training location!

99
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:26,767
Let's move!

100
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:27,937
- Let's move! - Let's move!

101
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:28,978
Let's go!

102
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,637
- Run! One, two. - One, two.

103
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,208
One, two.

104
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:33,507
You aren't here to play.

105
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,778
We aren't here to play.

106
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,277
We aren't here to play, but we can be in a good mood.

107
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:38,818
Let's do this.

108
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:40,487
(What?)

109
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,757
- What's that? - What? What is it?

110
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,517
- What's that flag? - What?

111
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:44,887
(A mysterious skull flag)

112
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:45,958
What's that?

113
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,797
- Someone is standing there. - What?

114
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:49,897
- Who is that? - What?

115
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,097
(Who is standing there?)

116
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,267
- Who is that? - What?

117
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,368
Who is that?

118
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,337
Be faster, guys!

119
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,607
Let's go! Run!

120
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,307
- Be faster, guys! Let's go! Run! - I feel like we should run.

121
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,837
But she's a foreigner.

122
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,438
I feel like we should run.

123
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,277
Faster!

124
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:08,148
- Faster! - Faster!

125
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,778
- Run! - What's this?

126
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:11,917
(Why are there tires?)

127
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,018
What's this?

128
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:15,858
(There are tires with rope...)

129
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,228
(and equipment that shouldn't be on the beach.)

130
00:05:20,928 --> 00:05:23,898
(Something doesn't seem right.)

131
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,327
What's this?

132
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,068
(What's this?)

133
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,698
Hello.

134
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:32,507
- Hello. - Hello.

135
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,207
(Her charisma makes them stutter due to nervousness.)

136
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,877
Hi, my name is Jibby.

137
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,138
I'm a head coach at the Pirate Camp.

138
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:39,377
- "Pirate Camp?" - "Pirate Camp?"

139
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:40,478
What's this?

140
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,118
(Have you heard of exercising abroad?)

141
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,887
Pirate Camp is a famous exercise program...

142
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,958
that takes place on the beaches of Phuket.

143
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:52,827
To participate in this camp,

144
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:55,357
fitness enthusiasts from all over the world...

145
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:56,527
come to Phuket.

146
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:59,044
(An extreme exercise program for the global fitness enthusiasts)

147
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,297
It's a fun program,

148
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,497
so the Iron Girls have to participate.

149
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,797
I'm scared.

150
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,337
Do you know why you're here today?

151
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,368
I want you guys to experience it today.

152
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,478
- We're in trouble. - Excited?

153
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,777
- Yes! - Yes!

154
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,047
Let's go.

155
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,977
Hold on. If I remember correctly,

156
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,817
a coach who speaks Korean is coming.

157
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,748
- Who? - Really?

158
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,317
Please come on in.

159
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:25,828
(Where?)

160
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:29,158
The coach who speaks Korean is here.

161
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,268
All right.

162
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,768
(Taking out)

163
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,498
(Putting on the pirate do-rag)

164
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,308
The coach who speaks Korean is here.

165
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:42,378
- Welcome. - Yes.

166
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:43,808
Welcome.

167
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,277
A big surprise.

168
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,817
- Yes. - I'm a coach.

169
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,647
I opened a gym in Phuket.

170
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,517
(The Cicada Gym opened in Phuket.)

171
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:53,747
I like the Cicada Gym.

172
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,847
- It's good, right? - Yes.

173
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,618
I'll assist Coach Jibby and join the program.

174
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,658
- Okay. - All right. Let's go.

175
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,127
People will come and join you guys.

176
00:07:03,128 --> 00:07:04,857
Is another team coming?

177
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,598
- Hold on a second. - Players, come on in.

178
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:09,298
Pirates, let's go!

179
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,168
(Oh, my)

180
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,567
Oh, my gosh.

181
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,208
- Run! - Oh, my gosh.

182
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:19,877
(Many healthy and muscular people enter.)

183
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:21,048
Look at their bodies.

184
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,717
(Sae Rok freezes and In Ah chuckles.)

185
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:23,878
- Hold on. - Gosh.

186
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,587
- Hello. - Hi.

187
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:28,087
It's so global.

188
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:29,188
How cool.

189
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:31,257
(These incredible people signed up for the Pirate Camp themselves.)

190
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:32,358
They're so fit.

191
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:34,088
- There's Aquaman too. - Yes.

192
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:36,357
(There's someone who looks like Aquaman.)

193
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:38,227
You participated in the fitness race...

194
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:39,327
- last time. - Yes.

195
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,528
This is the circuit training with similar vibes.

196
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:43,544
- Will we go around? - It's the circuit training.

197
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,768
The second is core training.

198
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,007
- A core training. - Also,

199
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,248
two people will make up a team.

200
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:49,977
If you're exhausted,

201
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:51,807
you can switch places with your teammate.

202
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,678
- There's a time limit. - Okay.

203
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:55,277
If you make it back on time,

204
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:56,678
you'll receive a gold medal.

205
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:58,017
- Yes. - I love that idea.

206
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,187
- Seriously, - Real gold?

207
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,417
It'll be like real gold.

208
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,747
- Okay. - Seriously.

209
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:02,857
That sounds good.

210
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,888
- I want it. - Okay.

211
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:05,457
(Pirate Camp)

212
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,528
(Circuit training)

213
00:08:06,588 --> 00:08:10,857
All right. Let's begin the circuit training in earnest.

214
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:11,928
- Okay. - That's good.

215
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:13,228
As you can see,

216
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:14,867
there are four sections,

217
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,537
- A, B, C, and D. - Okay.

218
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,837
Each section has three missions,

219
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:19,838
and...

220
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,307
you need to complete them in all four sections.

221
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,708
(They must complete all 4 courses.)

222
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,908
Let me explain the first one, Course A,

223
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,548
Run 200m while pulling a tire.

224
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:29,747
What?

225
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:30,977
(Running 200m while pulling a tire)

226
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,448
Start from the point with the flags.

227
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:34,987
You'll see flags in a distance.

228
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,457
Make a round trip.

229
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,957
Two members will pull a tire together.

230
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,028
Okay.

231
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:44,158
Then there's doing 60 deadlifts while holding a 16kg kettlebell.

232
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:46,168
Hold on. Did he say 60?

233
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,097
Then there's doing 60 burpees.

234
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,167
Touch the ground with your chest and do a standing jump.

235
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,268
No.

236
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:53,107
How will we do 60 burpees?

237
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,908
Then you'll be done with Course A.

238
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,138
And the second course...

239
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,908
Wait. Time out.

240
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,148
This is a fun exercise. What's that look on your face?

241
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,647
I just finished explaining the first one, Course A.

242
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:06,717
The look on your face...

243
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,017
You looked happy when you were warming up earlier.

244
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:11,388
Your face suddenly fell.

245
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,287
Guys, we have...

246
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:14,658
ten days until the competition.

247
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,057
This training will come in handy...

248
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,328
during the competition.

249
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,497
Also,

250
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:19,897
we took a six-hour flight to come here.

251
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:21,267
- That's right. - Let's make it worthwhile.

252
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,748
- Okay. - Let's do our absolute best.

253
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:25,707
(Course B)

254
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,367
(Course C)

255
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,737
(Course D)

256
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:30,808
That was a work of art.

257
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:34,308
This is the most needed training for boxing.

258
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,047
If you complete all missions in 35 minutes,

259
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:39,218
(The cutoff time: 35 minutes)

260
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,017
you'll receive a gold medal.

261
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:43,518
We can switch if we get a bit tired.

262
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:46,157
Divide into teams as you guys want.

263
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,087
Let's do it differently from the fitness race.

264
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,157
- Differently. - Then we're together.

265
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:50,478
- We're together. - Is this okay?

266
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,627
- That was easy. - Yes.

267
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,474
The two members who are standing together will be a team.

268
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:55,997
- Are you ready? - Are you ready?

269
00:09:55,998 --> 00:09:58,368
- Yes! - Yes!

270
00:09:58,438 --> 00:09:59,468
Okay.

271
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,568
I want to do it too. It's too bad.

272
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,428
They put the rope around the shoulder.

273
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,707
Stand by.

274
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,777
We start in ten seconds.

275
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:07,808
Ten seconds.

276
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,177
(Nervous)

277
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,547
All right. Let's move it.

278
00:10:10,548 --> 00:10:11,777
Are we ready?

279
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,147
- Yes! - Yes!

280
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:15,148
I can do it! We can do it!

281
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,417
(Iron Girls'...)

282
00:10:16,418 --> 00:10:17,787
(first training...)

283
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:18,957
(abroad)

284
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,488
Let's go.

285
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,758
(Running 200m while pulling a tire)

286
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,268
Let's go.

287
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:30,298
(They run at full speed.)

288
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:35,377
One straight line, guys. Let's go. Parking it there.

289
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:38,078
(They run as they pull a tire across the beach in Phuket.)

290
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,478
(It's the best feeling.)

291
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,648
Amazing.

292
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:44,077
That's good.

293
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,254
(They quickly pass the halfway point.)

294
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,287
Ju Hyun, are you okay?

295
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:47,318
I'm okay.

296
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,758
(They work with their partners...)

297
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,258
(and run energetically.)

298
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,527
- We're done. - Very good.

299
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,128
(They finish the first mission quickly.)

300
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,258
Next.

301
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,368
Shall I go first?

302
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,137
All right. Check the reps for each other.

303
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,768
Do it for your teammate.

304
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:09,638
(Do deadlifts with a 16kg kettlebell.)

305
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:14,748
(It's the training for strengthening the core.)

306
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,318
One,

307
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:17,948
two,

308
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,087
three, four...

309
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:22,988
(She maintains the pace she had in the beginning.)

310
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:24,917
Uie, will you do all of them? Let's do ten reps each.

311
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,028
You can do the burpees.

312
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,428
Get ready for the burpees.

313
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,497
Six...

314
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:33,368
(This is the class of Stamina Queen.)

315
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,738
In Ah, that's a great form.

316
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:37,814
You're doing it with the correct form.

317
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:41,068
(She has the perfect form.)

318
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:45,548
(In the other team, In Ah is doing the reps first.)

319
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:47,407
Sae Rok, get some rest.

320
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,478
We're doing burpees next.

321
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:53,347
(Leave the 16kg kettlebell to Strong In Ah.)

322
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:54,387
In Ah.

323
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:55,517
Jump.

324
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:56,588
Jump a bit.

325
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:58,688
- Three. - Jump a bit.

326
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,758
Let's do ten each.

327
00:12:01,158 --> 00:12:02,158
One.

328
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:07,168
(Doing 60 burpees)

329
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:11,638
(Ju Hyun does the burpees first.)

330
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:12,768
Five.

331
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:16,638
(When Ju Hyun gets tired, Uie switches places with her.)

332
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:20,078
(Grunting)

333
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,518
(Breathing hard)

334
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,947
Three.

335
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:25,247
(In Team Sae Rok and In Ah, )

336
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,088
(Exclaiming Rok begins with the burpees.)

337
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:31,717
- Five. - Five each.

338
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,857
(They switch places after 5 burpees.)

339
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,898
(They proceed with Course A without a hitch.)

340
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,467
Look over there.

341
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,028
The first team began Course B.

342
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,768
The second team began.

343
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:43,868
Next one.

344
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:46,368
When you finish your burpees, let's go.

345
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:47,508
Let's go.

346
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,538
- Go! - Let's go.

347
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:52,307
(Ju Hyun sets off with the treasure chest.)

348
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:53,908
Go together. Take turns frequently.

349
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:55,148
Treasure.

350
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:56,778
In Course B,

351
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,548
you will run 200m, carrying a 15kg treasure chest...

352
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:00,847
on your shoulder.

353
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,758
(Running 200m carrying a treasure chest)

354
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:05,787
Squat 80 times holding the 15kg treasure chest.

355
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,357
(Squatting 80 times holding a treasure chest)

356
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,998
Third, do 80 lunges while alternating legs.

357
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,067
You usually work out with sandbags or dumbbells,

358
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:15,567
so carrying a box like this...

359
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,274
makes you use different muscles than usual.

360
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,508
So this type of training can be helpful.

361
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,438
Slow down.

362
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,778
We're not in a rush.

363
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,278
Do you want me to carry it?

364
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:25,608
Give me that.

365
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,048
This is really heavy.

366
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:31,178
(It's okay. I'm the Stamina Queen.)

367
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,087
- Ju Hyun, follow me. - Uie.

368
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,588
(Running fast, following along)

369
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,618
- You're really fast. - Let's do this.

370
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:39,658
She still has a lot of energy left.

371
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:43,558
(Getting to the halfway point quickly)

372
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,158
Do you want to switch?

373
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,097
No. Help me put this on my shoulder.

374
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,168
What?

375
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,137
I think it will be harder this way.

376
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:51,198
No, this is better.

377
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:54,107
- Uie, give it to me now. - No, we're almost there.

378
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,368
- Are we? - We're here.

379
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,608
(As expected, Uie is the tireless Stamina Queen.)

380
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:02,048
(She's carrying it for over 100m on her own.)

381
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:08,018
(Smiling broadly as if it is not hard at all)

382
00:14:08,588 --> 00:14:12,628
(Another person who is running with a smile)

383
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:16,098
- Good job. Come on. - Go with her.

384
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,657
(The 15kg chest is heavy even for Strong In Ah.)

385
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,727
Switch. All right?

386
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:21,768
Can you carry it?

387
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,574
It's easier with it on your shoulder.

388
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,067
It will be hard that way. Just do it.

389
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,348
(They switch at the 100m point.)

390
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:29,307
- Good. - Come on.

391
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,008
You're doing well.

392
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,407
Will you carry it on your head? Not on the head.

393
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:35,618
- My goodness. - Head?

394
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:39,418
(Lifting it over her head)

395
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:41,317
Watch your head.

396
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:43,718
(But it looks like...)

397
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,658
(A mother carrying a snack to a farm?)

398
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,297
(Perfect K-labor style)

399
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,368
Good.

400
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,868
Your head...

401
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:55,738
Oh, no.

402
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,267
(Throwing it down due to exhaustion)

403
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,714
It's easier to carry it on your shoulder.

404
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:00,807
Okay?

405
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:02,128
(I will carry it no matter what.)

406
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:03,677
Carrying it with your fingers is harder.

407
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:06,208
You are using only the difficult ways now.

408
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:09,578
- Switch. - Give it to me.

409
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:10,718
No.

410
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:11,724
(Rocky Keum never gives up.)

411
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,587
- Let's go! - We're almost there.

412
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,068
- Let's go, girl. Come on. - Come on.

413
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:18,088
(She grits her teeth and finishes the course.)

414
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,427
- Good. - There you go.

415
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:22,188
(She squats without stopping, while holding 15kg.)

416
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:26,798
(Squatting 80 times holding a treasure chest)

417
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,498
Sae Rok's legs are stronger now.

418
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:30,937
She was too weak to lift things like that before.

419
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,338
Her legs have gotten stronger.

420
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,608
- Six, seven. - Good.

421
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:36,808
You're doing well.

422
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:39,407
We are ten minutes in, guys.

423
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:40,708
- Ten minutes in. - Eight.

424
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,477
- We have 24 minutes left. - She's gotten stronger.

425
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,817
- Good. Let's do it one more time. - Okay.

426
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:48,018
It's 60. The last one.

427
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,188
Good. You're doing well.

428
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:52,787
- Beautiful. - Let's go.

429
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,528
All right. Squat 80 times.

430
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:57,958
(Glancing)

431
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,098
Perfect.

432
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,098
(Holding a 15kg box in her arms, )

433
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:06,438
(she maintains perfect posture.)

434
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,608
Nine.

435
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,337
- Ten. - Ten.

436
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,408
You're almost there.

437
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:13,948
(While In Ah doing squats)

438
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,947
(Look at her.)

439
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,178
Why are you smiling?

440
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,487
Good. Uie, you are the best.

441
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,124
(The crazy Stamina Queen is happy doing squats.)

442
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,657
- She's not tired yet. - Four.

443
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:23,758
I'm tired.

444
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,858
I'm tired but happy.

445
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:28,228
Nine.

446
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,927
(Uie is happy when she works out.)

447
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,167
Five, six.

448
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,528
- Two, three. - She's doing lunges now.

449
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:37,767
(Doing 80 lunges holding a treasure chest)

450
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,368
- Let's go. - Five.

451
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:40,538
You can do this.

452
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:41,908
Why are you smiling?

453
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,708
You are unbelievable.

454
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:47,078
In Ah and Uie are strong.

455
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:48,778
Let's go.

456
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,339
- You got this. Keep going. - Let's go.

457
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:52,947
- You can do it. - Good.

458
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,287
(The muscle people from all over the world are enjoying the workout.)

459
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:57,008
It does feel like I'm in a foreign country.

460
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,587
(The people who flew in from all over the world to do this.)

461
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:02,228
Awesome.

462
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:05,458
Go.

463
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,397
Come on. Push.

464
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,828
(They truly love exercise.)

465
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,997
Eight!

466
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,937
(Mad Uie is happy.)

467
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,208
Okay.

468
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:17,737
- Yes. Go. - Okay.

469
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,808
(She starts Course C right away.)

470
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:23,778
- I'm fine with this. - You are?

471
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:24,948
You can just walk.

472
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:26,947
(She's happy carrying an 11kg dumbbell.)

473
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,617
- I'm a strong girl. - You're strong.

474
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:31,818
I'm a weak girl. I'm weak.

475
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,287
Go a little faster.

476
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,097
(Running 200m carrying a dumbbell)

477
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,128
Come on.

478
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:40,368
- One, two, three, four. - A little to the left.

479
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:42,997
- Thirty. Thirty-one. - I'm so tired. Mom.

480
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,574
(Clapping 100 times while doing a plank)

481
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:45,937
Ju Hyun must be tired.

482
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:48,667
- Uie is too good. - One, two.

483
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,078
(Next to the Stamina Queen who never feels tired)

484
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,578
- She is a monster. - In front of Uie...

485
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,177
Do you need a break?

486
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:56,318
- Are you all right? - Yes.

487
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:59,348
(It's hard, but they never give up.)

488
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,868
- Eight, nine. - You're almost there.

489
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:02,517
Forty. One.

490
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:03,557
One.

491
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:06,658
(Lifting and lowering a dumbbell 100 times)

492
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,358
- Just do five more. - Good.

493
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,397
- You need 16 and again. - Six.

494
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:11,558
One more.

495
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:13,197
- Six. - That's enough.

496
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,628
Stop it.

497
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,938
- Hey. Stop it. - That's enough.

498
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:21,538
(Ju Hyun tries her best not to burden Uie.)

499
00:18:21,838 --> 00:18:24,807
Uie, for this course, you should keep up with Ju Hyun's pace.

500
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:25,908
Of course.

501
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,347
You're such an amazing person.

502
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,718
Why? I'm fine.

503
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,777
I would've told you if I were too tired to do it.

504
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,348
You're unbelievable.

505
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:36,318
Instead, I'm not good at things that require strength.

506
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:38,988
I can feel that you are doing your best now.

507
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,287
You are working out your lower body a lot today.

508
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,597
You all will get sore muscles today.

509
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:45,098
(Lifting a medicine ball 40 times)

510
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,467
(Strong Girl Park Ju Hyun tries her best to lift a 10kg ball.)

511
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,267
Come on. Very good.

512
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,767
- It's been 25 minutes. - Yes.

513
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,107
- Let's take turns. - That's do it.

514
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,037
(Throwing a medicine ball 40 times)

515
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:57,478
Good. That might be better.

516
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,078
You can do this, Ju Hyun.

517
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,407
- We can do this. - Up.

518
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,747
Do you want me to do the rest?

519
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:03,778
No.

520
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,177
Let's do it together until the end.

521
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,587
- Okay. - Really good.

522
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,217
- We can do this. It's almost over. - Seven.

523
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,164
(While helping each other, they are about to finish it.)

524
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,288
Eight!

525
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:12,828
- Yes! - There you go!

526
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,358
- Nine! - Okay. The last one.

527
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,558
Last. Forty.

528
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,357
- Ten! - Okay!

529
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,798
(Uie and Ju Hyun finished the course in 27 minutes and 34 seconds.)

530
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:25,067
(Meanwhile, Sae Rok and In Ah are also about to finish it.)

531
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:27,068
Thirty-seven.

532
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,608
- Okay. - You can do this!

533
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:33,578
(Sae Rok is exhausted from the intense training.)

534
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:37,277
(She is squeezing out every last bit of her strength.)

535
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:38,278
Stop.

536
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,788
(Strong In Ah steps up when Sae Rok is tired.)

537
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,057
- Stay balanced. Yes. - Eighteen.

538
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,058
(The medicine ball is 10kg.)

539
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,459
- Nineteen. - Control your stamina.

540
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:49,198
Twenty. Let's go.

541
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,558
- Two, three. - Three, four.

542
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:56,097
(Pulling it off flawlessly, without losing her posture.)

543
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,098
Let's go.

544
00:19:57,438 --> 00:19:58,438
Twenty-four.

545
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,637
(She always keeps a smile on her fece.)

546
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,767
Twenty-five. Pay attention. Are you okay?

547
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,408
(After In Ah putting in all her strength)

548
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,048
Cheer them up, guys. They are nearly there.

549
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:13,948
(Giving it her all)

550
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,617
- Let's go. - Come one. Upwards.

551
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:19,657
(It's finally the last course, throwing a medicine ball 40 times.)

552
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:21,957
- Twenty-four. Ready. One. - Sit down.

553
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,457
(Staggering)

554
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,958
Twenty-seven.

555
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:28,667
(Throwing the medicine ball down like a boxing punch)

556
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,067
Twenty-nine.

557
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:31,367
This will pay off in a match.

558
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,938
Thirty. Ten more.

559
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,138
(Flopping)

560
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,508
Let's go! You can do this!

561
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,248
- You can do it, Sae Rok. - Come on.

562
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:42,917
- Thirty-six. Go. - You got this.

563
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:44,577
Thirty-seven.

564
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,647
- Three more. - Three.

565
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:48,318
Thirty-eight.

566
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,518
Thirty-nine.

567
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:53,287
- Forty. - Yes!

568
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:56,297
(Sae Rok and In Ah finished it in 31 minutes and 15 seconds.)

569
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,998
You got this!

570
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,427
We should take a photo of In Ah lying on the ground.

571
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,467
(Sae Rok and In Ah poured out all their strength.)

572
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:05,137
Look at In Ah lying on the ground.

573
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,708
It's the most exhausted expression I've ever seen on her face.

574
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:11,908
(Crawling)

575
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,178
Thank you.

576
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,578
Well done.

577
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:16,818
You didn't give up.

578
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,548
You didn't give up.

579
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,417
Alright.

580
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:23,058
(They finished within the time limit with a boxer's spirit.)

581
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:25,918
Good job.

582
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,388
Finished?

583
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:29,157
- One more. - Finish!

584
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:30,727
- One more? Oh, gosh. - Finish!

585
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:32,127
- Go. One more. - Finish.

586
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,198
We'll die.

587
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,798
You're evil.

588
00:21:36,938 --> 00:21:38,297
It's not my problem.

589
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,738
(Laughing)

590
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,168
Okay. The last one.

591
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,537
- Easy? - Very easy.

592
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,178
She says it's very easy.

593
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,147
Ready for a six-pack?

594
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:49,148
- Yes! - Yes. Let's go.

595
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:51,077
We will do it in the water.

596
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:52,818
What? What is going on?

597
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:54,217
All right. Sit down.

598
00:21:54,218 --> 00:21:56,288
- Sit here? - One line. Let's go.

599
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:58,958
My goodness. What are we doing?

600
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,157
(Sitting facing the sea, they feel great.)

601
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:03,928
- Good. - Yes!

602
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,597
(Just looking at the beautiful waves makes them feel refreshed.)

603
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:08,927
This training session...

604
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,137
is available only in Phuket.

605
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:13,537
This is the best.

606
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:15,378
(The beach of Phuket is perfect for training.)

607
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,737
Guys, are you glad that you came to Phuket?

608
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:19,677
- Yes! - Good.

609
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:22,947
Okay. We have only three movements, guys.

610
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:25,347
- I want arms around arms. - What?

611
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:27,087
Everybody, lie down.

612
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:31,518
(Core Training 1: Lying down, arm in arm)

613
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:37,897
(It starts with the cool waves.)

614
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,127
Oh, my gosh.

615
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,328
It must be cool.

616
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:41,468
And kick.

617
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,568
- Kick. - My gosh.

618
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:49,407
(Kicking while tightening the core)

619
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,537
One, two, three, four, five,

620
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,747
- six, seven... - The water is coming!

621
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,977
(While being hit by the waves, )

622
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:58,518
(they strengthen their core muscles.)

623
00:22:59,418 --> 00:23:00,987
(The chaotic kicking is over.)

624
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:01,988
All right.

625
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:03,758
Synchronized sit-up.

626
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,517
- Oh, my gosh. - When I say, "Down,"

627
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,728
you go down.

628
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:08,227
- Down. - Together?

629
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,288
Together?

630
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:10,757
Down.

631
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:11,858
Up.

632
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,627
Down.

633
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:14,697
(Down)

634
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:16,537
- Up. - One.

635
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:17,538
Down.

636
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:20,667
(Synchronized sit-up, )

637
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,478
(where no one can slack off)

638
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,838
- Up. - Four.

639
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:34,218
(Strengthning the core muscles all together)

640
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:35,548
Up.

641
00:23:35,988 --> 00:23:39,657
(The sense of unity strengthens as much as their core muscles.)

642
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:40,687
Last one. Up.

643
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:41,987
(The sense of unity strengthens as much as their core muscles.)

644
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,527
- Yes! - Okay.

645
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:44,597
Oh, my gosh.

646
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,428
This is like a training session for Special Forces like UDT.

647
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:49,397
This is really fun!

648
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,168
- It's so much fun. - I know.

649
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:53,284
When else will I ever get to do something like this?

650
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,668
High plank.

651
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:56,378
Keep your arms straight.

652
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:59,138
Raise them.

653
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:03,977
(Screaming)

654
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:05,248
This is great.

655
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:10,288
(They hold the plank position until everyone passes through.)

656
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,088
Go.

657
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:13,987
You have to hurry...

658
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,434
to make things easier for the other people.

659
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,528
(Groaning)

660
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,098
This is hard.

661
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:21,627
(Core training and ranger training at the same time)

662
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,667
- Go. - Get closer.

663
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:24,668
Closer.

664
00:24:25,538 --> 00:24:26,538
(Attacked by the waves)
You have to keep going.

665
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,578
You have to keep going.

666
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:31,707
(Spitting water)

667
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:32,778
Keep going.

668
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:34,977
(Ju Hyun also struggles against the waves.)

669
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:36,078
You got this!

670
00:24:36,418 --> 00:24:39,078
We have to win the match!

671
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,747
- You can do this. - What is this?

672
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,158
- You can do this. - My gosh.

673
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,418
You can do this, Park Ju Hyun!

674
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:47,758
You can do this, Uie!

675
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,828
You should get closer.

676
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:51,527
You can do this!

677
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:53,468
(Splash)

678
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:56,068
Let's knock our opponents out!

679
00:24:56,498 --> 00:24:57,738
- Three. - Three.

680
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,808
- Two. - Two.

681
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:01,238
- One. - Yes.

682
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:06,277
(The Pirate Camp is over.)

683
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:09,108
This is like Special Forces.

684
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,377
That was so cool.

685
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,977
Thank you, guys.

686
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,648
- Thank you. - Thank you.

687
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,488
Phuket is nice.

688
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,858
I love Phuket.

689
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:19,187
Hey, guys. Well done today.

690
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,228
We have...

691
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,027
a surprise!

692
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:23,628
(We have medals.)

693
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:28,168
Everybody is a winner!

694
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:29,837
(Yes, it's a medal!)

695
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:31,097
- You're the winner. - Thanks.

696
00:25:31,098 --> 00:25:32,567
- Thank you. - Thank you.

697
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:34,267
Thank you.

698
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,608
I love medals.

699
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:37,178
I like medals.

700
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,178
- Thank you. - Medal!

701
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:42,447
(They share the joy...)

702
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:46,148
(of finishing the course with their colleagues.)

703
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,347
So the training is over.

704
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:50,987
It was a training session available only in Phuket.

705
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,957
I was even jealous of the trainees here.

706
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,627
I could see your desire to exercise during the training.

707
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:57,998
In the ring, I fight alone.

708
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:00,497
But I could be with other people during the training,

709
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:02,068
- which made me really happy. - Okay.

710
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:04,037
It felt like such a special training session,

711
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:05,468
so I was really excited.

712
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:07,318
- Thank you so much. - You got the energy.

713
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:09,437
I loved working out...

714
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:11,407
early in the morning...

715
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:13,847
on my first visit to Phuket.

716
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:17,277
When else would I get to work out with such a great coach?

717
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,348
It was a lot of fun.

718
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:20,518
It was really fun.

719
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:21,947
- KO! - KO!

720
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,957
- Iron! - Iron!

721
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,757
- Girls! - Girls!

722
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:26,928
(KO Iron Girls)

723
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,098
- Thank you. - Thank you.

724
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:31,797
- Let's go. - Let's go.

725
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,868
(The intense first training session is over.)

726
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,097
We haven't had a single meal in Thailand yet.

727
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:37,098
That's true.

728
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,598
This is our first meal in Thailand.

729
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,167
I want to know...

730
00:26:40,168 --> 00:26:42,637
- what we are going to eat, Captain. - This place...

731
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:44,638
is beloved by exercise enthusiasts.

732
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:45,708
- I see. - That's because...

733
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,008
it offers a lot of dishes that exercise enthusiasts love.

734
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,977
- Healthy food. - Really?

735
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:51,048
Healthy food.

736
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,647
The restaurant is totally different.

737
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:54,988
(Healthy food?)

738
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:56,657
You know people who are crazy about workouts.

739
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:57,957
They are called...

740
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,657
- workout enthusiasts. - Yes.

741
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:01,387
Workout enthusiasts love this place.

742
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,457
- This place? - Because...

743
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,757
Are you sure we're going to eat?

744
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:05,257
Of course. We're going to eat.

745
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:06,467
We're not going to build muscles, are we?

746
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:07,698
Not at all.

747
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:09,127
We're here.

748
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,574
(They've arrived at the place beloved by workout enthusiasts.)

749
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:11,768
Shall we go?

750
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:14,537
(Heading to the restaurant with the atmosphere of Phuket.)

751
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:15,538
It looks different already.

752
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,038
It does feel exotic.

753
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:20,047
This street is very famous.

754
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:21,107
Really?

755
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:23,294
(This street lined with shops is a famous attraction in Phuket?)

756
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,477
- All the people here... - Yes?

757
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,847
- are very muscular. - Right.

758
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,117
Look. There's a topless man.

759
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:30,888
People walk around without a shirt on here.

760
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:32,688
Why?

761
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:33,987
All the places here are like a gym.

762
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:35,057
Here and there.

763
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:36,627
(What is this unusual street?)

764
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:37,697
The name of this street...

765
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,228
is Soi Ta-iad.

766
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,997
There are a lot of gyms on this street.

767
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,097
(It's called the Fitness Street.)

768
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:44,597
All the places over there are gyms.

769
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:45,997
There are huge gyms.

770
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,907
There are many different kinds of gyms.

771
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:49,267
(There are a variety of gyms here.)

772
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,638
They are all gyms,

773
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,877
and they are huge.

774
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,308
(World-class large-scale gyms)

775
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:56,929
A lot of athletes from around the world visit this place,

776
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,378
so it has become a street for athletes.

777
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:02,217
When people come here for vacation,

778
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:03,257
they usually stay for a month.

779
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,017
- Just to work out? - Just to work out.

780
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,088
That's amazing.

781
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,888
(Gyms lined up along the street)

782
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,297
Those who are crazy about sports...

783
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,628
come here to work out and rest.

784
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:18,537
- My gosh. - Gloves.

785
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:20,168
Look at the sporting goods.

786
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:23,007
This place is for physical treatments.

787
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:25,238
(There are also sports injury clinics.)

788
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:27,477
This place has everything related to workout.

789
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:28,508
That's true.

790
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:31,877
I can see why people who love working out com here.

791
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,638
- This neighborhood is interesting. - Right?

792
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:36,588
Do you see the poster on your left?

793
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:39,418
There are always Muay Thai matches.

794
00:28:40,058 --> 00:28:41,157
- Really? - Muay Thai?

795
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:42,557
- Are they real matches? - They have...

796
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:43,718
Muay Thai matches every week.

797
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,498
The place in front of you...

798
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:46,868
is for conditioning.

799
00:28:46,998 --> 00:28:49,328
- What is this? - Like the CrossFit you tried.

800
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,798
This is where you train for fitness races.

801
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:55,838
(This is the gym for fitness races, which the Iron Girls tried before.)

802
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:57,207
Hi.

803
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,538
(Maximum inner intimacy)

804
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,078
Burn!

805
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,678
Let's burn!

806
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,817
Even the cafe...

807
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:07,318
- sells protein shake here. - Look. Protein shake.

808
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:10,617
- Protein ball. - Protein ball.

809
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:11,988
(Even the menu feels healthy.)

810
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:14,187
The ice cream shops sell protein.

811
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,188
Really?

812
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,897
- You're right. Froyo. - Protein.

813
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,557
(This is their first time seeing protein ice cream.)

814
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:20,528
We can have protein for dessert later.

815
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,067
This is a pharmacy.

816
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:23,338
There are a lot of pharmacies.

817
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:24,538
Look. There's protein.

818
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,338
I somehow don't like this neighborhood.

819
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:30,077
- There's a fruit shop. - You can get injured.

820
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,408
A fruit shop.

821
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:32,608
It's healthy.

822
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,577
Protein shake.

823
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:35,947
(It's a protein shake store that pretends to be a fruit store.)

824
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,348
This place is crazy for workouts.

825
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:40,748
I think we can call it the protein street.

826
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,258
Can we try the protein shake?

827
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:44,388
We can.

828
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:45,557
Look here.

829
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,358
They have all kinds of protein here.

830
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:48,857
- Smoothie. - I've never seen...

831
00:29:48,858 --> 00:29:50,578
that sells so many kinds of protein before.

832
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:51,898
Do you want to try one?

833
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:54,228
I think you can choose a flavor.

834
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:56,268
It says flavors here.

835
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:57,997
It sounds delicious.

836
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,137
(It sounds delicious.)

837
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:02,438
Mixed berry milk yogurt honey with protein.

838
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:03,937
- This... - How much?

839
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:05,038
Isn't this a toy?

840
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:08,177
Is it sleeping like this?

841
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:09,277
(The cat is napping peacefully.)

842
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,748
The cat is sleeping in a Muay Thai pose.

843
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,188
It's a Muay Thai pose.

844
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,388
It's so cute.

845
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,217
What kind of cat is that?

846
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:18,194
(Even the cat looks extraordinary in the fitness street.)

847
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:19,858
He puts ice in it.

848
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,358
(They get up, curious about Phuket-style protein shakes.)

849
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,528
(Appetizing fresh fruit)

850
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,268
(They put in milk and ice.)

851
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:29,667
(One scoop of protein instead of syrup)

852
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:30,968
He adds the protein.

853
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:37,807
(Mixed berry and mango protein shakes are done.)

854
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,138
- Thank you. - My gosh.

855
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:40,408
Try it.

856
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,977
It looks delicious.

857
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:42,978
(Expectant)

858
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,278
(Captain tries a cool sip first.)

859
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,378
How is it?

860
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:47,448
It's nice.

861
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:49,017
It's nice. It tastes good.

862
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,788
(In Ah tries it after Captain.)

863
00:30:57,528 --> 00:30:58,797
What's with her face?

864
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:00,168
It tastes good.

865
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,728
- My gosh. - It has the taste of protein.

866
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,568
(It's somewhat strange.)

867
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:06,967
It is good,

868
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:08,037
but it just tastes like protein.

869
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:09,308
Isn't that nice?

870
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,778
- It's healthy and tasty. - Their faces look funny.

871
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:14,008
You should be happy about this.

872
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:15,907
All right. I'm happy.

873
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,494
(They force a smile, knowing it's good for their health.)

874
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,078
It's not bad.

875
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:20,748
Enjoy it.

876
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,557
- Okay. - Where's the restaurant?

877
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:24,688
We're almost there.

878
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,188
Look here. This place looks nice.

879
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:31,398
I bet this place is famous.

880
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,097
All right. This is the restaurant we're going to.

881
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,767
- What? - Yes.

882
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,967
It's the best. Let's go.

883
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:38,074
- Finally. - We're finally here.

884
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:39,098
Look.

885
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,408
(They are excited to eat.)

886
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:41,868
I like it.

887
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:43,484
- Finally. - It looks delicious.

888
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,788
- Where do we sit? - It's clean.

889
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,608
- It's clean. - Finally.

890
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,407
- It must be delicious. - Here.

891
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,648
Sit here.

892
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:51,948
- I'm hungry. - Yes.

893
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,917
- The food we are going to eat... - Okay.

894
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,647
The main dishes are here.

895
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,887
The name is...

896
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:59,288
muscle meals.

897
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:00,658
So...

898
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,658
(Even the name is muscle meals?)

899
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:05,527
So, the dishes we're going to eat are...

900
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:08,098
- What's special is... - Yes.

901
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:09,597
That you can choose what you want.

902
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,138
On your plate...

903
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,967
You can choose a sauce and a protein.

904
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:15,408
It also says...

905
00:32:15,608 --> 00:32:17,307
how much carbohydrate it contains.

906
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:18,977
So you can choose what you want.

907
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,247
(They can choose based on its mutritional information.)

908
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:21,508
(Carbohydrates, fat, protein)

909
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,378
(A muscle meal is packed with healthy ingredients.)

910
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:26,887
When you try it,

911
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:29,088
you will think, "This is healthy and delicious."

912
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,857
Choose what you want here. And there's more.

913
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:31,917
Look.

914
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:34,227
- Here, there's pasta. - Pasta.

915
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,668
- Can we have pasta? - Look at this.

916
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:37,958
This is bolognese.

917
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,928
- It contains 38g of protein. - That's amazing.

918
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:43,004
- I want to try it. - I bet it tastes like protein.

919
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,597
They also have pancakes.

920
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,044
- You can have pancakes. - I want pancakes.

921
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:49,707
- But it's protein pancakes. - But it's protein pancakes.

922
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,278
(Feeling faint)

923
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:52,938
No more protein.

924
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,647
These pancakes have 42g of protein.

925
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:56,718
I'm getting sick of it.

926
00:32:56,948 --> 00:32:58,917
They've got it all. Shrimps...

927
00:32:58,918 --> 00:32:59,947
(Captain Kim)

928
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:00,948
What is it?

929
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,647
I was looking forward to eating pad Thai.

930
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,818
Or green papaya salad.

931
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,528
- Stir-fried morning glory. - We're going to eat all of that.

932
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:09,127
But we worked out a lot this morning.

933
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,197
We trained excruciatingly hard.

934
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,127
So we have to eat healthy protein...

935
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:14,897
and healthy vegetables first.

936
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:16,867
We'll eat the tasty food later.

937
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,967
- I promise. - You’ll guarantee that we can eat?

938
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,007
Yes, 100 percent.

939
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:21,368
- Okay. - All right.

940
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:23,408
Choose what you want to eat.

941
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:24,877
We'll share.

942
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,537
It kind of feels as if...

943
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:29,377
we're at a protein theme park.

944
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,317
Everything here has protein in it.

945
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:34,248
It's like "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

946
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,717
- This is the Protein Factory. - Right.

947
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:37,517
Cicada Kim's Protein Factory.

948
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,528
- It's all protein. - What a unique neiborhood.

949
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,057
- I feel like we'll reach our limit. - This is too much protein.

950
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:45,957
Even if it's healthy for us...

951
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,867
The thing is,

952
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:49,567
a lot of people think this is plenty of protein,

953
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,167
but actually, it's not enough...

954
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:52,337
- for athletes. - So how much is enough?

955
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:53,407
On average,

956
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,437
people should consume about 0.8g of protein per kilogram of body weight.

957
00:33:58,438 --> 00:33:59,677
And athletes...

958
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:02,277
should consume 1.2g to 2g of protein per kilogram of body weight.

959
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:03,517
So if you're 50kg,

960
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,677
you have to consume 100g of protein.

961
00:34:05,678 --> 00:34:08,017
Let's say you have 200g of chicken breast.

962
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,387
People tend to think there's 200g of protein,

963
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:12,517
but actually there's only 30g to 40g of protein.

964
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,664
(The protein content is lower than they expected.)

965
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:16,287
And our bodies don’t absorb all the protein we eat.

966
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:17,927
- Right. - So we have to eat a lot more.

967
00:34:17,928 --> 00:34:19,498
I can do that.

968
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,867
Captain, why do we have to eat protein?

969
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:23,868
I don't know why.

970
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:27,467
As we age, protein is the most important nutrient in our bodies.

971
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:30,907
When we lose muscle, we get injured easily.

972
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:31,937
It's not good for our health either.

973
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:34,747
So increasing protein intake is recommended for the elderly.

974
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:37,818
I should bring my mom and dad here.

975
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:41,847
- You think they'll like it? - I'll bring my mom, dad,

976
00:34:41,848 --> 00:34:43,457
grandmother, and grandfather to Protein Street.

977
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,698
I don't think they'll enjoy it.

978
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:49,028
We're ten days away from the match.

979
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,698
Are you all eating healthy?

980
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,268
In Ah keeps texting me.

981
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,867
She keeps asking me if her diet is okay.

982
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,574
- She's very anxious about it. - I get it, though.

983
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,107
I didn't realize at first,

984
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:02,407
but the joy and sorrow felt by...

985
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:05,438
those of us who have to lose weight and those who don't...

986
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:06,877
is really different.

987
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:10,147
I told you that people get stressed over just a couple of kilograms.

988
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:12,478
- I'm like that right now. - Losing 2kg is stressful.

989
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,517
And this is my secret tip.

990
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:17,478
(Captain Kim has a secret tip for losing weight?)

991
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,587
You know how you don't have an appetite when you wake up?

992
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:21,487
And how you don't have an appetite when your workout is over?

993
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:23,697
- That's when you have to eat. - But I can't.

994
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,197
When you eat your meals then,

995
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:27,827
you can force yourself to eat healthy.

996
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:29,327
It's easier to control your appetite.

997
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:30,768
But when you eat when you're hungry,

998
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,897
not even athletes can control their appetites.

999
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,967
You really sound like an expert.

1000
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,078
So impressive.

1001
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,708
I'm a true athlete.

1002
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,577
Okay.

1003
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:42,324
(Their long-awaited first meal in Phuket is finally here.)

1004
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,348
- This looks good. - Those are tofu.

1005
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:46,117
- Thank you. - This looks so good.

1006
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:47,348
This looks so good.

1007
00:35:47,848 --> 00:35:49,688
This looks so appetizing. It's an actual meal.

1008
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:50,887
This looks so nice.

1009
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:52,094
(A special meal for the Iron Girls who did hard training)

1010
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:53,857
I ordered chicken,

1011
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:55,957
sweet potatoes, and steamed vegetables.

1012
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:59,558
I ordered beef, potatoes, and steamed vegetables.

1013
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:03,128
I ordered bolognese, brown rice, and steamed vegetables.

1014
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:07,638
I ordered beef bolognese, brown rice, and steamed vegetables.

1015
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:09,637
If you worked out hard, go ahead and eat.

1016
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:11,678
(With bolognese pasta that contains 38g of protein)

1017
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:13,807
- Gosh. - Enjoy your food.

1018
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,208
(How does the food taste?)

1019
00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:16,847
- This looks good. - I love this.

1020
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:18,318
I'm so happy.

1021
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:21,617
I'm so curious about the protein spaghetti.

1022
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:23,048
Right. This one.

1023
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,388
(Taking a huge bite)

1024
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,388
(Delicious)

1025
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,958
(In Ah takes a bite too.)

1026
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,467
(She also tries the sauce.)

1027
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:35,668
Try this.

1028
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:42,968
(The captain slurps on his food.)

1029
00:36:44,438 --> 00:36:46,438
(Delicious)

1030
00:36:47,148 --> 00:36:50,278
(Mouth open wide)

1031
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:51,478
This is good.

1032
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,847
- Have some more. - I want to try some.

1033
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:57,187
This is so good.

1034
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,134
(She didn't expect the healthy food to have such a rich flavor.)

1035
00:36:59,158 --> 00:37:00,428
- It's good. - It is.

1036
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:03,527
Seriously, this is so good.

1037
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:04,934
(Now, let's try the muscle-building food.)

1038
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,328
(They each try the dish they chose.)

1039
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:08,768
(Delicious)

1040
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:10,128
Is it good?

1041
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:11,568
Gosh, this is nice.

1042
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:16,708
(The food tastes so good that In Ah can't help but move her body.)

1043
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:21,778
(Delicious)

1044
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,317
(She dips the juicy shrimp in the sauce.)

1045
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:27,948
- I want to learn how to make this. - The camp was...

1046
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:32,018
(Eyes open wide)

1047
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,357
Even the carrot tastes good.

1048
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:36,238
I'm telling you. It can be tasty just the same.

1049
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:38,027
(They wordlessly exclaim in awe.)

1050
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:39,058
(Delicious)

1051
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:43,668
It's been a while since we all ate together, right?

1052
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:45,898
- Yes. - It's been a while.

1053
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:48,108
But it's nice to see that you still eat a lot.

1054
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:50,067
It feels like I'm eating with...

1055
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,538
my fellow professional athletes.

1056
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:53,307
I haven't eaten enough.

1057
00:37:53,308 --> 00:37:55,977
You have to eat good to use your strength.

1058
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:58,218
If you don't, your performance won't be good.

1059
00:37:58,618 --> 00:37:59,878
This is so good.

1060
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,417
- Thank you. - Are you done with this?

1061
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:03,657
- What? - You guys look like you starved.

1062
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,964
(They order more food right away.)

1063
00:38:04,988 --> 00:38:05,988
(Menu added, plus 3)

1064
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:07,487
More food?

1065
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:08,657
- For you. - There's more.

1066
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:11,798
At this point, you're eating more than the athletes on my team.

1067
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,158
Seriously.

1068
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:15,467
When I get food with the younger athletes,

1069
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,514
I can usually get a grasp on how much food they order.

1070
00:38:17,538 --> 00:38:19,697
You can't tell anyone that we eat this much.

1071
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,367
I think I misspoke earlier.

1072
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,738
If you eat too much protein,

1073
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:26,537
it can be stored as fat. So mind the amount too.

1074
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,707
Please have an idea of how much protein you should be eating.

1075
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,918
This tastes even better.

1076
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,277
I could probably eat healthy my whole life.

1077
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,947
Gosh, this is so good.

1078
00:38:34,948 --> 00:38:36,064
I can't believe how good this is.

1079
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:37,858
You were all worried earlier...

1080
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,427
that healthy food wouldn't taste good. So how was it?

1081
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:41,527
- It was so tasty. - It was so tasty.

1082
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,787
- Right? - Yes.

1083
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:46,058
We can stick to healthy food forever if it tastes like this.

1084
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,427
We still have to eat pu pad pong karee.

1085
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:49,428
(Is he trying to make us eat healthy food the whole trip?)

1086
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,997
Please let us have pad Thai at least once.

1087
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,598
- Please. - You mean the local pad Thai?

1088
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:55,067
Is it okay if we add protein to the curry?

1089
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,068
Gosh.

1090
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:58,177
(Loathing the idea)

1091
00:38:58,178 --> 00:38:59,477
Curry with protein powder.

1092
00:38:59,478 --> 00:39:01,807
I feel like that could actually be a thing.

1093
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:04,177
Yes, protein. And pad Thai made with protein noodles.

1094
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:05,378
(No more protein.)

1095
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:08,518
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1096
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,687
Let’s clean up and go sparring.

1097
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:14,404
(Iron Boot Camp in Phuket. Where will they be training next?)

1098
00:39:14,428 --> 00:39:17,328
(Located on the fitness street that is lined with gyms)

1099
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:21,868
(A local boxing gym in Phuket)

1100
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:26,038
(This is where the Iron Girls will be sparring today.)

1101
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:28,468
I guess we can't get away from here.

1102
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:29,738
Gosh.

1103
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:30,988
Did you get some good rest?

1104
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:32,577
(A familiar figure from behind)

1105
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,678
- Hello. - Coach!

1106
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:37,377
- Coach, we missed you. - Right.

1107
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,447
(Meeting Coach Kim in Phuket feels even more special.)

1108
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:41,017
Who are we sparring with?

1109
00:39:41,018 --> 00:39:44,018
You will be sparring with foreign boxers...

1110
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:46,017
who are training in Phuket.

1111
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:49,588
(Foreign boxers in Phuket)

1112
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:52,498
(Only 10 days left until their 1st competition)

1113
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:56,627
(Their first full sparring partners...)

1114
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,338
(were community sports competition veterans.)

1115
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:02,037
(Their second full sparring partners...)

1116
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:05,278
(were boxers that each had less than 1 year of experience.)

1117
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:08,648
(And today, they'll be doing their third full sparring session.)

1118
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:13,378
(This time, it's with foreign boxers.)

1119
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:17,258
(This is the final test, with no room to back down.)

1120
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,028
(Will they be able to hold their own against the foreign boxers?)

1121
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:23,287
They’re matched to our weight class, right?

1122
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,127
- Yes, like you said, - Yes.

1123
00:40:25,128 --> 00:40:28,298
They're in your weight class, so you don't have to worry too much.

1124
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:31,367
The main purpose of an overseas training camp...

1125
00:40:31,368 --> 00:40:33,867
- Yes? - is to spar with foreign fighters.

1126
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,307
- That's right. - Let's go inside to meet them.

1127
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,608
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1128
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,078
Take a look at this boxing gym.

1129
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,337
- It's amazing. - We've got to try it out.

1130
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:40,407
(They go inside the gym where they'll be sparring.)

1131
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,508
- Hello. - I'm nervous.

1132
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,269
- Gosh. I love this. - Look at all these pictures.

1133
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,239
How many people have been here?

1134
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,669
- The color is so nice and vibrant. - Gosh.

1135
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,980
How many boxing rings are there?

1136
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,870
- They have many rings here. - Come on.

1137
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,849
(The huge boxing gym is equipped with 3 boxing rings.)

1138
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,880
This is a gym with a long tradition.

1139
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,250
From boxing and UFC to MMA,

1140
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,289
many famous fighters have been here.

1141
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,919
So many people are obsessed...

1142
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,429
- with boxing. - Yes.

1143
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,160
The looks on your faces since we arrived at the gym...

1144
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,399
Right. Don't be discouraged.

1145
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,999
- Straighten your shoulders. - This feels different.

1146
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,329
- It feels different. - Don't be intimidated.

1147
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,299
This is our first time sparring with...

1148
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,870
- foreign boxers. - Yes.

1149
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,069
- Right. - Will we be all right?

1150
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,909
Won't they be more muscular than we are?

1151
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,209
I've always fought against foreign fighters,

1152
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,679
and I think the experience...

1153
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,309
- is truly necessary. - Why?

1154
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,449
Their way of applying force is definitely different.

1155
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,449
And the way they approach sparring is different too.

1156
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,679
Foreign fighters think of sparring as a match.

1157
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,119
- That's right. - Yes. So if someone wants to spar,

1158
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,720
it’s like saying they want a real match.

1159
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,829
It's because they think that sparring like it’s a real match...

1160
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,059
helps both participants improve.

1161
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,329
- I see. - Really?

1162
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,130
That's why you must remain composed.

1163
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,869
Let's not let our eyes give us away.

1164
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,829
- Right. - Do we have some eyeliner?

1165
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,069
Ju Hyun said yesterday...

1166
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,269
that she will put eyeliner on for the match.

1167
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,110
- We will draw it until here. - To look scary?

1168
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,240
Yes, to look scary.

1169
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,170
- So that our glare scares them. - Yes.

1170
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,339
Let's go.

1171
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,440
Today,

1172
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,649
we won't hear about...

1173
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,380
their experience or sport,

1174
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,850
but just go on with the sparring...

1175
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,219
and then listen to them.

1176
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,220
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1177
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,520
Then let's bring in our opponents.

1178
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,759
Please come out.

1179
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,960
(Who will their opponents be?)

1180
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,790
Gosh. Here they come.

1181
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,229
You can feel their aura, right?

1182
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,630
(The opponents show up.)

1183
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,739
Turn back around.

1184
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,740
(Turn back around.)

1185
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:26,869
- No. - It seems like they are...

1186
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,870
- in a different weight class. - Fix your mindset.

1187
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,186
They're in a different weight class.

1188
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,539
You never know until they get here.

1189
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,379
They seem to get bigger as they're getting closer.

1190
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,860
(They approach with an unusual aura.)

1191
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,949
(Nice to meet you.)

1192
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,120
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1193
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,919
Nice to meet you.

1194
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,520
(He greets the other coach.)

1195
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,759
(Dmitri, assistant boxing coach, Stan, head boxing coach)

1196
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,960
(No response)

1197
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,329
Coaches,

1198
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,200
are you feeling uncomfortable?

1199
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,399
Foreign teams are always like that.

1200
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
- Amazing. - Yes.

1201
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:59,539
Anyway, let's just hear their names...

1202
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,269
- and get right to sparring. - Yes, sir.

1203
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,240
Okay. Please introduce yourselves.

1204
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,479
Hello, my name is Marbie, and I'm from Ireland.

1205
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,210
- Ireland. - Ireland.

1206
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,579
And my name is Madeline.

1207
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,480
- I'm from Australia. - Australia.

1208
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,579
My name is Emma, and I'm from the UK.

1209
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,090
- Emma. - UK.

1210
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,860
Hello, my name is Saengchan, and I'm from Thailand.

1211
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,690
Thailand. Saengchan.

1212
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,959
Ireland, Australia,

1213
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,189
- and the UK. - The UK.

1214
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,730
- Thailand. - Thailand.

1215
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,830
What's going on?

1216
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,969
One thing I'm curious to know...

1217
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,899
is whether you live here,

1218
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,040
or if you are here on holiday for the match.

1219
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,270
I came here for holiday. But now, I'm living here.

1220
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,639
What? You're living here?

1221
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,680
(She lives here?)

1222
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,350
I've been in Thailand for 15 months now.

1223
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,180
Why is she living here?

1224
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,649
I came for holiday, and then I just...

1225
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:46,920
loved it, so I stayed.

1226
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,789
So I came for holiday. Now, I live here.

1227
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,060
And I'm here for training.

1228
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,389
They all came here for their holiday.

1229
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,859
(They all fell in love with training in Phuket and stayed.)

1230
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,466
- They are all living here. - Gosh. They're all...

1231
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,860
I should live here as well.

1232
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,760
When you have a match,

1233
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,899
you get to know your opponent...

1234
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,169
- when you get there. - Yes.

1235
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,099
At community sports boxing competitions.

1236
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,169
So today,

1237
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,269
we will do a random draw.

1238
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,969
(That's why they will do a random draw today.)

1239
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,709
- To make it fair? - Even the order...

1240
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,079
will be done by draw.

1241
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,779
That's how we will choose the order for the sparring.

1242
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,279
(They will do a random draw for the order as well.)

1243
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,449
This is like an actual match.

1244
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,949
They all seem good, so I don't know.

1245
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,049
We just have to go with it.

1246
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:22,250
(The foreign boxer draws the ball first.)

1247
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,990
Yes, they drew them.

1248
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,889
Great.

1249
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,860
(They finished drawing the ball.)

1250
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
(They start to get nervous.)

1251
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:30,860
- Let's go. - Our turn for colors.

1252
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,330
First, Ju Hyun.

1253
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,730
Blue.

1254
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:34,929
(Who will be Ju Hyun's opponent?)

1255
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,840
Blue. Okay. You may greet each other.

1256
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:38,900
The face-off.

1257
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,039
- Face-off. - Face.

1258
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,239
(They exchange intense eye contact.)

1259
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Okay.

1260
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,809
Great.

1261
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,009
(Emma versus Ju Hyun)

1262
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,079
Next.

1263
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,650
(Saengchan versus Sae Rok)

1264
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,289
Okay. Good.

1265
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,690
(Madeline versus In Ah)

1266
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,830
(Marbie versus Uie)

1267
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:05,129
(Today's sparring order)

1268
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,260
Great, then...

1269
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,029
we won't delay it.

1270
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,870
- Get ready for the sparring. - Yes, sir.

1271
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:10,970
Please get ready.

1272
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:13,170
(The third full sparring)

1273
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,070
(Warming up before the sparring)

1274
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:24,920
(The opponents lightly warm up.)

1275
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,290
Even the competition is nearing. I'm so nervous.

1276
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,950
Who is our biggest problem?

1277
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,160
Can you tell?

1278
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,060
I really can't tell.

1279
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,259
Are you serious? I'm just...

1280
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,589
- so scared. - Don't be scared.

1281
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,359
We were always in air-conditioned rooms,

1282
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,859
- and doing this outdoors... - Yes.

1283
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,330
That consumes a lot of energy.

1284
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,069
The weather is hot, so...

1285
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,669
Is it different for each nationality?

1286
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,746
- They're different. - Do they have different styles?

1287
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,040
It doesn't matter what happens.

1288
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,610
I will do my best up there.

1289
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,309
(10 days left.)

1290
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,980
(It's the last sparring before the competition.)

1291
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,349
(How much have the Iron Girls grown?)

1292
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,159
Let'ss begin the first sparring.

1293
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,420
Emma and Ju Hyun.

1294
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,929
- Please enter. - Okay. Let's go.

1295
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,229
Let's go, girl.

1296
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,260
Let's go.

1297
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,430
(Completely relaxed)

1298
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,769
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun calmly enters the ring.)

1299
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,869
Let's go, Ju Hyun.

1300
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,916
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun calmly enters the ring.)

1301
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,469
Why am I so nervous?

1302
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,509
- I'm nervous as well. - Really?

1303
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,286
- We're all nervous. - If you're not nervous...

1304
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,409
If you're not nervous,

1305
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,110
it means you don't care about the results.

1306
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,410
She cares, but she doesn't get nervous.

1307
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,279
- I'm nervous now. - What?

1308
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,280
- No way. - No way.

1309
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:33,419
You're nervous?

1310
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420
(Due to the sparring with a foreign boxer, )

1311
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:37,550
(Ju Hyun seems to be very tense.)

1312
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,520
(The opponent laughs.)

1313
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,890
And did you spar before with the helmet?

1314
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,430
Never.

1315
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,360
Congratulations.

1316
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,570
(She had been sparring without wearing the headgear?)

1317
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,300
- Go and watch what she does. - Okay.

1318
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Look how she punches. Look first.

1319
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,939
Don't rush. Never rush.

1320
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,770
- Just relax and have fun. - Yes.

1321
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,979
- And then fight afterwards? - Yes.

1322
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,350
- And try to close your guard. - Okay.

1323
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,320
She's so optimistic.

1324
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,950
What if she hits hard while smiling like that?

1325
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:09,949
I'm nervous.

1326
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,559
(Ju Hyun finishes preparing with a nervous heart.)

1327
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,620
I can feel it.

1328
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,219
Fighters, to the front.

1329
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,790
(Fighters, to the center.)

1330
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,660
Let's go. Have fun.

1331
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,260
Play fair.

1332
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,169
No attacking the back.

1333
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,270
Play fair.

1334
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,739
The sparring will consist of 2 rounds of 2 minutes,

1335
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,300
with 40 seconds of rest.

1336
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,609
- Okay. Don't rush. - Okay.

1337
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,640
Okay.

1338
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,439
Box!

1339
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,880
(Round 1 begins.)

1340
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,920
(Ju Hyun keeps her distance.)

1341
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,620
(Ju Hyun makes a sudden attack on the body.)

1342
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,500
(And connects it to a body shot)

1343
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,630
(Valid strike)

1344
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,300
(Valid strike 2, Valid strike)

1345
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,200
Go around.

1346
00:48:00,201 --> 00:48:03,139
- You have to go around. - Don't rush. Take your time.

1347
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,880
(After carefully measuring the time to attack...)

1348
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,680
(She makes a valid strike with a jab, )

1349
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,450
(and even dodges.)

1350
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,589
That's it. Good.

1351
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,590
(She calmly observes the timing while leading the opponent.)
Good. Stay calm.

1352
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,440
You can tell her strategy, right?

1353
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,270
Thirty minutes have passed.

1354
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,530
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

1355
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,670
(Valid strike 2)

1356
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,670
(Valid strike 2, Valid strike 3)

1357
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,910
(Her opponent suddenly smiles wide.)

1358
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,509
(Ju Hyun responds to the madness...)

1359
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,050
(with a jab.)

1360
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,050
(The pinpoint jab breaks the guard.)

1361
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,520
Don't stay so long in close distance. Okay?

1362
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,919
Lean your hands more.

1363
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,989
Okay. Stand with your hands up.

1364
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,589
That's it.

1365
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,530
(After Ju Hyeon attempts a dodge and punch)

1366
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,100
(A slugfest follows.)

1367
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,800
(She allowed a valid strike through an open guard.)

1368
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,400
You need to move back after an attack.

1369
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,000
- You did well. - Go in.

1370
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,540
Don't stay so long in close distance.

1371
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,310
(Parry)

1372
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,780
(Parry 2)

1373
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,950
(She easily blocks the opponent's attack.)

1374
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,449
(After a high-low combination, )

1375
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,080
(she withdraws.)

1376
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,850
(Ju Hyun makes valid strikes by hitting and withdrawing.)

1377
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,760
Close it.

1378
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,390
- That's it. Yes. - Okay.

1379
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,259
(Ju Hyun: Valid strike 1, Opponent: Valid strike 1)

1380
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,260
(Ju Hyun: Valid strike 2, Opponent: Valid strike 2)

1381
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:31,421
(Ju Hyun: Valid strike 3, 4, Opponent: Valid strike 2)

1382
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,229
Stand down.

1383
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,669
(Ju Hyun's hit and withdraw)

1384
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,099
(Opponent's body shot)

1385
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,909
- Yes. Go in. - Beautiful.

1386
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,040
(Ju Hyun withstands the strong body shot.)

1387
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,210
You have plenty of stamina left.

1388
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,486
A minute and 30 seconds have passed.

1389
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:49,580
It's the last 30 seconds.

1390
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,019
- That's it. More. - Ju Hyun.

1391
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,079
Keep going with the flurry.

1392
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,149
That's it.

1393
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,670
Keep going with the flurry. That's it.

1394
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,220
She got hit a lot.

1395
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,230
(They keep exchanging blows.)

1396
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,930
(A strong body shot)

1397
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,770
(Counterattacking with a right hook that is even stronger)

1398
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,739
- Nice. - Defense. More lead hand control.

1399
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,870
(Pausing to catch their breath after the rush)

1400
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,180
- Yes. - Yes.

1401
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,580
- You can do more. Keep going. - Good.

1402
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,680
(Another round of attacks 5 seconds before it ends)

1403
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,690
- Stop. - Okay.

1404
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,290
(Round 1 ends)

1405
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,429
You did well.

1406
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,630
Gosh. She did well.

1407
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,900
Ju Hyun did so well.

1408
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,129
Oh, my gosh. I'm so nervous.

1409
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,299
Yes, it's good.

1410
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,906
(After watching Ju Hyun's match, the next boxer is nervous.)

1411
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:47,040
(The opponent comes in, breathing heavily.)

1412
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,609
My cardio is ruined right now.

1413
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,970
I'm not worried. It's one more round, and that's it.

1414
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,539
More lead hand control.

1415
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,009
You keep holding your hands here all the time.

1416
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,850
More lead hand control. She will be confused.

1417
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,649
Yes? And don't lean so forward.

1418
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,489
- Okay. - Stay here and use some feint.

1419
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,249
What you did really well was when you lightly tapped...

1420
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,619
and then gave a strong blow.

1421
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,360
You threw three blows.

1422
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,860
You need to do what you do well to impact the opponent.

1423
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,799
Like what you just did. Light punches...

1424
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,259
- and then a strong... - Can I have some water?

1425
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,300
Two or three strong ones.

1426
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,929
(She has a drink of water and prepares for Round 2.)

1427
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,040
Time is up.

1428
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,300
Spit it out.

1429
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,810
(Round 2 begins.)

1430
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,920
(Sticking to the plan, she keeps her guard up with her lead hand.)

1431
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,650
Beautiful.

1432
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,590
Don't rush.

1433
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,960
(Ju Hyun hits and withdraws first.)

1434
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,519
Beautiful.

1435
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,090
(A cross-counter)

1436
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,929
(Another hit and withdraw)

1437
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,700
Ju Hyun is much better in the second round.

1438
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,830
That's it.

1439
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,500
Yes. That's what I was talking about.

1440
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,669
(Watch the opponent move calmly.)

1441
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,809
When she punches toward the body, her top is empty.

1442
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,310
Yes. Nice.

1443
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,540
Yes.

1444
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,649
(The opponent pushes her to the corner.)

1445
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,780
(Ju Hyun swings out.)

1446
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,780
(Punch)

1447
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,620
(And turn)

1448
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,559
(Followed by continuous valid strikes)

1449
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,190
Yes. You punched a lot.

1450
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,989
(Finishing up with hit and withdraw)

1451
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,160
Very good.

1452
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,270
(Exploring each other carefully)

1453
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,299
- More right. - She's getting closer again.

1454
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,640
Guard up. Yes.

1455
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,040
Yes. You got it.

1456
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,510
(Cross-counter)

1457
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,039
(Followed by Ju Hyun's...)

1458
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,749
(one-two)

1459
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,479
- Yes. You got it. - Beautiful.

1460
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,280
- It's okay. You're better. - And to the left. Go out there.

1461
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,319
Go left and go right.

1462
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,690
- Beautiful. - Do it at the end.

1463
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,960
- Go right means the face. - Go right and up.

1464
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,919
- Again. Come on. - That's right.

1465
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,329
Nice dodging. And you hit her first.

1466
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,330
Yes.

1467
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,760
It's been a minute.

1468
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,399
(However, Ju Hyun doesn't fall back and fights to the end.)

1469
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,830
Nice. Ju Hyun, you're determined.

1470
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,000
Ju Hyun, you're determined.

1471
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,509
Go to the middle of the ring.

1472
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,939
No gap. Go.

1473
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,310
- Yes. - Good job.

1474
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,579
- Look how she withdraws. - It's better when you think.

1475
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,180
- She's good at withdrawing. - Withdraw.

1476
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,910
(She hits and withdraws again.)

1477
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,779
- When you start... - You got it.

1478
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,720
(She succeeds in hitting and withdrawing 3 times in a row.)

1479
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,419
That's right.

1480
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,619
It's better when you think. Withdraw.

1481
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,690
Last 30 seconds.

1482
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,759
- Last 30 seconds. - Go to the left.

1483
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,330
- Last 30 seconds. - Low body.

1484
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,230
(The opponent's strong right hook)

1485
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,400
(Ju Hyun induces an attack, remaining calm)

1486
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,640
Fight back. Yes. Good job.

1487
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,079
(Sweeping and striking accurately)

1488
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,710
(Guarding as well)

1489
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,649
Yes. Good job.

1490
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,879
- Good job. - Last ten seconds.

1491
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,649
- Park Ju Hyun! - More! Last ten seconds.

1492
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,879
Be bold.

1493
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,520
Be bold for the last ten seconds.

1494
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,559
Turn around.

1495
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,990
Yes. Turn around.

1496
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,629
Yes. Turn around.

1497
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,489
Stop.

1498
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,729
(Round 2 ends.)

1499
00:53:58,730 --> 00:53:59,730
Good job.

1500
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:00,799
(Ju Hyun's fierce sparring is over.)

1501
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,099
Good job. Bow.

1502
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,069
- It's all good. Thank you. - Well done.

1503
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,569
- That was good. - You were so good.

1504
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,670
- That was great. - Was Park Ju born to box?

1505
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,310
Good job.

1506
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,939
- You were good. - It hurt so much though.

1507
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,340
Yes, but you were calm and good.

1508
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:17,079
- You have fun? - Yes.

1509
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,279
(Sparring was brutally fun.)

1510
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,449
Both fighters did a wonderful job.

1511
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,950
Please give it up for them.

1512
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,159
- Gosh. Ju Hyun sometimes goes mad. - Yes, she does.

1513
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,530
- Her opponent also went mad. - Yes.

1514
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,859
It was madness versus madness.

1515
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,829
- That's right. - It was very dynamic.

1516
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,130
To be honest, I was surprised.

1517
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,769
First of all, she's very strong.

1518
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,440
And she was smiling as she hit me.

1519
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,470
So I was scared.

1520
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,540
(After Ju Hyun's strikes 3 times in a row...)

1521
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,280
(Smiling)

1522
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,010
(What? You're scaring me.)

1523
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,809
So I kept telling myself,

1524
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,119
"No. It's okay."

1525
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,180
- I tried to remain calm. - Okay.

1526
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,149
I tried so hard to keep calm.

1527
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,819
Emma, you smiled in the middle.

1528
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,019
Why were you smiling?

1529
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,390
I'm happy.

1530
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,160
- That's so cool. - Why happy?

1531
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,159
- Unbelievable. - Look where I am.

1532
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,729
I'm in a ring with an amazing opponent.

1533
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,370
So how can I not?

1534
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:14,809
I respect.

1535
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,040
I was surprised too.

1536
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,710
And I respect. So...

1537
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,540
- Yes. - For real.

1538
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,350
Anybody can learn how to box. Anybody.

1539
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,979
But not everybody has a spark.

1540
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,420
And you have.

1541
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,050
(Thank you.)

1542
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,020
(Thank you.)

1543
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,220
(The mad boxers shared their passion physically.)

1544
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,289
- That's the charm of boxing. - Right.

1545
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,699
- When you fight, - It's hot in here.

1546
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,429
You hit each other and make each other bleed.

1547
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,246
But after the match, you respect each other...

1548
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,469
and become friends. That's the charm of boxing.

1549
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,569
That's right.

1550
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,570
How long have learned to box?

1551
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,270
(The opponent's experience finally unveils.)

1552
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,339
Western boxing for two months.

1553
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,580
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my gosh.

1554
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,150
- Two months? - Yes.

1555
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,749
- She's the same. - But she's so good.

1556
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,550
Did you learn anything before that?

1557
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,549
Kickboxing for a bit. Yes.

1558
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,089
- Kickboxing for how long? - Five years.

1559
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,649
Five years? I see.

1560
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,489
(Emma, UK, 43, psychotherapist)

1561
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,590
(5 years of kickboxing)

1562
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,889
That jab wasn't from two months. It hurt.

1563
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:11,959
- Right. - And it still does.

1564
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,099
You have a killer cross.

1565
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,530
(Don't act like you're weak.)

1566
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,400
- Oh, a killer cross. - That was very good.

1567
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,340
And don't put your hands down.

1568
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,239
Because after every punch, you put your hands down.

1569
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,769
- Keep it here. - Right.

1570
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,879
Keep them up.

1571
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,080
- Right. - Good.

1572
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,679
(Ju Hyun's third sparring results:)

1573
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,879
(Strengths: Figures out the opponent's attack timing...)

1574
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,390
(and hits and withdraws quickly)

1575
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:49,030
(Induces the opponent to attack in order to counterattack)

1576
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:58,280
(Points to improve: Lowers the guard after every punch)

1577
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,610
- Playing against her was painful. - Well done.

1578
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,479
- It looked painful. - I even thought...

1579
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,379
- I'd get TKO. - Really?

1580
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,496
- But you endured it pretty well. - It hurt that much.

1581
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,449
- So good. - How was it really?

1582
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:12,766
- No, it was good. - How was it? It was okay?

1583
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,730
I couldn't. She was fast. I couldn't get my distance.

1584
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,860
That's all right.

1585
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,929
- She clocked me in the nose too. - Did she?

1586
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,960
She did.

1587
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:28,310
(Every time she punched, she hit her nose.)

1588
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,679
- You're bleeding a little bit. - Am I?

1589
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,779
That's the cross.

1590
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,910
The cross.

1591
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,849
Prepare for the second sparring.

1592
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,880
Uie versus Marbie.

1593
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,189
(Uie looks frozen as she enters the ring.)

1594
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,920
Uie, just keep calm.

1595
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,460
Let's go.

1596
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,930
(On the other hand, the opponent has the composure to hum.)

1597
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,160
(Glancing)

1598
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,730
Like the last time, once it's over,

1599
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,700
it's not a big deal, you know?

1600
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,499
There, lead, lead, lead.

1601
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,170
You sometimes go to the body.

1602
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,740
- Look to the head. Go to the body. - She's taller.

1603
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,680
She'll work with her jab.

1604
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,949
You go to the body.

1605
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,050
Two or three times?

1606
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,120
After that, you feint to the body and go up.

1607
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,220
Okay?

1608
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:14,550
(Ready)

1609
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,120
(Uie is also getting ready.)

1610
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,129
(She's nervous enough to retch.)

1611
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,059
We'll begin the second sparring. Please come to the center.

1612
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,860
(The fighters for the second sparring enter.)

1613
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,400
No leg attack, okay?

1614
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,900
Touch your gloves.

1615
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:35,170
Fair play.

1616
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:36,310
Corners.

1617
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,409
Take a deep breath.

1618
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:39,879
(Taking a deep breath)

1619
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,910
- Good. - Okay.

1620
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:44,679
Box.

1621
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,950
(Round 1 begins.)

1622
00:58:49,585 --> 00:58:52,355
- Hands up. - Hands up.

1623
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:54,354
(The opponent attacks fiercely.)

1624
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:56,024
She just threw a strong punch.

1625
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:57,525
But it was blocked by Uie's jab.

1626
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,195
(The opponent's valid strike became weak due to Uie's jab.)

1627
00:59:02,565 --> 00:59:05,474
(She keeps her distance.)

1628
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,915
- She didn't hit you, did she? - No.

1629
00:59:07,535 --> 00:59:08,874
(Uie makes a valid strike just with a jab alone.)

1630
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,355
Because there's a gap in reach, she's going to try to come in.

1631
00:59:11,575 --> 00:59:12,945
(Blocking)

1632
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:16,015
(Connecting to a straight)

1633
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:18,815
(Punching strong enough to turn her head)

1634
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:20,385
(The opponent's body attack)

1635
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:22,385
(Uie counters with a jab.)

1636
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,824
(However, the opponent hits a two...)

1637
00:59:24,825 --> 00:59:26,595
(in return for Uie's jab.)

1638
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:29,925
(The opponent breaks through Uie's reach.)

1639
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:31,125
Oh, she's strong.

1640
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,765
She's going to struggle.

1641
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:35,835
- Oh, gosh. - She's good with the...

1642
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:38,134
- She's got good footwork. - Yes.

1643
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:40,334
Jab for the body right now.

1644
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:41,335
Thirty seconds have passed.

1645
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:42,775
Yes.

1646
00:59:43,005 --> 00:59:44,075
- Good. - Beautiful.

1647
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,275
(Dodging)

1648
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:48,585
(Valid strike, Valid strike 2)

1649
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,415
(Finishing up with a straight)

1650
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:53,114
Hands up.

1651
00:59:53,115 --> 00:59:54,815
Same combination with the left hand.

1652
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:56,255
- Head. - Guard up.

1653
00:59:56,355 --> 00:59:57,885
- Punch. - That's right.

1654
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:00,024
(Uie's jab)

1655
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:01,295
(The opponent's right hook)

1656
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:03,895
(Followed by the left hook)

1657
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:05,095
Beautiful.

1658
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:07,264
- Her left hook is crazy. - Why are you not doing anything?

1659
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:09,205
She's good.

1660
01:00:09,865 --> 01:00:11,264
- A minute passed. - Don't go straight.

1661
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:13,704
Why are you not doing anything after stretching your arm?

1662
01:00:13,705 --> 01:00:15,104
You have to retrieve it.

1663
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:16,274
Yes, do your footwork.

1664
01:00:16,275 --> 01:00:17,921
(Uie continues attacking with her footwork.)

1665
01:00:17,945 --> 01:00:19,044
(However, )

1666
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:20,515
(the opponent dodges easily.)

1667
01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:23,695
Use it when she gets close.

1668
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:25,485
(Turning)

1669
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,715
(Attacking again)

1670
01:00:28,685 --> 01:00:29,725
Don't let her.

1671
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:33,255
(Strong straight that breaks through Uie's reach)

1672
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:36,594
(Followed by the body attack)

1673
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:40,395
She's reading your timing.

1674
01:00:42,535 --> 01:00:43,535
(The opponent attacks at accurate timing.)

1675
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:45,805
Withdraw. Quick.

1676
01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:49,545
(A very strong straight)

1677
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:53,175
(An immediate series of attacks)

1678
01:00:56,985 --> 01:00:58,985
I need you to put more weight on your right leg.

1679
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,055
You have to get close and guard.

1680
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:02,585
Yes.

1681
01:01:04,185 --> 01:01:06,895
(A strong body flurry)

1682
01:01:08,395 --> 01:01:10,324
Your opponent knows that you'll jab.

1683
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:11,964
So deceive her.

1684
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,464
Jab as you deceive her.

1685
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:14,494
Then try one-two.

1686
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:15,665
Try one-two.

1687
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,104
Again.

1688
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:18,135
Okay.

1689
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:21,605
(Looking for the timing while doing the footwork)

1690
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,245
(Cross-counter)

1691
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:28,115
(Cross-counter again)

1692
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,185
(A strong valid strike on each other)

1693
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:36,584
- Get closer. - Yes.

1694
01:01:36,585 --> 01:01:38,794
Get closer.

1695
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:41,225
Yes. You're hitting her.

1696
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:42,394
That's right.

1697
01:01:42,395 --> 01:01:43,464
That's right. Use your stamina.

1698
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:44,625
Yes. Okay.

1699
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:47,065
(Round 1 ends.)

1700
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:48,565
- Good job. - That was good.

1701
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:50,934
(The opponent was superior in Round 1.)

1702
01:01:50,935 --> 01:01:52,275
All good.

1703
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,845
Among all the opponents she's met, I think she's the best.

1704
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:58,225
It was probably her first time getting hit like that.

1705
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:04,715
(Uie got punched hard throughout Round 1.)

1706
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:06,384
This is a very important experience.

1707
01:02:06,385 --> 01:02:07,984
Right. I'm sorry to say this, but she needs to get hit.

1708
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:09,084
- Yes. - She's doing great.

1709
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:10,884
(Because they've gone through it, )

1710
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:13,725
(they're worried about her even more.)

1711
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:15,225
It doesn't hurt.

1712
01:02:15,795 --> 01:02:16,894
- It doesn't hurt, right? - Yes.

1713
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,595
(Uie is as durable as her stamina.)

1714
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,164
More relax.

1715
01:02:20,165 --> 01:02:22,305
(Whereas the opponent is running out of breath.)

1716
01:02:22,465 --> 01:02:23,605
You go to the body.

1717
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:24,904
- Up. That's two. - She's so long.

1718
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:26,204
Because she has taller...

1719
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:27,475
She has longer hands.

1720
01:02:28,105 --> 01:02:31,145
And you have a really strong right hand. I like that.

1721
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:34,474
You don't jab. You just wait, so the opponent knows what's coming.

1722
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:36,914
When you jab, that's when she punches.

1723
01:02:36,915 --> 01:02:38,554
- So jab first? - Yes, that's why you got hit.

1724
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:39,584
If you're going to hit her, just hit her.

1725
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:41,265
- Otherwise, just get close to her. - Yes.

1726
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:43,131
- Uie, use all your stamina. - You're doing great.

1727
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,531
- You're doing amazing. - Use it all up.

1728
01:02:44,555 --> 01:02:45,994
The opponent is gathering her energy before punching you.

1729
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,571
But you have to attack her before she gathers it.

1730
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:48,665
Okay.

1731
01:02:49,695 --> 01:02:52,595
(My sparring begins now.)

1732
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:56,335
(What kind of match will she put on in Round 2?)

1733
01:02:56,705 --> 01:02:59,435
(Round 2 begins.)

1734
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,445
Let's go, girls.

1735
01:03:09,215 --> 01:03:11,615
(Uie approaches more aggressively compared to Round 1.)

1736
01:03:11,685 --> 01:03:13,715
Jab. Punch.

1737
01:03:14,485 --> 01:03:16,084
- Uie. That's right. - That's right!

1738
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:17,125
Yes. You got it.

1739
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:19,555
(Uie's signature one-two)

1740
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:23,995
(She chases after the opponent and flurries.)

1741
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:25,435
Yes. Go in.

1742
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,734
Yes. Don't take a break.

1743
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:29,804
Then the opponent can't gather her energy.

1744
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:31,004
Right. You got it.

1745
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:32,304
It's all about your stamina.

1746
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:33,834
Keep it up. Yes.

1747
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:35,944
Now, she can't gather her energy. That's right.

1748
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,044
Get closer.

1749
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:38,045
- Yes. - Way to go.

1750
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,875
Your opponent is nervous.

1751
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:42,844
Get closer.

1752
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:44,315
Keep it up. You're doing great.

1753
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:46,584
She can't gather her energy anymore. Oh, no. She got hit.

1754
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:48,061
Thirty seconds have passed. You have to go in.

1755
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:49,155
She's gathering energy.

1756
01:03:49,655 --> 01:03:51,284
- Yes. Get closer. - Yes, try one again.

1757
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:53,424
- Routine One. - That's right.

1758
01:03:53,425 --> 01:03:54,824
(Routine 1:1, 2, backstep, 1, 2)

1759
01:03:54,825 --> 01:03:55,894
- Try Routine One. - One, two.

1760
01:03:55,895 --> 01:03:56,895
- Again. - Yes.

1761
01:03:57,195 --> 01:03:58,595
- Routine One. - You have to focus.

1762
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:00,764
(She chases her opponent...)

1763
01:04:00,765 --> 01:04:02,405
(and throws a one-two.)

1764
01:04:02,535 --> 01:04:03,565
- Yes. - You got it.

1765
01:04:04,005 --> 01:04:06,374
(Followed by a cross-counter)

1766
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,404
- Yes. - You got it.

1767
01:04:07,405 --> 01:04:09,545
Hit. Yes. Good job.

1768
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:11,945
(The opponent is completely off guard.)

1769
01:04:12,045 --> 01:04:13,514
She's exhausted.

1770
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:14,575
Don't stop.

1771
01:04:15,445 --> 01:04:16,544
Look at the opponent. Yes.

1772
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:17,545
Now is your chance.

1773
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:19,455
She turned her head. Yes. She turned her head.

1774
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:21,814
Move around. Don't stay. Move around.

1775
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:24,055
(Bombarding with punches)

1776
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:26,595
(Pushing to the corner and flurrying with one-two)

1777
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:29,895
(The opponent is clearly slower than before.)

1778
01:04:30,095 --> 01:04:31,464
Circle out.

1779
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:32,595
Let's go. Thirty seconds.

1780
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:35,015
- The opponent wants to rest. - Don't stop.

1781
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:37,464
(Going straight to the opponent again)

1782
01:04:37,465 --> 01:04:38,465
- Okay. - That's right.

1783
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,705
(Throwing in a deep jab)

1784
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:45,515
- Go. - Get closer.

1785
01:04:45,775 --> 01:04:47,074
- Go! - That's right.

1786
01:04:47,075 --> 01:04:48,785
- That's right. Your stamina. - Hit her.

1787
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,444
There's a big gap in their stamina.

1788
01:04:50,445 --> 01:04:52,614
(Uie pushes...)

1789
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:54,885
(the opponent to the corner.)

1790
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:56,825
(Endless one-two)

1791
01:04:57,055 --> 01:04:59,154
- That's right. - Keep punching. Don't stop!

1792
01:04:59,155 --> 01:05:01,001
- Keep going. This can be a KO. - More. Why did you withdraw?

1793
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:02,225
More. Why did you withdraw?

1794
01:05:02,495 --> 01:05:04,124
- Why did you withdraw? - Don't stop.

1795
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:05,164
Why did you withdraw?

1796
01:05:05,165 --> 01:05:06,294
- Get closer. - You have to get closer.

1797
01:05:06,295 --> 01:05:08,095
- Go. - She's reviving.

1798
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:09,234
Yes.

1799
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:10,305
Last 40 seconds.

1800
01:05:10,535 --> 01:05:12,405
- Go. - Yes.

1801
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:14,405
(Uppercut in the gap)

1802
01:05:15,005 --> 01:05:16,044
- That's right. - Keep going.

1803
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,144
- Forty seconds. - Don't stop.

1804
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:18,175
Good job.

1805
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,144
(This time, Uie keeps pushing without stopping.)

1806
01:05:20,145 --> 01:05:21,675
- Get closer. - Yes.

1807
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:24,084
(When the opponent...)

1808
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:25,955
(lets her guard down...)

1809
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,284
(A punch in the face)

1810
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:29,355
Yes.

1811
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,254
Yes.

1812
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:32,295
Keep going.

1813
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:35,025
(The opponent's last counterattack)

1814
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,265
- Get closer. - Hands.

1815
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:39,865
(She pounds her with a tenacious flurry.)

1816
01:05:40,435 --> 01:05:41,935
- Stop. - Okay.

1817
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,765
(Round 2 ends.)

1818
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:45,905
Uie.

1819
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,504
- That's KO. - She was amazing.

1820
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:48,875
That was incredible.

1821
01:05:48,975 --> 01:05:49,975
- Good job. - What?

1822
01:05:50,105 --> 01:05:51,604
- Take it off. - What?

1823
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:53,274
- Wait. - What? What is it?

1824
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:54,374
- Good job. - Is it over?

1825
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,645
- It's over. - Yes, it's over.

1826
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,045
Yet it's over.

1827
01:05:57,046 --> 01:06:00,554
(The opponent did her best until she couldn't recover.)

1828
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:02,385
That is a good experience. All good.

1829
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,154
Applause to the two fighters who did their best.

1830
01:06:05,155 --> 01:06:07,894
(The two fighters did their best in sparring.)

1831
01:06:07,895 --> 01:06:10,294
Can you tell us how it was?

1832
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:12,165
Oh, my gosh. Look at my face.

1833
01:06:13,495 --> 01:06:14,865
She's very good.

1834
01:06:15,295 --> 01:06:16,734
She's very good.

1835
01:06:16,735 --> 01:06:18,034
But so good.

1836
01:06:18,035 --> 01:06:19,375
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1837
01:06:20,305 --> 01:06:23,044
Uie, you just sparred.

1838
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,675
You looked different in Round 1 and Round 2.

1839
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:26,944
To be honest,

1840
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:28,944
- when she punched me, - Right.

1841
01:06:28,945 --> 01:06:30,184
- it hurt, - Right.

1842
01:06:30,185 --> 01:06:32,185
But I could endure it.

1843
01:06:32,215 --> 01:06:33,284
- So... - Very good.

1844
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,214
In Round Two, I decided to give it a shot.

1845
01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:36,625
So I went close to her.

1846
01:06:37,085 --> 01:06:39,155
I think that was what worked.

1847
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,524
Marbie, I think...

1848
01:06:41,525 --> 01:06:44,295
you have a very strong punch.

1849
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:46,035
How long have you learned boxing?

1850
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,435
Two months passed.

1851
01:06:47,735 --> 01:06:49,004
- Two months? - Yes.

1852
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,965
- She's the same. - But why is she so good?

1853
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:52,534
But why is she so good?

1854
01:06:52,535 --> 01:06:54,104
- It doesn't make sense. - She was born with it.

1855
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:55,234
- Like In Ah. - Like In Ah.

1856
01:06:55,235 --> 01:06:57,945
My boyfriend. He's an assistant boxing coach.

1857
01:06:58,045 --> 01:06:59,114
And he said,

1858
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,014
"Hey, you. Fight." And then...

1859
01:07:01,015 --> 01:07:02,084
(Cool)

1860
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,914
- That's cool. - That's incredible.

1861
01:07:03,915 --> 01:07:06,015
What did you learn before boxing?

1862
01:07:06,515 --> 01:07:08,584
Back in high school, I played basketball.

1863
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:09,985
But I sing instead.

1864
01:07:10,185 --> 01:07:11,254
A singer?

1865
01:07:11,255 --> 01:07:13,695
What year did you debut?

1866
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:16,625
- A singer? When did you debut? - The same.

1867
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,395
I went on "The Voice UK 2017."

1868
01:07:20,095 --> 01:07:22,664
She's also a very famous singer...

1869
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:23,864
in Korea.

1870
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:25,041
(The senior singer: Your punch was pretty good.)

1871
01:07:25,065 --> 01:07:26,734
(The younger singer: I have a good punch.)

1872
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:27,775
Idol.

1873
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:29,344
- Do you know idols? - Yes.

1874
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,574
- Yes. Of course. - K-pop?

1875
01:07:30,575 --> 01:07:32,244
(Uie and Marbie. The boxing idols are formed.)

1876
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:33,714
- I'd say sister? - Sister.

1877
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:34,845
Sister.

1878
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:37,384
- So cute. - So cute.

1879
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:40,384
The coaches must've been impressed by her.

1880
01:07:40,385 --> 01:07:41,454
What did you think...

1881
01:07:41,455 --> 01:07:42,825
of their sparring?

1882
01:07:43,155 --> 01:07:44,685
You're doing so good.

1883
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:49,095
So strong even when you got strong punches a few times.

1884
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:50,864
You still kept going. Nice.

1885
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:52,234
Nice. All good. You're so strong.

1886
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,235
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1887
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:55,865
Same. Try to protect your chin with your shoulder.

1888
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,565
You fight like this.

1889
01:07:58,265 --> 01:08:00,034
That's the exact same thing our coach said.

1890
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,244
- She has to raise her guard. - I know that.

1891
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,405
- But I can't do it. - Right. That's what happens.

1892
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:06,544
(Uie's third sparring results:)

1893
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:07,974
(Strengths: Dogged enough to counterattack...)

1894
01:08:07,975 --> 01:08:09,214
(despite the opponent's attack)

1895
01:08:09,215 --> 01:08:15,414
(After the one-two, she can flurry using her stamina.)

1896
01:08:15,415 --> 01:08:23,895
(Points to improve: Her face is exposed due to the low guard.)

1897
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:26,034
Applause to the two fighters for their best match.

1898
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,035
(Their sparring gave them major experience.)

1899
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,294
- Thank you. - Yes.

1900
01:08:28,295 --> 01:08:29,764
- Thank you. - The senior and junior singers.

1901
01:08:29,765 --> 01:08:31,665
The senior and junior singers.

1902
01:08:31,765 --> 01:08:33,405
The third sparring.

1903
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:35,544
Sae Rok versus Saengchan.

1904
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:36,644
Please get ready.

1905
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:37,775
It's either do or die.

1906
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:40,815
Yes. Come on, girl.

1907
01:08:42,445 --> 01:08:44,214
(The biggest height difference among the sparring opponents)

1908
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:46,215
- Okay? Just stay strong, okay? - Yes.

1909
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:48,985
(Guard up.)

1910
01:08:49,185 --> 01:08:50,884
Like this, okay? Strong.

1911
01:08:50,885 --> 01:08:52,855
Not here. Here. Good.

1912
01:08:53,325 --> 01:08:54,754
(Due to the difference in their reaches, )

1913
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,715
(he emphasizes the guard in case of a long punch)

1914
01:08:58,725 --> 01:08:59,865
I can do it.

1915
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,334
Focus on what you've been doing, okay?

1916
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,364
I can do it.

1917
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:05,304
- Of course. - Undoubtedly.

1918
01:09:05,305 --> 01:09:07,065
- You can do it. - You're more than capable.

1919
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:08,305
You're more than capable.

1920
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,444
Keep punching.

1921
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,974
And when she gets close, give a two and turn.

1922
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:12,844
Just focus on that, okay?

1923
01:09:12,845 --> 01:09:14,075
Because she's short.

1924
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:15,314
- That'll get you win. - Okay.

1925
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:16,814
Even if you only do Routine One, you'll win.

1926
01:09:16,815 --> 01:09:17,815
Okay.

1927
01:09:18,485 --> 01:09:20,114
- Come forward. - Let's go.

1928
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,984
(Fighters to the center)

1929
01:09:21,985 --> 01:09:24,085
Let's play fair, okay?

1930
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:25,555
Touch gloves.

1931
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,425
Corners.

1932
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,165
We'll begin the third sparring.

1933
01:09:33,365 --> 01:09:34,365
Box.
(Round 1 begins.)

1934
01:09:36,435 --> 01:09:37,664
- You can do it. - Go.

1935
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:38,765
Do what you can do.

1936
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:43,974
Yes. Routine One.

1937
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,255
Do a feint and then Routine One.

1938
01:09:45,845 --> 01:09:47,774
(Going for the one-two according to her strategy)

1939
01:09:47,775 --> 01:09:49,214
(Valid strike 2, 3)

1940
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:50,385
(Valid strike)

1941
01:09:50,745 --> 01:09:53,785
(Successfully withdrawing)

1942
01:09:54,615 --> 01:09:55,654
(Followed by another one-two)

1943
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:56,884
(Valid strike 4)

1944
01:09:56,885 --> 01:09:58,125
(Followed by another one-two)

1945
01:09:59,095 --> 01:10:00,594
- Yes. Don't take a break. - Yes.

1946
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:01,771
(Sae Rok continues to record valid strikes.)

1947
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:05,395
(The opponent struggles due to Sae Rok's long reach.)

1948
01:10:05,525 --> 01:10:07,895
(As Sae Rok's flurry continues, )

1949
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:10,134
(the opponent decides to lower her aim.)

1950
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:11,165
Be careful.

1951
01:10:12,235 --> 01:10:15,074
(Sae Rok's continuous valid strike)

1952
01:10:15,075 --> 01:10:16,705
(Followed by...)

1953
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,315
(Groaning)

1954
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,744
(The opponent's strong body shot)

1955
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:23,745
Her punch is strong.

1956
01:10:23,746 --> 01:10:24,791
A strong punch on her stomach.

1957
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:25,831
- She has strong power. - Go.

1958
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,955
Turn around.

1959
01:10:29,085 --> 01:10:32,355
(She manages to withdraw and continues to attack.)

1960
01:10:33,455 --> 01:10:34,555
(Parry)

1961
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,295
(Valid body strike)

1962
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:44,765
(As Sae Rok counterattacks...)

1963
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,935
(Valid strike)

1964
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:49,205
Again.

1965
01:10:49,206 --> 01:10:51,175
(The opponent keeps throwing body shots.)

1966
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,575
- Watch carefully. - Goodness.

1967
01:10:53,075 --> 01:10:55,114
- Go. - Break free.

1968
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:56,745
(Sae Rok escapes while throwing jabs.)

1969
01:10:57,185 --> 01:10:58,284
Thirty seconds have passed.

1970
01:10:58,285 --> 01:10:59,485
That's it. Good.

1971
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:01,984
See that?

1972
01:11:01,985 --> 01:11:03,424
(She flies in with an amazing pose, )

1973
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,954
(evades Sae Rok's long jab, )

1974
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:06,824
(and lands a body shot.)

1975
01:11:06,825 --> 01:11:08,901
- She aims at the stomach. - Her foot is off the ground.

1976
01:11:08,925 --> 01:11:10,294
Because you're tall, she's targeting your body.

1977
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:12,165
Hit her in the face. Keep jabbing.

1978
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:15,234
(Carefully watching for the right timing)

1979
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,864
- Punch. - Okay.

1980
01:11:16,865 --> 01:11:19,035
- Punch and pivot. That's it. - Yes.

1981
01:11:19,135 --> 01:11:20,175
- Nice. - Good.

1982
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:21,874
- That's it. - Nice.

1983
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:24,675
Sae Rok, you're doing really well. Pivot.

1984
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:27,675
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

1985
01:11:28,515 --> 01:11:30,144
(Valid strike 2, 3)

1986
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,315

(Valid strike 6, Valid strike)

1989
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:39,125
(After many valid strikes)

1990
01:11:39,425 --> 01:11:40,894
- Good job. - Retreat.

1991
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:43,064
- Well done, Sae Rok. - Yes, nicely done.

1992
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,865
(Waiting for the right moment to attack)

1993
01:11:45,025 --> 01:11:46,865
- She's strong. - Yes. Punch her.

1994
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:49,405
- She's strong. - Yes. Punch her.

1995
01:11:49,865 --> 01:11:51,365
Try again. What's wrong?

1996
01:11:51,505 --> 01:11:52,535
Stop.

1997
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:54,834
One, two.

1998
01:11:54,835 --> 01:11:56,155
(Sae Rok crouches as if in pain.)

1999
01:11:57,345 --> 01:11:58,644
Breathe.

2000
01:11:58,645 --> 01:11:59,745
(Serious)

2001
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:02,114
One, two.

2002
01:12:02,115 --> 01:12:04,014
- I know a little. - She's tired?

2003
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,085
- Was that the liver? - One, two.

2004
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,555
(As Sae Rok threw a jab, )

2005
01:12:09,855 --> 01:12:12,225
(the opponent countered with a heavy body shot.)

2006
01:12:13,155 --> 01:12:16,825
(A fatal blow to the exposed stomach)

2007
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:19,834
Try again. What's wrong?

2008
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,105
(Sae Rok crashes down from the accumulated damages.)

2009
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,775
(Standing 8 count)

2010
01:12:28,175 --> 01:12:31,644
(She straightens up, )

2011
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:33,845
(but it doesn't seem easy.)

2012
01:12:34,075 --> 01:12:36,915
- I've been hit there too. - She'll strike again.

2013
01:12:37,045 --> 01:12:38,344
- Eight. - You can do it.

2014
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:40,685
(They cheer her on, )

2015
01:12:40,885 --> 01:12:45,625
(but if Sae Rok doesn't get up before the 8-count, )

2016
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:48,595
(the sparring will be over.)

2017
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:49,795
Eight.

2018
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:50,865
She'll strike again.

2019
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:54,064
- She'll definitely strike again. - Yes.

2020
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:56,305
- That's it. - Go, girl. Let's go.

2021
01:12:58,235 --> 01:13:00,275
- You can do it. - She recovers quickly.

2022
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:03,675
(Unshaken, Sae Rok boldly goes for the first attack.)

2023
01:13:03,805 --> 01:13:05,245
She'll aim at your stomach.

2024
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:07,474
She's coming for your stomach. See that?

2025
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:09,215
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

2026
01:13:09,915 --> 01:13:12,685
(Another body shot)

2027
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,584
She's coming for your stomach. See that?

2028
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:15,824
Don't attack until you've recovered.

2029
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:16,954
Retreat while jabbing.

2030
01:13:16,955 --> 01:13:18,354
- Move back as far as you can. - Yes.

2031
01:13:18,355 --> 01:13:19,515
Her eyes are on your stomach.

2032
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:21,675
(Recovering, she waits for the perfect opening.)

2033
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:23,495
- That's it. - Use your combinations.

2034
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,694
- Yes. - Throw straights. Punch.

2035
01:13:25,695 --> 01:13:27,535
- Take control. - Move around.

2036
01:13:27,795 --> 01:13:28,965
She's aiming your stomach.

2037
01:13:29,165 --> 01:13:30,865
(A proactive attack)

2038
01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:33,405
Punch. Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

2039
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,574
(Sae Rok dodges the attack...)

2040
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:37,575
(and counters with a long straight.)

2041
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,714
Punch. Yes, that's exactly what I meant.

2042
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:40,874
That was perfect timing.

2043
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,214
(Landing valid strikes to the face)

2044
01:13:42,215 --> 01:13:44,944
- They really use their long arms. - That's it.

2045
01:13:44,945 --> 01:13:47,055
- Keep going. - Her punches are strong.

2046
01:13:47,615 --> 01:13:49,014
- Your hand. - That's fast.

2047
01:13:49,015 --> 01:13:50,484
- Keep going. - Punch her.

2048
01:13:50,485 --> 01:13:51,824

Move back after you hit her.

2060
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:13,844
Retreat.

2061
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:14,975
(A powerful body shot)

2062
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:16,984
(An incredible power)

2063
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,045
(Staggering)

2064
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,615
- Go. - Retreat while pivoting.

2065
01:14:23,385 --> 01:14:24,454

(Round 1 ends.)

2067
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:27,154
Breathe. Inhale deeply.

2068
01:14:27,155 --> 01:14:28,155
It's okay.

2069
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:29,664
Breathe. Rest for a moment.

2070
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:30,765
(Round 1 was intense.)

2071
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:33,694
Great job. You've done really well.

2072
01:14:33,695 --> 01:14:34,964
Just keep doing what you just did.

2073
01:14:34,965 --> 01:14:36,564
The opponent will attack your stomach.

2074
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:38,764
After hitting her, step back. Okay?

2075
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,685
Step back with your footwork. You're doing well.

2076
01:14:42,605 --> 01:14:43,675
- Chin down. - No up.

2077
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:46,015

01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,615
- Okay? - Round Two.

2080
01:14:51,685 --> 01:14:53,284
She's done Muay Thai for a really long time.

2081
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:54,714
- Right? - You can tell?

2082
01:14:54,715 --> 01:14:55,924
She even lifted her leg earlier.

2083
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:57,654
She's done it for over ten years.

2084
01:14:57,655 --> 01:14:58,985
No, she began at age five.

2085
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,694
It's easy to tell.

2086
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:02,354
(Is she a veteran like Dong Hyun says?)

2087
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:03,924
Step back with your footwork.

2088
01:15:03,925 --> 01:15:04,995
You're doing well.

2089
01:15:08,265 --> 01:15:10,665

- Good luck, Sae Rok! - Good luck!

2091
01:15:12,635 --> 01:15:15,134
- Yes, right. - Be careful of body shots.

2092
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,175
Yes.

2093
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,005
- No. Move your head. - Punch her.

2094
01:15:18,075 --> 01:15:19,514
Jab.

2095
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,815

Try again.

2101
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,484
- Okay. - That's it.

2102
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,724
(She successfully hits and retreats again.)

2103
01:15:32,725 --> 01:15:35,295
- Nce. You did well moving back. - Exactly.

2104
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:37,865
- Your body. Step back. That's it. - Step back.

2105
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,095
- Punch. - Again.

2106
01:15:41,535 --> 01:15:44,464
(Keeping the opponent in check with jabs after attacking)

2107
01:15:44,465 --> 01:15:45,904
- Yes, nice. - Hit and retreat.

2108
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:47,474
- Good. - Good. Jab.

2109
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:48,934
Jab at her when she moves in, and pivot out.

2110
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:52,174
- Yes. Let's go. - Jab.

01:15:52,175 --> 01:15:55,045
(The opponent charges in on the coach's command.)

2112
01:15:55,615 --> 01:15:56,685
Jab.

2113
01:15:56,915 --> 01:15:58,344
- Retreat. - Sae Rok.

2114
01:15:58,345 --> 01:15:59,584
She can't reach you.

2115
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:01,015
- Move around. - Attack.

2116
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:03,985
(The opponent keeps pressing Sae Rok.)

2117
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:06,225
- Here she comes. - Good.

2118
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:09,765
Guard up! Nicely done.

2119
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:11,695

You did really well. That was perfect timing. Try again.

2123
01:16:18,465 --> 01:16:20,504
- Do it again. Keep going. - Stay on your right.

2124
01:16:20,505 --> 01:16:22,605
Immediately. That's it. Now retreat.

2125
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:24,775
- Nice one. - That's it. Now retreat.

2126
01:16:25,575 --> 01:16:27,375
(Valid strike)

2127
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,845
- Retreat. - Nice one-two.

2128
01:16:30,245 --> 01:16:32,855
(After striking the opponent, she even pivoted out.)

2129
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:35,455
(Preparing for the right moment to attack again)

2130
01:16:35,715 --> 01:16:38,725
Try again. You have to keep your eyes on her.

2131
01:16:39,055 --> 01:16:40,455
- Right away. - Gosh.

2132
01:16:41,155 --> 01:16:43,164
(The opponent blocks Sae Rok's lead hand...)

2133
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,495
(and launches a valid strike.)

2134
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:45,864
Don't get scared.

2135
01:16:45,865 --> 01:16:47,295
One minute to go. The final minute.

2136
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:49,835
She's going to attack you. Keep watching her.

2137
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:51,564
You're doing good!

2138
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,334
- Let's go. - Block her attacks.

2139
01:16:53,335 --> 01:16:54,511
(The opponent is using the same pattern.)

2140
01:16:54,535 --> 01:16:55,804
(Sae Rok calmly puts her guard up.)

2141
01:16:55,805 --> 01:16:58,075
Try it. Go in.

2142
01:16:58,445 --> 01:16:59,845
- That's it. - That's it.

2143
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,315
(A powerful straight)

2144
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:04,585
- That's it. - Nice.

2145
01:17:04,885 --> 01:17:06,815
- She took a strong hit. - Pivot.

2146
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:08,215
(However, )

2147
01:17:08,216 --> 01:17:11,455
(she immediately took a body shot.)

2148
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,895
(A fierce slugfest breaks out.)

2149
01:17:16,025 --> 01:17:18,225
- Yes. Go. - Attack and retreat.

2150
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:19,565
- Good one. - Good.

2151
01:17:19,895 --> 01:17:24,105
(The powerful straight punch slips past Sae Rok's attack.)

2152
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,805
- That looked like a strong hit. - Again.

2153
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,074
- Good. - Pivot.

2154
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:29,134
Don't forget.

2155
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:33,045
(While they're exchanging heavy blows)

2156
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,374
That's it.

2157
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:37,514
(A solid cross)

2158
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:39,814
- Again. - Breathe, Sae Rok.

2159
01:17:39,815 --> 01:17:40,885
Jump.

2160
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:42,925
- Jump. - One more time.

2161
01:17:43,055 --> 01:17:44,484
It's the last 15 seconds.

2162
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:46,794
- Jump, Sae Rok. - It's the last 15 seconds.

2163
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,424
(Using her last bit of energy, she attempts a jab.)

2164
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:49,425
(Groaning)

2165
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:50,624
(Valid strike 2)

2166
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,895
(Valid body shot)

2167
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:56,305
Retreat. Pivot.

2168
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:57,604
- Sae Rok. - Here she comes.

2169
01:17:57,605 --> 01:17:58,734
Go for it.

2170
01:17:58,735 --> 01:18:01,404
- That's it. Pivot. - Yes.

2171
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:02,474
Breathe.

2172
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:03,974
- Pivot. - Sae Rok.

2173
01:18:03,975 --> 01:18:06,145
- Go for it. Nice. - Nice.

2174
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:10,014
(Sae Rok throws punches until the very end.)

2175
01:18:10,015 --> 01:18:11,185
Don't counterattack.

2176
01:18:11,485 --> 01:18:13,214
- Nice. - Let's go.

2177
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:14,955
Nice.

2178
01:18:15,015 --> 01:18:18,155
(Sae Rok pivots out as she throws punches until the end.)

2179
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:19,794
Straighten your back, then pivot out.

2180
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,824
- Stop. - Okay.

2181
01:18:21,825 --> 01:18:23,025
(Round 2 ends.)

2182
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,265
- Well done. - Good job.

2183
01:18:26,265 --> 01:18:27,695
- Well done. - She endured it.

2184
01:18:28,465 --> 01:18:30,234
One punch landed perfectly.

2185
01:18:30,235 --> 01:18:32,064
- Good job. - Gosh.

2186
01:18:32,065 --> 01:18:33,504
You were so cool, Rocky.

2187
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,604
There was one punch...

2188
01:18:35,605 --> 01:18:37,805
- The counter. - that was a clean hit.

2189
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:41,145
Sir, thank you.

2190
01:18:41,545 --> 01:18:42,984
Thank you.

2191
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:44,684
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

2192
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,314
- Thank you. - Oh, thank you.

2193
01:18:46,315 --> 01:18:48,131
(Sharing the Korean-style gesture of gratitude)

2194
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:49,255
Goodness.

2195
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:52,054
When fighting her, Sae Rok was like a female warrior.

2196
01:18:52,055 --> 01:18:53,154
But now, she's all polite.

2197
01:18:53,155 --> 01:18:54,554
(From a fighter to Rocky Keum)

2198
01:18:54,555 --> 01:18:56,194
I made a guess outside the ring.

2199
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:58,195
I'm sure of this when it comes to Saengchan.

2200
01:18:58,295 --> 01:19:00,465
The way she throws her punches and moves...

2201
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:04,105
suggests that she started Muay Thai when she was 5.

2202
01:19:04,165 --> 01:19:07,875
When did you start boxing or practicing Muay Thai?

2203
01:19:08,205 --> 01:19:10,205
(Focused)

2204
01:19:10,905 --> 01:19:13,115
I've done Muay Thai for about ten years.

2205
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:15,674
(What?)

2206
01:19:15,675 --> 01:19:17,215
(10 years?)

2207
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,144
- Ten years. - You were spot on.

2208
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,215
I was spot on, right? Ten years.

2209
01:19:21,685 --> 01:19:24,284
I started Muay Thai when I was 12...

2210
01:19:24,285 --> 01:19:26,495
and taught myself boxing through YouTube.

2211
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:30,065
(She's been in over 20 matches.)

2212
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:33,835
(With strong kicks and punches, )

2213
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:37,235
(she's an unexpectedly skilled martial arts veteran.)

2214
01:19:37,365 --> 01:19:39,334
- She's a veteran. - She should be proud.

2215
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:42,735
We're really different in height, right?

2216
01:19:42,975 --> 01:19:46,814
Despite that, I got hit countless times.

2217
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:48,975
- Yes. - Getting hit on my body was...

2218
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,885
Receiving body shots was…

2219
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:54,785
If I say this on camera...

2220
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,624
- Would I be exposing my weakness? - The opponent...

2221
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:01,294
The opponent will...

2222
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:02,424
(I'm being serious.)

2223
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:04,365
No. Sae Rok has strong abs.

2224
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:06,264
- Did your stomach hurt? - My stomach...

2225
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,034
- I feel like I took... - Yes?

2226
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:11,004
- every body shot possible today. - I see.

2227
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:12,534
- Really. - It was a shock.

2228
01:20:12,535 --> 01:20:14,335
It was painful too.

2229
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,974
Until now, I'd been scared of getting hit,

2230
01:20:15,975 --> 01:20:17,374
which kept me from moving in.

2231
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:19,274
Today, my goal was...

2232
01:20:19,275 --> 01:20:22,214
to throw as many punches as I could until the end,

2233
01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:24,785
even if I was scared and took hits.

2234
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,555
(During her first sparring, )

2235
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:30,454
(Sae Rok missed the timing and hesitated, )

2236
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:34,225
(allowing the opponent to land a hit.)

2237
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:36,424
(During the second sparring, )

2238
01:20:36,425 --> 01:20:39,935
(she made many valid strikes.)

2239
01:20:40,395 --> 01:20:42,234
(But her moves were still passive, )

2240
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:44,735
(leaving the opponent to lead the attacks.)

2241
01:20:45,905 --> 01:20:51,375
(The sparrings had always left her with disappointment.)

2242
01:20:51,545 --> 01:20:53,315
(And today, )

2243
01:20:53,545 --> 01:20:59,115
(Sae Rok attacked proactively...)

2244
01:20:59,485 --> 01:21:03,824
(and landed the most valid strikes.)

2245
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,054
- Of... - You did really well.

2246
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:06,825
- everything I've done, - She did so well.

2247
01:21:06,925 --> 01:21:08,524
That's the one I'm proud of.

2248
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:10,124
- Well done. - You did an amazing job.

2249
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,295
You did really well.

2250
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:14,735
I was so surprised.

2251
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,635
Even when she got a heavy punch to the body,

2252
01:21:17,765 --> 01:21:20,674
she still found some power to stay in the ring...

2253
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,275
and did so well.

2254
01:21:22,735 --> 01:21:25,474
(During Round 1)

2255
01:21:25,475 --> 01:21:29,475
(there was a standing 8 count due to getting hit by a heavy blow.)

2256
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:33,684
(But Sae Rok overcame the pain...)

2257
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:36,784
(and fought until the end.)

2258
01:21:36,785 --> 01:21:38,024
I applaud that.

2259
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:39,025
That's so good.
Thank you.

2260
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:45,024
Because Sae Rok's arms are longer than her opponent's,

2261
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:48,634
if she uses that advantage and moves faster,

2262
01:21:48,635 --> 01:21:55,604
it could become a lethal weapon for her.

2263
01:21:55,605 --> 01:21:57,174
Yes. Thank you.

2264
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:59,104
(An objective feedback from the veteran)

2265
01:21:59,105 --> 01:22:01,615
For me personally, defense is the best offense.

2266
01:22:01,715 --> 01:22:04,414
Your chin is up, and your head is up.

2267
01:22:04,415 --> 01:22:06,045
Your whole body is open.

2268
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:07,584
Total defense.

2269
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:09,254
Chin down. Hands up.

2270
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:10,525
Your area is closed.

2271
01:22:10,685 --> 01:22:12,025
And like this, you can work.

2272
01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:13,595
Yes. Beautiful.

2273
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:14,854
- You got it. - Okay.

2274
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:15,895
You got it.

2275
01:22:16,155 --> 01:22:17,265
Protect.

2276
01:22:18,395 --> 01:22:20,094
(Sae Rok's third sparring results:)

2277
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:21,994
(Strengths: Proactice attacks to land valid strikes)

2278
01:22:21,995 --> 01:22:29,004
(Showing a willingness to use techniques)

2279
01:22:29,005 --> 01:22:34,144
(Points to improve: Defense is slow after attacking, )

2280
01:22:34,145 --> 01:22:39,485
(leaving her vulnerable to heavy strikes)

2281
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,954
You performed well against a highly experienced boxer.

2282
01:22:43,955 --> 01:22:45,124
Well done.

2283
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,624
- You were really cool. - For real.

2284
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,054
- That was the best sparring. - That was a great match.

2285
01:22:48,055 --> 01:22:50,394
(An intense sparring session recognized by everyone)

2286
01:22:50,395 --> 01:22:51,865
Saengchan, I love you.

2287
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:53,134
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2288
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,395
Let's get ready for the last sparring.

2289
01:22:55,435 --> 01:22:57,834
Seol In Ah versus Madeline.

2290
01:22:57,835 --> 01:22:58,864
Get ready to spar.

2291
01:22:58,865 --> 01:22:59,974
Okay.

2292
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,305
Let's go, Mad.

2293
01:23:01,705 --> 01:23:03,305
Which one do you want, champion?

2294
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:04,544
(Laughing)

2295
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:05,545
This one is fine.

2296
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:07,275
I think this one will be better.

2297
01:23:08,575 --> 01:23:11,314
(The opponent wears her gloves by herself.)

2298
01:23:11,315 --> 01:23:13,615
Show your skills. It's good for you too.

2299
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,214
I think I should use my experience.

2300
01:23:16,215 --> 01:23:19,084
Yes. Stay confident. Just start easy.

2301
01:23:19,085 --> 01:23:20,555
- See what you're made of. - Okay.

2302
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,695
- Hit and don't get hit. - Okay.

2303
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,265
I think she's a little bit scared. Maybe.

2304
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:27,794
Out of the four,

2305
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:28,795
I think...

2306
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:30,781
- she's the most experienced. - She looks good, right?

2307
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,404
Fight like you always do.

2308
01:23:32,405 --> 01:23:33,504
Stay calm. Don't worry.

2309
01:23:33,505 --> 01:23:34,505
It's okay to take a hit.

2310
01:23:35,435 --> 01:23:36,744
(It's my turn to fight!)

2311
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,005
We'll start the match.

2312
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:39,675
All right. To the center.

2313
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:42,214
Fair play.

2314
01:23:42,215 --> 01:23:43,245
- Okay? - Yes.

2315
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,385
Touch gloves.

2316
01:23:44,785 --> 01:23:45,845
Corners.

2317
01:23:47,685 --> 01:23:48,955
Good luck, Seol In Ah.

2318
01:23:49,055 --> 01:23:50,625
Okay?

2319
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:52,025
Okay?

2320
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:54,695
Box!

2321
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,656
- Good luck, Seol In Ah! - Good luck, Seol In Ah!

2322
01:23:59,495 --> 01:24:00,695
Good luck, Madeline!

2323
01:24:02,095 --> 01:24:03,305
Good luck, Madeline!

2324
01:24:03,965 --> 01:24:05,005
You're standing firm.

2325
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:06,575
Yes. Short jabs.

2326
01:24:06,805 --> 01:24:08,275
(A low strike after a feint)

2327
01:24:08,735 --> 01:24:09,905
Stronger!

2328
01:24:10,105 --> 01:24:12,144
(A low feint, )

2329
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:13,674
(and then a high straight)

2330
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:14,844
- Nice. - Jab.

2331
01:24:14,845 --> 01:24:15,885
(Another valid jab strike)

2332
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:17,814
(The opponent counters immediately.)

2333
01:24:17,815 --> 01:24:19,215
(However, )

2334
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:21,454
(In Ah raises her guard quickly, )

2335
01:24:21,455 --> 01:24:23,555
(evades the opponent's jab, )

2336
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:26,854
(and keeps an eye on her movements.)

2337
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:28,255
She's taken aback.

2338
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,665
(The opponent closes in quickly.)

2339
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,765
(In Ah moves across the entire ring to find the right timing.)

2340
01:24:38,635 --> 01:24:39,665
- Nice. - She's good.

2341
01:24:41,505 --> 01:24:43,374
(In Ah's guard)

2342
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,644
(The opponent's jab and body shot)

2343
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:46,875
(Dodging her straight)

2344
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,945
Guard up. Yes.

2345
01:24:49,045 --> 01:24:50,084
That just now was great.

2346
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,744
- The opponent is good. - Right?

2347
01:24:51,745 --> 01:24:53,131
- She seems experienced in matches. - Yes.

2348
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:54,214
Here she comes.

2349
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:55,215
Block it.

2350
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,155
- Here she comes. Block it. Nice. - Look at her.

2351
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,801
- That was amazing. - Thirty seconds have passed.

2352
01:24:58,825 --> 01:25:00,895
(In Ah looks for the perfect moment to strike.)

2353
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:03,225
(The opponent has her guard up.)

2354
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,094
(In Ah's high-low combination)

2355
01:25:05,095 --> 01:25:06,225
(The opponent's body shot)

2356
01:25:06,495 --> 01:25:08,135
(Another cross-counter)

2357
01:25:09,935 --> 01:25:11,035
What a strong punch.

2358
01:25:13,535 --> 01:25:14,574
(Dodge)

2359
01:25:14,575 --> 01:25:17,874
(A tense exchange of dodges)

2360
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,144
- The two... - You're doing great.

2361
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:20,615
Are having proper sparring.

2362
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,945
(Neither of them is taking their eyes off the other.)

2363
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:29,255
(A suspenseful back-and-forth)

2364
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:33,054
(In Ah attacks first with a body shot.)

2365
01:25:33,055 --> 01:25:35,895
(The opponent counters with a high-low combination.)

2366
01:25:39,865 --> 01:25:41,064
Here she comes.

2367
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:42,764
Do a cross-counter. Throw a straight.

2368
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:43,835
(Dodge 2)

2369
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:45,334
(Dodge)

2370
01:25:45,335 --> 01:25:46,774
Both are...

2371
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:48,374
(Parry, Dodge)

2372
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:49,435
Nice.

2373
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:50,645
That's it. Keep watching.

2374
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:54,545
(Cross-counter)

2375
01:25:54,845 --> 01:25:57,115
Yes. Just like that.

2376
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,984
(Dodging and guarding)

2377
01:25:58,985 --> 01:26:00,815
(An intense match)

2378
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,454
The last 30 seconds.

2379
01:26:02,455 --> 01:26:04,555
Thirty seconds. The last 30 seconds.

2380
01:26:05,185 --> 01:26:06,795
(The opponent quickly moves in.)

2381
01:26:07,555 --> 01:26:08,955
(Valid strike)

2382
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:12,525
(But In Ah retreats after a counterattack.)

2383
01:26:12,895 --> 01:26:14,194
- Nice. - Yes.

2384
01:26:14,195 --> 01:26:15,911
Backing up after a hit helps you dodge, right?

2385
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:17,364
How do you avoid that punch?

2386
01:26:17,365 --> 01:26:18,434
Well done.

2387
01:26:18,435 --> 01:26:19,435
Both of them are good.

2388
01:26:19,935 --> 01:26:21,074
Just like that.

2389
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,734
Nice, In Ah. You're doing great.

2390
01:26:22,735 --> 01:26:24,444
Keep watching her. That's right.

2391
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:26,044
(A well-timed cross)

2392
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:27,074
Yes. Keep your eyes on her.

2393
01:26:27,075 --> 01:26:29,845
(In Ah stays focused until the end.)

2394
01:26:30,845 --> 01:26:31,915
Ten seconds.

2395
01:26:34,785 --> 01:26:36,924
(She blocks high, weaves, )

2396
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,755
(and follows with a right hook.)

2397
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:42,294
(Dodging and guarding on repeat)

2398
01:26:42,295 --> 01:26:43,424
(Cross-counter)

2399
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:45,524
(In Ah tries a one-two combination.)

2400
01:26:45,525 --> 01:26:46,635
Stop.

2401
01:26:47,265 --> 01:26:48,494
(However, she let the opponent land a hook.)

2402
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,764
(Valid strike)

2403
01:26:49,765 --> 01:26:50,834
(Round 1 ends.)

2404
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:52,065
Okay. Well done.

2405
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,335
Good job. You did really well.

2406
01:26:55,405 --> 01:26:56,474
Nice.

2407
01:26:56,475 --> 01:26:58,844
(Round 1 was full of intense mind games.)

2408
01:26:58,845 --> 01:27:00,075
When the opponent attacked,

2409
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:01,221
you countered at the same time.

2410
01:27:01,245 --> 01:27:03,145
That was amazing. I'm serious.

2411
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:04,484
When you pivoted after the straight,

2412
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:05,914
the opponent missed you.

2413
01:27:05,915 --> 01:27:07,254
But what should you have done?

2414
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,655
- A one-two combination. - One-two.

2415
01:27:08,715 --> 01:27:09,785
A one-two combination.

2416
01:27:12,855 --> 01:27:16,294
(After attacking, In Ah dodged with a pivot.)

2417
01:27:16,295 --> 01:27:20,065
(However, she hesitated and missed her chance to strike.)

2418
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:23,064
Had you done that, it would've been great.

2419
01:27:23,065 --> 01:27:24,934
The opponent is a great boxer.

2420
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:26,234
- She is. She's really good. - Right?

2421
01:27:26,235 --> 01:27:27,404
She watched you before attacking.

2422
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,835
It's a tight match between the two of you.

2423
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:31,704
All good.

2424
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,775
- It's okay? - Yes, so good. Beautiful.

2425
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,614
Now, let her work.

2426
01:27:35,615 --> 01:27:39,684
(Round 2 strategy: Quickly counter and guard when the opponent attacks)

2427
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:40,784
Close the distance.

2428
01:27:40,785 --> 01:27:42,031
- "Close the distance." Okay. - Yes.

2429
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:43,884
- Show them. - Okay.

2430
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:44,984
- Girl, go. - Let's go.

2431
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:46,895
Let's go. And good food after.

2432
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:49,095
(Relaxed)

2433
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:50,865
Breathe.

2434
01:27:51,425 --> 01:27:52,725
You're doing well, okay?

2435
01:27:52,995 --> 01:27:54,165
In Ah, you're doing great.

2436
01:27:54,665 --> 01:27:58,405
(Let's fight harder in Round 2.)

2437
01:27:58,535 --> 01:28:00,935
(Round 2 begins.)

2438
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:07,415
(In Ah strikes as soon as the match begins.)

2439
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:11,584
(The opponent doesn't hesitate to counterattack.)

2440
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:12,745
(Valid strike)

2441
01:28:12,885 --> 01:28:14,055
(Guard)

2442
01:28:14,215 --> 01:28:15,255
(Valid strike 2)

2443
01:28:15,355 --> 01:28:16,684
(The opponent's powerful right hook)

2444
01:28:16,685 --> 01:28:17,725
Your head.

2445
01:28:17,885 --> 01:28:19,654
(Unlike Round 1)

2446
01:28:19,655 --> 01:28:21,195
(the opponent attacks relentlessly.)

2447
01:28:21,695 --> 01:28:23,054
It's okay, In Ah.

2448
01:28:23,055 --> 01:28:24,265
Stay calm and counter.

2449
01:28:24,865 --> 01:28:26,465
- Watch out for the body shots. - In Ah.

2450
01:28:26,695 --> 01:28:27,964
You're doing well, In Ah.

2451
01:28:27,965 --> 01:28:30,905
(Keeping a distance from the fierce opponent)

2452
01:28:32,005 --> 01:28:34,374
(Retreating after a straight)

2453
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,504
Right now, In Ah.

2454
01:28:35,505 --> 01:28:37,244
(In Ah's powerful straight)

2455
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,245
- Yes. - That's it.

2456
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,515
(Another intense exchange of blows)

2457
01:28:40,745 --> 01:28:42,314
(The opponent's high-low combination)

2458
01:28:42,315 --> 01:28:43,415
(Cross-counter)

2459
01:28:43,815 --> 01:28:46,684
(The opponent's body shot, In Ah's straight)

2460
01:28:46,685 --> 01:28:47,814
- You did everything. - You're doing well.

2461
01:28:47,815 --> 01:28:48,855
You're doing great.

2462
01:28:49,155 --> 01:28:51,155
The fact that you have your guard up is amazing.

2463
01:28:51,385 --> 01:28:52,654
Nice one. Here she comes.

2464
01:28:52,655 --> 01:28:53,725
That's it.

2465
01:28:55,695 --> 01:28:57,325
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

2466
01:28:59,825 --> 01:29:00,864
Here she comes again.

2467
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:02,095
- Endure it. - Your guard.

2468
01:29:02,395 --> 01:29:03,834
Here she comes. Yes.

2469
01:29:03,835 --> 01:29:05,081
(She tried a low body shot after guarding.)

2470
01:29:05,105 --> 01:29:06,905
Chin down.

2471
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:08,035
(Staggering)

2472
01:29:08,275 --> 01:29:09,905
- Nice. - Punch her.

2473
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,444
(In Ah's dodge...)

2474
01:29:12,445 --> 01:29:14,174
(causes the opponent to lose her balance.)

2475
01:29:14,175 --> 01:29:16,045
(But In Ah missed her chance to attack.)

2476
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,715
(The opponent regained her balance in the meantime.)

2477
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:22,184
(A series of fast strikes)

2478
01:29:22,185 --> 01:29:23,625
- Okay. - Wake up.

2479
01:29:23,785 --> 01:29:25,384
(Distancing herself with a wide punch)

2480
01:29:25,385 --> 01:29:26,725
- Get a grip. - Attack.

2481
01:29:29,455 --> 01:29:30,895
- Wake up. - Pivot out.

2482
01:29:32,425 --> 01:29:34,895
(A rapid series of attacks from the opponent in an instant)

2483
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:36,734
(Getting hit in a flash...)

2484
01:29:36,735 --> 01:29:38,834
(again and again)

2485
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:40,505
(The jab landed perfectly.)

2486
01:29:41,435 --> 01:29:42,475
Retreat.

2487
01:29:43,705 --> 01:29:44,875
Wake up.

2488
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,305
The opponent is incredible.

2489
01:29:46,475 --> 01:29:48,035
- She's great. - How did they find her?

2490
01:29:48,075 --> 01:29:49,445
Really, she's amazing.

2491
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,185
Catch your breath, In Ah.

2492
01:29:53,415 --> 01:29:57,185
(In Ah circles the ring to save her stamina.)

2493
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:00,055
Cross-counter. That's it.

2494
01:30:00,195 --> 01:30:01,954
(She backed off after the cross-counter.)

2495
01:30:01,955 --> 01:30:02,955
Yes.

2496
01:30:03,225 --> 01:30:05,965
(A perfectly timed cross)

2497
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:08,465
(Valid strike)

2498
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:09,995
You did it.

2499
01:30:10,335 --> 01:30:11,865
- Well done. - You can do it.

2500
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:13,334
Go for it.

2501
01:30:13,335 --> 01:30:14,374
(Valid strike 2)

2502
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,375
Retreat.

2503
01:30:16,905 --> 01:30:18,775
(Screaming)

2504
01:30:18,905 --> 01:30:21,074
(Filling her eyes with determination again)

2505
01:30:21,075 --> 01:30:22,115
Attack. That's it.

2506
01:30:23,075 --> 01:30:24,084
Attack. That's it.

2507
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:25,085
(Valid strike)
Retreat.

2508
01:30:26,115 --> 01:30:27,515
Punch and retreat. Retreat.

2509
01:30:28,985 --> 01:30:30,855
Counter! Just like that.

2510
01:30:33,155 --> 01:30:35,595
(In Ah's powerful straight punch)

2511
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:40,234
(In Ah attacks aggressively.)

2512
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:41,795
Nice one. Just like that!

2513
01:30:42,465 --> 01:30:43,465
Good.

2514
01:30:43,865 --> 01:30:45,964
(She attacks again with full fighting spirit.)

2515
01:30:45,965 --> 01:30:46,974
Duck.

2516
01:30:46,975 --> 01:30:48,035
(Groaning)

2517
01:30:49,105 --> 01:30:50,644
(A wide right hook from the opponent)

2518
01:30:50,645 --> 01:30:52,645
(Weaving)

2519
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:55,275
(Body shot)

2520
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,015
(Full of dogged spirit)

2521
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:00,614
- Go. - In Ah.

2522
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:02,955
- It's okay, In Ah. - One-two.

2523
01:31:03,085 --> 01:31:04,125
Come on.

2524
01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:06,025
(Come at me if you can.)

2525
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:08,625
You're the best. You are doing really well today.

2526
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:11,224
Nice. I'm really happy.

2527
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:13,835
- Good. Let's try again. - Backstep.

2528
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,694
(The opponent's body shot)

2529
01:31:15,695 --> 01:31:16,695
(In Ah's cross-counter)

2530
01:31:16,696 --> 01:31:18,604
(As soon as the 10-second signal rings, )

2531
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:20,735
(the two boxers launch their final attack.)

2532
01:31:22,235 --> 01:31:24,304
- You're doing great. - That's it.

2533
01:31:24,305 --> 01:31:26,505
- Well done. - Just like that.

2534
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:28,244
- Go for it. - Nice one.

2535
01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:32,314
(Despite taking hits, In Ah fights until the very end.)

2536
01:31:32,315 --> 01:31:33,785
Move around.

2537
01:31:33,885 --> 01:31:35,785
- This isn't easy. - Five seconds.

2538
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:37,684
- Okay. Stop. - Nice.

2539
01:31:37,685 --> 01:31:38,685
Thank you.

2540
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,924
- Thank you so much. - Awesome.

2541
01:31:40,925 --> 01:31:42,955
Thank you so much.

2542
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:45,625
- Thank you. - Very good.

2543
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:47,835
- Thank you so much. So good. - Thank you.

2544
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,365
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2545
01:31:49,835 --> 01:31:52,034
- Thank you so much. - You're a professional boxer.

2546
01:31:52,035 --> 01:31:53,874
You're a professional boxer.

2547
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,174
A professional fighter.

2548
01:31:56,175 --> 01:31:57,605
(Laughing)

2549
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,974
- She's the best. - She's really good at boxing.

2550
01:31:59,975 --> 01:32:02,245
Wasn't this random? How did this happen?

2551
01:32:02,545 --> 01:32:04,915
Had we fought her, we would've been knocked out.

2552
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:08,154
(Gosh, I'm tired.)

2553
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,585
Do you know that the opponent took more hits?

2554
01:32:10,885 --> 01:32:12,254
She's an amazing boxer.

2555
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:14,725
Yet you caught her off guard more than she did you.

2556
01:32:16,025 --> 01:32:17,125
She's too good.

2557
01:32:17,425 --> 01:32:18,864
Why do I end up with boxers like her?

2558
01:32:18,865 --> 01:32:20,864
In Ah, she was an outstanding boxer.

2559
01:32:20,865 --> 01:32:22,595
- Right? - But you did better than her.

2560
01:32:22,935 --> 01:32:24,164
- Great job today. - In Ah.

2561
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:26,704
You fought an incredible opponent.

2562
01:32:26,705 --> 01:32:27,974
It was a valuable experience.

2563
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:29,904
The boxers were drawn at random,

2564
01:32:29,905 --> 01:32:31,404
and you faced a valuable opponent.

2565
01:32:31,405 --> 01:32:32,474
- I agree. - Exactly.

2566
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:34,115
(The draw picked the right aces.)

2567
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,045
She is decent. She was really good, wasn't she?

2568
01:32:38,445 --> 01:32:39,585
She has grit.

2569
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:41,985
Well done, girl.

2570
01:32:42,485 --> 01:32:43,824
- Yes. - Yes.

2571
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:45,685
She's strong. A surprise.

2572
01:32:45,725 --> 01:32:48,124
The last sparring was between...

2573
01:32:48,125 --> 01:32:50,595
- In Ah and Madeline. - Right.

2574
01:32:50,925 --> 01:32:52,724
Each match kept surpassing the last.

2575
01:32:52,725 --> 01:32:54,325
Please give the two a round of applause.

2576
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:57,164
- Thank you. Thank you so much. - The best.

2577
01:32:57,165 --> 01:32:58,604
- First off... - You're the best.

2578
01:32:58,605 --> 01:32:59,704
Thank you.

2579
01:32:59,705 --> 01:33:01,705
(A rare praise, in Korean, from the foreign coach)

2580
01:33:02,175 --> 01:33:05,644
Before I even ask how the sparring went,

2581
01:33:05,645 --> 01:33:07,675
it's crystal clear. Madeline...

2582
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:10,714
She's a real boxer. A professional boxer.

2583
01:33:10,715 --> 01:33:12,515
She clearly has a lot of experience.

2584
01:33:12,645 --> 01:33:15,214
I've been training in mixed martial arts for five years.

2585
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:16,284
- Five years? - Five years?

2586
01:33:16,285 --> 01:33:17,485
Five years. Exactly.

2587
01:33:18,155 --> 01:33:20,455
(No wonder.)

2588
01:33:20,555 --> 01:33:22,094
- And then... - How many MMA fights?

2589
01:33:22,095 --> 01:33:24,094
- I've had 21 fights. - What?

2590
01:33:24,095 --> 01:33:25,525
(About 21 fights)

2591
01:33:25,695 --> 01:33:28,034
- She's an MMA fighter. - She's unbelievable.

2592
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:29,495
What about your record?

2593
01:33:30,735 --> 01:33:32,935
I've had 21 fights, and I've lost 5 fights.

2594
01:33:35,035 --> 01:33:36,434
Sixteen wins, five losses.

2595
01:33:36,435 --> 01:33:38,204
(An impressive record of 16 wins and 5 losses)

2596
01:33:38,205 --> 01:33:39,275
Madeline.

2597
01:33:39,505 --> 01:33:41,415
- Thank you so much. - We...

2598
01:33:42,415 --> 01:33:44,515
(Relentless kicks...)

2599
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:48,285
(and powerful punches)

2600
01:33:49,015 --> 01:33:53,185
(A veteran among veterans)

2601
01:33:53,285 --> 01:33:54,994
- She has strong punches... - No wonder.

2602
01:33:54,995 --> 01:33:56,355
And fights in a high weight class.

2603
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:57,895
She's simply a great boxer.

2604
01:33:58,025 --> 01:34:00,894
This will be a chance for In Ah to grow.

2605
01:34:00,895 --> 01:34:03,765
The sparring was great. She's very strong. Yes.

2606
01:34:03,865 --> 01:34:05,764
She's not just strong,

2607
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:08,305
- but her skill level is quite high. - Thank you.

2608
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:12,175
I wasn't expecting her to be so strong, so it was very surprising.

2609
01:34:13,075 --> 01:34:14,274
(It's an honor.)

2610
01:34:14,275 --> 01:34:16,314
- Seol In Ah... - Thank you.

2611
01:34:16,315 --> 01:34:17,984
Is a famous actress in Korea...

2612
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:20,614
and has been boxing for only three months.

2613
01:34:20,615 --> 01:34:21,684
- A new boxer. - Three months?

2614
01:34:21,685 --> 01:34:23,254
- Just three months. - Three months.

2615
01:34:23,255 --> 01:34:25,554
Yes, let's go. Her new career is boxing.

2616
01:34:25,555 --> 01:34:27,695
- Really? - Yes, let's go.

2617
01:34:27,925 --> 01:34:28,994
- Yes. - A professional boxer?

2618
01:34:28,995 --> 01:34:30,624
Now. Let's go. Yes.

2619
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:32,124
(Even a veteran has acknowledged Simba Seol.)

2620
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,094
I was very impressed by your skills.

2621
01:34:34,095 --> 01:34:35,234
You fight backwards.

2622
01:34:35,235 --> 01:34:37,204
Some professional fighters can't fight backwards.

2623
01:34:37,205 --> 01:34:38,905
- She's really good. - Thank you.

2624
01:34:39,235 --> 01:34:42,134
Stay focused and train. Very good. I liked your work.

2625
01:34:42,135 --> 01:34:43,604
The coach just now...

2626
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:45,844
That scene really impressed me too.

2627
01:34:45,845 --> 01:34:47,314
I don't know if you'll remember.

2628
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:49,044
Right around here,

2629
01:34:49,045 --> 01:34:50,544
you got hit and must have felt the pain.

2630
01:34:50,545 --> 01:34:52,315
But then you moved to about here...

2631
01:34:52,445 --> 01:34:54,554
and signaled, "Let's fight over here."

2632
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:55,614
- I did? - Don't you remember?

2633
01:34:55,615 --> 01:34:56,685
Not at all.

2634
01:34:57,855 --> 01:35:00,655
(During Round 2, after a slugfest, )

2635
01:35:01,695 --> 01:35:04,095
(In Ah took a heavy blow.)

2636
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:05,324
(But she created distance by stepping back.)

2637
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:06,625
(Come at me!)

2638
01:35:07,165 --> 01:35:10,365
(Showing off that she can continue fighting)

2639
01:35:10,435 --> 01:35:12,664
I thought you had taken a hit, but suddenly you were like,

2640
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,275
"I won't dodge, so come at me."

2641
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:16,704
I felt it in my head.

2642
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:19,175
Gosh. In Ah.

2643
01:35:19,475 --> 01:35:21,814
- You went up against... - I did.

2644
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:23,575
- a strong opponent. - Yes.

2645
01:35:23,645 --> 01:35:25,584
Firstly, Madeline is super strong.

2646
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:27,484
I somehow kept fighting...

2647
01:35:27,485 --> 01:35:29,615
strong opponents.

2648
01:35:29,755 --> 01:35:30,984
But she had the most powerful punches.

2649
01:35:30,985 --> 01:35:31,985
You're right.

2650
01:35:31,986 --> 01:35:33,584
I thought she'd focus on my eyes,

2651
01:35:33,585 --> 01:35:35,324
so I planned to intimidate her with them.

2652
01:35:35,325 --> 01:35:37,765
Instead of looking at my eyes, she kept her eyes...

2653
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:39,325
- on my legs and fists. - Yes.

2654
01:35:39,365 --> 01:35:42,735
When I fight, I'm always looking at their chest.

2655
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:45,804
Because for MMA, it's full-body.

2656
01:35:45,805 --> 01:35:47,435
You can see where people go.

2657
01:35:48,105 --> 01:35:49,904
I've learned a valuable lesson from you.

2658
01:35:49,905 --> 01:35:52,075
- You're a star. - Thank you so much. Thank you.

2659
01:35:52,445 --> 01:35:54,874
(In Ah's third sparring results:)

2660
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:57,014
(Strengths: Hit-and-run skills and defense have gotten better)

2661
01:35:57,015 --> 01:36:03,755
(Can stop attacks and take control with a cross-counter)

2662
01:36:03,785 --> 01:36:07,254
(Points to improve: Misses instant openings)

2663
01:36:07,255 --> 01:36:11,925
(Hesitating may lead to rapid counters)

2664
01:36:12,025 --> 01:36:13,664
- Thanks, In Ah. - We're grateful...

2665
01:36:13,665 --> 01:36:14,941
- We love you. - for such a match.

2666
01:36:14,965 --> 01:36:16,794
If it had been one of us instead of you,

2667
01:36:16,795 --> 01:36:18,234
we would have been knocked out.

2668
01:36:18,235 --> 01:36:20,305
- For real. - I might've been taken to the ER.

2669
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:21,965
We wouldn't be able to return to Korea.

2670
01:36:22,075 --> 01:36:24,274
Actually, the goal...

2671
01:36:24,275 --> 01:36:26,304
- of off-season training... - Yes?

2672
01:36:26,305 --> 01:36:28,915
- is for such sparring. - It was spot on.

2673
01:36:28,975 --> 01:36:30,814
The plane ticket wasn't wasted.

2674
01:36:30,815 --> 01:36:32,745
Exactly. That was what I meant.

2675
01:36:33,285 --> 01:36:35,154
The sparring was what we were looking for.

2676
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:37,014
Please give a round of applause...

2677
01:36:37,015 --> 01:36:39,684
to the two boxers for an outstanding sparring match.

2678
01:36:39,685 --> 01:36:42,725
Seol In Ah and Madeline are so cool.

2679
01:36:42,855 --> 01:36:44,424
We're truly grateful.

2680
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:46,124
Our boxers have matches next week,

2681
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,694
- For sure. - and being able to spar...

2682
01:36:47,695 --> 01:36:49,794
with the best boxers was a great honor.

2683
01:36:49,795 --> 01:36:52,404
Every sparring session felt like the best.

2684
01:36:52,405 --> 01:36:53,464
- Yes. - Absolutely.

2685
01:36:53,465 --> 01:36:55,474
So, breathe.

2686
01:36:55,475 --> 01:36:56,974
I could see you were getting tired...

2687
01:36:56,975 --> 01:36:59,275
because you were breathing very fast.

2688
01:36:59,675 --> 01:37:02,444
Breathe slowly, and you'll have more energy.

2689
01:37:02,445 --> 01:37:03,845
And you will win.

2690
01:37:04,645 --> 01:37:05,684
Thank you.

2691
01:37:05,685 --> 01:37:08,954
Listen to your coaches and trust your preparation.

2692
01:37:08,955 --> 01:37:10,415
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2693
01:37:10,885 --> 01:37:12,285
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2694
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:14,355
- Thank you. - Great work.

2695
01:37:18,225 --> 01:37:19,894
Thank you.

2696
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:21,935
(After completing such rewarding sparring sessions)

2697
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:24,204
You were all so cool.

2698
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:26,004
All four of us were amazing. We did really well.

2699
01:37:26,005 --> 01:37:27,904
Before we analyze the videos,

2700
01:37:27,905 --> 01:37:30,004
let's hear about the sparring sessions.

2701
01:37:30,005 --> 01:37:32,104
Since they were foreign boxers,

2702
01:37:32,105 --> 01:37:34,214
- I was a bit nervous at first. - Right.

2703
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:37,784
But I really liked how focused I remained despite being nervous.

2704
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:39,684
Even I could tell that...

2705
01:37:39,685 --> 01:37:42,484
you were much more nervous in this sparring than in the others.

2706
01:37:42,485 --> 01:37:45,354
Your eyes were wide open in the headgear,

2707
01:37:45,355 --> 01:37:46,755
completely focused.

2708
01:37:46,785 --> 01:37:48,894
It felt like all your concentration was focused...

2709
01:37:48,895 --> 01:37:50,794
- I loved it. - on your opponent.

2710
01:37:50,795 --> 01:37:52,024
Here's what I learned today.

2711
01:37:52,025 --> 01:37:54,694
Smiling in the middle of a sparring session?

2712
01:37:54,695 --> 01:37:56,194
That puts intense pressure...

2713
01:37:56,195 --> 01:37:57,735
- on the opponent. - Exactly.

2714
01:37:57,935 --> 01:37:59,704
If I ever get the chance to do it...

2715
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:01,705
(Smiling)

2716
01:38:01,905 --> 01:38:02,905
(Madness skill has been unlocked.)

2717
01:38:02,906 --> 01:38:04,145
At least once.

2718
01:38:04,275 --> 01:38:05,504
I'll mess with it.

2719
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:07,205
- Someone's mind. - That's essential.

2720
01:38:07,545 --> 01:38:10,985
After Coach Kim's review last time,

2721
01:38:11,245 --> 01:38:13,815
I focused on trying new techniques.

2722
01:38:14,215 --> 01:38:16,515
It's true that I need to adjust my techniques...

2723
01:38:16,715 --> 01:38:18,624
depending on the opponent,

2724
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:20,124
but I became too fixated on my goal...

2725
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:21,924
and didn't think outside the box.

2726
01:38:21,925 --> 01:38:25,695
I realized I shouldn't set a rigid goal before stepping into the ring.

2727
01:38:25,965 --> 01:38:28,294
Either way, let's watch the videos of your sessions...

2728
01:38:28,295 --> 01:38:30,805
and analyze your strengths and weaknesses.

2729
01:38:31,065 --> 01:38:33,805
All right. We'll start with Ju Hyun's sessions.

2730
01:38:34,235 --> 01:38:35,475
I will gladly accept feedback.

2731
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:37,705
Okay. What Ju Hyun was good at...

2732
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,705
was throwing jabs...

2733
01:38:39,905 --> 01:38:42,305
to provoke the opponent, so she could watch their rear hand.

2734
01:38:42,845 --> 01:38:44,745
Ju Hyun kept that going.

2735
01:38:45,515 --> 01:38:48,455
As you can see, Ju Hyun jabbed at the opponent's stomach...

2736
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,255
and then landed two low blows.

2737
01:38:50,315 --> 01:38:51,325
That was great.

2738
01:38:52,425 --> 01:38:53,924
Watch carefully. Right here.

2739
01:38:53,925 --> 01:38:55,194
(After watching the opponent retreat)

2740
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:56,275
Punch. This is what I mean.

2741
01:38:57,025 --> 01:38:58,164
That just now was amazing.

2742
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,925
(Stepping back while tracking the rear hand)

2743
01:39:00,425 --> 01:39:02,434
If the opponent didn't attack, Ju Hyun would jab at her.

2744
01:39:02,435 --> 01:39:04,635
She used jabs to provoke the opponent. Nice.

2745
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:06,834
(After a jab)

2746
01:39:06,835 --> 01:39:08,074
Look. She's watching, right?

2747
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:11,005
After throwing a jab, Ju Hyun kept looking at the rear hand.

2748
01:39:11,645 --> 01:39:13,644
Retreating after throwing a punch was effective too.

2749
01:39:13,645 --> 01:39:16,545
- Keeping the distance was great. - Ju Hyun is scary.

2750
01:39:16,675 --> 01:39:18,915
Whenever I throw a jab, the opponent always responds.

2751
01:39:18,985 --> 01:39:21,384
That technique works very well,

2752
01:39:21,385 --> 01:39:22,561
and she executes it skillfully.

2753
01:39:22,585 --> 01:39:23,985
Ju Hyun’s strength is that...

2754
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,925
no matter which sparring session it is, she remains calm.

2755
01:39:27,085 --> 01:39:28,124
I agree.

2756
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:29,795
She has excellent footwork...

2757
01:39:29,855 --> 01:39:31,465
and has her own rhythm.

2758
01:39:32,395 --> 01:39:33,465
Watch her.

2759
01:39:33,665 --> 01:39:35,095
- Another one-two. - Nice.

2760
01:39:35,165 --> 01:39:37,295
Move away. Yes, that's how you retreat.

2761
01:39:38,665 --> 01:39:40,704
She's like, "Come at me."

2762
01:39:40,705 --> 01:39:42,385
And then, she strikes. That's a good move.

2763
01:39:42,705 --> 01:39:43,905
While moving sideways.

2764
01:39:45,275 --> 01:39:46,344
That was great just now.

2765
01:39:46,345 --> 01:39:47,845
(Backstep)

2766
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,815
Punch and retreat.

2767
01:39:50,945 --> 01:39:52,315
She did an excellent job.

2768
01:39:52,585 --> 01:39:53,585
But...

2769
01:39:53,945 --> 01:39:56,385
But when exchanging blows,

2770
01:39:56,855 --> 01:39:58,454
your punches tend to get big.

2771
01:39:58,455 --> 01:39:59,455
Right.

2772
01:39:59,655 --> 01:40:01,625
Move in. Come on.

2773
01:40:02,025 --> 01:40:04,595
Watch closely. Your hand slips backward.

2774
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:08,194
- Look. It slips backward, right? - It moves outward.

2775
01:40:08,195 --> 01:40:09,435
Exactly.

2776
01:40:09,965 --> 01:40:11,135
Watch this footage.

2777
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:12,665
You lower your hand.

2778
01:40:13,565 --> 01:40:17,234
If you had tightened your punches during the consecutive hits,

2779
01:40:17,235 --> 01:40:18,475
it would have been much better.

2780
01:40:18,845 --> 01:40:21,945
You understand why I had you do ducking and hooks, right?

2781
01:40:22,215 --> 01:40:24,215
I'll practice punching at short distances.

2782
01:40:24,615 --> 01:40:26,614
And look at this footage.

2783
01:40:26,615 --> 01:40:28,785
(Ju Hyun was cornered during the fight.)

2784
01:40:28,985 --> 01:40:30,715
Yes, but in these situations...

2785
01:40:31,355 --> 01:40:33,155
In these situations, you need to retreat.

2786
01:40:33,785 --> 01:40:36,695
I clearly heard you telling me to move out.

2787
01:40:37,095 --> 01:40:39,495
But I couldn't because of the rage from getting hit.

2788
01:40:40,595 --> 01:40:43,635
I got struck right when I needed to retreat.

2789
01:40:43,995 --> 01:40:45,864
But to retreat immediately? No way.

2790
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:48,275
With that, I tried to hit her more.

2791
01:40:48,305 --> 01:40:49,605
That's incredible.

2792
01:40:49,935 --> 01:40:51,045
That's true madness.

2793
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:53,405
- I should've moved back, right? - Still,

2794
01:40:53,475 --> 01:40:55,144
you can tell that you should've moved back...

2795
01:40:55,145 --> 01:40:56,444
when you watch the video.

2796
01:40:56,445 --> 01:40:58,215
- That's how you learn. - That's right.

2797
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:00,084
If you improve yourself in such aspects,

2798
01:41:00,085 --> 01:41:03,055
you'll be ready for the competition.

2799
01:41:03,455 --> 01:41:04,925
- You did well. - You did very well.

2800
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:07,185
You're cool.

2801
01:41:08,825 --> 01:41:10,125
I survived today as well.

2802
01:41:10,995 --> 01:41:12,024
Now,

2803
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:14,025
Uie is next.

2804
01:41:14,365 --> 01:41:16,364
You need to pay attention...

2805
01:41:16,365 --> 01:41:19,205
to which techniques your opponent used often on you.

2806
01:41:19,605 --> 01:41:20,805
Look at this. Here.

2807
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,135
Push, punch.

2808
01:41:23,335 --> 01:41:25,775
(The opponent's attacking pattern 1: Parry, two)

2809
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:29,044
(Low)

2810
01:41:29,045 --> 01:41:30,215
(High)

2811
01:41:30,885 --> 01:41:31,944
She kept going for low and high.

2812
01:41:31,945 --> 01:41:33,061
(The opponent's attacking pattern 2: Low, high)

2813
01:41:33,085 --> 01:41:34,115
All right.

2814
01:41:35,085 --> 01:41:36,584
Walk, punch. Walk, punch again.

2815
01:41:36,585 --> 01:41:37,754
(The opponent's attacking pattern repeated itself in Round 1.)

2816
01:41:37,755 --> 01:41:38,901
Then she punched the stomach.

2817
01:41:38,925 --> 01:41:40,124
She's fast.

2818
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:42,354
(Uie was helpless against the opponent's attacks.)

2819
01:41:42,355 --> 01:41:43,795
She's blocking the attacks.

2820
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:46,164
Uie, you need to think about this...

2821
01:41:46,165 --> 01:41:47,634
when you watch the video.

2822
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:49,964
- Okay. - "That's how the opponent attacks."

2823
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:51,364
"At which timing..."

2824
01:41:51,365 --> 01:41:52,404
- "should I go for two?" - I see.

2825
01:41:52,405 --> 01:41:53,564
Think about that only.

2826
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:55,305
Then you'll improve.

2827
01:41:55,905 --> 01:41:57,805
However, you kept waiting.

2828
01:41:58,005 --> 01:41:59,445
Then your opponent will read that.

2829
01:42:00,145 --> 01:42:02,845
Then she thought about which techniques she should use.

2830
01:42:03,915 --> 01:42:07,144
When I tell you not to attack first,

2831
01:42:07,145 --> 01:42:10,255
I want you to make your opponent attack first.

2832
01:42:10,715 --> 01:42:12,915
That's what I mean when I tell you not to attack first.

2833
01:42:13,255 --> 01:42:14,295
Watch.

2834
01:42:14,825 --> 01:42:15,855
Punch.

2835
01:42:15,955 --> 01:42:17,394
That was nice.

2836
01:42:17,395 --> 01:42:18,824
You punched from the spot.

2837
01:42:18,825 --> 01:42:20,265
- You did it with confidence. - Yes.

2838
01:42:22,135 --> 01:42:23,965
- Your punch landed. - Well done.

2839
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:25,835
Another punch.

2840
01:42:26,005 --> 01:42:27,405
Your one-two punches landed.

2841
01:42:27,775 --> 01:42:28,805
You did well.

2842
01:42:29,235 --> 01:42:30,974
You did well just now. You did really well.

2843
01:42:30,975 --> 01:42:32,504
After that punch landed,

2844
01:42:32,505 --> 01:42:33,905
your opponent couldn't come closer.

2845
01:42:33,945 --> 01:42:35,074
(Flustered)

2846
01:42:35,075 --> 01:42:36,375
The opponent became flustered.

2847
01:42:36,975 --> 01:42:39,345
I think I became a bit confident at that time.

2848
01:42:39,615 --> 01:42:41,314
You did very well toward the end of Round One.

2849
01:42:41,315 --> 01:42:42,554
- That's right. You did well. - That was...

2850
01:42:42,555 --> 01:42:45,425
because your punches landed on the opponent.

2851
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:47,624
- Thus, in Round 2, - Round 2.

2852
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:49,224
- I told you to keep going. - Yes.

2853
01:42:49,225 --> 01:42:50,895
You were cool in Round Two.

2854
01:42:51,295 --> 01:42:52,724
She changed as if someone pressed the button...

2855
01:42:52,725 --> 01:42:54,395
- to turn on the booster mode. - I know.

2856
01:42:54,435 --> 01:42:55,734
All right. Watch...

2857
01:42:55,735 --> 01:42:58,204
how the dynamics changed in Round Two.

2858
01:42:58,205 --> 01:42:59,265
Okay.

2859
01:43:00,405 --> 01:43:02,004
Punch.

2860
01:43:02,005 --> 01:43:04,204
Then you punched again.

2861
01:43:04,205 --> 01:43:05,245
Retreat.

2862
01:43:06,045 --> 01:43:08,075
Punch.

2863
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:09,775
Your punches landed.

2864
01:43:10,445 --> 01:43:11,614
You punched and moved back.

2865
01:43:11,615 --> 01:43:13,921
(Her attacking pattern was the same, but the punches landed.)

2866
01:43:13,945 --> 01:43:15,814
Uie, you just need to be good at punching...

2867
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:16,815
and stepping back.

2868
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:18,084
- You're that type of boxer. - That's right.

2869
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:19,154
Her reach is very long.

2870
01:43:19,155 --> 01:43:21,325
You can see how well you did, right?

2871
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:24,765
Every time threw a punch, it landed.

2872
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:27,164
You went it again.

2873
01:43:27,165 --> 01:43:28,694
(Uie cornered the opponent with enthusiasm.)

2874
01:43:28,695 --> 01:43:29,794
You went it again.

2875
01:43:29,795 --> 01:43:31,135
You followed the opponent.

2876
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:32,365
She got cornered.

2877
01:43:33,905 --> 01:43:36,134
She's tired. She needed rest, but Uie didn't back down.

2878
01:43:36,135 --> 01:43:37,475
That was why she got cornered.

2879
01:43:38,305 --> 01:43:39,945
She put her guard down.

2880
01:43:40,445 --> 01:43:42,475
She couldn't do the footwork.

2881
01:43:43,275 --> 01:43:44,614
(With the same energy, Uie cornered her until the end.)

2882
01:43:44,615 --> 01:43:47,485
Watch. Like that, you threw multiple punches.

2883
01:43:47,585 --> 01:43:49,755
Had you done Routine One...

2884
01:43:50,155 --> 01:43:52,285
Backstep, one, two. Had you done that,

2885
01:43:52,355 --> 01:43:54,024
the opponent would've stood down right away.

2886
01:43:54,025 --> 01:43:55,025
Watch.

2887
01:43:56,225 --> 01:43:57,424
Like that,

2888
01:43:57,425 --> 01:43:59,025
you dodged. You should've attacked then.

2889
01:43:59,295 --> 01:44:00,365
But you ran.

2890
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:02,065
You ran.

2891
01:44:02,665 --> 01:44:04,234
The opponent was tired.

2892
01:44:04,235 --> 01:44:05,264
She took a lot of damage.

2893
01:44:05,265 --> 01:44:07,804
That was why she threw the last punch.

2894
01:44:07,805 --> 01:44:09,004
Had you dodged and attacked,

2895
01:44:09,005 --> 01:44:10,234
she would've been knocked out.

2896
01:44:10,235 --> 01:44:12,504
But you stepped back at that time.

2897
01:44:12,505 --> 01:44:13,744
(Had it been a real match, she could've ended the opponent.)

2898
01:44:13,745 --> 01:44:16,114
The thing is, my opponent put up her guard...

2899
01:44:16,115 --> 01:44:17,314
like this.

2900
01:44:17,315 --> 01:44:19,215
It was my first time seeing it in sparring.

2901
01:44:19,415 --> 01:44:21,054
I didn't know what it meant.

2902
01:44:21,055 --> 01:44:22,414
You were supposed to punch her.

2903
01:44:22,415 --> 01:44:24,231
If that situation occurs during the competition,

2904
01:44:24,255 --> 01:44:26,124
keep punching her.

2905
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:27,725
Punch her body.

2906
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:29,295
- Make her stand down. - Okay.

2907
01:44:29,395 --> 01:44:30,795
- Understood. - You did well today.

2908
01:44:31,095 --> 01:44:32,364
You were like different people...

2909
01:44:32,365 --> 01:44:34,125
- in Round 1 and Round 2. - Seriously.

2910
01:44:34,535 --> 01:44:36,264
The third one is Sae Rok.

2911
01:44:36,265 --> 01:44:37,295
Okay.

2912
01:44:37,535 --> 01:44:39,234
Did you see the body shot?

2913
01:44:39,235 --> 01:44:40,265
Let's watch again.

2914
01:44:40,965 --> 01:44:43,175
(Sae Rok)

2915
01:44:43,775 --> 01:44:46,575
You took a body shot. Did you see that? Okay.

2916
01:44:47,945 --> 01:44:48,945
Punch.

2917
01:44:48,946 --> 01:44:50,044
It went in cleanly.

2918
01:44:50,045 --> 01:44:52,185
(She took a body shot in an instant.)

2919
01:44:52,315 --> 01:44:53,814
Why did you take the body shot?

2920
01:44:53,815 --> 01:44:55,535
(The reason why Sae Rok took the body shot)

2921
01:44:55,855 --> 01:44:57,054
Look at the hand behind you.

2922
01:44:57,055 --> 01:44:59,654
(One arm was in the back.)

2923
01:44:59,655 --> 01:45:00,885
Sae Rok,

2924
01:45:00,985 --> 01:45:02,824
had you returned the fist to the original position quickly,

2925
01:45:02,825 --> 01:45:04,155
you wouldn't have taken the shot.

2926
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:10,495
(Meanwhile, her body was exposed.)

2927
01:45:12,605 --> 01:45:13,964
Watch.

2928
01:45:13,965 --> 01:45:15,045
(In another two-movement, )

2929
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:18,245
(her arm was behind her again.)

2930
01:45:20,405 --> 01:45:23,675
(Her body kept getting exposed to attacks.)

2931
01:45:24,415 --> 01:45:26,385
What's wrong with her?

2932
01:45:26,785 --> 01:45:28,984
- Why do I do that? - It's like...

2933
01:45:28,985 --> 01:45:31,015
"Take my two!"

2934
01:45:31,185 --> 01:45:32,224
"Take this!"

2935
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:33,854
The opponent's coach told you...

2936
01:45:33,855 --> 01:45:35,854
- To attack faster. - to attack a bit faster.

2937
01:45:35,855 --> 01:45:36,924
- That's right. - Yes.

2938
01:45:36,925 --> 01:45:38,365
This is the reason.

2939
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:39,695
So,

2940
01:45:39,725 --> 01:45:41,434
rub salt on your wound...

2941
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,695
- and recover quickly. - Okay.

2942
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,364
However, Sae Rok was not an easy opponent either.

2943
01:45:45,365 --> 01:45:46,805
She got back up.

2944
01:45:50,235 --> 01:45:51,374
(Even after she took another body shot)

2945
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:53,074
You kept throwing jabs.

2946
01:45:53,075 --> 01:45:55,174
- That's it. Good. You did well. - You're doing good.

2947
01:45:55,175 --> 01:45:56,175
She was so determined.

2948
01:45:56,245 --> 01:45:58,344
She turned into Determined Sae Rok.

2949
01:45:58,345 --> 01:45:59,944
(Determined Sae Rok refused to go down.)

2950
01:45:59,945 --> 01:46:03,554
Also, I think today's sparring was good.

2951
01:46:03,555 --> 01:46:05,325
After throwing a punch,

2952
01:46:05,725 --> 01:46:07,261
you do a better job of stepping back for defense.

2953
01:46:07,285 --> 01:46:08,324
After throwing a punch, you move this way.

2954
01:46:08,325 --> 01:46:09,931
After throwing a punch, you move that way.

2955
01:46:09,955 --> 01:46:11,725
(In the last sparring, )

2956
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,635
(Sae Rok punched once and got punched twice.)

2957
01:46:17,165 --> 01:46:19,905
(She took so many punches.)

2958
01:46:20,505 --> 01:46:21,835
Watch. Punch.

2959
01:46:22,305 --> 01:46:23,305
Punch.

2960
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:25,005
You moved to the side.

2961
01:46:25,275 --> 01:46:26,304
You moved.

2962
01:46:26,305 --> 01:46:27,345
(She retreated.)

2963
01:46:28,145 --> 01:46:29,174
Punch, punch, jab.

2964
01:46:29,175 --> 01:46:30,414
(She puts a distance between them with jabs.)

2965
01:46:30,415 --> 01:46:31,844
There you go. You ran again.

2966
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,615
You moved to the side again.

2967
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:35,655
Your defense after a punch improved a lot.

2968
01:46:36,055 --> 01:46:38,555
She can attack and defend at the same time.

2969
01:46:38,655 --> 01:46:39,754
That means...

2970
01:46:39,755 --> 01:46:41,354
your stamina has improved.

2971
01:46:41,355 --> 01:46:43,325
That's right. Since your stamina has improved,

2972
01:46:43,395 --> 01:46:45,294
you can keep moving.

2973
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:46,594
After throwing a punch,

2974
01:46:46,595 --> 01:46:47,724
you keep moving instinctively.

2975
01:46:47,725 --> 01:46:48,765
You've improved.

2976
01:46:49,395 --> 01:46:50,694
Your stamina has improved. It's good.

2977
01:46:50,695 --> 01:46:51,855
Your timing has improved too.

2978
01:46:52,235 --> 01:46:53,534
(Rocky Keum showed a noticeable improvement.)

2979
01:46:53,535 --> 01:46:55,175
Your turn has improved a lot.

2980
01:46:55,235 --> 01:46:57,235
- The last one is In Ah. - Gosh.

2981
01:46:57,505 --> 01:46:59,145
My opponent was scary.

2982
01:46:59,575 --> 01:47:01,874
The thing is, I saw you become a bit flustered...

2983
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:03,675
because the opponent was good.

2984
01:47:03,775 --> 01:47:05,655
But your opponent was ten times more flustered.

2985
01:47:06,215 --> 01:47:07,315
Watch.

2986
01:47:07,785 --> 01:47:10,055
Slide. You guys exchanged jabs.

2987
01:47:10,215 --> 01:47:11,224
Then you moved.

2988
01:47:11,225 --> 01:47:13,955
Both of you guys had great footwork and rhythm.

2989
01:47:14,355 --> 01:47:17,195
Like a fearless lion, you moved in.

2990
01:47:17,295 --> 01:47:19,255
Let me tell you what I liked about this sparring.

2991
01:47:19,465 --> 01:47:21,864
Back in the day, you did this when the opponent attacked.

2992
01:47:21,865 --> 01:47:23,664
But now, you put up your guard in order to defend yourself.

2993
01:47:23,665 --> 01:47:24,705
Here. Watch.

2994
01:47:24,865 --> 01:47:25,865
(In Ah)

2995
01:47:25,866 --> 01:47:27,835
(In the previous sparring, )

2996
01:47:28,735 --> 01:47:32,205
(her head turned when she took multiple punches.)

2997
01:47:33,275 --> 01:47:37,245
(Her guard went down against her intention.)

2998
01:47:37,845 --> 01:47:39,284
(How is In Ah now?)

2999
01:47:39,285 --> 01:47:40,344
Watch.

3000
01:47:40,345 --> 01:47:41,715
After punching low and high...

3001
01:47:42,285 --> 01:47:43,415
She did very well.

3002
01:47:43,485 --> 01:47:46,155
You put up your guard as you watched your opponent.

3003
01:47:46,525 --> 01:47:49,424
She was like a hyena. Gosh.

3004
01:47:49,425 --> 01:47:51,095
You did well without getting intimidated.

3005
01:47:51,725 --> 01:47:52,765
How cool.

3006
01:47:53,525 --> 01:47:54,534
Watch.

3007
01:47:54,535 --> 01:47:55,535
Watch. Here.

3008
01:47:55,536 --> 01:47:59,164
I was like, "Is this the end? Is she in danger?"

3009
01:47:59,165 --> 01:48:00,605
(She put up her guard and attacked.)

3010
01:48:02,705 --> 01:48:03,834
The timing was great.

3011
01:48:03,835 --> 01:48:06,404
(She put up her guard at the perfect timing.)

3012
01:48:06,405 --> 01:48:07,445
Good.

3013
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:10,615
I think she grew again.

3014
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:11,985
She's different from the past.

3015
01:48:12,785 --> 01:48:13,785
In the past,

3016
01:48:13,786 --> 01:48:15,114
- when she took the damage, - That's right.

3017
01:48:15,115 --> 01:48:16,214
She either turned her head or stopped.

3018
01:48:16,215 --> 01:48:17,284
- That's right. - She stopped. That's right.

3019
01:48:17,285 --> 01:48:19,054
- But she continued to attack. - That's right.

3020
01:48:19,055 --> 01:48:20,084
I realized then...

3021
01:48:20,085 --> 01:48:21,231
- that she became stronger. - That's right.

3022
01:48:21,255 --> 01:48:22,824
And when the opponent came closer,

3023
01:48:22,825 --> 01:48:24,295
you threw a two. That was...

3024
01:48:24,595 --> 01:48:25,794
That was very impressive.

3025
01:48:25,795 --> 01:48:26,865
The timing was perfect.

3026
01:48:27,425 --> 01:48:28,434
Watch.

3027
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,995
You guys were watching each other.

3028
01:48:30,365 --> 01:48:31,534
(Backstep)

3029
01:48:31,535 --> 01:48:32,805
(Two)

3030
01:48:34,305 --> 01:48:35,804
(She retreated...)

3031
01:48:35,805 --> 01:48:37,004
(and threw a two.)

3032
01:48:37,005 --> 01:48:38,105
It was so nice.

3033
01:48:39,245 --> 01:48:40,674
It was great. Again, two.

3034
01:48:40,675 --> 01:48:42,015
You punched as well. Yes.

3035
01:48:42,615 --> 01:48:43,775
She's owning it.

3036
01:48:45,245 --> 01:48:46,614
You went on until the end.

3037
01:48:46,615 --> 01:48:47,695
You did well until the end.

3038
01:48:48,915 --> 01:48:51,255
Even though the punch didn't land, it was great.

3039
01:48:52,385 --> 01:48:53,754
Watch. You put up your guard.

3040
01:48:53,755 --> 01:48:54,855
(Putting up her guard)

3041
01:48:55,055 --> 01:48:56,094
That's it.

3042
01:48:56,095 --> 01:48:57,555
You punched again.

3043
01:48:58,565 --> 01:48:59,764
She did very well.

3044
01:48:59,765 --> 01:49:01,605
(She focused until the end and threw a punch.)

3045
01:49:01,735 --> 01:49:04,735
You threw a two, but the opponent cross-countered.

3046
01:49:05,505 --> 01:49:06,665
She came closer.

3047
01:49:06,835 --> 01:49:08,004
You guys had the same rhythm.

3048
01:49:08,005 --> 01:49:09,304
Punch. Right?

3049
01:49:09,305 --> 01:49:10,411
(The opponent threw a cross-counter.)

3050
01:49:10,435 --> 01:49:11,474
Let's watch again.

3051
01:49:11,475 --> 01:49:12,475
(They attacked at the same time.)

3052
01:49:12,476 --> 01:49:13,916
Your opponent threw a cross-counter.

3053
01:49:14,145 --> 01:49:15,674
And you took a hit.

3054
01:49:15,675 --> 01:49:17,315
(Valid strike)

3055
01:49:17,985 --> 01:49:19,284
(The opponent's cross-counter landed.)

3056
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:21,785
Despite the cross-counter, you did well. It's okay.

3057
01:49:22,115 --> 01:49:23,814
You just need to practice...

3058
01:49:23,815 --> 01:49:25,385
- the cross-counter. - Okay.

3059
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:28,155
Yes. In Ah, you did well until the end.

3060
01:49:28,925 --> 01:49:30,755
It's fun. I want to do it again.

3061
01:49:31,095 --> 01:49:32,964
I think it's good as long as you do your best...

3062
01:49:32,965 --> 01:49:34,494
in the ring.

3063
01:49:34,495 --> 01:49:36,164
In my opinion, everyone did that today.

3064
01:49:36,165 --> 01:49:37,394
- That's right. - Seriously.

3065
01:49:37,395 --> 01:49:39,135
That's why I'm in a good mood today.

3066
01:49:39,665 --> 01:49:41,434
- Everyone did well today. - It's so nice.

3067
01:49:41,435 --> 01:49:44,504
I didn't know that our coach had so many straight teeth.

3068
01:49:44,505 --> 01:49:45,645
- Please smile. - I see.

3069
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:47,845
I'm really satisfied with today's sparring.

3070
01:49:48,445 --> 01:49:49,544
Seriously.

3071
01:49:49,545 --> 01:49:51,444
- Thank you. - I'm close to tears.

3072
01:49:51,445 --> 01:49:53,015
Coach's compliment is sweet.

3073
01:49:53,115 --> 01:49:54,785
- It's so rare. - Yes.

3074
01:49:56,385 --> 01:49:59,354
(The first day at Phuket nears its end.)

3075
01:49:59,355 --> 01:50:00,385
Let's go.

3076
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:04,995
(Iron Girls head over to the lodging after the training.)

3077
01:50:05,995 --> 01:50:07,295
We've arrived at the lodging.

3078
01:50:07,365 --> 01:50:08,695
Let's go.

3079
01:50:09,795 --> 01:50:11,565
- I'm curious. - Let's go.

3080
01:50:15,635 --> 01:50:16,675
(Exclaiming)

3081
01:50:17,605 --> 01:50:19,345
Is it a two-story house?

3082
01:50:20,675 --> 01:50:22,245
- It looks nice. - Gosh.

3083
01:50:22,715 --> 01:50:24,315
You look nice

3084
01:50:24,685 --> 01:50:27,485
(The lodging makes them sing.)

3085
01:50:27,885 --> 01:50:31,255
(They finally enter the lodging.)

3086
01:50:31,485 --> 01:50:33,485
(Exclaiming)

3087
01:50:34,085 --> 01:50:35,695
- What? - Gosh.

3088
01:50:36,025 --> 01:50:37,495
- Why is it so big? - What?

3089
01:50:37,825 --> 01:50:39,164
This is insane. What's this?

3090
01:50:39,165 --> 01:50:40,865
(What's this?)

3091
01:50:40,995 --> 01:50:43,764
- It's so nice. I can't believe it. - What's this?

3092
01:50:43,765 --> 01:50:45,735
I want to jump into it right away.

3093
01:50:45,965 --> 01:50:47,235
It's fancy.

3094
01:50:48,705 --> 01:50:51,675
(This is where the Iron Girls will be staying today.)

3095
01:50:52,275 --> 01:50:53,904
(The Phuket trip finally feels like a vacation, )

3096
01:50:53,905 --> 01:50:55,574
(after they've been training all day.)

3097
01:50:55,575 --> 01:50:57,175
This is so cool.

3098
01:50:57,615 --> 01:51:00,945
This feels like the house of a crime boss.

3099
01:51:01,245 --> 01:51:02,955
- What is this place? - I love it here.

3100
01:51:03,215 --> 01:51:05,354
- Whose house is this? - Is this a model home.

3101
01:51:05,355 --> 01:51:07,054
Wait, I want to go inside the pool.

3102
01:51:07,055 --> 01:51:08,624
I can't believe we get to stay here.

3103
01:51:08,625 --> 01:51:09,725
This place is amazing.

3104
01:51:10,055 --> 01:51:11,294
- Gosh. - Seriously. This place is great.

3105
01:51:11,295 --> 01:51:13,135
I've never stayed at a place like this before.

3106
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:16,235
(What in the world?)

3107
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:18,104
- There's a pool table. - What?

3108
01:51:18,105 --> 01:51:21,004
- There's a pool table here? - What's going on?

3109
01:51:21,005 --> 01:51:22,235
Gosh.

3110
01:51:22,275 --> 01:51:23,905
Look at that painting.

3111
01:51:24,105 --> 01:51:25,804
- What is this place? - This house feels so romantic.

3112
01:51:25,805 --> 01:51:27,104
How many rooms are there?

3113
01:51:27,105 --> 01:51:29,075
(The enormous living room)

3114
01:51:31,445 --> 01:51:34,015
(The neatly organized bedroom)

3115
01:51:35,385 --> 01:51:40,085
(The Iron Girls made it through a grueling day, )

3116
01:51:41,055 --> 01:51:44,195
(and this house will help them relax and recharge.)

3117
01:51:44,495 --> 01:51:48,895
(Gosh, I'm so excited.)

3118
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:49,994
I love it here.

3119
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:52,265
I can’t get over how nice this place is.

3120
01:51:52,935 --> 01:51:53,964
This place is incredible.

3121
01:51:53,965 --> 01:51:56,134
This is way too generous. What do they have in store for us tomorrow?

3122
01:51:56,135 --> 01:51:57,735
I'm scared about tomorrow.

3123
01:51:58,075 --> 01:51:59,345
What if we get beaten up?

3124
01:51:59,405 --> 01:52:01,404
Honestly, if this is the price for getting beaten up,

3125
01:52:01,405 --> 01:52:03,045
I'm okay with that.

3126
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,784
- Me too. - Me too. I'd rather be beaten up...

3127
01:52:04,785 --> 01:52:06,085
- and live here. - Me too.

3128
01:52:06,485 --> 01:52:09,514
Gosh. Hey! In Ah. Ju Hyun.

3129
01:52:09,515 --> 01:52:11,185
Isn't this a mangosteen?

3130
01:52:11,685 --> 01:52:14,555
We've been wanting to eat this.

3131
01:52:14,655 --> 01:52:15,755
Mangosteen.

3132
01:52:16,325 --> 01:52:17,495
Mangosteen.

3133
01:52:18,795 --> 01:52:20,224
(Ju Hyun takes a seat at the table.)

3134
01:52:20,225 --> 01:52:21,835
I'm suddenly feeling energized.

3135
01:52:22,665 --> 01:52:25,905
(She starts fueling her body with mangosteen.)

3136
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:29,275
(Nibbling)

3137
01:52:29,575 --> 01:52:30,774
This is really good.

3138
01:52:30,775 --> 01:52:32,645
(Sae Rok joins her.)

3139
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:34,815
(Delicious)

3140
01:52:35,275 --> 01:52:36,544
Forget about showering.

3141
01:52:36,545 --> 01:52:38,145
- This mangosteen is my priority. - Yes.

3142
01:52:38,515 --> 01:52:40,645
It’s so perfectly ripe.

3143
01:52:40,815 --> 01:52:42,685
I can't stop eating it.

3144
01:52:42,785 --> 01:52:43,884
- Stop. - No, Ju Hyun.

3145
01:52:43,885 --> 01:52:45,025
Eat the rest tomorrow.

3146
01:52:45,455 --> 01:52:48,055
- Seriously, finish it tomorrow. - She's already gone through it.

3147
01:52:48,085 --> 01:52:49,094
(Ju Hyun finished the mangosteen already.)

3148
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:50,224
We really have to shower and go to sleep.

3149
01:52:50,225 --> 01:52:51,585
You have to eat the rest tomorrow.

3150
01:52:51,825 --> 01:52:53,325
Why do I feel so energized?

3151
01:52:53,425 --> 01:52:55,065
- Is it because of the mangosteen? - Yes.

3152
01:52:55,295 --> 01:52:56,365
Let's shower.

3153
01:52:57,965 --> 01:53:01,165
(The Iron Girls have gathered in the living room again.)

3154
01:53:01,535 --> 01:53:03,274
She's so funny. Whenever I say something,

3155
01:53:03,275 --> 01:53:06,244
she goes, "What?" or "That's not the point."

3156
01:53:06,245 --> 01:53:08,815
Uie always says, "You got this!" "You got this, Sae Rok!"

3157
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:11,914
Always with a smile on her face. "You got this!"

3158
01:53:11,915 --> 01:53:13,955
Meanwhile, I'm the worst coward in the boxing ring.

3159
01:53:14,615 --> 01:53:15,815
I get so intimidated.

3160
01:53:16,085 --> 01:53:19,785
(Even after a whole day together, the conversation never stops.)

3161
01:53:19,985 --> 01:53:22,024
Uie, teach us how to dance.

3162
01:53:22,025 --> 01:53:23,294
Yes, teach us how to dance.

3163
01:53:23,295 --> 01:53:24,624
How do we do this?

3164
01:53:24,625 --> 01:53:26,524
You're doing it right.

3165
01:53:26,525 --> 01:53:27,894
But you look...

3166
01:53:27,895 --> 01:53:30,665
(Girls’ night is in full swing.)

3167
01:53:31,235 --> 01:53:33,134
(Iron School, let's go! Featuring After School)

3168
01:53:33,135 --> 01:53:34,765
You’ve been doing jump rope since then.

3169
01:53:36,175 --> 01:53:38,075
- Diva - Diva

3170
01:53:39,005 --> 01:53:41,915
(The choreography is ingrained in her body.)

3171
01:53:42,945 --> 01:53:44,115
Gosh, that's Uie!

3172
01:53:44,445 --> 01:53:46,014
That's Uie of After School!

3173
01:53:46,015 --> 01:53:48,985
(She's exuding her idol energy.)

3174
01:53:51,115 --> 01:53:54,925
(You're doing great, Kim Uie.)

3175
01:53:56,995 --> 01:53:59,565
- Amazing! - You're awesome.

3176
01:54:00,225 --> 01:54:01,464
(In awe)

3177
01:54:01,465 --> 01:54:03,565
Gosh, that was amazing.

3178
01:54:03,965 --> 01:54:06,864
- Show us some more. - You're so cool.

3179
01:54:06,865 --> 01:54:08,004
That's all I remember.

3180
01:54:08,005 --> 01:54:10,034
- That was so impressive. - Your stamina is incredible.

3181
01:54:10,035 --> 01:54:12,675
(Uie, your stamina is incredible.)

3182
01:54:13,775 --> 01:54:15,644
I'm so glad I decided to do Iron Girls.

3183
01:54:15,645 --> 01:54:16,844
(On the first night in Phuket, )

3184
01:54:16,845 --> 01:54:19,845
(their conversations carried on late into the night.)

3185
01:54:20,063 --> 01:54:22,093
(Day 2 of the Phuket Training Camp)

3186
01:54:22,193 --> 01:54:23,963
(He is waiting for the Iron Girls.)

3187
01:54:24,133 --> 01:54:26,333
(A boxing world champion?)

3188
01:54:26,403 --> 01:54:28,503
I can't believe we get to meet a world champion.

3189
01:54:29,333 --> 01:54:32,103
(The world’s number 1 boxer)

3190
01:54:32,243 --> 01:54:33,542
You'll be sparring against me.

3191
01:54:33,543 --> 01:54:35,143
(Are we sparring with her?)

3192
01:54:36,173 --> 01:54:37,243
She disappeared.

3193
01:54:37,613 --> 01:54:39,913
(Which Iron Girl will get the champion’s approval?)

3194
01:54:41,343 --> 01:54:43,713
(Finally)

3195
01:54:44,783 --> 01:54:47,653
(The highly anticipated first competition)

3196
01:54:48,323 --> 01:54:49,453
My heart is pounding.

3197
01:54:52,493 --> 01:54:53,523
I can do this.

3198
01:54:54,323 --> 01:54:55,463
I can do this.

3199
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:03,703
(Time to see all that hard work pay off)

3200
01:55:05,543 --> 01:55:06,702
In the Red Corner,

3201
01:55:06,703 --> 01:55:08,973
Geum Sae Rok of Iron Girls.

3202
01:55:11,343 --> 01:55:13,242
- You got this! - You got this!

3203
01:55:13,243 --> 01:55:15,813
(They have 3 minutes to showcase...)

3204
01:55:16,153 --> 01:55:18,434
(all the hard work and sacrifice from the past 3 months.)

3205
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:19,923
