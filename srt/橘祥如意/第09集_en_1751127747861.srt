Episode 16

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know everything about the embroidery bureau and Sixth Brother.

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How did you know?

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You really know.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You even hid the military information from me.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Tell me, what's going on between them?

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I...

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll tell you.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll tell you.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Brother.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:15,000
chooses Between Trickery

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,720
Huh.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,280
Ostrich with retired entertainer

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
Doctoring.

16
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Picking some GIRLS

17
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
For shoulder rest If You Form Allowances

18
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,480
Hmm

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,720
When you rest

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,240
You Let First Number

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:52,240
I'm still a young man.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Nonsense!

23
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
How could you hide such ridiculous things from me?

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
How am I supposed to face the Embroidery Bureau and the Sixth?

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Yes, I was wrong.

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,240
But I can't care about anything else for your happiness.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
You think I deserve your love?

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Of course I deserve everyone's love.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,240
So you want to destroy the Embroidery Bureau and the Sixth for me?

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
You want to destroy their happiness and life?

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
As long as I can make a living for your happiness and the Shen Family,

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
even if I have to be a villain and be a bad name for the whole world,

34
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm willing to do it.

35
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
You're still obsessed with it.

36
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Master, the Tomb of Changzhou is already destroyed.

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
The Embroidery Bureau and the Sixth have been broken.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
If you really love the Embroidery Bureau,

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
you can pretend that you don't know anything.

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Why do you care so much?

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
I do like the Embroidery Bureau.

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240
But what you did made me feel insulted.

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
It's an insult to a man.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Master.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
The Tomb of Changzhou

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Where are you going? Let me see.

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Brother, I'll take her to see the doctor.

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Tell him what kind of girl you like.

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Master, look.

50
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
It's really the Third Madam and the Sixth.

51
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
You're called Juer.

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
As long as you're willing to be my wife,

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I won't let you be a concubine.

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
It's not impossible.

55
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Why didn't I think of it?

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Master, I...

57
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm also responsible for this.

58
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
If I had thought of it more,

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I wouldn't have come to this point.

60
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Since the Embroidery Bureau doesn't love me,

61
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
I might as well let go.

62
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Master,

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
sometimes,

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
it's not always like this.

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
You can cultivate feelings.

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
And you can also warm your heart.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I know what you want to say.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
But I've made my decision.

69
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
I'll go.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Master,

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
the weather is nice today.

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I think we should not talk about this.

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
I'll go out with you later.

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Let's relax.

75
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I'll go.

76
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
Today,

77
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
the couple is not meant to be.

78
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Their hearts are different.

79
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,240
They can't return to their original ways.

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
They're meant to be.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Xiaoju, come here.

82
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Change this.

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Later, you'll go climbing with Master.

84
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Why so sudden?

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Don't ask me.

86
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Change it.

87
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
You must remember

88
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
You have him in your heart.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
You must find a way to keep him.

90
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Madam, what's wrong with you today?

91
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Did something happen?

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Don't forget,

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Master is grateful to you.

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
And you have to do what you promised me.

95
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm counting on you.

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Master,

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
I'll go climbing with you today.

98
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Where is Madam?

99
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
She...

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Master.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Be careful, Madam.

102
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Master.

103
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
You...

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

105
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I was careless and sprained my ankle.

106
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
I may not be able to go today.

107
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I can't go.

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
How about I let the embroidery bureau

109
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
take care of you on the way?

110
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
No need.

111
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm not old enough yet.

112
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
I can do it alone.

113
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Embroidery Bureau.

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Master,

115
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I'd better go.

116
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Then you go to the car and wait.

117
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,240
What's the point of doing these little things now?

118
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
I always feel that

119
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Master and Madam

120
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
are full of feelings today.

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
They are full of feelings.

122
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
The book of Broken Scissors is well written.

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Everyone should have the right to choose the book.

124
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Remember to read it when you go back.

125
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
The answer is in it.

126
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Master,

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
look at this flower.

128
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
It's so lively.

129
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
It can adapt to any kind of environment.

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes.

131
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,000
It's like the giant

132
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
that Lao Liu took good care of.

133
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
Xiu Jue,

134
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
what do you think of Lao Liu?

135
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Master Six,

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
he's a good man.

137
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
I know all of these.

138
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Lao Liu is kind and warm-hearted.

139
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
What I want to ask is,

140
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
if you hadn't married me,

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
would you have fallen in love with him

142
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
and been with him?

143
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Master's assumption is absurd.

144
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
The traces left by the path

145
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
can't be erased.

146
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
It's impossible to come back.

147
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Yes.

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Some things can't be changed.

149
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Especially feelings.

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Xiu Jue,

151
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
we should take our time.

152
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I don't want to go back so soon.

153
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Here, take care.

154
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay.

155
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Brother,

156
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,240
are you here to climb the mountain too?

157
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Master Six.

158
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Are you here for a photo?

159
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
It reminds me

160
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
that I don't have a photo of Xiu Jue.

161
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I'll take one for him this year.

162
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
How do you want me to use it?

163
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Okay, this way.

164
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Xiu Jue,

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
sit here.

166
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
The light is good.

167
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Lao Liu,

168
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
teach me.

169
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay.

170
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Here.

171
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Hold it here.

172
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Here?

173
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Hold it.

174
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
It needs light.

175
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Okay.

176
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Here.

177
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Smile.

178
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Yes.

179
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Lao Liu,

180
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
teach your sister-in-law.

181
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Okay.

182
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Your hand can be like this.

183
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Then,

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240
put your upper body into the room.

185
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
It's more natural.

186
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Yes.

187
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Your corner can be raised.

188
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Smile.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Raise.

190
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Yes.

191
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
How did you do that?

192
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Look at this beautiful scene.

193
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
You're so loving.

194
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
You're so filial.

195
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
He's my big brother.

197
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Climb your mountain.

198
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
He can be his father.

200
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
He's my big brother.

201
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Please walk faster.

202
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Can you?

203
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
Lao Liu.

204
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Be careful.

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Xiao Xue.

206
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Xiao Xue.

207
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Xiao Xue, how are you?

208
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Are you okay?

209
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Let me see.

210
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
He's twisted.

211
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
We need to deal with him.

212
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
I'll take him to find Leng Long.

213
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Master, put me down.

214
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Brother,

215
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
how about I do it?

216
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
No need.

217
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I remember climbing mountains before.

218
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I carried you down the mountain every time.

219
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Master,

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
I can walk with a wooden stick.

221
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
You don't have to.

222
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
I said I can.

223
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
No need.

224
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
You think I'm old?

225
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Brother,

226
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I don't think you're old.

227
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
But look,

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
it's getting late.

229
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
We need to go down the mountain as soon as possible.

230
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
And

231
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
you asked President Chen to meet you.

232
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
It's hard for me to walk the whole city alone.

233
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
How about we switch?

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Am I really old?

235
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm not as young as him.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
How can I send him?

237
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Put me down.

238
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Are you a little tired?

239
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm not tired.

240
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,240
I have many chances to do something for you.

241
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
I'm not tired.

242
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm not tired.

243
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm not tired.

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I have many chances to do something for you.

245
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
I'm not tired.

246
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Sometimes,

247
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
giving and persisting are meaningless.

248
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
You should think for yourself.

249
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
This is my business.

250
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
It has nothing to do with you.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
What's the reason for the draft this time?

252
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Did the kitten take your draft away?

253
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Or did you get hurt by the gunfight?

254
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Everyone in the team is waiting for your draft.

255
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
You have to write it to me as long as you don't break your hand.

256
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
How can the writer call it a draft?

257
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
I'm dizzy.

258
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Besides,

259
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
I really don't have any inspiration this time.

260
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
No inspiration?

261
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
A noble, elegant, and talented

262
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
and a gang of handsome men

263
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
met in the casino.

264
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
He helped him drive away his ex-boyfriend who was in trouble.

265
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
He pretended

266
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
to be a real love.

267
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
He was so romantic and dramatic.

268
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
How could he not write it?

269
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
It's all because of that time.

270
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Since then,

271
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Xiao Ye has been avoiding me.

272
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
How do I know what will happen next?

273
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Recently, a Russian drama master

274
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
proposed an experiment.

275
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Since the play is not out,

276
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,240
we will create a play.

277
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
You mean,

278
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Xiao Ye will be a little white rat?

279
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Yes.

280
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
It's your turn.

281
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I heard in the night

282
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
that love is bitter.

283
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
You are so afraid of me.

284
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Are you kidding?

285
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm afraid of you, a girl.

286
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I just kissed you.

287
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
You were avoiding me like a little wife.

288
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
You lost to me once.

289
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
You lost your courage.

290
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
You'd better be more reserved.

291
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I'm afraid you will be too busy

292
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
to bear the consequences.

293
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
I understand.

294
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
Two love birds are together.

295
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
It's full of sincerity.

296
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
No.

297
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I have to write it down.

298
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm sorry.

301
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Is he crazy and crazy

304
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
for art creation?

305
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,240
We should have met earlier.

307
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
But the show

308
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
is not good enough.

309
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm sorry.

310
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
It's okay.

311
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I just don't have a good family

312
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
when I talk business.

313
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Today is the first day of the day.

314
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,240
It seems that the Third Madam is very important to you.

315
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

316
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Please take care of her

317
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
orange fruit business.

318
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm really looking forward

319
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
to such a good product.

320
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Brother Shen.

321
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
Your Third Madam

322
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,240
is really a beautiful woman.

323
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Come to my place if you have time.

324
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I will.

325
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Okay.

326
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Goodbye.

327
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Goodbye.

328
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Your dishes.

329
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Thank you, sir.

330
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You have done so much for me.

331
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,240
I don't know how to repay you.

332
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Fortunately, love is not a business.

333
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
It's not worth paying back.

334
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
So,

335
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
you don't have to feel burdened.

336
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
My jade pendant seems to be left in the box.

337
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll get it.

338
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Your wine.

339
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
It's okay.

340
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Wait for me, sir.

341
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
I'll go.

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Shen Yan.

343
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
It's because of you

344
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
that Shen Yan Qing has lost all my money.

345
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I can only take my brothers

346
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
to hide like a mouse.

347
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
You are responsible for all this.

348
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
You just settle it today.

349
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Go.

350
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Xiuquan.

351
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
How is it?

352
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Shen Yan Qing.

353
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
It's you again.

354
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
I think you haven't eaten enough bones.

355
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
You have to force me to kill you.

356
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Young Master.

357
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Young Master.

358
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
What happened?

359
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Young Master.

360
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I don't believe it.

361
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,240
You can protect her forever.

362
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You will have a chance to get the gun back.

363
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Don't run away.

364
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
How is it?

365
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Are you okay?

366
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
I'm fine.

367
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Your hot tea.

368
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
What's wrong?

369
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Who made you so angry?

370
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I underestimated my feelings for her.

371
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I thought I might lose her.

372
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
I actually have a heartache feeling.

373
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I have never had it in my life.

374
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Xiuquan.

375
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,240
It's a gift from God.

376
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
What is more fortunate than God?

377
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
If it's really a gift from God,

378
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
should I really die?

379
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,240
Here.

381
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Why are you so excited today?

382
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
You want me to drink?

383
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
What happened to your hand?

384
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I was working in the school.

385
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
I accidentally hurt it.

386
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
It's okay.

387
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Here, big brother.

388
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Here.

389
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I remember when you were young,

390
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
you had to take it back to the wound every day.

391
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I was so worried.

392
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I even asked your sister-in-law to help you.

393
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I thought sewing clothes was that simple.

394
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
That night,

395
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I got a stroke.

396
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Even the doctor said I was dead.

397
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
It was you who said,

398
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
you saved my life.

399
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Even if it's a life-threatening disease,

400
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
you have to save me.

401
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
You and your sister-in-law,

402
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
regardless of the risk of the disease,

403
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
have to take care of yourself.

404
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Only then can I survive.

405
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I can never repay your love and help

406
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,240
for raising me.

407
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Liu,

408
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
this is the business of the external audit department.

409
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Big brother has been tired for a lifetime.

410
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Now that you've grown up,

411
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
can you help me?

412
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
The external audit department?

413
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
You want me to leave Jiangcheng?

414
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Liu,

415
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
