1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:57,660
использ

2
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,660
But this time, I want to thank you.

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,660
Thank you for helping me marry Xiu Ju.

4
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,660
I really like her.

5
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
But you...

6
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,660
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

7
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Especially to women.

8
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,660
You know, back then, Wei Bao's family was very poor.

9
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
I had an affair with you.

10
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,660
Then I met Ru Yan.

11
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Although it wasn't my wish,

12
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,660
I had no other choice.

13
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,660
Only Xiu Ju.

14
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,660
I really fell in love with her from the bottom of my heart.

15
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
Why is it her?

16
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,660
Why is it Xiu Ju?

17
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
Maybe because...

18
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Maybe because she's the first woman to talk business with me.

19
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Maybe because she's different from the rest.

20
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
She never depends on me.

21
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,660
I can see something else from her eyes.

22
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
I don't know.

23
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,660
It's hard to describe anyway.

24
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
If you can explain it clearly,

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
then it's not love.

26
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
Isn't it?

27
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
I understand.

28
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
I understand.

29
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
Liu.

30
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,660
This is the business of the external audit department.

31
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
I've been working on it for my whole life.

32
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
Now you've grown up.

33
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Can you help me?

34
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
The outside...

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
She left Jiangcheng.

36
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
Where do you want me to go?

37
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
I don't care.

38
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
I know.

39
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
I'll think about it, brother.

40
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,660
This is a difficult decision for you.

41
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,660
But I believe it's good for everyone.

42
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
No matter what,

43
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,660
you'll always be my best brother.

44
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
Come.

45
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Come.

46
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
Come.

47
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
The memories I have of you...

48
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,660
are finally gone, right?

49
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Like a...

50
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,660
on the top of my head...

51
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,660
before Damocles.

52
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,660
I don't know when it will fall...

53
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
and hurt you.

54
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Maybe I should leave.

55
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,660
That's the best choice.

56
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
You...

57
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
are leaving?

58
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,660
Why are you here at this hour?

59
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
I had a nightmare.

60
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
I came out for a walk.

61
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Don't be afraid.

62
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,660
This nightmare...

63
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,660
will end soon.

64
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
You said...

65
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,660
you were leaving.

66
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,660
What do you mean?

67
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm leaving.

68
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,660
I'm leaving Jiangcheng...

69
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,660
to help with Jiayi's business.

70
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
That's good.

71
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Leaving Jiangcheng...

72
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
leaving the Shen family...

73
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,660
you'll have a beautiful and free future.

74
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,660
The sea is wide and the sky is vast.

75
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,660
You can think whatever you want.

76
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Is that really what you think?

77
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
We're really...

78
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,660
separated from each other.

79
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,660
We'll never be able to see each other again.

80
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
What if I have two tickets?

81
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
No!

82
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,660
You said it a thousand times.

83
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
A good man is determined to die...

84
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
on a love note.

85
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,660
He'll be able to go back to heaven.

86
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Master Six.

87
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
We've come this far.

88
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Let's not let the last bit of happiness...

89
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,660
and dignity...

90
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,660
disappear.

91
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,660
The love between us...

92
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,660
is like this seed.

93
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,660
No matter how I teach and pamper it...

94
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,660
it will never bloom.

95
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I never believed in destiny...

96
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
or destiny.

97
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,660
Because it never stood by my side.

98
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,660
God, help me!

99
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I was naive enough to think...

100
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
if I had come again...

101
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
I wouldn't have let it all end.

102
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,660
The heart that was once so full...

103
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,660
has nothing left.

104
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,660
In the end, I forgave the good will.

105
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,660
It was a big mistake.

106
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,660
I'm leaving.

107
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Please hold me.

108
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
I cried and cried.

109
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,660
I smiled and smiled.

110
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,660
I learned to be mature.

111
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,660
There has to be someone...

112
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,660
who can fly out of this world.

113
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,660
I can still greet you politely.

114
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,660
The corner of our friendship.

115
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Brother and Sister-in-law.

116
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
I've decided to go to Nanyang.

117
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,660
I came to say goodbye.

118
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,660
What? You're going to Nanyang?

119
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Nanyang is a place that takes a month to be passed down.

120
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
And it's hard to stay there.

121
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Why did you choose this place?

122
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
I bragged to my friend...

123
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,660
that I wanted to help him sell the goods to Nanyang.

124
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,660
I wanted to see if I could do it.

125
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
When are you leaving?

126
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Tomorrow.

127
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Why are you leaving so soon?

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
You didn't prepare anything.

129
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
And you haven't packed your bags.

130
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
How about I pack them for you?

131
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
No need, Sister-in-law.

132
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I'll have Shaoqi bring me some clothes.

133
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,660
I plan to start over.

134
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,660
You're my mother?

135
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
I'm not your mother. I'm your sister-in-law.

136
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Can I call you mother?

137
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
Then, call me quietly.

138
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
As if it's our secret, okay?

139
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
Mother.

140
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Sister-in-law!

141
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
What's wrong?

142
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Sister-in-law, the teacher is complaining again.

143
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
There's still a rule.

144
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
If my brother punishes me again,

145
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
you have to cover for me.

146
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
You owe your brother a lot.

147
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
He hit you hard, didn't he?

148
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
I don't believe it.

149
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
You don't deserve to be hit.

150
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I won't say it.

151
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
I have to go to the hospital.

152
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Go, go, go.

153
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

154
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I'm going.

155
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Liu has grown up.

156
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,660
It's good to start over.

157
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Don't worry.

158
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,660
My family is always waiting for you.

159
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Sister-in-law.

160
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
It's not that I won't come back.

161
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Why are you so sad?

162
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Let Zhou bring you more money.

163
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,660
You have to be calm when you go out.

164
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
Send the telegram back as soon as possible.

165
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
The boys of the Shen family

166
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
are all good boys out there.

167
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
You are not exception.

168
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
I know.

169
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Come on, sit down and eat something.

170
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
I...

171
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I toast to Liu.

172
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Come on, sister-in-law.

173
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
The song is in different scales.

174
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Who can cross the line?

175
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,660
Accompany me to see the end of the day.

176
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,660
In the darkness, the sky and earth are shaking.

177
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
The sound of the flute is humming.

178
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm about to fall asleep.

179
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,660
The world is made of the past.

180
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Eat.

181
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Come on.

182
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Let the past be me.

183
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Let the past be me.

184
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,660
I will give up my right to be born.

185
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,660
In the cold dream of you.

186
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Why do I have to wake up?

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Come on, let's fall together.

188
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,660
Master and Madam have gone to the dock to see Master Liu off.

189
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,660
I feel empty when I step on the dock.

190
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Let the past be me.

191
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Accompany me to see the end of the day.

192
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
I promise myself.

193
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I will give up my right to be born.

194
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Mrs. San.

195
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Our love is like a seed.

197
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,660
No matter how I teach it to it,

198
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,660
it will never be broken.

199
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Mrs. San is here.

201
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660
Xiu Xuan, are you willing to

202
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,660
take care of this bird with me?

203
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Imagine that you are a cloud.

204
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
I am the wind.

205
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Where the wind blows, you will fly.

206
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Are you willing to go with me?

207
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,660
Leave here and find our own garden.

208
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
I'm willing.

209
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
I'm willing.

210
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Xiaoju.

211
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
Liu has left.

212
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Master.

213
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Master, let's go in and have some tea.

214
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
Let's go.

215
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,660
Yanzhou, I'm willing to leave.

216
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Why didn't anyone tell me

217
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
that Uncle Liu went to Nanyang?

218
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
Am I not from the Shen family?

219
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,660
So you remember that you are from the Shen family.

220
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
You are not with that gang of gangsters?

221
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
They have a surname.

222
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
It's called Xiao Ye.

223
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I not only want to be with him,

224
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,660
I also want to marry him.

225
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Nonsense!

226
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
The Shen family's noble daughter

227
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
is marrying a gang of gangsters.

228
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
How is that fair?

229
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm not afraid of you, uncle.

230
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
Because you are a tiger.

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,660
What did you say?

232
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Shut up.

233
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
How can you say that?

234
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
Stop it.

235
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I didn't say that.

236
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Lu Xun said that.

237
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Lu Xun?

238
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Why did he say that?

239
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,660
He said that you are a noble girl.

240
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You look moral and righteous.

241
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,660
But in fact, you are a poet.

242
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
You are too much.

243
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Guozhong, lock her up.

244
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Take care of her.

245
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Yes.

246
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,660
Do I have any right to be here?

247
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
You are so rude.

248
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Stop it. Let's go.

249
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
Master.

250
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Guozhong.

251
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Give it to madam.

252
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Let her taste it.

253
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Okay.

254
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
We have sold a lot of it.

255
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I have never counted the money

256
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
in my life.

257
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
Master.

258
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Something happened.

259
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Master.

260
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Master Six is gone.

261
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Who is gone?

262
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Master Six is gone.

263
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
His boat sank.

264
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
There are eighty-nine people on the boat.

265
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
There is no bones left.

266
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
Master.

267
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Master.

268
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
Madam.

269
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
It's gone.

270
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Sister.

271
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Master Six went there

272
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,660
and didn't get to accompany you.

273
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
You have to take care of yourself.

274
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Six will be old when he is two years old.

275
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
He will be old when he is three years old.

276
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
I still remember

277
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
the first time he called me

278
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
was the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

279
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
At that time,

280
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I took him back to my mother's house.

281
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I really treated him as my own son.

282
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
You are such a smart child.

283
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,660
How can God not be a good son?

284
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
Brother,

285
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
if you want to cry, cry.

286
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Don't destroy yourself.

287
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Mother.

288
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
Sister.

289
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Sister.

290
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Brother.

291
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Brother.

292
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Brother.

293
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Brother.

294
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Brother.

295
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Brother.

296
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Brother.

297
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Brother.

298
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
Brother.

299
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,900
Why did I have to pull him out highlights?

300
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,660
I left with so many regrets.

302
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm not a good person.

303
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,660
It's all my fault.

304
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
I'm the one who hurt him.

305
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
It's not your fault.

306
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
It's me.

307
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
I should have stopped him.

308
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
When he came to me,

309
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
I should have stopped him.

310
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I know.

311
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
But I always know

312
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,660
why I can't forgive myself.

313
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I know he has a brother.

314
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Why can't I let him go?

315
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
He's my only brother.

316
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
It's me.

317
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
It's all me.

318
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
I let him go.

319
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I'm the one

320
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
who's dying.

321
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Xiaoju.

322
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
Xiaoju.

323
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Xiaoju!

324
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Xiaoju.

325
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Why are you lying on the bed?

326
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,660
Why are you getting up?

327
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,660
It's okay.

328
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
How can I let my wife take the medicine for me?

329
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
So what?

330
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
I can give you the medicine.

331
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Can't I give you the medicine?

332
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I'm worried about you.

333
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Sixth is gone.

334
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
And you're like this.

335
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Xiaoju,

336
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
you can't have a second or third child.

337
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
The Shen family can't have another child.

338
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Xiaoju.

339
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Xiaoju,

340
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
listen to me.

341
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Drink the medicine.

342
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
The doctor said

343
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
you're too sad

344
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
to recover.

345
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Drink it and you'll be fine.

346
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Third Madam.

347
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
What's the matter?

348
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,660
You're so rash.

349
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
Your mother wrote in a letter

350
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
that your mother is seriously ill.

351
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
She may not be able to survive tonight.

352
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Xiaoju.

353
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Mother.

354
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Mother.

355
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
Mother.

356
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Xiaoju,

357
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,660
I can't be with you anymore.

358
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Where's Yubei?

359
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
Yubei.

360
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Yubei.

361
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Yubei is still here.

362
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Xiaoju,

363
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,660
I have always been waiting for you.

364
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Who's child is this?

365
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
Don't cry.

366
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
You're so pretty.

367
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
Don't cry.

368
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,660
Because of this pen,

369
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Juhua Yubei,

370
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
the name I gave you

371
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
is called Xiuju.

372
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
I can't bear to

373
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
let you be

374
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,660
a piece of nothing.

375
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
Mother.

376
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Go find your biological father.

377
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,660
This is my last wish.

378
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Mother.

379
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Hurry up.

380
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Mother.

381
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
