1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Yes.

2
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm afraid that our Shen family will be drowned by the ink.

3
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
You three ladies have caused trouble in the inner residence.

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
According to the rules,

5
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
you should be punished severely.

6
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
You will be punished severely.

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I should be punished severely.

8
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Sixth brother.

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm willing to do it.

10
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
He has always been innocent.

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
He has never been wronged.

12
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Come at me.

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Come on.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Come on.

15
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
So kind.

16
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Dear elders,

17
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
this is extraordinary.

18
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
After all,

19
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,240
the master is the leader of the family.

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Can we make a decision

21
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
after the master wakes up?

22
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
The decision of the whole family

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
is not the right of the master to interfere.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
If you interfere,

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
catch him.

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Do it.

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Let me go.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Let me go.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Sixth brother.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Come on.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Shen Yanqing

32
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Shen Yanqing, Shen Yanqing.

33
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
You have a golden day.

34
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
I haven't had enough fun.

35
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Why are you lying down

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
like a loser?

37
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,240
It's so boring.

38
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,240
The Shen family is now

39
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,240
in a state of silence and chaos.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
After that,

41
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
the business world of Jiangcheng

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,240
is under the control of Mr. Han.

43
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm hungry.

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
I said

45
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I would take everything from the Shen family.

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
In the future,

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Shen Yanqing's property is mine.

48
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
His woman

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
is also mine.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
It's not good.

51
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,240
I just want to ask his woman

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
in front of her.

53
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,240
This will stimulate

54
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
and solve the hatred.

55
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
You are so bad.

56
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
But I like it.

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
By the way,

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
isn't Xiuzhi your sister?

59
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
She will be punished tomorrow.

60
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
You don't save her.

61
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
She is nothing.

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
But you,

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
you seem to have a lot of profit

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,240
after the Shen family is eliminated.

65
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
How should you repay me?

66
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
What's wrong?

67
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
What's going on?

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
What's going on?

69
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,420
Where did he come from?

70
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,640
His domestic relations are in danger.

71
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,020
All right.

72
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
What's the matter?

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,540
My third madam

74
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,280
ruined my home.

75
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,700
She took me exposed.

76
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,280
She deserved it.

77
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,120
Everyone can

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,540
apologize to her

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,480
Later will be차�

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,040
Everyone leave

81
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,620
Release our lives

82
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,280
Release licence

83
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,780
Don't follow me

84
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,300
Don't kill my friends

85
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
You dare to kill them

86
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,920
Look at him!

87
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,520
He's shameless!

88
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
What a scoundrel!

89
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Who does he think he is?

90
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
What a shameless man!

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,320
What a shameless man!

92
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
What a shameless man!

93
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
What a shameless man!

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
What a shameless man!

95
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
What a shameless man!

96
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
What a shameless man!

97
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Get up!

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Stop!

99
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Get lost!

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
You're all rich and poor!

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm late.

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Don't be afraid.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
I'll take you home.

105
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Get lost!

106
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't come over!

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm warning you!

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Get down!

109
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Go back!

110
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Go back!

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Does it hurt?

112
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,560
No matter how hard you push me away,

113
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I won't let go of you.

114
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Aren't you afraid of those rumors?

115
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
No.

116
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,560
Aren't you afraid of losing everything you have now?

117
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
No.

118
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Aren't you afraid of disappointing Madam and Master?

119
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
No.

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm not afraid.

121
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
What I'm most afraid of is that

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
you're no longer alive.

123
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,040
What I'm most afraid of is that

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
you're no longer alive.

125
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Your sister is sad.

126
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Liu Wei,

127
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
my heart is broken.

128
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
If I could be a exchange with Heaven,

129
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
I'd be willing to fall into hell

130
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
and only ask for a lifetime of love.

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
I'm a single person.

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I only have one mistake.

134
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
In the end,

135
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
I ended up like this.

136
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
From now on,

139
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
I won't push you away anymore.

140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Even if there are many difficulties,

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I'll be with you.

142
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Let's leave here.

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Go to a place where no one knows us.

144
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
And start a new life.

145
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
But now,

146
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm not going anywhere.

147
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
I want to go back and be with Master.

148
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
We have to be together.

149
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Yes.

150
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Let go of me!

151
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Move!

152
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Stop taking it!

153
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Move all the money!

154
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Hurry!

155
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
How could you do this?

156
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
You made a lot of money

157
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
with the Shen family.

158
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
The Shen family is in danger,

159
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
and you're just going to do nothing.

160
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Madam, you're wrong.

161
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
The Shen family is a big family.

162
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
We can't afford to be a burden.

163
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
We're a small business.

164
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
But we can't afford to be a burden.

165
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
But...

166
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Move!

167
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Move!

168
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
If you didn't

169
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
push the embroidery bureau away,

170
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
we would have been sent away.

171
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
But you said

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
the heart is gone.

173
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
How could it come back?

174
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
What should we do?

175
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
You're right.

176
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Come on.

177
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
What are you doing?

178
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Put it down!

179
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
You can't take this!

180
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
You can't take this!

181
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
The Shen family is in danger.

182
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
They have a law!

183
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
The business is

184
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
money is money.

185
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Money is the most important thing.

186
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Move!

187
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Move!

188
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
What are you doing?

189
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Put it down!

190
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Madam.

191
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Sixth.

192
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Stop! Put it down!

193
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Business is about

194
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
making money.

195
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
You're forcing the Shen family to cut their own money.

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
We just want to get our own stock.

197
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
We just want money.

198
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
We just want money.

199
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
That's right.

200
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
The Shen family has a way.

201
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
If you want money,

202
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
put everything back in its original place.

203
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Then apologize to me.

204
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Do you understand?

205
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
What?

206
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Money!

207
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Money!

208
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Money!

209
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Money!

210
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Money!

211
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Money!

212
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Money!

213
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Thank god you two came back.

214
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Otherwise, the Shen family would have been...

215
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
The businessmen are very powerful.

216
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
And there are people who are provoking.

217
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
It's inevitable that they will push everyone.

218
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
But as long as they get the money,

219
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
it won't be a problem.

220
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Oh, right, Sixth.

221
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Where did you get this money?

222
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
The embroidery bureau.

223
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
They have all the imported machines

224
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
and all the sub-banks.

225
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Xiuqun, what about the bureau?

226
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
You worked so hard to manage the bureau.

227
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Can you do it?

228
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Don't worry, Madam.

229
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
It's sub-banks, not sales.

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
That's good.

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Madam,

232
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Master is awake.

233
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Let's go see him.

234
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Let's go.

235
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Master.

236
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Master, you're finally awake.

237
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Brother.

238
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Brother, you misunderstood Xiuqun.

239
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Master,

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I'm not Han Shijie's sister.

241
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Han Shijie used lies to use me.

242
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm just a trickster.

243
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
I've always been

244
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
loyal to Han Shijie.

245
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
I searched the whole Jiang City

246
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
to find the old housekeeper of the Han family.

247
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
The Han family

248
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
was attacked by the Shen family.

249
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
The Han family

250
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
was entrusted by a friend to take care of you.

251
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
But not long after,

252
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
the Han family went bankrupt

253
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
and was driven out of Jiang City.

254
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
They hurriedly abandoned you

255
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
on the roadside.

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Have you seen my parents?

257
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
No.

258
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I just heard that they went to escape the disaster.

259
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
We suspect

260
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
that the order of the Nanyang merchants

261
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
is a trap.

262
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
I pretended to believe Han Shijie

263
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
and helped him.

264
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
I've calculated.

265
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
The market of Nanyang's merchants is already secure.

266
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm afraid it's not that big of a demand.

267
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Master Six, Madam Fan.

268
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
This is the telegram from Nanyang.

269
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
It's true.

270
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
This is a scam.

271
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Shen Yanqing

272
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
is really sharp-sighted.

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
This Juyuan is really well-managed.

274
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
No wonder he wants to take the lead.

275
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Sister,

276
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
tell Juyuan

277
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
that I'm willing to pay double the price.

278
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm willing to pay double the price.

279
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I was too hasty

280
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
and too unruly

281
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
to push the Shen family

282
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
into such a dangerous situation.

283
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Brother,

284
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
the crisis of the Shen family

285
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
has been resolved.

286
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
You must take good care of yourself.

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Let's go.

288
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Take care, brother.

289
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Thank you, brother.

290
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Yanzhou,

291
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I think we should discuss the divorce

292
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
after Master is better.

293
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I have the same idea.

294
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
The Shen family is in a crisis.

295
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Brother, you need to take your time.

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
But now,

297
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,040
we have a good show to discuss.

298
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
The Shen family

299
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
has finally avenged their enemies.

300
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I've been waiting for this day for years.

301
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
I've been waiting for this day for years.

302
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Then tell me,

303
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
how should we celebrate?

304
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
How should we celebrate?

305
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
It's up to you.

306
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Master!

307
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Something bad happened!

308
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
What happened?

309
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Nanyang... Nanyang's goods and goods are all gone.

310
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Qin... Qin's people

311
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
are coming to kill us.

312
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Hurry!

313
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Han Shijie, open the door!

314
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Come out! Come out!

315
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
I know you're home.

316
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Come out!

317
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Ruyan, Ruyan,

318
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
you stay here and watch me.

319
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
I'll go to the back house to get the money.

320
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Come out!

321
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Go! Go!

322
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
You...

323
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Although I knew he was not reliable

324
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
in the city,

325
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
I was so happy.

326
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Hurry up and pay the money!

327
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Don't hide!

328
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Now only the Shen family is alive.

329
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
A man?

330
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
A man!

331
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Excuse me! Excuse me!

332
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
The Han family has declared bankruptcy.

333
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Excuse me! Excuse me!

334
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
The Han family has declared bankruptcy.

335
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Han Shijie,

336
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
you should have thought of the result

337
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
that you can't pay back.

338
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Good! This time the problem is more serious.

339
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
No, no.

340
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
I didn't run away.

341
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm going to get the money.

342
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
My money! My money!

343
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
My money!

344
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Don't grab it!

345
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Mine! Mine!

346
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Don't grab it! Don't grab it!

347
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Don't grab it! Hurry up and chase after it!

348
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Get out of the way!

349
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Thus the two crystals dried up and one failed to come out.

350
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Hence the two crystals dried up and one failed to come out.

351
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Thus the two crystals dried up and one failed to come out.

352
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Thus the two crystals died.

353
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Thus the two crystals dried up and one failed to come out.

354
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Thus the two crystals died.

355
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,740
So don't you have the comeback led by

356
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,040
the nonexistent세.

357
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
The life and death of a single soul

358
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
is death which means the death of anyone else.

359
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
But the orange I have,

360
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
you are just playing with me.

361
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm telling you,

362
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
even if I let those land be ruined,

363
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
bury all the oranges in the ground,

364
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
I won't sell them to you.

365
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
We've calculated for you.

366
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Now the market is saturated,

367
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
the oranges are sold out.

368
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
So for you,

369
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
the orange will only be a burden.

370
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Even if you are on the Han family's side,

371
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
you still can't fight back.

372
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Han Shijie,

373
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
instead of being so persistent,

374
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
you should be more urgent.

375
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
One day later,

376
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
your power will increase.

377
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Do you really want to go with those people?

378
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
They will really break your bones.

379
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Han Shijie,

380
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
if you don't sign,

381
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,040
when the land is sold,

382
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,040
the price will be higher.

383
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
What's the price now?

384
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Okay.

385
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I admit it.

386
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
But it's not over yet.

387
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
The End

388
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Xiuqu,

389
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
you never want to know

390
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
who your real father is.

391
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Master Jin.

392
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Master Jin.

393
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
How are you?

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
How are you these days?

395
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
I'm fine.

396
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
But Mr. Han came here once.

397
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
He found it.

398
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
The End

399
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,040
This business is

400
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
very complicated.

401
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Go tell him

402
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
when he has news about my daughter

403
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
and when he will say something else.

404
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
I understand.

405
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Yes.

406
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
The End

407
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Master Shen,

408
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
I want

409
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
to marry Zhile.

410
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I...

411
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,040
You're so stubborn.

412
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Uncle,

413
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
I know you don't like Xiao Ye.

414
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
But in my heart,

415
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
all the men in the world are not as good as him.

416
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Don't you want to see me happy?

417
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Yes.

418
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
In the past,

419
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I was a fool.

420
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
I was a scumbag.

421
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I used to go out to fight.

422
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
I have nothing to lose.

423
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Since I met him,

424
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
I was afraid for the first time.

425
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm afraid

426
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I'll lose someone I care about

427
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
and someone who cares about me.

428
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
So

429
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I quit.

430
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Uncle,

431
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
I know you're afraid I'll lose someone

432
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
and want to find a partner for me.

433
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
But in my heart,

434
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
love is more important than marriage.

435
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
No matter what,

436
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,040
I don't care if I'm poor, rich, or good.

437
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,040
I will never regret.

438
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Just trust me once.

439
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Let me choose the life I want.

440
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
When your father passed away,

441
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
holding my hand,

442
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I said only one thing.

443
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Take good care of you.

444
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
All these years,

445
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
I was a nephew.

446
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
But I've already treated you

447
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
as my own daughter.

448
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Master Shen,

449
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,040
even if I die,

450
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I will never let you down.

451
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Uncle.

452
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Come.

453
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
At this moment,

454
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
let's go after dinner.

455
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
You...

456
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
What does your uncle mean?

457
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Then let's agree.

458
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Agree?

459
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Hurry.

460
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Master Shen,

461
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
please wait a moment.

462
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Master Shen is here.

463
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Master?

464
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Master,

465
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
what's wrong?

466
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
How long?

467
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
It's been seven years.

468
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
You were bullied at the dance party.

469
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
You were flattered.

470
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
You looked so helpless and pitiful.

471
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I didn't expect that now you became a weak and evil person.

472
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
You are a good person.

473
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
No.

474
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Master, I was wrong.

475
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
I did all this because I love you so much.

476
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I didn't treat you well these years.

477
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
You framed Xiuqu over and over again.

478
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
I wanted to kill him when I was unconscious.

479
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,040
I can't tolerate a cruel person like you.

480
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
Master, I won't do it again.

481
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Please give me another chance.

482
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Leave by yourself.

483
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
You can take all the things I gave you.

484
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,040
This is the last time I can leave you.

485
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Master.

486
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
What?

487
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,040
You want to beg me today?

488
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Please give me another chance.

489
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Master.

490
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Master.

491
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Master.

492
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Master.

493
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,040
The flower bloomed in the past.
