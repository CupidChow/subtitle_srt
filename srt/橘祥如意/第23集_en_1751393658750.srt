1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Brother.

3
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Brother came here today.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There must be something special, right?

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiaoju.

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How old is your child?

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Two months.

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Two months.

9
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good, good, good.

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You were still in the Shen family at that time.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This...

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is the child of me and Xiuqu.

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Xiuqu and I are now husband and wife.

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This child came here justly.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No matter who wants to hurt my child,

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
don't blame me.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry.

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I won't hurt this child.

19
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On the contrary,

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you must give birth to him.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But he must be alive.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But he must be the child of me and Xiuqu.

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will go back to the Shen family

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to claim that Xiuqu was in great difficulty.

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This child is raised by me.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's my father.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The family property of the Shen family

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and the family business I have,

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
will be all his.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Brother.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't understand what you are talking about.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is the child of me and Xiuqu.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you want to take it away?

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, not take.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm asking you.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm asking you.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To claim that this is the child of me and Xiuqu.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your relationship can only exist in secret.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Master.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is ridiculous.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Brother.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have gone through all the hardships

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to get out of the Shen family.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you want us to go back

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and steal love for a lifetime?

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I...

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I have a reason.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I, Shen Yaning, have never begged anyone in my life.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But this time I want to beg you.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Please fulfill the crime of a man.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And the reputation of the whole family.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For the so-called reputation,

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you have to lose your personality, right?

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Even hurting my child

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and making him the victim of the Fengjian family

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is a crime.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I beg you.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You want to make him the victim of the Fengjian family, right?

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Master.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We can't accept it.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please go back.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I knew it would be like this.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But I had to come.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Today you just pretend I didn't come.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Take good care of Xiuqu.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm responsible for myself

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
One said it without surprise

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One is too confident to make a promise

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I cried for happiness from the beginning

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then I smiled to end it

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The tears that flowed

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Can make people learn to be mature

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Time is breaking through the beautiful

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And the cruel

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Love is not a constant temperature

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I cried for happiness from the beginning

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then I smiled to end it

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The tears that flowed

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Can make people learn to be mature

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sometimes I can say hello politely

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
From a friend's angle

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sometimes I can say hello politely

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
From a friend's angle

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong with brother today?

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What he said is so strange.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think he seems to be in a lot of trouble.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Could something happen to the Shen family?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I also feel a little weird.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You say

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Could the master encounter some difficulties?

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Otherwise he had already helped us before.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why suddenly

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Suddenly changed again?

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The god of heaven is in the house.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sixth Lord and Third Madam are not dead.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go to the god's house

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Watch it well

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I dare not

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Who gave you the right?

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where is my brother?

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want to see my brother

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is what your brother means.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How could the master?

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He just clearly

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Stop talking nonsense.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hurry up and take it back to the Shen family.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Tianzhou

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tianzhou

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Xiaojue

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Xiaojue

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Tianzhou

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Xiaojue

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Tianzhou

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You let him go

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let him go

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Xiaojue

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Xiaojue

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Who gave you the right?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I caught the sixth and the lord without permission.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Didn't I already ask you?

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But the result

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Still rejected

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I came back with a nose.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is to be painted.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't think we don't know the big guy.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This thing wants to drag to the end.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Impossible

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We have already told the lord and the third wife.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is what the big guy means.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How dare you

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In the name of my name

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This makes me have a face in the future.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Face the six and Xiaoju

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The face of the big guy alone

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How can it be compared to the face of the whole Shen family?

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The king's death cannot be broken.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The Shen family cannot be destroyed in our generation.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have to force it.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't come to the death again.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If the big guy doesn't obey

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then the three wives in the belly

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The evil seed that is in the mess

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can't stay

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What do you say

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Only like this

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Can make the six and the third wife

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can't be done

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The face of the big guy

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And the reputation of the Shen family

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Only to be protected

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where does this kid go?

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Big guy, you choose yourself.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Face

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Name

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Family

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I anybody

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,840
How many

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I do jumping

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Lock

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Did you pick up

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That line

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,260
Erfolg and fortune in heaven...

169
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,120
The Communist Party single

170
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,160
the Tzu Chi of six emperors

171
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
and be …

172
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,780
...given a great honor

173
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,300
to lastn

174
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,060
their great strength.

175
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,360
And be加油!

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't make any trouble!

177
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
Why did he do that?

178
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
It's the master's order.

179
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,280
We can only obey him.

180
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,080
Mrs. Jiang,

181
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
this is the young master's clothes

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,400
that we have prepared.

183
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,720
Look.

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,360
How cute!

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,520
Master.

186
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,600
Master.

187
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Sit down.

188
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Master.

189
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Master.

190
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,400
Master,

191
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
what happened?

192
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
Do you have any reason to do this?

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,240
Master.

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,520
Yanzhou and I

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,680
will try our best to help you.

196
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,560
It's my idea.

197
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
You're a young man.

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
The most important thing now is this child.

199
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,320
Don't expect me to save you.

200
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,680
He was tied up in the pond.

201
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Mike and my daughter

202
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,360
are livingleg Bakunade.

203
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:36,920
Their drums sound like a bell

204
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,080
hitting a피 ty issue

205
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,400
is Mikey's partner.

206
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,280
New find,

207
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
a surely good one.

208
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
There are 4 sticks.

209
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
And Ma Peiutar's

210
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,280
terrible technique!

211
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,000
So the rest is a joke!

212
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
They started to make shit.

213
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
We was бытьon fun.

214
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
Hes's Theme

215
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm feeling relieved.

216
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Brother,

217
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
why did you do all this?

218
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Please tell me the truth.

219
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Brother,

220
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
say something.

221
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Brother,

222
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
do you want to know why?

223
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm telling you now.

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
I have a bad habit of being

225
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
like a family member

226
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
and betraying my ancestors.

227
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I've never said

229
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
that I would be the last one

230
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
to be in my hands.

231
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Brother,

232
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
is this true?

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
My father used to hold my hand

234
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
and say that

235
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
he had once cast a spell

236
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
and if he wanted to live forever,

237
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
he had to marry a good son

238
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
or he would have no hope.

239
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
He wanted me to be a teacher.

240
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Family interests are the most important thing in life.

241
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
So since I was a child,

242
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
I've been living in the fate of the Shen Family.

243
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Family,

244
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
family name,

245
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Brother has been suffering from these for a lifetime.

246
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
But Brother,

247
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
the child is innocent.

248
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
So I have to keep this child.

249
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
I'm willing to pay for it.

250
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Madam.

251
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Madam.

252
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Xiaojue.

253
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Xiaojue.

254
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
What are you doing?

255
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
Xiaojue.

256
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I was wrong.

258
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
It's all my fault.

259
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
It's all my selfishness that has caused you harm.

260
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Because I wanted to keep Master

261
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
and keep him from talking about his selfishness,

262
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I dragged you

263
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
into the Shen Family.

264
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I'm sorry, Xiaojue.

265
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I caused you harm.

266
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm sorry to you and Master.

267
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
It's all my fault.

268
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Madam,

269
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
why did you say that?

270
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Let's get up first.

271
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Get up and talk.

272
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Xiaojue,

273
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
have you been sleeping for 20 years?

274
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
I know

275
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
you're still young.

276
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You can't be like me.

277
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
You'll be trapped in this big house for the rest of your life.

278
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I'll take you away.

279
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Come with me.

280
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
I'll take you out.

281
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Master.

282
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
You can't leave now.

283
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Listen to me.

284
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Go.

285
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
No, you can't go.

286
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Madam.

287
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Madam.

288
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Are you okay?

289
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Shen Yanqing,

290
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
I want to divorce you.

291
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
I want to divorce you.

292
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Nothing.

293
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
In these 20 years,

294
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I've had a dream.

295
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
In the past,

296
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
I would take all the responsibility

297
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
and leave it to myself.

298
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
But now,

299
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

300
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

301
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

302
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

303
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

304
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I've lived in vain

305
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
for the first half of my life.

306
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
You

307
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
know it all.

308
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
I know it all.

309
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I'm sorry for you.

310
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Shen Yanqing,

311
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I want to ask you

312
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
if you really cared about me

313
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
for the past decades.

314
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Even if

315
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
your love

316
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
and your affectionate eyes

317
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
are nothing but a joke,

318
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
I said I didn't care.

319
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
But do you know

320
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
I felt so sad

321
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
from the bottom of my heart?

322
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
I've been waiting for that for my whole life.

323
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
I want to ask you one more thing.

324
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Do you know what I'm called?

325
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
I'm called

326
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Shen Yanqing.

327
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Do you know what I'm called?

328
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
In this family,

329
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm the only one who doesn't have a name.

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I'm called Madam.

331
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
That decent, virtuous,

332
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
kind and kind Madam.

333
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Who am I?

334
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Who am I?

335
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Zhuang Hui.

336
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Zhuang Hui.

337
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
You're in the Shen family.

338
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
You're the father of the Shen family.

339
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
And you met me.

340
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
You're the only one who doesn't have a name.

341
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm Zhuang Hui.

342
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Master,

343
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
you called me Zhuang Hui.

344
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm not Madam.

345
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
I'm not Madam.

346
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm not Madam.

347
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm not Madam.

348
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Let's go, Zhuang Hui.

349
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Leave the Shen family.

350
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
You're free.

351
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Let's go.

352
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Let's go.

353
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Let's go.

354
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Let's go.

355
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Let's go.

356
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
If you have no intention,

357
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
I'll stop.

358
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Rather than relying on someone else's love,

359
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
it's better to break apart and re-birth.

360
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
And re-birth another side of the world.

361
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I've been trapped in this house all my life.

362
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
It's time to go out

363
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
and see the outside world.

364
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Madam, take care of yourself.

365
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Go.

366
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Take care.

367
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Take care.

368
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Take care.

369
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Take care.

370
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Take care.
