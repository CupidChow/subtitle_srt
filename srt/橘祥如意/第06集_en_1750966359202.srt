1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Then you tell me now give me a gift is a show or a sister-in-law

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Liu Dian

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You have to get cold

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Drink it

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You are so good

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are so good

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can treat your nephew

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
but your heart disease

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You still need to be careful

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I said everything I should say

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You do it yourself

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't get better

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want to get better

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm not as heartless as you

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is love

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have forgotten

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You also forget

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
People live in the world

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Not only love

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There are more important things

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go and get the medicine for Liu Yan

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The moon is the sound of the song

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The moon is not too short

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In the morning

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The moon is not too short

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In the morning

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The moon is not too short

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In the morning

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The moon is not too short

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In the morning

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sixth

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is not a fireworks show

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are too rude

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Turn off this

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Your brother will hear it

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I will serve him

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have my sister-in-law to give me medicine

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What is going on with you

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why did you become like this

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It hurts me so much

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are like this

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sister-in-law

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't see the mirror

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you feel annoyed

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go out and walk

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Keep dancing, don't stop

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll give you a beat

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Dance

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dance

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The wind that blows in the middle of the day

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The wind that blows in the middle of the day

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Dance

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How to escape

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Did you send the goods to him

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all arranged

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Boss Wen plans to buy all the rest of the oranges

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then we can't

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Third madam wants to make orange jam

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have to leave her some fun

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Master

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Third madam

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll talk to the third madam

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You go first

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Walk with me

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's enough

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How about Lao Liu

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
His wound has been healed

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lao Liu is my only brother

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
His sister-in-law and I raised him

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If it's not too much

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will never beat him

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know what happened recently

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This kid is like a person

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Like a demon

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Maybe there is something on your mind

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe it will be better in a while

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I hope so

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you think that day

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The spirit person is similar to you

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Do you have

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Really?

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't think so

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you suddenly saying five wrong things

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's the master suddenly asked

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't tell if it's serious

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or laugh

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't know how to answer

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just talk

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't learn the first madam's way

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are always trying to get my meaning

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's the difference between me and you

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Come

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Today's orange is very sweet

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
By the way

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have found the way for you

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In the morning

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There are a few shops in the city

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Really?

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But they

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's for the sake of the master

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Businessmen are talking about interests

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's your orange jam

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Delicious

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you master

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In the future, use Jiangcheng and Lingcheng

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will help you to sell orange jam

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
To the whole country

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will make the orange jam better

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Will not disappoint the master

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To my expectations

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
it is good

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Good

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Happy New Year

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Happy New Year

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Happy New Year

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Happy New Year

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Happy New Year

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Happy New Year

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Good

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ye

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ye, everyone is here

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Happy New Year

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Shen Chunle

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you doing here

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Isn't it obvious

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The beauty of the night is the same

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You four, come with me

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Can you stop messing around

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This time he is serious

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Am I not beautiful enough

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or not enough

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Or not enough

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
As for technology

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You will know when you try

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is not where you, a big girl, should come from

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Where to go

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm not going anywhere

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I tell you the truth

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I want to come to you for an internship

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Please

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I want to come to you for an internship

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ok

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You want to go to work, right

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The most important thing

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Not technology, but the atmosphere and talent

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Have to give you

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A face

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ok

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You go back

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You go back

163
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You talk

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You go back

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You can see me if you go back

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Very good

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Very good

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did not pass the interview

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Take her away

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ye

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You dare to play me

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This woman

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Very scary

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tomorrow is the day of the fire

176
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This batch of orange jam

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Have to be made quickly

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mrs. San, in fact, you don't have to do it yourself

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just let the servants do these things

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Just let the servants do it

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In this life

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's like growing oranges

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What you plant will reap what

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If I could grow a tree

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you expect others to cover the wind and rain for me

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What's wrong with you

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's the spirit that brought back by the sixth month

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Only we serve him

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Unhappy, cold

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Old master and the big lady

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There is something out

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There is something out

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go and see

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Dare to play dirty with me

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What are you

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The people of the Shen family

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's not your turn to teach

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mrs. San

215
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Give you a face

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Call you Mrs. San

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't give face

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You are just a country girl

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You just borrowed the old master's material

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Really take yourself as a phoenix

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Since you said that

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then I'll borrow it

223
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You like to eat

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then let you eat enough

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This table of food can't be eaten

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You don't want to leave this room

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
One step

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I am a man of the sixth lord

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So what

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I am the sixth lord's sister-in-law

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What, do you need me to help you

232
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What a mysterious

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What is this

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What's going on

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll show you.

238
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's the orange jam he made.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What a silly thing to eat.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll show you.

241
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Orange jam

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You did it, didn't you?

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why are you blaming a good person?

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You just broke a few orange jam.

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What does it have to do with me?

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I didn't mention jam.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
How do you know what's in the jar?

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Unless you've been to the warehouse and seen it.

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I just heard from the servants.

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How can you still argue?

251
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because of you, the jam in the warehouse is all over.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I...

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's the privilege given by Sixth Master.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He allowed me to go to the warehouse.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He said I could take whatever I like.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's just a few orange jam.

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Sixth Master didn't say anything.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How can you say three things?

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, I'll go to Sixth Master now.

261
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Sixth Master

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Brother

263
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
These things have been in my heart for a while.

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't stop them.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can only tell you everything in this way.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Actually, Xiu Jun and I...

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What are you doing here?

268
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You gave him privilege.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let him do whatever he wants in the Shen family.

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You even allowed him to go to the warehouse, right?

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So what?

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He just broke a few jars of jam.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll pay you back with the money.

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can take whatever you hate me or take revenge on me.

275
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But the orange jam is my career and my bottom line.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How can I explain to those buyers?

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Shen Yanzhao

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How did you become like this?

279
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What did I become?

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You dare not to add anything?

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can't even recognize myself.

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can't recognize you.

283
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You betrayed me, hurt me, hurt me.

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't forget, you created me today.

285
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay, it's all my fault.

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I should take it.

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But Shen Yanzhao

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I tell you, don't touch my bottom line again.

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I saw it...

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,500
I...

291
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,000
I know.

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Add some water inside.

293
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay.

294
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's going on?

295
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What's going on?

296
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We can only hand in these today.

297
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
As for the rest,

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
we'll compensate you three times according to the contract.

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The merchant has agreed to extend the delivery date to five days.

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
How could he suddenly agree to deliver the goods in a short time?

301
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
After Master found out about your situation,

302
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he personally asked the merchant to give the delivery date in a short time.

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He also agreed to give Jiangcheng's business a share.

304
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Third Madam, you've signed the contract with Master again.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How can you repay the debt so easily?

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The merchant has agreed to extend the delivery date to five days.

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The merchant has agreed to extend the delivery date to five days.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's as if the situation is getting worse.

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:21:08,480
Unlike me, I'm already like a dry

310
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Madam is a noble lady.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Whether it's Liu Ruyan or the embroidery bureau,

312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
they are all inferior to you.

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So what if I'm a noble lady?

314
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'll get old and ugly.

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Liu Ruyan is different.

316
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
She's young and pretty.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No wonder Master adores her.

318
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But now I have you.

319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're younger, prettier, and more human.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Madam, I still need some time.

321
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This orange has to be picked,

322
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
peeled, and then returned to its original form.

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's what it's worth.

324
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If not, the wind blows and the sun rises,

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
one day it will be old and dry.

326
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Then it's meaningless, isn't it?

327
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Here.

328
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
How does the orange taste?

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Only when Master has tasted your taste,

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
will you be able to truly grasp Master's heart.

331
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You will eventually live through this,

332
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and become a sincere woman to Master.

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Do you understand?

334
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Jinniang.

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Madam, it's all ready.

336
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Here, Xiaojue.

337
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
All right.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I look forward to your good news.

339
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's go, Jinniang.

340
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes.

341
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'll be waiting.

342
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll be waiting.

343
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's go, Jinniang.

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yes.

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Master Six.

346
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Madam, save me.

347
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Why did you come to my room

348
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
to be filial to your own woman?

349
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Don't take it so lightly.

350
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I was drunk that day.

351
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I was not dead.

352
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I know very well whether I touched her or not.

353
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
As for how she came to my room,

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
you know better than me.

355
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You are a bad dancer.

356
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You are a good dancer,

357
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
but the Shen Family can still give you food.

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
If you play tricks behind my back,

359
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you will pay for it.

360
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Stop.

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Don't play this trick with me.

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I tell you, Shen Yanzhou,

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
she is your sister-in-law.

364
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Shut up.

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If you let me catch her again,

366
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I will let you, a woman who is not honest

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and not obedient, get out of the family.

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You useless thing.

369
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Madam, you sent me to seduce and frame Master Six.

370
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You also let me monitor him and Madam.

371
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I swear,

372
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
their relationship is not simple.

373
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Go on.

374
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Think about it.

375
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
She called me Juer

376
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
because of Madam.

377
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's right.

378
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I know it.

379
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Please leave the Shen Family.

380
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
If you don't let me live well,

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
then don't think about anyone.

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Master.

383
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I will give you a coat.

384
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Master.

385
