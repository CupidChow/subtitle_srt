00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,940
Head وه收看 ho arribat.

2
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,620
Episode libertary

3
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Shen Yanzhao.

4
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
What?

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're in my dream again.

6
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,040
Sister-in-law.

7
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Put it down.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Come.

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Come.

10
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
Kneel.

11
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Sister-in-law.

12
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
Where are you taking Xiu Ju?

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,560
To the right place.

14
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Don't forget,

15
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,240
Xiu Ju belongs to me and Master.

16
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't need you to interfere.

17
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Sister-in-law,

18
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,120
Xiu Ju is not someone's friend.

19
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
Xiu Ju is not someone's friend.

20
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,400
Besides,

21
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
am I not a member of the Shen Family?

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,200
Since you know you're a member of the Shen Family,

23
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
do you know who you are?

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
Don't do anything out of line.

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
You and Xiu Ju are in a relationship.

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,640
It's a matter of life and death.

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
Don't put the whole world

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,080
in the hands of the Shen Family.

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,840
From now on,

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
I hope you stay away from Xiu Ju.

31
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Remember my words.

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,760
Go.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Master.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,280
When Third Madam comes back,

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,080
the patient wants you to accompany her.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,600
You two can stay here tonight.

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
when you're almost home.

38
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Get out.

39
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,400
Master.

40
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,520
Master今天晚上

41
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,600
白晴

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Yan...

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Yan Zhou.

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
You came back, Junhao.

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
You are so affectionate.

46
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I have done so much for you.

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I can't let you get away with it.

48
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Be careful, Master Liu.

49
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Are you going to the workshop?

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
What happened to your leg?

51
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Master Liu, yesterday...

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I accidentally fell down.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm going to the workshop too.

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's go together.

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Let's go.

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Master Liu.

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Are you okay?

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm fine.

59
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Brother.

60
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Master.

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Let's go.

62
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Since you have rested,

63
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
go to the shop in the east street to settle the accounts.

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
When you have settled the accounts,

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
when you will come back.

66
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I will personally send your sister-in-law there.

67
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's go.

68
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Let's go.

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
The orange cake tastes good.

70
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Why did you suddenly come?

71
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Is there something wrong?

72
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I came to learn.

73
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
What's wrong?

74
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Aren't you welcome?

75
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Do you like to learn

76
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
or do you want to steal?

77
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
I said, is there no one in your family?

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
You actually let a woman

79
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
come out to manage the business.

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I thought

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Boss Han was just a little shallow.

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I didn't expect that thinking is so narrow.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Since ancient times,

84
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
men and women have no difference.

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
It's just that the social division is different.

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
A woman can certainly be called

87
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
half the master.

88
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
If Boss Han despises women,

89
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
why don't you think about your wife and mother?

90
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
In this day and age,

91
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
the world has changed,

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
the society has improved,

93
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
and the dust has come out of the heart.

94
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Men and women have no difference.

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
The capable are the ones who are hurt.

96
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
If you can't accept the new silk market,

97
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
you should be swept into the garbage pile of history.

98
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
What are you doing?

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
What are you doing?

100
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Boss Han seems to be in a great mood today.

101
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
Hurry up and get them out.

102
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
What are you doing?

103
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Go.

104
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Don't you dare!

105
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Back off!

106
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Get out!

107
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Get out!

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Get out!

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Get out!

110
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Get out!

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Get out!

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Get out!

113
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Get out!

114
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Get out!

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Get out!

116
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Get out!

117
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Get out!

118
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Get out!

119
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Get out!

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Get out!

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
All right.

122
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Do you know how important this jade pendant is?

123
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
This is the only proof that our master has been looking for

124
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
for many years.

125
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
You just broke it like this.

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Shut up!

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I tell you,

128
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
if you can't repair my jade pendant,

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
don't do business with the Shen family.

130
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Wait!

131
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Han Shijie is actually my biological brother.

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
How is that possible?

133
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
My brother is not such a despicable and shameless person.

134
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Sixth Brother!

135
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Sixth Brother.

136
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Qin Shueping?

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Why are you here?

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Of course I'm here to see you.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Today, the reunion party specially sent me to invite you to a big Buddha.

140
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Let's go.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Don't be shy.

142
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's go.

143
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Sixth Brother,

144
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,600
how long have we not seen each other since we graduated?

145
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Today, no matter what,

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
we have to get together.

147
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I tell you,

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I miss you very much.

149
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
The traitor who sold the country

150
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
is begging for glory and the country's people.

151
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
So that our mountains and rivers are broken and the people are not healed.

152
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
We can only defeat the traitor

153
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
to protect our homeland.

154
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Qin Shueping!

155
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Protect our homeland!

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Protect our homeland!

157
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Qin Shueping!

158
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Defeat the traitor!

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Protect our homeland!

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Qin Shueping!

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Protect our homeland!

162
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Defeat the traitor!

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Protect our homeland!

164
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Defeat the traitor!

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Take all these rebels away.

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
You can't let any of them go.

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Dare to resist,

168
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
kill them on the spot.

169
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Yes.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm Shen Yanzhu.

171
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
You did a good job.

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
That's what you deserve.

173
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Thank you, Mr. Han.

174
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Thank you, Mr. Han.

175
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You should know the consequences of offending the Shen family.

176
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I don't need to teach you the rest of the story, do I?

177
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
I understand.

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I will leave right away

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
and seek refuge in Nanyang.

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Go to Nanyang?

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Fine.

182
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
I'll send you to the West.

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I happen to have a way to Nanyang.

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
I can send you there directly.

185
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Thank you, Mr. Han.

186
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I will never forget it.

187
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
It's good that you know.

188
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Go.

189
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I think he has a way to go.

190
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Just let him go like this?

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I don't dare to leave such a betrayer

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
with him.

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
It's better to throw him into the sea

194
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
to make me feel at ease.

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
At the end of the story,

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Mr. Han is still the one who is in charge.

197
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
This time, not only can the Shen family be in chaos,

198
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
but also gain some strength.

199
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I...

200
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
It's all thanks to your idea.

201
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
But after we destroy the Shen family,

202
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
you will gain the most.

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
We plan a great event together.

204
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
What event?

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Why are you and I?

206
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Everything that the Shen family owns

207
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
will be mine sooner or later.

208
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Including you.

209
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Xiuju, eat more.

210
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
You don't look well lately.

211
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
What?

212
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Is there something wrong with the workshop?

213
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
No.

214
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Everything is fine.

215
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Master, bad news!

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Sixth Master is dead.

217
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
He is not dead.

218
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
He is alive.

219
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
He is alive.

220
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
He is alive.

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Sixth Master.

222
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Sixth Master was caught by the people of the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

223
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
What?

224
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
What happened?

225
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
According to the rumors,

226
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Sixth Master and his classmates went to a party.

227
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Unexpectedly, when they went in,

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
they were criticizing the military law and made a bad speech.

229
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
They were caught by the people.

230
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
It's obvious that they were set up.

231
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
How could they do this to such a big person?

232
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh my god.

233
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
How could this happen?

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Master,

235
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,600
please find a way to save Sixth Master.

236
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Yes.

237
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
This prison is not a place for people to stay.

238
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
This is a big deal.

239
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
He dares to jump into the trap of the people.

240
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
He should be kept in the prison.

241
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
This...

242
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Master, let's save Sixth Master first.

243
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Let him reflect on himself at home.

244
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
He deserves this.

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
He should be punished

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
without thinking.

247
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
If you spread my words,

248
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
no one can save him.

249
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Okay.

250
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Master,

251
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
no matter what the reason is,

252
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
you can't put the Green Emperor in danger.

253
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Even if you want to teach him a lesson,

254
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
you can't let him suffer in prison.

255
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Even you have to betray me.

256
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I say it again.

257
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
No one is allowed to save him.

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Madam.

259
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Master,

260
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
maybe you have your own reasons.

261
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
But I think

262
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
your decision is appropriate.

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
The priority now

264
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
is to save him first.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Do as I say.

266
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,600
The End

267
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
You are really helping me.

268
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Don't mention it.

269
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Listen,

270
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
we can save him in two minutes.

271
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
No problem.

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I don't dare to let him go with this case.

273
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Right?

274
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
No, no.

275
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,160
You're the big boy.

276
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,800
Go away.

277
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,320
Uncle Six.

278
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,920
Uncle Six.

279
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,080
Chi Lu.

280
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,480
Two minutes.

281
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,000
Xiu Ju.

282
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,520
Uncle Six.

283
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,160
I asked Xiu Ju about you.

284
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
He was so worried.

285
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Chi Lu.

286
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,040
Chi Lu.

287
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,920
Come here.

288
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,520
Does it hurt?

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,720
No.

290
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't worry.

291
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,480
I'll find a way to get you out.

292
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,240
Hurry up.

293
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
It's time.

294
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,240
Hurry up.

295
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,080
It's too fast.

296
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,600
Go.

297
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,400
No.

298
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
There are two minutes left.

299
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Hurry up.

300
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,240
No.

301
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Wait a minute.

302
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,160
Go.

303
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,880
Hurry up.

304
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,480
It hurts.

305
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Go back.

306
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Go.

307
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,680
Enough.

308
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,200
Go.

309
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,880
Go.

310
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,480
Go.

311
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,000
Go.

312
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Go.

313
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,200
Go.

314
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Go.

315
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Go.

316
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Go.

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Go.

318
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,200
Go.

319
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,800
Go.

320
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Go.

321
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,000
Go.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Go.

323
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Go.

324
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Hurry up.

325
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Hurry up.

326
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
I was happy when I cried.

327
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,200
Then I smiled and said goodbye.

328
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
The tears I shed

329
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,000
can't make me mature.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Time blows away the beauty.

331
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
It's cruel.

332
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,400
Love is not a constant temperature.

333
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,800
I was crying when I cried.

334
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
What's wrong with you today?

335
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,200
You brought the third madam of the Shen family

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
to my place.

337
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,200
If you want to know who owns this jade pendant,

338
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
help me save Shen Yanzhou.

339
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
How could you do this?

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,800
I'll kill you.

341
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
I will kill you.

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I will kill you.

343
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Zhou.

344
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Zhou.

345
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Zhou.

346
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Zhou.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,560
Zhou.

348
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,800
Master.

349
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,800
What's wrong?

350
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
What's the matter?

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Why is it so quiet in the house today?

352
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,160
I can't see anyone.

353
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,400
Where have you been?

354
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,840
We haven't come back yet

355
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,800
for the sake of the Sixth.

356
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,680
Now, no one in this house

357
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,120
can understand me.

358
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,760
Zhou.

359
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,280
I have become the biggest sinner.

360
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,520
Master.

361
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,200
Don't you really want to save the Sixth?

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,120
If you need anything,

363
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,720
just tell me.

364
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
Why do you have to come in person?

365
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,840
Sit.

366
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,240
I won't be involved in the case.

367
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,200
Shen Yanzhou,

368
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
caught your men.

369
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,720
It must be the men who are so arrogant

370
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
that they hit their own brother.

371
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,040
Don't worry.

372
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,600
I'll release them as soon as I get back.

373
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,680
You have to release them.

374
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,080
But not now.

375
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,480
He's just a rebellious man.

376
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,560
He can't hear me.

377
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,560
I can take this opportunity to teach him a lesson.

378
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I hope you can forgive me.

379
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,880
This is a token of my gratitude.

380
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,000
Please forgive me.

381
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,920
Actually, I've made the arrangement.

382
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
The reason why I'm so tough on Liu

383
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,440
is not because of my personal reasons.

384
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,920
I just hope he can grow up

385
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
through this.

386
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,480
After all,

387
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
I still hope that Liu can take my position.

388
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,240
I can't let him make mistakes.

389
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I see.

390
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,840
I've misunderstood you.

391
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,120
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

392
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm sorry, Master.

393
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
But now the development of the situation

394
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
is far from my control.

395
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
This is not only making me start to doubt

396
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
whether I'm old

397
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
or not.

398
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,160
I made a mistake.

399
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
I understand.

400
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,960
You've made every step very hard.

401
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,400
Everything is far from my control.

402
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,800
Maybe after Liu takes my position,

403
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,720
he can understand the hardships.

404
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
It's not necessary.

405
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,840
Liu hasn't come back yet.

406
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Did something happen to Zhifeng?

407
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,760
Brother.

408
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,120
Brother.

409
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,400
You've suffered a lot.

410
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
Others can't even see your trap.

411
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,720
You deserve it.

412
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,240
Brother.

413
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,840
I know what you're going to say.

414
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll take care of everything.

415
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,880
I'll go to the ancestral hall and kneel down.

416
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,400
Master Liu, be careful.

417
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,720
Master.

418
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,800
I'll go and tell Madam.

419
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,200
Master.

420
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,600
Master.

421
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,160
Master.

422
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,840
Madam went to ask for Han Shijie

423
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
and took Master Liu away.

424
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,400
We were too late.

425
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,280
She really loves Liu.

426
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,320
Master.

427
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
Why haven't you been wearing

428
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,560
this hairpin lately?

429
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,400
I've been busy recently.

430
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,000
It's too expensive.

431
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,080
I'm afraid I won't be able to try it on.

432
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
Only you deserve it.

433
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,680
I was shocked at the auction.

434
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,120
I scared everyone out there.

435
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
That's because I knew

436
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,680
good things

437
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,600
are worth giving.

438
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,240
Liu is injured.

439
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,760
Take a medicine to see him.

440
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,680
Me?

441
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,880
Don't you care?

442
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,600
Master.

443
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,960
I care about him

444
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,760
because we're family.

445
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,160
He's my partner.

446
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,040
I can't just watch him

447
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,080
go to prison

448
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,280
and do nothing.

449
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Yeah.

450
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
In the end, I became

451
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
the one who did nothing.

452
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,040
If you're saying

453
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,600
we're family,

454
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,840
why don't you go and care about him

455
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,680
and give him a medicine?

456
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,440
Shouldn't that be a good thing?

457
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
I understand.

458
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,200
Don't you think

459
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,920
this scene is familiar?

460
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,120
Last time when you were punished by my brother,

461
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,360
you were the one who gave me the medicine.

462
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
Stop talking.

463
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,400
Take the medicine.

464
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,680
Then is here

465
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,940
your sister-in-law

466
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,480
or brother-in-law?

467
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
A thousand and ten thousand years

468
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,280
The spring and fall of fate

469
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,080
Is caressing your face

470
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,480
Like the ancient time, the five-leafed flower blooms

471
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,880
In the past

472
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,080
Like the ancient time, the five-leafed flower blooms

473
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
In the past
