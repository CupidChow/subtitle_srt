1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

3
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,900
Oh

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,240
oh

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh

6
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
Oh

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Master, it wasn't me this time.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was him, Mrs. Shisan.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I just said a few words

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
that had something to do with Master Six.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He then shut his face

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and tried to push me into the pool.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was humiliated

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
by so many people.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's work together.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is that true?

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I wanted to remind him

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
about Master Six.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't make him sad

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
at this moment.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Who knew that he would get drunk

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and fall down

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
if he didn't listen to me?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Stop talking nonsense!

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's all the fault of the embroidery bureau.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They didn't stop you.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So many soldiers came today.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a great sin

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to lose the honor

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of the Shen Family.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll take Mrs. Shisan to the study.

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Master will apologize to everyone

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
for me.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll make a small mistake

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to keep everyone's mood.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Master, you...

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm tired.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me take you to rest.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come with me to the study.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have something to tell you.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You've suffered these days.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You like to do business.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll let you manage the theater.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is that okay?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well...

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Master,

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you afraid of?

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If we get married,

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll take over the theater

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and give you the full rights.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Only if you have business

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
can you go to a bigger heaven.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can shine by yourself.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No need to be taken care of.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If we get married,

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
your light can't be covered.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Master,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm willing to take over.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I heard that

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
women are not allowed to go to the study.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Shen Family is in the wrong.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master is determined.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He gave three cards

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to the Third Madam.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How can he do that?

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Third Madam should have continued

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the Shen Family's business.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But he invested in the business.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's beyond

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the duty of a wife.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A woman

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
always shows up outside.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The Shen Family

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
is not allowed to eat

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or wear.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If this is done,

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
where will the family's ancestral rules be?

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's no such thing.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This time,

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm asking you to come out

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to talk to me.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hope you can

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
help me persuade Master.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Even if I'm the bad guy,

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can't let Master

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
be humiliated.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please don't worry.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He can't do that.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There's no woman

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
in the family

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
who can participate in the Shen Family's business.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is the ancestral rules.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's strictly forbidden.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No such thing?

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
From today on, there will be.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The rules are set by people.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The Shen Family has five branches.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why can't I break the old rules

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and open the fairy river?

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How can you be so stubborn?

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For a woman,

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
do you want to disobey your ancestors?

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The Shen Family will be over sooner or later.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a big problem.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The third wife is the

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
big boss.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who dares to talk nonsense again?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't blame me for being shameless.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Men's decision

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is not to blame anything on women.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are so ungrateful.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Since the late father died,

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the Shen family has been

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
everywhere.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How many difficulties

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
did Shen Yingqing

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
bear alone?

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She has the hope of being a leader now.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now the Juyuan has always been

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
a very important role.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to give it to the third wife.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How can you be so heartless?

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to blame you,

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
for the crime of misusing the red salt on the white elixir.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How about

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
selling the Juyuan this season?

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If I can double the profit

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
in the past years,

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
can you please

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
stop me from participating in the business

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
of the Shen Family

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
as a woman?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How is that possible?

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How can we still do business?

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are so stupid.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wait and see how she does it.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If so,

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
why don't you give her this chance?

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
She is useless to us anyway.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Xiuju.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why do you have time to see me?

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You are so happy

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to be here.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No wonder you are so happy.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What do you mean by that?

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't care

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
what those men think.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Just like you.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can be happy

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
after you keep your Juyuan

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and spend your whole life with it.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
To be honest,

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I am here today

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to see you.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I am here to see you.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am here to see you.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I am here to see you.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I am here to talk about cooperation.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Cooperation?

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You mean

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the orange and orange products

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
of the Shen Family

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
are in my play?

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I know that you artists

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
are poor in money

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and don't like to be

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
interfered by others.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But now

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the most effective way

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can think of

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
is this.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Great, Xiuju.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are the first

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
gold owner who is willing to

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
invest in me.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Besides,

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can help you.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But if you want to

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
perform in the city,

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you don't have enough people.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Last time, Xiao Yi

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
owed me a bet.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He can help me.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to change the script.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have to get the orange elements

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
through the whole area.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hurry up.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Someone is acting over there.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's go and have a look.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's so close.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What a pity.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't see

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the orange products of the Shen Family.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's red.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's go.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Look,

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
hours.

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's dead.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm so happy.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's so good.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm so happy.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm so happy.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
My orange is red.

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
My orange is red.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I want to eat orange.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Good.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Good.

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Good.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Good.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Good.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Good.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Good.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Good.

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Good.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Good.

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Good.

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Good.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Good.

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The performance was great.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Now, Shenji

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
has launched a love gambling

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
association and a game production.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All the producers

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
can watch our bad scenes for free.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I want to play.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Slow down.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We have them.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hello.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Look over there.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hello.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We have them.

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't rush.

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How is it?

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So much fun.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm so happy.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll help you this time.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't bother me.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How can I get married

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if my brothers see it?

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They?

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They have them.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Here you are.

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Put them inside.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Please.

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Now,

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Jiangcheng has a new trend

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
for young men and women to love.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're welcome.

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
If you want to eat oranges,

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you have to go to Shenji.

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Zhiluo,

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
thanks for your help.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Xiuju,

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
now you and uncle...

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you love uncle?

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He treats me well.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He often makes me feel guilty.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know how to repay him.

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But true love

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
doesn't have a return.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Murderer!

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Murderer!

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Murderer!

272
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Murderer!

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Murderer!

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Who went to the country of the dead?

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Come and see!

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who bought the orange

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
from Shenji?

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
They ate it and

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
died.

280
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
They killed my family.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm so sorry.

282
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm so sorry.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is too much.

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What are you talking about?

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
How could the orange from Shenji be wrong?

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is a false witness.

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Shenji is not a country

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that can't be denied.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Exactly!

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I guarantee that all the procedures

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
of the orange from Shenji are safe.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Have you asked the doctor?

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's ask the doctor to check it first.

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you doing?

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't touch me!

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't touch me!

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You want to hit me?

299
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you have any manners?

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You don't know?

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Shenji is attacking people.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You want to kill them?

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I didn't hit him.

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How can you guarantee the safety of the orange?

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How can you explain to the victim?

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You didn't even figure it out.

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They did it on purpose.

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Don't believe him!

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They are the blacksmiths.

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They are not the victims.

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't let them escape!

313
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What are you doing?

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Calm down!

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Calm down!

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let go of me!

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't hit me!

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let go of me!

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Stop!

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you okay?

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I am Shen Yanqing, the boss of Shenji.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will take care of this.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
After we find out the truth,

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I will give you a satisfactory explanation.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Boss Shen is so arrogant.

326
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you want to destroy the evidence

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
or bribe the witness?

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who are you?

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is the vice president of Jiangcheng Chamber of Commerce,

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Han Shijie, the new leader of the horse.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Vice president?

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Han Shijie?

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Boss Shen is really a noble man.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He has a lot of memories.

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let me remind you again.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I am still the young boss

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
of Hanji Chamber of Commerce

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
twenty years ago.

339
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's you.

340
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You used a despicable means

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to compete with me.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think

343
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
my son Yanqing is a man of high rank

344
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and he will definitely turn the tables.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You are a man of low rank

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and you will be doomed.

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You will be punished.

348
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dad! Dad, what's wrong with you?

349
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Go away!

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dad! Dad! Dad, wake up!

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Dad!

352
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Dad! Dad! Dad, wake up!

353
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Dad! Dad!

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Dad!

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I, Han Shijie,

356
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
will revenge you

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for hurting your

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
disciple Shen Ji

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and destroying the family.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You have grown up.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It seems that you are also responsible for this.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Since you didn't kill me

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
back then,

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
don't blame me for being so useless.

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shen Yanqing,

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
remember,

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I will be burned by you sooner or later.

368
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Guards!

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Lock Shen Ji's shop.

370
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't tell anyone.

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't open the door

372
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
for a day.

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Good!

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Good!

375
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Good!

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Good!

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Good!

378
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Good!

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Good!

380
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Good!

381
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Come.

382
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You are here.

383
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You mean,

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the customer who died of poisoning

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
died in a fake death?

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes.

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have been suspecting for a long time.

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's said that

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
there should be a corpse after the death.

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But that person didn't have such a situation.

391
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm not sure if I can

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
find the corpse.

393
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm afraid that it will cause more trouble.

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The man's corpse is in danger.

395
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He is still thinking about

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
putting on a gold ring

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and putting on a fake death.

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Instead of looking for people,

399
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
we should set fire.

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The snake is coming out.

401
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Zhou,

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
tell him

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that I want to open the door.

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

405
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The Shen family is here.

406
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If we tell them, they will know.

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't panic.

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Burn all these things.

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's give him a death certificate.

410
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How dare you!

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You dare to fake death

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and get the reputation of the Shen family.

413
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Take him down.

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let me go.

415
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If you have the ability, send me to the police station.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You are so impudent.

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm afraid that the police station has been taken care of by them.

418
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The world is different.

419
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Anyway, it seems that you are a dead man.

420
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You will die if you don't open the door.

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Please forgive me.

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Who told you to do this?

424
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will make sure you don't die.

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay.

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I will tell you.

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I lost money in the gambling house.

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They didn't beat me to death.

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Someone called me

430
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and told me to call the reporters

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
to make trouble.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
After that,

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
they gave up the money.

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I didn't have to do that.

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
These reporters

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
dare to fight against the little one

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and destroy the reputation of the Shen family.

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Master, we have to find a chance

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to go to the police station

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and let the police station remove the reputation

441
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
of the Shen family.

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Miss Liu, I will take care of this.

443
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Master Shen.

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Why are you here?

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I heard that something happened to the Shen family.

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't worry, Master.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have already told the chief editor.

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Tomorrow morning,

449
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the headline of the newspaper will be published.

450
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The original story will be known to the public.

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
By the way,

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
we can help Mrs. Shen

453
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to advertise the story.

454
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What do you think?

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You know each other?

456
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Miss Liu is my wife.

457
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If it weren't for her,

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I wouldn't be here.

459
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Master,

460
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I have done enough.

461
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Don't be angry with me.

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What are you talking about?

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Go back and talk.

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you, chief editor.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You're welcome.

466
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's go. We can take you back to the village this afternoon.

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Don't you want to see your wife?

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you looking at?

469
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I think she is still in Jiangcheng.

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's find her

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and find the one

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
who has the other half of the jade pendant.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Master,

474
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we have been looking for her for so many years.

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Your sister...

476
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Even if I have to dig three feet,

477
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I will find her.

478
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes.

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The Shenji shop is cleaning the house.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The house is not clean.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The house is not clean.

482
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The Shenji shop is cleaning the house.

483
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The order of the orange juice has increased.

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We are lucky.

485
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Master, the oranges inside are ripe.

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
How could this happen?

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's an apple.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Han Shijie must have done it

489
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and removed all the oranges.

490
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There is no evidence.

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Han Shijie must have been so furious.

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Zhou,

493
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
go find all the people who did it.

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Find them.

495
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But these oranges are too late.

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The most important thing now is to stop the damage.

497
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Make a secret sword.

498
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
My mother taught me before.

499
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is the best way to preserve the ripe oranges.

500
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is the best way to preserve the ripe oranges.

501
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Third Madam.

502
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Master.

503
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let me see how it is going.

504
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The more people, the more power.

505
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We can finish the work today.

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Good.

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Good. It's quite sweet.

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Master, you are giving me a lot of respect.

509
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Madam, you are washing the sour fruits.

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This is especially made for you.

511
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Try this.

512
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Try this.

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's quite sweet.

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll go back to work.

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm going.

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Master, you are looking for me?

517
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to the tree to pick the fruit.

518
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You have made a lot of effort.

519
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Now you have a profit.

520
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But...

521
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't know when I can make a profit.

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The fruit you just picked is almost ruined by you.

523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Open it.

524
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Eat it.

525
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I will collect local specialties as a souvenir every time you have a business.

526
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Of course,

527
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
if you can collect with me one day,

528
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
that would be even better.

529
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
There are too many changes in the world that I shouldn't have.

530
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm still waiting for you to come back in my dreams.

531
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Give me a chance,

532
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
okay?

533
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
In this world,

534
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
everyone has a lover.

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
A book of flowers,

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
it seems to have been waiting for ten million years.

537
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's hard to live, it's hard to live,

538
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
a dream, a long year.

539
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The four seasons of love, fate.

540
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
A precious gift that cannot be lost.

541
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Is like a living soul.

542
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,300
If so, you canIF you

543
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,300
see the moon tomorrow night.

544
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,000
Could you find out if freedomVE

545
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
is hidden in the clouds.

546
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The greed that knew no bounds.

547
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
When you feel the warmth of redOK.

548
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,540
In the陷阱 DON pleasing chaos

549
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,420
Searching for time and yet
