1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Villagecommun mother

2
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,520
You are not ready yet

3
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,780
Sorry

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Your Highness.

5
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Highness, what are you doing?

6
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,880
It should just a little wound.

7
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,000
It's okay.

8
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,880
If Madam finds out

9
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,780
that the embroidery bureau does not afford correctly

10
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm going to sew all this up Please, Libationer.

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,280
Maybe one with his smile and another

12
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,500
with his

13
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,160
smile.

14
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,600
the day you put me in your arms.

15
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,440
Have a good rest.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
I have to check the account book.

17
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
Copy right away.

18
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,880
Baby, go now.

19
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Brother Yan is here.

20
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,280
Brother Yan, here comes the fetus.

21
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Miss Shen,

22
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,600
we don't have enough money

23
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,760
to buy your big fortune.

24
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,880
Please go somewhere else.

25
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother Song.

26
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
Do you dare to bet with me

27
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
and decide the winner by winning?

28
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
If I lose,

29
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll give you all these.

30
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
But if I win,

31
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
you'll let me stay and be a court official.

32
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,200
I'll eat, live and worry.

33
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,120
I can't lose anything.

34
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
You

35
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
are betting with me?

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,080
Brother Yan will be a fool at one year old.

37
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
At three, he can turn a coin.

38
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
You and Brother Yan are betting.

39
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
You're not dying, are you?

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Why are you talking so much?

41
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,880
Are you afraid of me?

42
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Or you've been so stubborn since you were a child?

43
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,600
Fine.

44
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,440
I'll let you lose.

45
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm convinced.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,120
This girl dares to bet with Brother Yan?

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,760
Yes.

48
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
She's really strong.

49
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,080
This is a good deal.

50
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
She's a master.

51
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes.

52
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
How many cards does she have?

53
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
This is a good deal.

54
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,600
She can't win the red-tongue.

55
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes.

56
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,360
It's really the red-tongue.

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,880
Yes.

58
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
It's really the red-tongue.

59
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,600
It's really strong.

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,080
It's really strong.

61
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Yes.

62
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,640
That's it.

63
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,920
This is...

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,080
Brother Yan will win this time.

65
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
He's really Brother Yan.

66
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Can this little girl

67
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,160
win the big king?

68
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,320
Xiao Yan.

69
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
You lost again.

70
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,840
This is really the red-tongue.

71
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
It's really the red-tongue.

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,320
This is really the red-tongue.

73
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
It's really the red-tongue.

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
It's really the red-tongue.

75
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
This is really the red-tongue.

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,840
Maybe it's not the red-tongue.

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
You're cheating.

78
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,120
Xiao Yan.

79
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,920
You slandered me because you couldn't win.

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
What kind of man are you?

81
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,320
You're cheating in the capital.

82
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,440
At least leave one hand.

83
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,040
Money?

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
I was just playing.

85
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,120
I won you with my brain.

86
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,880
Count from the left.

87
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
Fourth is the red-tongue.

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
It's really the red-tongue.

89
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Yes.

90
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,040
This is really the red-tongue.

91
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,880
Sixth is the black-tongued.

92
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
It's really the black-tongued.

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
Tenth is the square hook.

94
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Look at him.

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
He lost again.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
Now you're convinced, right?

97
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
Who let my little girl

98
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,480
to crush you on the ground?

99
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,040
Let's go.

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,240
Where are we going?

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
It's not easy.

102
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
Let's go.

103
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,920
Sixth, come on.

104
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,520
I just made you a good bird's nest.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,720
Drink it while it's hot.

106
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Thank you, Mrs. Liu.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Take care.

108
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Mrs. Liu.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Mrs. Liu.

110
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,440
It's done.

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,520
What's going on?

112
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,920
Why did you forget the rules?

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,720
Sixth.

114
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Mrs. Liu, look.

115
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Great.

116
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,480
Sixth.

117
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,520
Now Xiu Ju is your real sister-in-law.

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,160
8th Aunt of Three Dwarfs

119
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,520
Master Long, Madam.

120
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,040
We have many guests

121
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,520
for this wedding.

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,720
I think

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
it's time

124
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
for Mrs. Li

125
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
to make a advisory.

126
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,520
Ok.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,160
Do as you want.

128
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Master, you really like Lady Liu.

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,320
If learn from her,

130
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Xiu Ju will never

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
let you touch her for nothing.

132
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You promise?

133
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
What's the point of you?

134
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
Your Highness, Madam.

135
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
This orange means that

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
the person with the most children will be blessed.

137
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
The stomach of the embroidery bureau will be full.

138
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Just like this red orange.

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
By then,

140
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
we can give birth to a child for you.

141
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I'm afraid it's not just for me.

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
It's also for you.

143
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Actually, you had a different idea about the embroidery bureau from the beginning.

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
You made it

145
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
into a young person.

146
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
People think that I like her

147
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
because I like you.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
If she gives birth to a child, it's like you give birth to a child.

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
Am I right?

150
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
I...

151
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm not a good wife.

152
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
These years,

153
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
we've brought up the six of us together.

154
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
We've brought up Zhi Le.

155
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
But I didn't

156
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
make a living for the Shen family.

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
By then,

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
the embroidery bureau gave birth to a child.

159
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
The whole yard

160
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
is full of children's laughter and crying.

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
How happy would that be?

162
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Master is happy.

163
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm happy.

164
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
Don't worry. I will

165
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
raise the children with the embroidery bureau.

166
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
In this life,

167
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
how much do you plan to owe me?

168
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
You don't owe me?

169
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Everything I do

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
is voluntary.

171
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Master, don't feel burdened.

172
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
These 20 years,

173
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
you've worked hard for the Shen family.

174
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
But the embroidery bureau isn't you.

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Since she married into the Shen family,

176
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
she's mine.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
So, please don't

178
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
force your marriage with her.

179
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Okay?

180
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Okay.

181
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay.

182
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Third Madam, this is your first

183
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
meeting since you married into the family.

184
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
It's very lively here.

185
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Second Madam, Third Madam.

186
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Embroidery Bureau,

187
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I wanted to apologize to you today.

188
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I was too narrow-minded

190
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
and I've been too rude to you.

191
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Please don't take it to heart.

192
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
What are you

193
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
trying to do?

194
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I'll tell you the truth.

195
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
I saw

196
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Master

197
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
treating you with care every day.

198
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I was so jealous.

199
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
That's why...

200
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
But I know

201
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
if I keep doing this,

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I'll only bring

203
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Master's anger.

204
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm too weak.

205
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Forget it.

206
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Forget it.

207
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Maybe you don't

208
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
believe me.

209
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
I've never thought

210
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
of fighting with you.

211
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
I know

212
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
why

213
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Master

214
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
likes you so much.

215
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Sister,

216
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
after this cup of tea,

217
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
let's forget our past grudges.

218
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
How about it?

219
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
You stupid girl!

220
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
How could you do this?

221
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
It's okay.

222
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
You're so rude.

224
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
You're embarrassing Master.

225
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I've got a new suit

226
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
for you.

227
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Why don't you

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
put it on and show it to Master?

229
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
No need.

230
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
You're still being sarcastic.

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
You're

232
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
still being sarcastic.

233
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Xiao Yue, put on the new suit.

234
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Yes.

235
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Madam, this way, please.

236
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Hurry up.

237
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
The show

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
is about to start.

239
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Isn't it

240
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
in Madam's room?

241
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Why are you taking me this way?

242
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
She's late.

243
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
She's on the back stage.

244
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
It's about to start.

245
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Why is the troupe still not ready?

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Madam, please come with me.

247
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Stop her!

248
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Master.

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Master.

250
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay.

251
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Come, Master.

252
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Sit down.

253
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,520
Okay.

254
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Sit down.

255
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Sit down.

256
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Where's the embroiderer?

257
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
I haven't seen Six.

258
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
He's not used to

259
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
the show.

260
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
He's not used to

261
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
the show.

262
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
He's not used to the show.

263
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
He's not here.

264
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Don't worry.

265
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
The show will be over soon.

266
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
As for Six,

267
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
he must be sleeping at home.

268
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Master,

269
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
the show is about to start.

270
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
We can't keep him waiting.

271
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Let's watch the show first.

272
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Zhou.

273
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
The show is about to start.

274
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
The show is about to start.

275
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Great.

276
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Great.

277
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Master,

278
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
the show is about

279
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
the meeting between

280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Madam Li and Liu Sheng in their dreams.

281
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
They are getting married in Mudan.

282
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
They are so in love.

283
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
They are so loving.

284
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
They are so kind.

285
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
What's going on?

286
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
What's going on?

287
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
The clothes look like

288
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
the embroidery bureau.

289
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Zhou,

290
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
let's go.

291
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Sorry,

292
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I'm sorry for your loss.

293
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I think we should...

294
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
That woman,

295
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
she looks like

296
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Madam Fan.

297
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,520
And that man,

298
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
he looks like Six.

299
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
How could this happen?

300
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Madam Shen and Six are in a private relationship.

301
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
They are sister-in-laws.

302
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Master Shen is going to lose face.

303
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Yes.

304
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Master.

305
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Master,

306
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
this is the maid of Madam's second son and maid.

307
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
How did they get married?

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Who knows?

309
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
It's hard for them.

310
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
It's so strange.

311
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
They are so in love.

312
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
They are in love.

313
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
They are in love.

314
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
What's going on?

315
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Master Six,

316
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Madam San.

317
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Six,

318
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
why are you so late?

319
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
What's going on?

320
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Madam San, this way please.

321
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Move faster.

322
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
You follow her.

323
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Madam San.

324
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Six, wake up.

325
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Madam San.

326
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
How dare you, Six.

327
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Let's go.

328
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
We need to get rid of them as soon as possible.

329
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
If we don't get rid of them,

330
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
we can't get rid of them.

331
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
What do you want to do?

332
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
I want to use the way of the cheater

333
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
to get rid of the cheater.

334
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Liu Ru Yan,

335
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I warned you

336
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
not to do anything behind my back.

337
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
But you used such a vicious trick again.

338
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I think you

339
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
don't want to stay in the Shen family.

340
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I didn't.

341
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Why did you accuse me?

342
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
It must be you two

343
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
who stole the letter

344
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
and put it on the table.

345
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You are so embarrassing.

346
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Madam San, I didn't.

347
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
If you don't tell the truth,

348
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
your family will be implicated.

349
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
You are loyal to the right person.

350
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
You can be pushed out of the house

351
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
as a scapegoat.

352
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Is it worth it?

353
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I understand your concern.

354
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
But today, Madam and Master are here.

355
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
No one dares to take you.

356
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Yes, you should tell the truth.

357
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Master and I will definitely

358
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
help you.

359
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm a little impatient.

360
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
What's going on?

361
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
It's...

362
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Madam San who instructed us.

363
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
I didn't.

364
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
She said, why did Madam San

365
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
such a lowly maid

366
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
get Master's favor?

367
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,520
If she was exposed,

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Master would divorce her.

369
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Then,

370
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
she could be alone.

371
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Master, I didn't.

372
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
How could I say that?

373
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
How dare you!

374
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
You are so evil.

375
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
You should be ashamed of yourself.

376
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
You have ruined the reputation of the Shen family.

377
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Don't be angry.

378
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Yes.

379
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Why are you so muddled?

380
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
You know that Master cares about the reputation.

381
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
How could you frame them

382
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
with such a thing?

383
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
The new bride smiles.

384
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
The old bride cries.

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Since Madam San was born,

386
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Master has never smiled at me.

387
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I hate her.

388
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I hate her.

389
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Why?

390
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
She could take away Master's love for me.

391
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Besides,

392
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I didn't wrong them.

393
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Shen Yanzhou,

394
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
don't think you can hide your evil intentions for long.

395
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Do you dare to

396
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
speak out against her

397
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
in front of the ancestors

398
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
and say you have no feelings

399
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
for her?

400
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Liu Ruyan!

401
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
My ancestors

402
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
and I swear

403
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
that if I have

404
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
any evil intentions for you,

405
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I will die.

406
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
You did it for her.

407
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Enough!

408
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Get out of here!

409
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Get out of here!

410
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
You are not allowed to enter the old house!

411
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I got it.

412
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,520
From now on,

413
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,520
you will be my wife.

414
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
The one I love

415
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
is my Xiu Ju.

416
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Madam San.

417
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Madam San.

418
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
What's wrong?

419
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
This tangerine is sour.

420
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Madam San.

421
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
This tangerine is sour.

422
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Madam San.

423
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
This tangerine is sour.

424
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Madam San.

425
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
This is

426
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
sweet.

427
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Maybe.

428
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Mother, I miss you.

429
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Although the past days were bitter,

430
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
the heart is sweet.

431
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Master.

432
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Sit.

433
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I don't know how to

434
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
write those words of Madam San.

435
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Don't take it to heart.

436
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Master, it's not a good thing.

437
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
I have nothing to feel sorry for.

438
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I think you have been wearing this jade pendant.

439
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Did your family give it to you?

440
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
My mother gave it to me.

441
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I have been wearing it since I was a child.

442
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
I have a memory of it.

443
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Master.

444
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Zhou, what are you looking for?

445
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Go and buy it. Money is not a problem.

446
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
What's important is to make it look good.

447
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Yes, Master.

448
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Master.

449
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
Madam San.

450
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
Okay.

451
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Master, this is...

452
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Then go back.

453
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Didn't you miss your mother?

454
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
How do you know?

455
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
If you have any worries,

456
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
just tell me.

457
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I am happy to know what you are thinking.

458
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Don't let me guess.

459
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Thank you, Master.

460
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
But there is no need to be so formal.

461
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
It's necessary.

462
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
You are my wife.

463
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
It's my honor.

464
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Okay.

465
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Go back and pack up.

466
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I will take you back with me.

467
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
It seems that I was right.

468
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Master is much better

469
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
than before.

470
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
But in this family,

471
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
the wife is the most miserable.

472
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I can't treat you like this.

473
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Okay, don't say that.

474
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
You are blaming me.

475
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Isn't it

476
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
the same as blaming me for all these years?

477
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
You have to understand.

478
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
I can't give you

479
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
what the embroidery bureau can give.

480
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
So I don't want to.

481
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
The End

482
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,520
The tears and sorrows that are hard to forget

483
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,520
are like a firefly

484
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
If we meet,

485
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
we can overcome tomorrow night

486
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
The rain and the clouds are so bright

487
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,520
The tears are so bright

488
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
The warmth of the red

489
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,520
is like the eyes of a butterfly

490
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Who will be the next

491
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Who will be the next

492
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,520
The lovers are like smoke

493
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
A bouquet of flowers

494
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
seems to be broken

495
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
for a thousand and ten thousand years

496
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
The whole life

497
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
is like a long wish

498
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
The love is not always short

499
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
But one person's life

500
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
is a perfect one

501
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
for a hundred years

502
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
The rain and the clouds are so bright

503
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,520
The tears are so bright

504
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
The warmth of the red

505
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
is like the eyes of a butterfly

506
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Who will be the next

507
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Who will be the next

508
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
The lovers are like smoke

509
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
A bouquet of flowers

510
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
seems to be broken

511
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for a thousand and ten thousand years

512
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
The whole life

513
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
is like a long wish

514
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
The love is not always short

515
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
But one person's life

516
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
is a perfect one

517
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
for a hundred years

518
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
The whole life

519
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
is a perfect one

520
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
The world is like

521
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
the old days

522
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
The old days

523
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
A bouquet of flowers

524
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
seems to be broken

525
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
for a thousand and ten thousand years

526
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
The whole life

527
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
is like a long wish

528
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
The love is not always short

529
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
But one person's life

530
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
is a perfect one

531
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
for a thousand and ten thousand years

532
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
The whole life

533
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
is like a long wish

534
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
The whole life

535
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
is like a long wish

536
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
The whole life

537
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
is like a long wish

538
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
The whole life

539
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
is like a long wish

540
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
The whole life

541
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
is like a long wish

542
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
The whole life

543
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
is like a long wish

544
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
The whole life

545
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
is like a long wish

546
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
The littlest Department Store

547
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
is like the entire seaside

548
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Even the pieces fall

549
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,520
One piece out of each other

550
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
is like the future

551
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
I was born under this

552
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I am変 compendium

553
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
but the categories make me think

554
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
This year, we met

555
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
this vez per cent
