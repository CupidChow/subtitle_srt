You have to give him the right medicine.

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,040
Juicy orange juice.

4
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,920
What do you know?

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,200
Juicy orange juice.

6
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,920
Look.

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,440
Six copies.

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
It's cheap.

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,200
Give me one.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Excuse me.

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
How much is the juice?

12
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,920
Six copies.

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,680
Why are you here?

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm here to show you a trick.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
sesame oil

16
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,400
First,

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
let Xiaozuo put the products

18
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
on.

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
I have an idea.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Be called first stems.

21
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
The label

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
alone in a corner of the Akie.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Besides,

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,160
the name of the brand

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,880
must be the most popular in

26
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,560
fate in an entire street.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't run.

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,540
Really, it's really cute.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's free! It's free!

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The first round is open for the big players.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Everyone has a chance to get a free bottle of fruit jam.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Come and see. It's free.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Really? Really?

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's free!

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How is it free?

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come and play a game with me.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The big ones can get a free bottle of fruit jam.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You take it.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm taking it?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's free.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you, thank you.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you, boss.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Boss, let me do it.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't worry, everyone.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You go first.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You go first.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Who's next?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll do it.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's a lot of money.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is it worth it?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is three big dollars.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's the first coin in my life.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thanks to you, I have so many ways to do business.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You helped me sell flowers.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll help you sell flowers tomorrow.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Aren't you going to school?

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm taking a vacation tomorrow.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you want, I can help you sell flowers for the rest of your life.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm home.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't want to meet you in secret.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you love me, come to propose to me tomorrow.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I only love you in my life.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Shen Zhi Le.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, no.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My uncle is coming to help me sell flowers again.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Shen Zhi Le, stop.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Shen Zhi Le.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You've been walking around the city all day.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You know that you're addicted to these love stories.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're talking nonsense.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come here.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, no, no.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll do whatever I want.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Uncle, open your eyes and look at it.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a new era.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're talking nonsense.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Help me pick it up.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll go to you later.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Master.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I happen to be looking for you.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's up?

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Master.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is the bonus for you.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to make a lot of them.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You've been working on them for days.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you've sold them all?

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thanks to you,

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can make so many orange juice.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I sold three of them.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I divided them into three.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is for you.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're the first one who's been scheming my business.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Actually,

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I want to talk to you about a business.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I've been secretly counting the accounts.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The ugly oranges that I lost every day

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
can be made into a hundred and fifteen orange juice.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The cost of the manpower

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is five dollars.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't want to take advantage of you.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So you can sell those ugly oranges to me at a discount.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I remember you're good at counting.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can work with me.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Since we're working together,

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
how can I not be sincere?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The pink and the orange that are not of good quality

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
are not my favorite.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't want to sell them to you.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't want to sell them to you.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The pink and the orange that are not of good quality

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
are my money.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you, sir.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I won't let you down.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
By the way,

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the other pink...

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Who did you give it to?

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I've looked everywhere.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's nothing here.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to find it even if there's nothing.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Where did she hide the money?

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You...

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ye... Ye Ge.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why did you come here in person?

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Shengnan.

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ye Ge.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's been ten days.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Tell me.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You should pay me back.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ye Ge.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
My sister's school has money.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When she comes back,

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll pay you back.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Ye Ge.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Stop hitting me.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ye Ge, I'll pay you back.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stop talking nonsense.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Pay me back.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mom, please let me go.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you doing?

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're that rich girl?

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's none of your business.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Stop it.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Your brother

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
owes me 20 yuan in cash.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you don't pay me back,

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
he won't live.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't escape.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll pay you back.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't move.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ye Ge.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Ye Ge.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ye Ge.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't move.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Put the gun down.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or I'll shoot him.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Interesting.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's interesting.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're the first woman

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
who dares to point a gun at me.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's interesting to be the first.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hurry up.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Raise your hands.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Get out.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Back off.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hurry up.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You dare to point a gun at me?

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're brave.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let me go.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If no one teaches you,

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll teach you.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You'll die if you play tricks with Ye Ge.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not sure who will be in whose hands.

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop.

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let her go.

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Miss, you're back.

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ye Ge, she wants money.

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She wants money.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let her go.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll take you to get the money.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Miss.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you think it's your first day

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to be out here?

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You've been taking me back to the East.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't run.

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ye Ge, it's the Sixth Master of the Shen Family.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are you here?

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Are you okay?

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm glad you're okay.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I tell you,

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you can't even afford to eat.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're so stingy.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We're all rough.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're not loyal.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I advise you,

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
don't mind the idle things.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Heroes are beautiful.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not what a young master like you should do.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's none of your business.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't mind me.

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Go.

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What do you mean?

215
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll take care of it.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Xing Zhi.

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Go.

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Stop.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't move.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hurry.

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Stop.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't be afraid.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Did they leave?

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know.

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's wait for a while.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Come.

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're playing tricks on me.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I...

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Are you okay?

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm fine.

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I have a surprise for you.

232
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't peek.

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm fine.

234
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Be careful.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Where are you taking me?

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Haven't you arrived yet?

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're playing tricks on me again.

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't move.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm fine.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
A chrysanthemum?

242
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You said

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you were afraid of the danger.

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can't open it.

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm willing to try all the impossible for you.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
My dear,

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
the rich are in need of a rich family.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's not something that we poor people can do.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't have much time.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just want you to be with a good person.

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Liu Yan.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You don't have to come anymore.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't need you to help me sell the goods.

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I thought you would understand what I mean.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Xiu Xue, I want to...

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Liu Yan.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We are separated by thousands of people.

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We are not the same people.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Just like the famous pomegranate candy,

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can never say a word.

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Liu Yan

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The past me

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
was a twilight.

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I thought the world was like this.

265
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Until I met you,

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you made me understand

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that I had to accept my mistakes.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I admit my mistake.

269
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I won't owe you anything.

270
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't owe you anything.

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You made me understand

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that every heart that is behind money

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
made me understand

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that God can't let us down.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
From that moment on,

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I knew that

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you were the fate that God gave me.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In my heart,

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
you are like this sentence.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Pure and unwavering.

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You are strong,

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
bright and beautiful.

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Xiu Xue,

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
are you willing

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to be with me

286
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and take care of this song?

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The snow that fell between us

288
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I used my memory to understand

289
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
how tears were left in the snow

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If I find an excuse

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and you haven't turned around

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm right behind you

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll tell you a secret.

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This jade pendant was given to me by my mother.

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But she never told me

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
where it came from.

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There should be another half of this jade pendant.

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll definitely find a way to find it for you.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In this way,

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you can be like my sister

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and be a couple.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Some things

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
can't be done in one go.

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It also depends on the fate of God.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Fate is in this beautiful night.

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I want to invite a beautiful girl

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to dance with me.

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm going to dance with you.

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm going to dance with you.

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm going to dance with you.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm going to dance with you.

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm going to dance with you.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to dance with you.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm going to dance with you.

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm going to dance with you.

316
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm going to dance with you.

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm going to dance with you.

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going to dance with you.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm going to dance with you.

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm going to dance with you.

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm going to dance with you.

322
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm going to dance with you.

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm going to dance with you.

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm going to dance with you.

325
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm going to dance with you.

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm going to dance with you.

327
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm going to dance with you.

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm going to dance with you.

329
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm going to dance with you.

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm going to dance with you.

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm going to dance with you.

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm going to dance with you.

333
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm going to dance with you.

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm going to dance with you.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going to dance with you.

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm going to dance with you.

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm going to dance with you.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm going to dance with you.

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm going to dance with you.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm going to dance with you.

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm going to dance with you.

342
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to dance with you.

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Take care.

344
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,680
Steady.

345
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,760
Help me, please.

346
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,480
Hurry up.

347
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
Just two of us.

348
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,320
Steady.

349
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,000
Go find someone.

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,680
Leave it to me.

351
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,400
No.

352
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,160
You're alone.

353
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
Are you crazy?

354
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,320
It's raining heavily.

355
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,240
If anything happens to you,

356
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
how am I going to take care of it?

357
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,560
Don't worry.

358
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,240
Leave it to me.

359
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,200
Be careful.

360
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,940
Be careful.

361
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Be careful.

362
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,680
Don't force yourself.

363
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,600
implement it.

364
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,040
Trust me and be cool.

365
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,160
A man should have faith.

366
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm the only one

367
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,240
father commands.

368
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,400
That's why I'mんで゚ כי

369
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,200
AL WA coughing.

370
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,920
It might pout Bag denen.

371
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,400
Can't you see there's a lot of Priestess out there?

372
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,680
Just depend on your lover.

373
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Master, are you really going to move to the city this time?

374
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
The business in the city is getting busier.

375
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm afraid there will be fewer opportunities to come back.

376
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
But...

377
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Master!

378
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Something bad happened!

379
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Today, the whole of the Palace of the Apes was raided in the middle of the night.

380
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Now, only the Embroidered Bureau is there.

381
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
We have to hurry and send someone over.

382
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Otherwise, the Emperor will die!

383
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Call everyone over.

384
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
Come with me.

385
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Master.

386
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Madam, this...

387
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Embroidered Bureau...

388
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Hurry!

389
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Hurry!

390
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Go!

391
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Go!

392
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Master, I promised I would protect the Emperor.

393
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
The Emperor is fine.

394
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Don't worry.

395
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
If the Emperor dies, there will be another death.

396
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
But there is only one life!

397
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Hurry!

398
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
Xiao Qu.

399
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Master.

400
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Xiao Qu!

401
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Xiao Qu, wake up!

402
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Lao Zhou!

403
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Master!

404
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Go and save the doctor!

405
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Yes!

406
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Xiao Qu!

407
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Xiao Qu!

408
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Xiao Qu!

409
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Xiao...

410
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
You are really a lucky woman.

411
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Master never cares about anyone like this.

412
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Madam, you mean Master...

413
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I know him very well.

414
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Sometimes, men can't open their mouths.

415
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
As a woman, you have to learn to guess his feelings.

416
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,680
For so many years, Madam has been busy with the family.

417
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
I have to help her.

418
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,680
For so many years, Madam has been busy with the family.

419
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
But Master has neglected you.

420
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Sometimes, I feel sorry for you.

421
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
Liu Ruyan is just a dancer.

422
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,680
She became the Second Madam because of Master.

423
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
You should think about yourself.

424
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Yes.

425
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
I want to marry a woman who is sincere.

426
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I want to marry a woman who is sincere.

427
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
I want to marry a woman who is sincere.

428
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Only then can Master's heart be restored.

429
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Mother.

430
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Mother, I sold a lot of fruit and jam again today.

431
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
I will make enough money soon.

432
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Mother.

433
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Mother.

434
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Mother.

435
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
Mother.

436
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Mother.

437
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Mother.

438
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
I will go to the doctor.

439
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
I will go to the doctor.

440
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
What are you doing?

441
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Let go of me.

442
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Bastard.

443
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Bastard.

444
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Master.

445
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Master.

446
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
The price of this batch of oranges is settled.

447
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
I will ask someone to send the deposit to your house.

448
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Then I will be greedy.

449
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Please keep it.

450
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
This is a new style of building.

451
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
It's starting to make these foreign things.

452
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
This is a different era.

453
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
This foreign thing is interesting.

454
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,680
I heard that the foreign machines can handle seven or eight workers.

455
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Machines can do things.

456
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
People can do it too.

457
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
The opposite is not acceptable.

458
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Now everywhere is bloodshed.

459
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
It seems that foreigners are suppressing the countrymen everywhere.

460
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
The things passed down from the ancestors for thousands of years.

461
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
It's all a disaster.

462
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
But think about it.

463
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
If all of these are lost.

464
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Then the people will only have an empty shell.

465
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:38,820
I want to go to the

466
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
This is the blue building.

467
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Brother and sister-in-law sold me.

468
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Look at what kind of wind blew Shen Yan to the ground today.

469
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
It's just that today came a chef.

470
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
If Shen Yan is interested.

471
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Boss Wen still makes the western culture not completely civilized.

472
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Next time, let's not make an appointment in this kind of place.

473
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
OK, Shen Ye.

474
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Next time, let's make an appointment in another place.

475
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,680
OK, then I will go to the west.

476
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I will go to the west.

477
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I will go to the west.

478
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
I will go to the west.

479
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I will go to the west.

480
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,680
OK, then I will leave.

481
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
OK, take care.

482
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Master, take care.

483
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Don't come over.

484
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I was sold in.

485
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
I'm not a girl here.

486
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
How did you come in?

487
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
It's none of my business.

488
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I spent a lot of money for you.

489
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
It's not worth it.
