1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
oh

4
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Oh

5
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Oh

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Ah!

7
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Master!

8
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,800
Don't be afraid.

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm here.

10
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,720
It's okay.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,120
You've done a lot today.

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,760
How dare you to bully me?

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,000
You've made it to the end.

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,760
Go find the butler.

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,360
Master.

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,520
Go!

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,840
Stop!

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,840
Don't run!

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,800
The bandits are coming!

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,720
Let them go!

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,040
Shut up!

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,600
Why are you shouting?

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
What are you doing?

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,880
Go check on the butler.

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,480
Yes.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
Arrest her.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,840
Stop!

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,760
Let go!

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
The soldiers are coming.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,440
You can't escape if you don't leave.

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll drag you to die with me.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,080
Are you okay?

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm fine.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,440
How dare you to act on my territory?

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
Are you tired of living?

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
Yanzhou, why are you here?

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,960
I went to your house.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Your mother told me

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,560
that you were kidnapped.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
I've been looking for you.

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,480
Find a chance to leave.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,120
No.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,360
Master is still inside.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,040
Jin Ye.

45
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,680
Brother.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,000
Black Wind is in a gang.

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,480
The water is not river water.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,880
It's just a girl.

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,560
How can you do this?

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Stay away.

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,320
Then don't you meet with anyone

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,640
to find her who she is?

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,400
Master.

54
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm afraid if anything about

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,440
tuberose Flow,

56
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,840
kindness be famished.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,640
What's happenning?

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,480
Master.

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,640
Heâ€¦

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,960
Troublesome!

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,760
Master.

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,560
I'm Shen Yanzhou, the sixth son of the Shen Family.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
My eldest brother is in there.

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
The Shen Family always has a revenge to pay for.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
We will always repay you.

66
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
If there's anything you need in the future,

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm sure you can give it to me.

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Thank you for your help, Lord Jin.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Thank you for your help.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
You're a righteous man.

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
It's what you should do.

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Liu, you should go back now.

73
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,560
He's not suitable to stay here.

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I'll talk to Jin Yan.

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Let's go.

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Today's matter

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
is only about the reputation of a girl's family.

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
I don't want to hear any word from you.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I mean what Boss Shen said.

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Thank you, Jin Yan.

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Madam,

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
the matter you asked for has been done.

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
This is the delivery fee.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
His brother and sister-in-law

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
sold him so easily.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
They are both

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
shameless.

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
They only care about money.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Since we can sell him once,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
we can sell him again.

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I think we should hurry up

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
to do this.

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
We don't want to waste time.

94
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Yes.

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
You guys go.

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Okay.

97
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm counting on you, Xiu Ju.

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Madam!

99
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Madam!

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
What's wrong?

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
You can't give Xiu Ju to my brother.

102
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Because I like him.

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
He's mine.

104
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
It seems that you've heard the news

105
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
and you know you're going to have a blind date.

106
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
I know

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
you've always been a free-lover.

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
You're very resistant to this.

109
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Every time,

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
you say that you have a girlfriend.

111
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Or you've already lost your love.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
You can't forget your old love.

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Madam,

114
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I won't fall for your trick again.

115
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I mean it.

116
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
It's true.

117
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
Every time you don't tell me it's true.

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm serious.

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Sometimes,

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
even if it's true,

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
you have to be a fake.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Xiu Ju!

123
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Madam, what's wrong?

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Go to the grass.

125
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm so angry.

126
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
They're going to sell me.

127
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I don't think this is the end of us.

128
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
As long as I don't confess,

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I can say something to you.

130
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Let's go find my brother.

131
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
As long as he agrees,

132
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
everything will be solved.

133
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Brother,

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
you can't marry Xiu Ju.

135
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Because...

136
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Because I love her.

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
We were like a school.

138
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
We loved each other under the flower wall.

139
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
She changed me.

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I have a new understanding of life.

141
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Brother,

142
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Xiu Ju has already become one with my life.

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
I want to have her future.

144
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Please help us.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Please help us.

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Shilu.

147
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Uncle is on a business trip.

148
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
He's not home.

149
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Sister-in-law is preparing for the wedding.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
We have to find my brother.

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
How many immortals have been here in the past?

152
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Because of the lockdown of the feudal house,

153
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
they have been in the middle of life.

154
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
It's said in the play of Shakespeare.

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't live without love.

156
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Your love doesn't need to be broken.

157
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
You can't live without love.

158
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Your love doesn't need to be fulfilled by others.

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
As long as you love each other,

160
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
it's heaven everywhere.

161
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Will you go with me?

162
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Leave here.

163
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
Go to our own garden.

164
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
I will.

165
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,560
When we find a place to settle down,

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I'll take my mother there.

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Mother.

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Mother.

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Daughter.

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,560
Leave here.

171
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Don't worry about me.

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Mother.

173
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I'll go find the doctor.

174
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Mother.

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Mother.

176
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
How is my mother?

177
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Her pulse is weak.

178
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Like the waste water in the house.

179
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
No root.

180
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm afraid it's not long.

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Doctor.

182
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,560
My mother is my only family in this world.

183
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Please.

184
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Please save my mother.

185
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Please.

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Please.

187
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Get up.

188
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
With my medical skills,

189
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I can save your mother.

190
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Now,

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
there's only one person who can save your mother.

192
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Madam.

193
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Doctor has said what he should say.

194
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
He said it.

195
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Come.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
It's so late.

197
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm afraid he won't come.

198
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
He won't.

199
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
He will come.

200
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Madam.

201
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
My mother is ill.

202
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
I heard your mother's family name is Lin.

203
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
There's a secret recipe for treatment.

204
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
If you give me the recipe,

205
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I'll be yours forever.

206
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm willing to be a slave and a servant.

207
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
I'm here to repay your kindness.

208
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Please help me.

209
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Help me.

210
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Help me.

211
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Go.

212
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Please.

213
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Come.

214
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Get up.

215
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
Sit.

216
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
You're a singer.

217
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
You're unreliable.

218
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Even if you get the recipe,

219
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
you can't save your mother forever.

220
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,560
But if you ask the Shen family to be your backer,

221
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
things will be different.

222
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
What do you mean?

223
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Sixth Brother

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
has never seen the outside world.

225
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
One day, he will fly away.

226
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
You can't keep him.

227
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
But Master is different.

228
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
He likes you and is mature and steady.

229
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
At this time,

230
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
I'm afraid only Master and I can save you.

231
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Rather than pursuing those fleeting futures,

232
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
it's better to seize the opportunity now

233
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
and change your fate.

234
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
You're a smart girl.

235
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,560
You should understand what I want.

236
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
You want me to marry Master

237
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
because I'm afraid of losing you.

238
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
It's impossible.

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Why?

240
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,560
How many girls can't ask for a man like Master?

241
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
As long as I have this condition,

242
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
I can promise you anything else.

243
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
But I only have this condition.

244
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,560
You can decide whether you want it or not.

245
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
No.

246
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
I can't do it.

247
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Do you know that

248
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Master didn't go on a business trip?

249
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
He hid it because he was afraid you would feel guilty.

250
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
He killed everyone.

251
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Go.

252
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Are you awake?

253
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Are you awake?

254
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Please spare me.

255
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
In order to save you,

256
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
Master was hit on the head.

257
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,560
He is still unconscious and his life is in danger.

258
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,560
He can do this for the embroidery bureau.

259
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
I've tried all the methods.

260
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Even if it's a surprise,

261
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
I want to try this kind of trick.

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Xiuqu,

263
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
can't you even stand the love between your loved ones

264
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,560
and your benefactors?

265
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Xiuqu.

266
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Shile.

267
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Uncle Liu,

268
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Xiuqu,

269
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
he won't come.

270
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Did he get his wife's heart broken

271
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
or his mother's illness?

272
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
He has decided to marry Uncle.

273
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I don't agree.

274
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
She is my woman.

275
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
What did you say?

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
In the darkness, the sky and earth are shaking.

277
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
The sky and earth are shaking.

278
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
It's about to rain.

279
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
The world is being controlled by you.

280
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I can't feel the pain anymore.

281
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Xue Yanzhao, wake up!

282
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Xiuqu, come with me.

283
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
When I promised to marry you,

284
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
it will never happen again!

285
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
The heart is broken.

286
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Come and help me.

287
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Okay.

288
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Come on, put the things there.

289
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Okay.

290
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I'll take this.

291
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Where is Xiuqu?

292
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
She is in the room next door.

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Put this away.

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Okay.

295
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Liu, you are here.

296
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Your brother hasn't come back from his business trip.

297
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
There is a wedding in the house.

298
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
You have to replace your brother

299
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
and take Xiuqu to the door.

300
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
What?

301
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
This is ridiculous, sister-in-law.

302
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
This wedding can't be held.

303
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
The wedding invitation has been issued.

304
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
The guests have come.

305
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
Now you say you won't hold the wedding.

306
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
How can we face the Shen family?

307
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Don't be childish.

308
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
I'm not a child anymore, sister-in-law.

309
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
No one is important to me.

310
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
You can't force Xiuqu like this.

311
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
No one is forcing Xiuqu.

312
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
She is willing to do it.

313
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Don't you know her personality?

314
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Sister-in-law, listen to me.

315
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Xiuqu and I...

316
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Listen to me.

317
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
We don't have time, Liu.

318
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Sister-in-law, don't force me.

319
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,560
It seems that I have to kneel down and beg you.

320
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Sister-in-law.

321
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Xiuqu said she was tired from the fight.

322
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
She didn't want to run away forever.

323
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,320
She is a

324
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
You can't wait for her anymore.

325
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Liu, don't blame me.

326
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
Sister-in-law had no choice.

327
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
The new couple has arrived.

328
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
The new couple has arrived.

329
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
The new couple has arrived.

330
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
They are so happy.

331
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Let me show you what is called the Tangbo Valley of Jiangcheng.

332
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
The new couple has arrived.

333
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
They are safe.

334
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
The new couple has arrived.

335
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
They are safe.

336
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Let's go.

337
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Let's go.

338
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Don't come every day.

339
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Be careful.

340
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
The new couple has arrived.

341
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
The new couple has arrived.

342
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
The new couple has arrived.

343
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
You said you were afraid of the danger.

344
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I can't say a word.

345
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
I don't want to be afraid of you.

346
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
I am willing to try all the impossible.

347
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
First bow to the heaven and earth.

348
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
The heaven and earth bow to each other.

349
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
The two sides bow to each other.

350
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
The two bows to the high pagoda.

351
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
The couple sings and the couple follows.

352
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
The new couple has arrived.

353
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
The new couple has arrived.

354
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
The new couple has arrived.

355
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
The two bows to each other.

356
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
The heaven and earth bow to each other.

357
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
The new couple has arrived.

358
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
The new couple has arrived.

359
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
This is the most popular dance in the Western World.

360
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
When you learn it,

361
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
I will take you to the biggest dance hall.

362
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
When you get there,

363
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
you will wear the pair of crystal shoes I gave you.

364
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,560
I will make you the most attractive dancer in the whole city.

365
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Sometimes you can still look at the big window

366
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
and the angle of the friend.

367
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
From the beginning, I cried for happiness.

368
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Then I smiled to end it.

369
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
The tears I shed

370
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
The end.

371
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
I learned to tell.

372
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Time is long and beautiful.

373
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
It's cruel to stay.

374
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Love is not a constant temperature.

375
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
From the beginning, I cried for happiness.

376
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Then I smiled to end it.

377
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
The tears I shed

378
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
The end.

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I learned to tell.

380
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Sometimes I can still look at the big window

381
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,560
Master, I know you don't like others to guess your thoughts.

382
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,560
And you don't like women to make decisions.

383
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
But I did this

384
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
for you and the Shen family.

385
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I am willing to be a bad person this time.

386
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Master, please wake up.

387
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Master, you are awake.

388
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Come.

389
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
What's going on outside?

390
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Come, let me help you up.

391
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Slowly.

392
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
You are smiling so well.

393
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
You are awake.

394
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
You are awake.

395
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
You are awake.

396
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Congratulations.

397
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Congratulations.

398
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Congratulations.

399
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Congratulations.

400
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Congratulations, my big brother.

401
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Okay.

402
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Master.

403
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
I told you, congratulations, my big brother.

404
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Congratulations.

405
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Congratulations.

406
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Xiao Jun,

407
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
is he willing

408
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
or do you want to

409
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
make things difficult for him?

410
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
You think too much.

411
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
You should know that

412
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
in this world,

413
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
there is no woman who is not willing to marry master.

414
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
What I am doing now

415
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,560
is just to share the burden of the master.

416
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,560
I want to continue the fire of the Shen family.

417
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Even so,

418
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I still feel that it is not right.

419
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I should ask him personally.

420
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Master,

421
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,560
since the situation has become like this,

422
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
why don't you just do it?

423
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Don't you really like Xiao Jun?

424
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Third Madam,

425
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Master is awake.

426
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Please wait for a moment.

427
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Why are you here?

428
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Master will be back soon.

429
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Xiao Jun,

430
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
why are you so impatient

431
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
to fight with him?

432
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,560
Sixth Master,

433
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
please don't go.

434
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
I will go.

435
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
I am sorry.

436
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Please go.

437
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
I am sorry.

438
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Please go.

439
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
I am sorry.

440
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
Please go.

441
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Please go.

442
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
I am sorry.

443
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Sixth Master,

444
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I am sorry.

445
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Please go out.

446
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Xiao Jun,

447
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
why?

448
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Didn't you agree to leave with me?

449
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
You agreed to die with me.

450
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I was just impulsive to you.

451
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
After the passion is gone,

452
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
I will understand what I want.

453
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Xiao Jun,

454
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
do you have any difficulties?

455
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Tell me.

456
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
I can help you solve everything.

457
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Sixth Master,

458
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
you should wake up.

459
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
If the situation is like this,

460
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
it will be meaningless.

461
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
It was me who met you first.

462
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Why did you marry my brother?

463
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
What did I do wrong?

464
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
When did you start to love me?

465
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I don't know.

466
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Xiao Jun,

467
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
can't you live up to your love

468
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,560
with your benefactor?

469
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Master,

470
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
you are mature and steady.

471
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
You are kind and kind.

472
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
You are the family of the Shen Family.

473
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Which girl in Jiangcheng doesn't want to marry him?

474
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Sixth Master,

475
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
since I have a better choice,

476
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
why should I waste my youth

477
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
waiting for you to mature?

478
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
I don't believe it.

479
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I don't believe you are such a woman

480
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
who loves but doesn't show off.

481
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I don't believe it.

482
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Let me go.

483
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Let me go.

484
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Let me go.

485
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
I don't believe it.

486
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Let me go.

487
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
The marriage is not accepted yet.

488
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
Don't try to get rid of me.

489
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Don't try to get rid of me.

490
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Let me go.

491
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Chen Yanzhou,

492
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
you are crazy.

493
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I am crazy.

494
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
From the moment I fell in love,

495
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
I have been crazy.

496
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Let me tell you,

497
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560

I will get rid of you.

507
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
From today on,

508
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
you will always be mine.

509
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
