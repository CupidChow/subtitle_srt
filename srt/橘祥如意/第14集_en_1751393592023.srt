1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,880
Gr objective

2
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,440
and

3
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,440
on

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,120
Master Six, we found out.

6
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
Go call someone to watch the show.

7
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Second Madam is here.

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

9
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm going to sleep.

10
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
I told them to come to you.

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Master Six,

12
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
you just came back

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,920
and made everyone feel uneasy.

14
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,720
Brother,

15
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
I heard that the palace was on fire a while ago.

16
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
People were almost killed.

17
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Do you remember that?

18
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
Master Six, what do you mean?

19
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
The real culprit behind this fire

20
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,440
is your Second Madam, Liu Ruyan.

21
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,640
I've already found the maid who witnessed everything.

22
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,960
She said that she saw Liu Ruyan's torch

23
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,200
going to the garden at night.

24
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,960
She didn't know what happened after that.

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,040
I don't need to say more

26
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,080
since I know what happened.

27
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,760
Liu Ruyan, what's going on?

28
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,920
Master Six framed me.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Even if I went to the garden,

30
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
I would be the culprit?

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,200
So,

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
you did go to the garden that day?

33
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
You usually go to the garden to collect the ashes.

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,920
Why are you so stubborn?

35
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,840
You went there that day and even set the fire.

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,320
You almost killed Master Six.

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
I only have one thing to say.

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,520
I went to the garden that day

39
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,560
for a good news.

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,760
A big news that can make everyone

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,240
happy.

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,560
Liu Ruyan,

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
what good news is it?

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
Tell me.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
There's an old custom in the countryside

46
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,520
where the bell rings.

47
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,000
That day,

48
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I went there to pray to the God of War

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,280
and to bless my child.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,680
What did you say?

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
Your child?

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes.

53
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
Congratulations, Master Shen.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
Mrs. Shen is pregnant.

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,880
But the pregnancy hasn't been confirmed yet.

56
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Pregnant?

57
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,280
Yes.

58
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,920
I...

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm pregnant.

60
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,240
Good.

61
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Good.

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,720
Zhou,

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,120
you have the reward.

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,880
Yes, Master.

65
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,840
Thank you, Master Shen.

66
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
This way, please.

67
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,400
I'll leave you two alone.

68
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Take care.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
Thank you.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
It's my pleasure.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
Congratulations, Master.

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
You got the first child

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
in your life in the year of the tiger.

74
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,120
And you, Mrs. Shen.

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Thank you, Master Shen.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,360
You're the luckiest

77
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
among the three of us.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
It's impossible

79
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,560
to killApplause

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
just because

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,680
his wife's enrollment event failed.

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,640
I've turned to the police

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
to investigateily.

84
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
Whoever it is,

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
All right.

86
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You can rest in peace.

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Master,

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
the baby is having a hard time recently.

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
You don't stay with him.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
You're talking too much.

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
How long have you been pregnant?

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
You can't be noisy.

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
A baby is afraid of a monkey.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
But...

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
The baby is so angry.

96
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Is he afraid?

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Without your blessing,

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
how can I raise the baby?

99
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Master, Mrs. Cheng,

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
you can rest.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
We're leaving.

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
All right.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Let's go.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you want to touch the baby?

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I've been waiting for 20 years.

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I've been waiting for you

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
to come back to this house

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
every day and night.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I've been waiting for you

110
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
to come back every day and night.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
But I got to this point.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Why didn't you come back?

113
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Why?

114
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm the one who disappointed you.

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You scolded me.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I didn't know you were pregnant.

117
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
You scolded me.

118
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
What's the use of scolding you?

119
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It's all fate.

120
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
It's all fate.

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I remember that year,

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
I followed my father

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
to the Shans' house

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
to visit the Shi family.

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,600
When the light was out,

126
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I met Master.

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I've never seen a man like that.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
He was so righteous

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
and unyielding.

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Master.

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I fell in love

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
with him at first sight.

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
When the Shen family

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
and the Han family fought,

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
the Shen family suffered a great disaster.

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
In order to preserve the Shen family's business,

137
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Master had to marry me.

138
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I didn't even have the chance to

139
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,600
say that if the Shen family married me,

140
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
it would be a good thing.

141
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
But at that time,

142
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I was in love with Master.

143
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
How could I...

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I have no child.

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
You have no child either.

146
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Is this really the God

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
punishing me?

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Now,

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Liu Ruyan has Master's child.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Does it mean

151
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Master will be taken away one day?

152
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Then my hope is gone.

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
It's all gone.

154
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Yes.

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
How could a man like Master

156
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
be a couple with me

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
for the rest of my life?

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Besides,

159
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Liu Ruyan is pregnant.

160
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Will I have the same fate

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
as Madam in the future?

162
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Why does the God have to do this to me?

163
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Come on!

164
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Brother Ye.

165
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I raised a bunch of assholes!

166
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Where is Brother Shen?

167
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Let him sit and wait.

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Brother Ye, you should leave.

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I will lose money

170
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
if I lose him.

171
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Yes.

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Go to your father.

173
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Okay.

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Go.

175
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Thank you, boss.

176
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Brother Ye.

177
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Brother Ye.

178
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Brother Ye.

179
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
This is the third round.

180
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Third round?

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
If you want to see Shen Zhi Le,

182
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
just tell me.

183
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Why do you need to go around so much?

184
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
What do I need to do?

185
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Nonsense!

186
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Since Shen Zhi Le left,

187
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
you have no passion to kill people.

188
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
The gambling business is more advanced.

189
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
What?

190
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
You are teaching me how to do business?

191
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
You don't dare?

192
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Go.

193
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
If I were you,

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
I would believe you.

195
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Come in and have a look.

196
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I really

197
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
miss her.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Come in and have a look.

199
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I did this for the show.

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
If it weren't for Xiao Ye's charity,

201
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
the show would have been affected

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
by the gambling business.

203
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Where is he?

204
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Why hasn't he come out yet?

205
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Miss Shen, are you looking for Brother Ye?

206
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
No, I'm just passing by.

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Brother Ye is not here.

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
He just left.

209
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Where did he go?

210
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
I don't know.

211
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Come and have a look.

212
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Are you

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
okay?

214
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I mean, the show.

215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
It's great.

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
We have a more professional male lead.

217
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
He is always full of energy.

218
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
He is good at everything.

219
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
That's good.

220
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Then,

221
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
congratulations.

222
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
What about your gambling business?

223
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Good.

224
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
How can it not be good?

225
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
We have made a great success.

226
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Sister, look.

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Congratulations.

228
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Goodbye.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Goodbye.

230
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Boss, you...

231
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Goodbye.

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Master, he hasn't come back yet.

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
He said he didn't have to wait for him.

234
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Let's eat first.

235
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
The soup is quite fresh.

236
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Who made it?

237
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
This is the cooking skill

238
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
that the cook learned from Third Madam.

239
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Try it.

240
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Our Third Madam is really capable.

241
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
She is qualified to be a servant.

242
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
As a wife,

243
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
she is far worse.

244
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Yes.

245
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
How can she be better than you?

246
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
As a wife, she is very strong.

247
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
As a servant, no one wants her.

248
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Right?

249
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Master Six

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
is really protecting Third Madam.

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
He is so angry

252
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
that he can't bear to let her go.

253
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Master Six is not protecting me.

254
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
He is just saying that Second Madam

255
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
is pregnant and has a noble status.

256
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
How can he be a servant?

257
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Someone has a good heart

258
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
but he doesn't have a good heart.

259
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
He is just saying that

260
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
he is not a good person.

261
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
He has a good heart.

262
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
If you have something to say,

263
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
just say it.

264
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Master told me

265
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
that I can ask

266
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
whatever I want to eat.

267
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
But I

268
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
like to drink soup.

269
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Please

270
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
make a bowl of soup for me.

271
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
So you want to

273
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
make fun of me.

274
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
If I don't do as you say,

275
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I will not listen to you and respect you.

276
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
If I do as you say,

277
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
I will be a servant to you.

278
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
No matter what I do,

279
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
you will be angry at me.

280
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
You...

281
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
What's wrong?

282
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
I just want to drink soup.

283
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
She has so much bad intentions.

284
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Xiuqun,

285
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
be selfish.

286
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Why don't you

287
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
go and make it for her?

288
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I said you are almost done.

289
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Okay.

290
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Wu Jun,

291
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Master, you know

293
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
that three people are like a tiger

294
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
who can swallow people

295
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
with one gulp.

296
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
If I really don't care,

297
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
according to my previous temper,

298
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
I would have been in trouble.

299
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I just want to ask you,

300
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
is this kind of life

301
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
really what you want?

302
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Master and Madam

303
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
are very nice to me.

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Besides,

305
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
I can manage the office

306
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
myself now.

307
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
This is what I want to do.

308
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
What else am I not satisfied with?

309
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You used to

310
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
dare to fight for power

311
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
but now you are

312
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
just a little bit afraid.

313
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
You are not patient.

314
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
You are not afraid of anything.

315
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
You are not afraid of anything.

316
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Are you satisfied?

317
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
My mother

318
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
used to give me

319
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
two oranges.

320
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Big oranges are very sour.

321
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Small oranges are very sweet.

322
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
My brother always picked the best one.

323
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I would be glad

324
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
if the small one was sweet.

325
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
The sour one

326
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
would be glad

327
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
if the big one was sweet.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
You didn't have a choice before.

329
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
But now?

330
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Master Liu,

331
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
when the oranges are sour,

332
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
you have to chew the core of the food.

333
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
When it is sweet,

334
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
you have to put it in your mouth.

335
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Only then

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
can you live

337
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
this life.

338
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I will be waiting for you.

339
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Thank you, Master.

340
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
You came back with me to pay respects to Mother.

341
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You even removed so many of the oranges.

342
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Today is your mother's death day.

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
How can those things

344
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
be compared to the disease?

345
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Mother died suddenly.

346
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I was still sick at that time.

347
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
The funeral of Yi Ying

348
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
was arranged by Master.

349
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I didn't expect it to be so good.

350
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
It's what it should be.

351
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
She is your mother.

352
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
No matter how good it is, it's not good.

353
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
It's okay.

357
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Come.

358
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Mother,

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
everything is fine in the embroidery bureau.

360
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Don't worry.

361
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Don't worry.

362
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I will definitely protect the embroidery bureau in this life.

363
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I will never let her suffer.

364
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Master,

365
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
it's snowing.

366
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Let's go back.

367
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Let's go.

368
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Let's go.

369
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
In the snow,

370
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
lovers are like smoke.

371
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
A bouquet of flowers is left.

372
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
It seems to be

373
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
for a thousand and ten thousand years.

374
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Hoping that the world will turn around.

375
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
It's too snowy.

376
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I'm still like a white snow.

377
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Come.

378
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,600
This is the end.

379
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Come.

380
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Come.

381
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Mei Mei is with you.

382
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
But she is as childish as a young man.

383
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
In your book,

384
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
one person sees herself

385
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
in the eyes of another person.

386
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
This means that

387
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
you have already planted a root in that person's heart.

388
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I want to know

389
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
if I have a root in your heart.

390
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
You think it's a seed?

391
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
It's the same as the flower.

392
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I think it's a seed.

393
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
What do you mean?

394
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
The seed is not in your heart?

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
It's in the heart.

396
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
The heart is not in your heart.

397
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Then what's in your heart?

398
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
It's in my heart.

399
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
In your heart,

400
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
it seems to be a flower.

401
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
This is the same as a flower.

402
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
It seems to be a flower.

403
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
It seems to be a flower.

404
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
I believe that if I can melt the snow,

405
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
one day,

406
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
the snow will melt.

407
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Let's go in.

408
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,600
I'll go to the kitchen to see what else is in the store.

409
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
You go?

410
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
How can I let you go?

411
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll go.

412
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
It's obvious that you underestimated me.

413
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
In your eyes,

414
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
you didn't see the root,

415
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
but only the big smoke that came out of the mouth?

416
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
Go inside and wait.

417
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I'll come at the end.

418
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Shen Yanzhou, you are...

419
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
The second lady is now in a bad shape.

420
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
You are a delicate person.

421
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
If you bump into someone,

422
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
it's hard to explain.

423
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I'm doing this for your own good.

424
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Just stay here.

425
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Shen Yanzhou,

426
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
why are you so capable?

427
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Let's go.

428
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Keep an eye on her.

429
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Yes, Master Liu.

430
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I haven't done this for a long time.

431
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I don't know if I've learned anything.

432
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Master,

433
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
you can make Yangchun noodles?

434
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Back then,

435
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
in order to support the Shen family,

436
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I traveled a long way every day,

437
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
and ate a lot.

438
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I didn't expect that the best skill I learned

439
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
was to make Yangchun noodles.

440
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
It's a good meal.

441
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Try it.

442
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Does it suit your taste?

443
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
I'll try it.

444
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
It's delicious.

445
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I didn't expect that you would make this.

446
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I still like you calling me Yan Qing.

447
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
But since the day of the wedding,

448
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
after Liu came back,

449
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
you never called me that.

450
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
I didn't mean to.

452
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I was too careless in the past.

454
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
Now I think

455
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I shouldn't forget

456
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
our identities.

457
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Identities?

458
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I don't want to be the master

459
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
who carries the whole Shen family,

460
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Mrs. and Mrs. Cheng.

461
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Although I'm self-sufficient,

462
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
as a man,

463
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I still have the responsibility to be a father.

464
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Sometimes,

465
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
I envy Liu more

466
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
for being able to leave everything behind

467
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
without any care.

468
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Brother.

472
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Sister-in-law asked me to ask you to go back.

473
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
She said she has something important to tell you.

474
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Are you okay?

475
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I'm fine.

476
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Let go of me!

477
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Let go of me!

478
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Let go of me!

479
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Let go of me!

480
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Let go of me!

481
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Let go of me!

482
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Let go of me!

483
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Who dares to do this to me?

484
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Mrs. Cheng.

485
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
You can't give birth to a child yourself.

486
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You're just trying to kill my father and my child, right?

487
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
How dare you mention the child?

488
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Kneel down!

489
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Let go of me!

490
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
What are you doing?

491
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Master.

492
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Master.

493
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Master, save me!

494
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Ru Yan.

495
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Save me!

496
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
What's wrong?

497
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Master, he's going to kill me.

498
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
What if something happens to the child?

499
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
What should I do?

500
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
My stomach hurts.

501
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
What are you doing?

502
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
He's pregnant.

503
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
What did he do wrong?

504
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Why are you torturing him?

505
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Brother.

506
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
We were all fooled by him.

507
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
He's not pregnant at all.

508
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Ru Yan.

509
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Ru Yan.

510
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
This world is like the old days,

511
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
the familiar expectations.

512
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
A wish to meet someone

513
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,600
just to meet someone.

514
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,600
The fate is waiting to conquer your face.

515
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,600
The flowers bloom without saying goodbye.

516
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
The world is like the old days,

517
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,600
the familiar expectations.

518
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
A wish to meet someone

519
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,600
just to meet someone.

520
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,600
The fate is waiting to conquer your face.

521
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,600
The flowers bloom without saying goodbye.

522
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:28,600
The flowers bloom without saying goodbye.
