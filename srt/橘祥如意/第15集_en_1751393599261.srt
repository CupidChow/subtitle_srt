Episode 15

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Master, save me!

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Ru Yan, what's going on?

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Madam is going to kill me!

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What if something happens to the baby?

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What should I do?

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My stomach hurts.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you doing?

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She is pregnant.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What did she do wrong?

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why do you have to torture her like this?

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Brother, we were all fooled by her.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She is not pregnant at all.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Stop talking nonsense!

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Master, don't listen to her.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She must have done this to slander me.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I knew you would say that.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I dare not touch you without any evidence.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bring her here.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You...

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's going on?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Since she is pregnant,

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
why did she come to the music room?

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I suspected that she was having problems.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I asked her to keep an eye on her.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bring her here.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Master, I...

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have no experience.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought it was normal for a woman to bleed.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was afraid you would be worried.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So I didn't tell you.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have never had a baby.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I didn't know about this.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It must be the doctor.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The doctor had a miscarriage.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Really?

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll call the doctor here.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You two can face each other.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Shaoqi.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Master...

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tell me.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's going on?

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The lady said that

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
she would give me a lot of money

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
if I lied to her.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was so worried.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Master, I...

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The closer you are to her,

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
the more you know how to deceive me.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm afraid you would abandon me.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I was confused.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I did this stupid thing.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Give me another chance.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I did it.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to divorce you.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
From now on,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you are Liu Ruyan's wife.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are my wife.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to divorce you.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to divorce you.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to divorce you.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Liu Ruyan has nothing to do with the Shen family.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Come on.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Drive her out.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Master.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Master.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let go of me.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let go of me.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hurry.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Madam.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't run.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Don't come over.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you come over,

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll jump off.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's dangerous.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come down.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come down.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
For so many years,

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've been helping the Shen family

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
with wine and laughter.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I've been helping people everywhere.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've been doing everything for them.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you treat me like this?

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Since you know you're wrong,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you should repent.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You should have been dead

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and let people see you.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Did you live for others all your life?

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You have the favor of Master.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course you can say such things.

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How many wrongs have you suffered

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
from the Tianxiu Bureau?

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now she's so good.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't be a good girl.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Liu Ruyan.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Stop it.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come down, okay?

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You left alone.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And you're being so polite.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't care about your politeness.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Shen Yan, please let me tell you.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you dare to abandon me,

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll die here.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Be careful.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I want to be the most powerful woman in the Shen family.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hate being threatened by others.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No one can change

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
what I've decided.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother, what if she...

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She finally got rich.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
She can't bear to die.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Leave her alone.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Brother.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Master.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Master.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Mrs. Shen.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Mrs. Shen.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mrs. Shen.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mrs. Shen.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mrs. Shen.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mrs. Shen.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mrs. Shen.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mrs. Shen.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Mrs. Shen.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Shen.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The doctor has checked her.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's nothing serious.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's just that her arm is broken.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She needs to rest for a while.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll send a car tomorrow

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to send her back to the city.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In case of any more trouble.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If we send her back,

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm afraid

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
she's not feeling very stable right now.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Once she's back,

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
she'll be fine.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm afraid

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
she'll be in a bad mood.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Once she's back,

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
she'll talk nonsense.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Or she'll say something that she can't figure out.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm afraid

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
it'll ruin the reputation of the Shen family

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and Master's reputation.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're right.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The Shen family is not doing well lately.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Everything is going against the grain.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I thought having a child

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
was a good thing.

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who knows?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But in the end,

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's a joke.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I...

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm ashamed of my ancestors.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Master.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't think like that.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're in your prime.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So the child will be born sooner or later.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The embroidery bureau has already

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
responded to you.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Besides,

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sixth is back safely.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Everything is going in the right direction.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I hope so.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wine can only forget worries for a moment.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But people can get rid of their sorrows.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are...

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Boss Han.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You haven't seen me for so many years.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You still look beautiful.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was lucky enough to dance with you

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
until I can't forget you.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You smiled.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Can we have a drink now?

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's the point of forgetting?

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can't escape from

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the end of being loved by others

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and being abandoned by others.

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Since you're in the prime,

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you should turn back in time.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
To be honest,

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have a family grudge against Shen Yanqing.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know him better than you do.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You want to drag me into your plan?

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're drunk.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't you want to

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
listen to my words?

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
To Shen Yanqing,

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you are a family man.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are a business man.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He will be grateful to you,

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but he will never love you.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In the end, you will end up

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
like Madam.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Enough.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not going to drink anymore.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're being ridiculous.

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Enough.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Listen,

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
he's just bewitched by that embroidery shop.

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
When I have a child,

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
he will be by my side.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He will love me in the end.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What if your plan is empty?

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Miss Liu,

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
what's in your hand

211
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
is the most real.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Everything is the same.

213
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You have to think it over.

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I have some good wine.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I hope to drink with you next time.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The business in the shop is getting worse.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I just found out that

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
this can of Yang Yang

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
has stolen most of our business.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's not entirely your fault.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There are many types of cans now.

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ying Ying fruit is full of meat.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's a fresh product.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Everyone will definitely go to work.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're only half right.

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Master Liu.

228
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
As long as the price is low,

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the customers will definitely go to work.

230
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The stock is already self-produced.

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This has saved a lot of costs.

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But the space is limited.

233
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's why we need to change.

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
These are photos of the Nanyang Food Processing Factory.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If we can import machines,

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
we can improve production capacity

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and save cost.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We can even change the new life.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Besides making orange juice and secret ingredients,

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
we can also use these machines

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to develop more new products.

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're right.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I actually thought the same.

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I also want to develop orange wine,

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
orange juice, orange cream,

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and orange juice.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I want to make orange juice.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I want to make orange juice.

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Orange juice, orange cream.

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why are you thinking about food?

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Come.

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Look at this.

253
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Orange skin?

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We can also make orange skin,

256
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and medicinal ingredients like orange red.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We can also make canned food.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Orange juice, orange cream, orange juice.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
From a long-term perspective,

260
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it's a good thing for Ju Yuan.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But this idea is too risky.

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm afraid it will...

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll help you.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Since God gave me a chance to be reborn,

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't want to repeat the same mistake.

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
As long as it's what you want to accomplish,

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will do it for you.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's not for me.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's for the Shen Family.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Thank you, Sixth Lord.

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're welcome.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
My Lord,

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
it's hard to make a living

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
if we sell our cans abroad.

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The world is different now.

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Instead of being eliminated by others,

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
we can make our own.

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's right.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Jiang City now has a few machines.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So we can take advantage of the opportunity

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to take over the market at a low price.

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes.

284
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
As long as we have enough raw materials,

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
we can not only sell our goods,

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but also attack Jiang City.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We can even sell them overseas.

288
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I disagree.

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You two are too careless.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Just do your job well.

291
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't think too much.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But...

293
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Enough.

294
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've made my decision.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's not talk about it.

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No, my Lord.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If we don't make any changes,

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the Shen Family will be in a dead end.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Don't listen to what you hear.

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Our business will not die.

301
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't have to worry.

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
My Lord,

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
it's about the future of the Shen Family.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I want to open a ancestral hall.

305
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Please give me a chance.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What did you say?

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Open an ancestral hall?

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I sent you out to see the world

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to make you come back to bother me?

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Open it if you want.

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
My Lord.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Why are you so rude?

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why are you so rude?

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why do you have to

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
disturb the elders

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
in the business between you brothers?

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Liu,

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
it's not proper for you

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
to do this.

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And how can you

322
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
disobey the Lord

323
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
in the embroidery bureau?

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You have to cut the thread once

325
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
before you know it hurts.

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
My Lord,

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
what do you want to say?

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I...

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The embroidery bureau is very serious.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I understand his ambition

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to show off his skills.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But it is very expensive.

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It is very hard to make ends meet.

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It will be a big trouble

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
if everything is too hasty.

336
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A hundred years ago,

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
the ancestors of the Shen family

338
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
dared to be human immortals.

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They hurt the Bo Sha

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and created a huge family business.

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Now,

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the advanced technology and machines

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
abroad are heavily affected

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
by traditional craftsmanship.

345
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
If we are too old

346
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to be immortals,

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
what will the Shen family

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
look like

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
in the next hundred years?

350
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You did this

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
to destroy

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
the reputation of the Shen family

353
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and those who have

354
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
succeeded several times.

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How should they do it?

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't worry, My Lord.

357
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
No matter how good the machines are,

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
they need people to operate them.

359
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Their family can be trained

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
to start over.

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Others can be sent to sell

362
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and open new businesses.

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Anyway,

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
there will be a way out.

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you are worried,

366
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I am willing to take out all my savings

367
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to make a living

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and be your

369
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
goldsmith.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What do you think?

371
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Show us your attitude.

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is true.

373
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Drink it all.

374
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Stop it.

375
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I bet you can't.

376
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
At least concubine borrowing

377
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,000
will help us.

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was only given

379
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
by a distant relative.

380
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They always were geniuses!

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Madam ISO really makes sense.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
And

383
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,000
Carlos has Explore all over the world.

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We've decided

385
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
both before this war was over.

386
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's wrong

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
We'll take care of it.

388
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We'll take care of it.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's go.

390
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Good day, Madam.

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Good day, Madam.

392
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyone has worked hard.

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I have something to tell you.

394
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The residence is about to close.

395
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You should all go home and rest for a few days.

396
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's going on?

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What happened?

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What happened?

399
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Just do as I said.

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Don't ask so many questions.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Madam, what if Master finds out?

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You don't understand.

403
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The embroidery bureau and Sixth Brother

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
are challenging his authority.

405
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If we let them go,

406
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the house will be in chaos.

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Madam, why are you here?

408
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Madam, Madam.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Madam just said

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
that you don't have to worry.

411
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They will pay the An family's fees.

412
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What do you mean by An family's fees?

413
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What do you mean by An family's fees?

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you going to drive us away?

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You don't know yet?

416
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

417
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Madam,

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you want to buy a batch of foreign machines

419
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
for production in the bureau.

420
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Once you have the machines,

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
you don't need to pay the An family's fees.

422
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Isn't this a life-threatening task?

423
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Master wanted to keep you guys.

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I agree with Master.

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But Madam

426
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
insisted on holding a ancestral hall

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to suppress us.

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I am too young

429
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to help you guys.

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I have worked in the Shen family for a lifetime.

431
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
If you want to drive us away,

432
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
isn't that killing us?

433
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let's go talk to her.

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There are so many of us.

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's go.

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We must talk to her.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We can't control Madam's machines.

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But you can't stop us from doing our job.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's right.

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Who said that?

441
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We know everything.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
How long are you going to keep it from us?

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Listen to me.

444
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I want to buy machines

445
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
to upgrade the bureau.

446
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But I will also settle everyone's situation.

447
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You think the An family's fees are settled?

448
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
How are we going to survive?

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's right.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
We have been managing the bureau

451
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
for so many years.

452
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But you

453
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
are killing us.

454
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Don't think about it.

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I...

456
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Beat them!

457
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Beat them!

458
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Don't beat them!

459
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Don't beat them!

460
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Stop!

461
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Stop!

462
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You want to run away after you smash things?

463
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Hold him down!

464
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Close the door!

465
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Who are you?

466
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What should we do?

467
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
These are the orders from the moon.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Xiaoju!

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Xiaoju!

470
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If anything happens to Madam Santa,

471
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I will not give up!

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I will not give up!

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I will not give up!

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I will not give up!

475
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Go!

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Go!

477
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What are you doing?

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Madam, Madam, Madam said

479
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,460
that we have to get rid of the

480
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
machine and get rid of the egg.

481
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
She won't let us live.

482
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
We can only play together.

483
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
You are talking nonsense.

484
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Lock her in the room for three days.

485
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
You are not allowed to leave the room without my permission.

486
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Master,

487
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
don't you want the machine to go into the prison?

488
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
I did this for you.

489
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
It's my family's business whether the machine goes into the prison or not.

490
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
It's not your turn to talk nonsense.

491
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Outsiders?

492
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
Shen Yanqing,

493
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
all these years,

494
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I have been

495
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
doing business in the prison.

496
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
I have been doing business in the prison.

497
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,380
I have been doing business in the prison.

498
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I am just an outsider

499
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,380
in your heart, right?

500
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,380
I am just an outsider, right?

501
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Why are you still standing there?

502
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Take her away!

503
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
Take her away!

504
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
You make it clear!

505
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
You make it clear!

506
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
Shen Yanqing!

507
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Let me go!

508
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Let me go!

509
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Don't close the door!

510
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't close the door!

511
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Let me out!

512
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
What a bad place!

513
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Shen Yanqing,

514
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I have seen through you.

515
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Since you don't love me,

516
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
I will ask for money.

517
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
I need to find a new supporter.

518
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
You...

519
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
You...

520
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
You see,

521
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
I have already packed it.

522
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
I have also thrown away

523
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
those broken equipment.

524
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Don't be sad.

525
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I won't go to the old place.

526
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
I won't come now.

527
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
In the morning, there is a master who can repair the machine.

528
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
I will go to the old place.

529
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
I won't go to the old place.

530
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I won't go to the old place.

531
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I won't go to the old place.

532
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
I have sent someone to repair the machine.

533
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
No need.

534
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Don't be sad.

535
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Although the broken equipment is heart-breaking,

536
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
we have agreed

537
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
to purchase a batch of imported machines

538
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
to replace these hand-made equipment.

539
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Now,

540
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
let's start the schedule.

541
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
I thought you would be sad for a while.

542
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
It seems that

543
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
you have figured it out.

544
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
When the workers learn to use new machines,

545
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
they will see that the machines can improve production capacity

546
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
and help them earn more money.

547
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Then they will understand our hard work.

548
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
That's right.

549
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
When new machines come in,

550
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
I believe that the business of Juyuan

551
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
will be able to revive.

552
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Then tell me how to

553
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
purchase new machines.

554
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
I am waiting for your words.

555
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
This way, please.

556
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
The route is like this.

557
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
This is Nanyang.

558
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,220
We will send someone to pick up the machine at the dock.

559
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,220
But will the cost be high?

560
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,220
The cost is within our calculation range.

561
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
Only passing through this place

562
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
will require a bus fare.

563
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Sixth, Xiuji.

564
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,220
Big brother, sister-in-law.

565
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Master, madam.

566
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
You came just in time.

567
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
I am discussing how to purchase new machines with Sixth.

568
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes.

569
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
For this machine,

570
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
you made such a big move.

571
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
I think

572
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
we should delay it for a while.

573
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
But sister-in-law,

574
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,220
if we don't have this new machine,

575
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,220
it will be difficult for Juyuan to start a new business.

576
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Then the efforts that Xiuji has made before

577
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,220
will be in vain?

578
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
As the third madam of Master,

579
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
even if she does nothing,

580
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
she will never lack

581
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,220
her wealth and glory in this life.

582
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Right?

583
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
What are you going to do?

584
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I plan to work with Sixth

585
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
to make a joint venture.

586
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,680
We will split the profits.

587
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Sixth knows about the machines.

588
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
When the new machine arrives, he will be in charge of the maintenance.

589
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,140
I will sell the machine.

590
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Since you have decided,

591
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,140
let's do it.

592
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
Thank you, master.

593
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,140
Thank you.

594
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,140
Thank you.

595
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,140
Thank you.

596
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,140
Thank you.

597
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,140
Thank you.
