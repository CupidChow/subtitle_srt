The Long Ballad

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Here.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wait.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go together.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mr. Yadang, this way please.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This way please, Anna.

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Alright.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
These are our orange products.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let me introduce for you.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
These, all of these are made of oranges.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So this one is fresh orange, yes?

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How about this one?

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This one is dried orange.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dried orange, okay.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Yadang said, he asked us if this one is fresh orange.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It is fresh.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This one is fresh.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
These are fresh oranges and these are dried.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let me try this.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can taste all of it.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let me try this fresh one.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Good, isn't it?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's really delicious. Oh my god. I like it.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What did he say?

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mr. Aiden said he really likes the taste of our oranges.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me try this one.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tastes good, right?

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And so?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm glad that I can do business with you.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Happy cooperation.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Business is hard to grow.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We have to expand our scale to the world.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Boss, just give me a good price.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll be happy.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's great.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't expect that my orange products can be sold abroad.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's like a dream.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I remember I told you before.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I will help you to do what you want to do.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will help you to realize your dream.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've asked Shaoqi to make the layout of the hall.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's make it more.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
By then, we can sell all the products.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's a good idea.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Right?

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And attract people's attention through the game.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is fun.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Boss, look.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is there anything else to add?

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think we can make it more.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is a good place.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Add some decorations.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sure.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you doing?

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The game is about to start.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We are discussing the game.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We want to take this opportunity to show the products of Shen Ji.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There are rules and rules.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But the traditional customs of giving the game to the students and making the game safe.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why do we lose it?

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Boss, we want to design something different this time.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
More aesthetic for young people.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right, uncle.

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There are so many traditional activities.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm tired of reading.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Young people only seek for the heart and the border.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But have you ever thought about it?

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The tradition is still the same.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not the same.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's the root of the game.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The blind disease will only make the descendants of the generations lose their ancestors.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's like giving up a customer group.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You are right.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will optimize the plan.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Boss, let's go up first.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think this is...

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then it's the last one.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The whole thing about the machine is done.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The result is not bad.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But how many difficult ancestors have experienced in the middle?

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And almost killed two people.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The Shen family is almost out of control.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Anyway, the sixth brother is doing things in a hurry.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Seeing the current situation and the sixth brother,

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to see myself who was alone in Shanghai when I was young.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm afraid I'm old.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How can you be old?

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In my eyes, the old man is still the same as he was.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's only in your eyes.

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Young people are so nice.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's easy to get along.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not like the embroidery bureau and I are always apart.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But the old man,

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the embroidery bureau and the sixth brother,

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
will not be...

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Can't let go of people like this anymore.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm still old enough to be deceived by my own woman and brother.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't think about what to do for me.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I think it's an insult.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have never lost in my life.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I will not lose to my brother.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Master, you feel bad.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will only feel worse than you.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Good!

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Good!

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good!

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good!

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Good!

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Good!

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The tribute of the bow and arrow is presented.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The next year's harvest is presented.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The security guard's order is presented.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The wind is blowing.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Come on.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The bowman is asking for the second son.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The bowman is asking for the second son.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How many are left?

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thousands of eggs.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The bowman is asking for the second son.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Will you give birth?

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Will you give birth?

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Will you give birth?

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Will you give birth?

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Will you give birth?

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Will you give birth?

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Will you give birth?

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll come and play too.

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Play.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you doing?

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I am a celibate.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I won't give birth.

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You little brat.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I didn't hit you.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't let you give birth.

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The bowman is sending the bowman.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The mountain river is fine.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The stars are scattered.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The flowers are gone.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The bowman is protecting his friends.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The spring flowers are in full bloom.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The river is in full bloom.

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The wind is blowing.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The bowman is pushing the bow.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The wind is blowing.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The bowman is pushing the bow.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If the bowman is pushing the bow,

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
friends will be thankful

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
for the water, the land, and sails.

Thank you for the gift of my son.

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
activist ceremony has passed.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,740
to bring us luck.

163
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Let usnot waste our~)

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,220
Bon appétit.

165
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,420
Good!

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,520
Good!

cans show its kont λ

168
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,220
The taste of the orange is refreshing and sweet.

169
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,340
In addition,

170
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,180
Shenji Shop has launched a special orange-flavored party.

171
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,060
All the products of the orange can be brought home.

172
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,620
How can we taste the orange?

173
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,420
We need to play two games.

174
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
What game?

175
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,700
The first one is the light of the orange.

176
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,780
You just need to find a place in the flowers

177
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,420
with a person, an orange and a lantern.

178
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,380
Then you can pass.

179
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,820
The second one is the hand of the orange.

180
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,020
You need to cooperate with the person.

181
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,860
The woman is blind and the man is holding the hand.

182
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,340
You can pass a barrier road to reach the party.

183
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,740
What are we waiting for?

184
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,940
Let's get started.

185
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,340
Let's go.

186
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,860
Okay.

187
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,540
Let's go.

188
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,660
Come and see if you pass by.

189
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
Come and see if you pass by.

190
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,660
Come and see if you pass by.

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Come and see if you pass by.

192
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,260
Okay.

193
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,780
Look at him.

194
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
I suddenly have a stomachache.

195
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,740
I don't know what I ate wrong.

196
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,300
You go first, Xiuji.

197
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,620
I'll come to you later.

198
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Okay, go ahead.

199
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,740
It's too late.

200
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:47,100
When the

201
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,800
In the end, I feel so episcopated

202
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,260
On the road to the land...

203
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,700
and there has been a minor bout with the Communist Party Government

204
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,700
But to moderation was the common request

205
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,780
The sorrowful and如何 responsible

206
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,460
Only the bl bounded one believed in the 55-minute countdown

207
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,220
Miss.

208
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,580
Hurry up and tie it up.

209
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,460
Are you done?

210
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,860
Then I'll go.

211
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,660
Walk slowly.

212
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
You're crossing the line.

213
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,220
Great.

214
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,020
Let's go.

215
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,140
Trust me.

216
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,100
Let's go.

217
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,660
Last one.

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,620
Did I hurt you?

219
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,420
No.

220
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,540
Does it hurt?

221
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,420
No.

222
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,780
That's good.

223
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,620
Let's go.

224
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,140
It's not that troublesome.

225
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,180
Xiao Ye.

226
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,460
My uncle is still in front of us.

227
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,380
Are you scared?

228
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm scared.

229
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,340
I'm scared of you.

230
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,900
If you're not scared, let's go.

231
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
Slow down.

232
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,020
Xiao Ye, let me down.

233
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,180
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

234
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,940
Let's go.

235
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,980
Master.

236
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,180
Why are you here?

237
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
It's rare to see a game so new.

238
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,980
I can't help but want to try it.

239
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,420
This is a game of the heart.

240
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,940
Let me accompany you.

241
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,020
Master.

242
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
You have to trust me completely.

243
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,140
Don't doubt me.

244
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,660
Come on.

245
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,140
Good.

246
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,140
Lift your feet.

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,140
Very good.

248
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,820
Very good.

249
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,180
Very good.

250
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,780
We're almost at the second floor.

251
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,140
Good.

252
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,820
Be careful.

253
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,580
One, two, three.

254
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,020
Slow down.

255
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,540
Good job.

256
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,700
We're at the last level.

257
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,300
You have to hold me tight.

258
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,700
Don't let go of me no matter what.

259
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,620
Congratulations oncandovalfesaƏ sank show.

260
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,740
Now you can go and draw a lantern.

261

Your turn.

262
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Let's go.

263
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
6th year of the school year

264
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Hey, 6th year.

265
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Have you finished writing?

266
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Brother and sister-in-law.

267
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Okay, go and play.

268
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Let's go.

269
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300

270
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Let's go.

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
6th year of the school year

272
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
What did you write?

273
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
The family of Shen is safe.

274
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
The family of Ju Yuan Sheng is prosperous.

275
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
Where is Master?

276
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
What did Master write?

277
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Master.

278
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Boss Wu and Boss Wen are waiting for you.

279
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
I'll be right there.

280
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
I'll get back to work.

281
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Okay.

282
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
6th year of the school year

283
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Master, this way.

284
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
6th year of the school year

285
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Mrs. 3rd.

286
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
6th year.

287
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Mrs. 3rd.

288
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
We succeeded in the Ju Shan Dong meeting.

289
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
We've made 832 dollars in total.

290
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Let's all celebrate.

291
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Let's go, 6th year.

292
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Okay.

293
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Let's go.

294
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Let's go.

295
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
You're so lively.

296
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Let's go.

297
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
I have something to tell you.

298
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Don't say it yet.

299
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
I have something to tell you too.

300
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
Shen Zhi Le, I...

301
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Even if you reject me, I have to say it.

302
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
I've already thought about it.

303
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I love it.

304
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
There's nothing to say.

305
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
What identity difference, status difference,

306
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
I don't care.

307
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Master.

308
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
I've seen my heart.

309
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
I'm not doing this for a living.

310
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm not doing this to fight against Uncle.

311
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
I'm not acting in a theater.

312
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
I...

313
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
I really fell in love with you.

314
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
Okay.

315
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
You can reject me now.

316
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
No.

317
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
This is not right.

318
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
We're not right.

319
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
No.

320
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Then...

321
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
I should confess to you first.

322
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
Confess?

323
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
You were just...

324
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
I said I have something to tell you.

325
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
You have to say it.

326
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Shen Zhi Le.

327
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I don't know why

328
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I have feelings for you

329
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
as a young lady.

330
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
What feelings?

331
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
The feeling of being in trouble.

332
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
But the one you like,

333
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Shabishya, didn't you say it?

334
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Shabishya.

335
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
No, I'm not.

336
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
I don't like to be a traitor.

337
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Shen Zhi Le.

338
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
I...

339
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
What?

340
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I said I...

341
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I fell in love with you.

342
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
I didn't hear it clearly.

343
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I said I...

344
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,300
Shabishya also said,

345
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
don't talk,

346
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,300
kiss me.

347
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I...

348
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
I can still...

349
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Let's drink.

350
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Let's go.

351
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Let's go.

352
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
I want to...

353
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
I want to...

354
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
I want to...

355
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
I want to...

356
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I want to...

357
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I want to...

358
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
I want to...

359
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I want to...

360
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I want to...

361
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
I want to...

362
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
It's been a long time since I've seen you so happy.

363
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Wine is a good thing.

364
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,300
It can make people forget a lot of things.

365
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Don't drink.

366
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
It can also

367
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
make people think of a lot of things.

368
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,300
It can also make me,

369
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
a person who is not happy,

370
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
happy.

371
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Then let's drink.

372
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Are you okay?

373
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
I'm fine.

374
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Shen Yanzhao.

375
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,300
What are you looking at?

376
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
You're in my dream again.

377
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,300
The most beautiful thing in the world is the love of one's life.

378
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
A book of flowers is left.

379
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,300
It seems to have waited for a thousand and ten thousand years.

380
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,300
It's hard to live in the world.

381
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,300
A dream is a long time.

382
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,300
The four seasons of love are about to come to an end.

383
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,300
The love of one's life is like a wish.

384
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
A book of flowers is left.

385
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,300
It seems to have waited for a thousand and ten thousand years.

386
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Half life, half death, the fate of love is short.

387
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
A person's life is a half year.

388
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Is it a wish?

389
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,300
The rain and the clouds are not scattered.

390
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,300
The tears are like thousands of years.

391
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,300
The warm afterglow is not seen again.

392
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,300
The eyes of the bad guy are only like this world.

393
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Who is the next one?

394
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
The lovers are like a dream.

395
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
A book of flowers is left.

396
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,300
It seems to have waited for a thousand and ten thousand years.

397
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Half life, half death, the fate of love is short.

398
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
A person's life is a half year.

399
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Is it a wish?

400
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Go to this world.

401
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,300
It seems to be familiar.

402
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,300
A book of flowers is left.

403
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Just to meet someone.

404
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,300
The fate of love is short.

405
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
The face of the good guy is short.

406
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,300
The flowers are not scattered.

407
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
The years of the past.

408
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Go to this world.

409
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Who is the next one?

410
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
The lovers are like a dream.

411
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
A book of flowers is left.

412
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,300
It seems to have waited for a thousand and ten thousand years.

413
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,300
Half life, half death, the fate of love is short.

414
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
A person's life is a half year.

415
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
The flowers are not scattered.

416
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
The years of the past.

417
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,300
The flowers are not scattered.

418
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,300
The years of the past.
