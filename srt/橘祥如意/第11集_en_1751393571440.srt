00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The doctor said

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
he was dying of starvation.

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm afraid he won't wake up again.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sixth sister is gone.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
His mother is dead.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He has no attachment to this world.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to be with him alone.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Sixth sister

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Uncle.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I just found a letter

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
from Sixth uncle to the embroidery bureau.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But what's the use of just a letter?

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's gone.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You go out first.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't let anyone in.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Will Sixth brother wake up

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
if I stay here?

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Xiuqu,

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
take care.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to go south today.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Xiuqu.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Xiuqu.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yanzhou.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can you fall asleep reading?

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Isn't your boat...

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What boat?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm fine.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I had a nightmare.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I dreamt

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I would never see you again.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I thought you dreamed of marrying me

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and having a happy life.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Happy and bitter.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yanzhou,

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to be with you.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want to marry you.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then we will be together forever.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The end

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
People say

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that a daughter can't be willful

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when she's married.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But you're different.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As long as you have me,

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you can do whatever you want.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In the next life,

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to be your daughter.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're such a silly child.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now I'm leaving you to her.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can finally become my bride.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yanzhou,

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
after we get married,

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
we'll find a place

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
with a beautiful scenery

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and plant flowers and pick oranges.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No one can ever

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
separate us.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry, Xiuquan.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm going to break my promise.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't keep you.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You should wake up.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What do you mean, Yanzhou?

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yanzhou,

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it's not a dream.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We're getting married soon.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If I keep keeping you,

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you can't wake up.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want...

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I want to be with you.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Do you remember that tune?

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's me.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll be with you forever.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yanzhou,

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
you don't even know.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I regretted it so much that day.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I shouldn't have said those words.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I shouldn't have let you go, Yanzhou.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The words you said to me

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
were all lies.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Xiaoqi,

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't blame you.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No matter what,

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I hope you can live well

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and live your life

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
as you want.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Live your life with no fear.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I said that

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
doesn't mean we forget each other.

93
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I just want to tell you

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that we're the most beautiful

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and the most beautiful couple in our lives.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We should spend our whole lives together.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But in our lives,

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we shouldn't be the only one.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Xiaoqi,

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
there are many dreams

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and dreams waiting for you to fulfill.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
put you in this dream.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yanzhou,

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't want you to go.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
As long as you still have me in your heart,

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll always be by your side.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I love you.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Xiaoqi,

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
goodbye.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Goodbye,

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yanzhou.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I wish you happiness

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and happiness.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can only let go

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
when I'm happy.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yanzhou.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Master,

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Madam

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and Zhi Le

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
have tried their best

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
to make me live

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
for them

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
or for you and your mother.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sorry

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for what I did.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
for what I did.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
for what I did.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
for what I did.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
For you and your mother,

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
for myself,

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll live well

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and cheer up.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yanzhou,

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Master.

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You seem to be so serious.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I didn't disturb you.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The orange juice is good recently.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have worked hard.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you feeling better?

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can't think about those things when I'm busy.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm going to the city to search for shops.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You follow me to the desert to learn.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And have a walk.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Master, I...

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Get ready.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll wait for you downstairs.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Master,

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you'll take me to the city every year to search for shops.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know how long you can stay this time.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can go and pack up some of my new clothes.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, and put on some expensive jewelry.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have to make sure you look good.

159
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And bring some medicine to keep you hydrated.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
After he comes to the city,

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
he'll drink and drink.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He'll feel sick then.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay. Is this good?

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's go.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't keep him waiting.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Master, I'm ready.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We can go.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where's Master?

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Madam,

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Master told me to tell you to take Third Madam to the city.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
She's already gone.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I see.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Madam, this...

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's time to take Xiuju out to see the world.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
After all, Xiuju is still young.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's boring to stay in the countryside.

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I should be happy.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This...

183
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Xiuju has finally caught Master's heart.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have hope.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right?

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Madam, you're right.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Madam, you're right.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Sir!

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Here comes the water!

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Perfume and wine!

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Perfume and wine!

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Miss, sir.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm a

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,000
wine-drinker from the city of Falanxi.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Perfume and wine

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
are the scent of the soul.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Each one has its own unique

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
personality and smell.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This one has a light orange scent

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and a clear and lively scent.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The middle one has a sweet scent.

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The tail one has a strong fragrance

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and the front one has a strong scent.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It smells sweet.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's like walking in the rain.

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There are flowers all around.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It seems that you like perfume.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll take all of these.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Where is the boss?

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Where is the boss?

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get in the car.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Excuse me.

216
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sir, please slow down.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Excuse me.

218
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Madam is here.

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Excuse me.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hello.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The orange jam from the first round is really good.

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, I've never had such a delicious food.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The orange jam from the first round is really good.

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Give it to my wife.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Isn't this my orange jam?

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Take a look at this.

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is our store's commercial product.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why is it being sold in such a high-end store?

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I promised

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to help you sell the orange jam to the whole country.

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But you created this business.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You should be seen.

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It seems that the small-scale production

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
is a big hit.

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I remember it.

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's called the first round.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The label

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
can be a unique orange flower.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
See some orange and Sichuan citizen

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
who have never seen such a beautiful flower like this.

243
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This canned grape is for you.

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why is this not the grape taste?

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Great.

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You work in this store?

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is the first store we opened together.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The orange jam can be sold here in the future.

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,640
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,440
Master.

252
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Yu Qing, I like you.

253
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760
I'm willing to sacrifice for you.

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,280
Yu Li, I'm your shareholder.

255
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
This is also my investment.

256
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
So don't mention

257
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,000
the return of the family.

258
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,100
Come on, we're arriving.

259
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,360
Come on.

260
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,600
Why isn't anybody picking me up?

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Didn't tell Second Madam I'm back today?

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Second Madam said it.

263
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Maybe she's asleep.

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Unruly.

265
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Let me show you our house in the city.

266
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Boss.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,500
Welcome.

268
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
Welcome.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Brother Shen, I've been waiting for you.

270
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
During your absence,

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Miss Liu has done a lot of business for you.

272
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes.

273
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm very proud of Brother Shen

274
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,000
for having such a good wife.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes.

276
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,300
Where is she?

277
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,000
Here.

278
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Welcome home, Master.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,500
I happen to take this opportunity

280
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,000
to introduce my Third Madam to you.

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
Xiuqu.

282
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Please take care of her.

283
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,500
Okay.

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Brother Shen, I have something to discuss with you.

286
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Let's talk in private.

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

288
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll be back soon.

289
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Please.

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,500
Today is the first time Third Madam has shown her face.

291
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,000
I suggest

292
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
she should dance the opening dance today.

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay.

294
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Good.

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Good.

296
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't want to dance.

297
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
You don't want to dance or you don't know how to dance?

298
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
I forgot to introduce.

299
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Our Third Madam is a country girl.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,500
It's her first time in the city.

301
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
She's never seen anything like this.

302
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Please take care of her.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't leave, Third Madam.

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,500
So many people are watching.

305
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
You should have been more careful.

306
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
You're in a good mood today.

307
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Can you invite a beautiful girl

308
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to dance with you?

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,500
I can't.

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Imagine you're a cloud

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and I'm the wind.

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You're the wind.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm a cloud.

314
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Where you blow,

315
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I'll float in that direction.

316
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're not here

318
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's raining and snowing

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't care

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The sea is covered with clouds

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
in your ears

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The flowers fall into the sky

323
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The snowfall is blue

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and the clouds are blue

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There is a bright moon this morning

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm not here

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
for the dead

328
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The trees are still here

329
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,500
The more the day goes by, the more people go away

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm not used to

331
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
you still not here

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
I don't understand

333
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
how much time has changed

334
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
I shouldn't have said that

335
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm still in the dream

336
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
hoping you'll come back

337
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
The trees are still here

338
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
The more the day goes by, the more people go away

339
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm not used to

340
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
you still not here

341
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I don't understand

342
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
how much time has changed

343
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I shouldn't have said that

344
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm still in the dream

345
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
hoping you'll come back

346
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I'm still in the dream

347
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
hoping you'll come back

348
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
The End

349
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I'll teach you

350
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
the last song

351
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Master, I don't know how to dance

352
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
You dance very well

353
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
very beautiful

354
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Just follow the feeling

355
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I'll take you

356
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Master, I'm sorry

357
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I stepped on your foot

358
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It doesn't matter if you step on the wrong foot

359
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
You have to jump bravely

360
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You will be lost

361
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
and start over

362
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Master

363
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Master

364
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
You're very sick

365
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
My body is not as good as it is now

366
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
But Mrs. Dai told me

367
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
You have a fever

368
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I have to be careful

369
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Forget about it

370
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
She is not you

371
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I never thought you would be like her

372
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Master

373
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Master, President Chen is talking to you

374
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I'll be right there

375
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
If you don't mind

376
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You can go around and see

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why don't you want to compete with me?

379
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're just pretending

380
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
to be a pure white flower

381
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
and you're so shameless

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Whatever you want

383
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I can't tell you

384
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You're so shameless

385
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You only know how to seduce men

386
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You've killed the sixth child

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You want to harm master

388
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You dare to say it again

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I said

390
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You only know how to seduce men

391
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Who will seduce men?

392
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
How did you become Mrs. Dai?

393
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You're not a woman

394
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
You know how to seduce Mrs. Dai

395
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Yes

396
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Everyone looks down on me

397
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
In order to make a living

398
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I was a dancer for a few days

399
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
And I'm a low-ranking dancer

400
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Do I have to be watched by all of you for a lifetime?

401
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
No one is born a low-ranking dancer

402
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You're blind, aren't you?

403
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What are you?

404
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Do you know who I am?

405
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You dare to kill me

406
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What's wrong, Shen Yi?

407
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You're looking at her

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you know

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to fight for this kind of mess?

410
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You'd better shut up

411
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Today is the day of my show

412
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
I invited all the guests

413
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You're too low-ranking to be a woman

414
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
What did you say?

415
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Say it again

416
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
What did I say?

417
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
You can ask the Governor Zhao

418
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
If there's nothing else

419
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Goodbye

420
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Okay

421
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
All these years

422
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
I've suffered a lot

423
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Only Shen Yi

424
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
is willing to look at me

425
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
and protect me

426
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Thank you

427
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm sorry

428
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I've met a man

429
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
who dares to be a good man like you

430
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Am I wrong

431
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
to love him?

432
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I want to hold him tight

433
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
He's a man of high status

434
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He's never been an excuse

435
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
to fight for his love

436
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He even doesn't know how to do it

437
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This is the reason

438
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
why people really like you

439
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Is your love

440
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
really that pure?

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I love him

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I have money, status

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and conflicts with him

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I love him

445
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Do you have conflicts?

446
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I, Liu Ruyan

447
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
will not allow myself

448
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
to be a woman

449
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
who has no dignity

450
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
and no money

451
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I will not allow that

452
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
So

453
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
no one can be my master

454
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
I love you

455
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I love you

456
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I love you

457
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
I love you

I love you

I love you

I love you

468

I love you

469
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I love you

470
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I love you

471
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I love you

472

I love you

I love you

475
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I love you

476
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I love you

477
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I love you

478

I love you

I love you

I love you
