00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Master, someone sent a letter in the drawer.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is this Mrs. Shen of the Shen Family?

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She finally figured it out.

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Love is the most vain.

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Only money can be relied on.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The new machine will arrive at the port three days later.

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The business of buying a new machine to rebuild the park

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is not going to happen.

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But Master Shen is also a little bit out of power in the city.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Our people may not be able to stop it.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then let's make an exception.

16
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This machine is so rare.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's just right to let Jin Ye get a protection fee.

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, I understand.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We've arrived at the port.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've already asked Shaoqi to bring the men to unload the goods.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Master Liu, wait!

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The intelligence team has stolen our machine.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's Master Xiao.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The Long Ballad

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where is Xiao Ye?

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's the hurry?

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's inside.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you okay?

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Open the door!

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We want to see Master Xiao!

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Mrs. Shen, Master Liu,

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is the order from the Qing Gang.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's no use for Ye Ge to come.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The Shen Family has some face in the capital.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Have you ever thought about the consequences?

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Master Liu, I'll tell you the truth.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Master has already sent someone to the Shen Family.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is the personal affair between the master and the Shen Family.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It can't affect the capital.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
As long as Master Shen gives out the ransom,

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
everything will be easy.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Father,

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
why did we steal the machine

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
and detain them?

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have my reasons.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Just look after them.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But they are the Master and the Third Madam of the Shen Family.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The Shen Family is also one of the second family in the capital.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Instead of fighting with them,

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
why don't we sell them for the sake of our reputation?

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What do you think?

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know when you got close to them.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I did it for our own good.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We are all in Jiangcheng.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There are so many eyes on us.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's better than having more friends.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When did I decide to let you interfere?

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Just do as I say.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't worry.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Uncle, auntie,

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I know the location of the Qing Dynasty.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll find a way to save Uncle Jiu and Uncle Liu.

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't make trouble.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I...

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Master, don't be angry.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's urgent.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's think of a way to save them.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:23,580
I'll send someone to find Jinye with my

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's wrong?

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You are hurt.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's okay.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's just a small wound.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's nothing serious.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let me see.

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's all because of me.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's all because of me.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's between us.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I still owe you after all.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How can a partner do business?

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know I'm not talking about just one thing.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm willing to do anything for you.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I feel like it.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What should I do?

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Brother Ye,

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
brothers caught a head-over-the-wall.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm scared.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm scared.

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who let you tie him?

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let Xiu Jun and my Uncle Liu go.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get out of here.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why are you here?

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm talking to you.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you hear me?

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let Xiu Jun and my Uncle Liu go.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Be good.

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Does it hurt?

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My hand.

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Nonsense.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's red.

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sit there.

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you in a hurry?

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What are you doing?

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I know you're in a hurry.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm trying to figure something out.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sit there.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't touch me.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm a professional.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not a good guy.

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Is this the point?

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm telling you,

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
if you don't let them go,

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I...

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll never talk to you again.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let them go.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let them go.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let them go.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll let them go.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How?

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You...

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You...

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let them go.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't even count to three.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You think of a way to let them go.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is the gang.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The one who is against them is Jin Ye.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If I let them go,

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll betray the gang.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Although

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the key is with me,

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
but the thing is

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
he didn't do that.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you know how many people are out there?

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're all men.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They're all so rude.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You hit his back.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hit him.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He's blind.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's blind.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But there are dozens of men out there.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Even I

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
can't get through

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
without this key.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't even mention it.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hand grenade.

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Smoke grenade.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There are swords and spears and sticks.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Nothing.

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The gang's trick.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're a little girl.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're still following me.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm so smart.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can't even hit the target.

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm second.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm crazy.

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm so dizzy.

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
God bless you.

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please bless Liu and Xiuju

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to come back safely.

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
God bless you.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Please bless Liu and Xiuju to come back safely.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Although I'm not close with Jin Ye,

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
we never broke up.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why did he suddenly

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
hit my Shen family?

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Besides,

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
who leaked the news

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
about the robbery

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and the dock?

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You mean

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
they actually

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
colluded inside and outside

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and played a game together?

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Master.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How is it?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Jin Ye

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is not letting go.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He said that if he saw

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,620
the

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
two coffins

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
within a few hours,

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
this...

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Master,

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what should we do?

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Inform the other rooms

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
to send Zhang Shang out

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and gather the books.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll go right now.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Zhou,

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
take the car to the Commandery Prince's mansion.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If there's anything wrong,

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
we can only come to get him.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Master,

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
for me,

202
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
you broke up with the Shen family.

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm very grateful.

204
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Remember,

205
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the thing I taught you

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
is the most important thing.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
As long as you do it well,

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the whole Qing Gang

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
will be your back.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't worry, Master.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I won't forget it.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What are you going to do

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
with the machine?

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not easy to catch

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Shen Yanqing's life.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you don't take revenge,

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
how can you pay for

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the revenge of our two families?

219
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well,

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it's OK

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to ask everyone

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
who knew they killed it,

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but not all.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How interesting that

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
are the people who guys

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
blame the witness

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
for the whole policy of Qin's AWACS.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Found it easily.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
The according to your

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
understanding,

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Uncle Liu!

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Xiaoju, it's me.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Chi Lu, why are you here?

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Of course I'm here to save you.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Am I here to play?

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're the only one who did all the work outside.

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Of course.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll use a beauty skill to get Xiao Yi

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and get the key.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then I'll use a skill to get the fish and the fish.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll be the watcher of the world.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I'll take you to escape from the heaven.

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
All right, let's go.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Wait, what about those machines?

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If we don't care about losing the heavy ones,

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
we'll have to temporarily isolate them.

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But those machines are so big.

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's impossible to take them out secretly under the eyes of people.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Keep it safe.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Keep it safe.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Fire!

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hurry up!

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Fire!

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hurry up!

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Fire!

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hurry up!

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's go now.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hurry up!

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Go to the front yard to save the fire.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't go to the back yard.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't even hear you.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't even see you.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Back yard.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's go.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hurry up.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Brother Yi, is it accurate?

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The money has been changed into gold bars.

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The army has already called.

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Just stay at home and wait for my news.

271
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay.

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Master, you don't have to go.

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Brother.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Master.

275
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You...

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's good that you're back.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Did it hurt?

278
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did they do anything to you?

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No.

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No.

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And we took all the machines back.

282
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thanks to Master Six, Zhile and Master Xiao.

283
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's mainly Zhile's credit.

284
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If it weren't for him,

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Jin Yan would be on the front line now.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I wanted to praise you,

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but I'm really worried about you.

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If anything bad happens to you,

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
how can I explain to your uncle and your late parents?

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Aunt,

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm back in good health.

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm so worried about you.

293
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay, let's not talk about this.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Zhu,

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
prepare the food.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's celebrate tonight.

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay.

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
By the way,

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
tomorrow is the anniversary of my wedding with Xiu Ju.

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We should celebrate it.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's go to the city and celebrate it.

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay.

303
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
When I entered the city,

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Xiu Ju and Master Six

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
were holding sticks and potholes

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and almost hit me.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
They almost hit me in the hand of their own people.

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You two,

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
give me a glass of wine.

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes.

311
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So,

312
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Xiu Ju and Master Six are locked up together.

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Brother,

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
we are human beings,

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
not nobles.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can we take care of them so carefully?

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Am I right?

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Here,

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have to thank you.

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll give you a toast.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have to apologize to you.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't have alcohol.

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll drink it for you.

324
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Brother,

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
how about this?

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's drink alone.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But first,

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
whoever loses can't drink alone.

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Lose?

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I've never lost in my life.

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm waiting for your words.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come on.

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Come on.

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Come on.

336
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Slow down.

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Brother,

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can see that

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you are just playing chess with me.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You have to beat me to win.

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You are drunk.

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I won't let you win.

344
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you need to beat me?

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How can you beat me?

346
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You are losing.

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So you are anxious.

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't win me, brother.

349
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What did you say?

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Master Six,

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
don't say that.

352
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Say less.

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Master, stop drinking.

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How about this?

355
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Let's play...

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Dou Niu.

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Dou Niu?

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How about it?

359
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay.

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You never know how many times I've said it.

361
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Come on.

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are a drunkard.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Brother.

364
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Come on.

365
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Come on.

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Come on.

367
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Master.

368
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Master.

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Uncle.

370
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you okay?

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Brother.

372
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Uncle.

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Are you okay?

374
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You lost.

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You lost, brother.

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You lost.

377
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Get up.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Come on.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Come on.

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll beat you.

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Brother, you are bad.

382
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Brother, you are bad.

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Brother.

384
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What?

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You don't recognize me?

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You are different today.

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You are the same.

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You will be the same as me in the future.

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Master, you are here.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Boss Shang.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Boss Shi.

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My third wife.

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Boss Shi.

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is Boss Wang.

395
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hello.

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Boss Wen.

397
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Long time no see.

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Master Shen.

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
When did you change your taste?

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This dress and this design

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
are all the most fashionable in the world.

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I can't believe my eyes.

403
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
This is all the credit of my third wife.

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
She is young and lively.

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
She makes me younger.

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Master has a wide view.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But he didn't care about this before.

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This third wife is really good.

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Master.

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Liu.

411
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You should let go of some obsession.

412
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You should know

413
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that we brothers

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
can't have any complaints.

415
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you.

416
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Thank you for coming

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to my wedding with my third wife.

418
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You should be happy.

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Good.

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We will be happy.

421
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Boss Shen.

422
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You should be closer to your third wife.

423
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I will take a picture.

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes.

425
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

426
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Don't be shy.

427
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Closer.

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes.

429
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Good.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Keep it.

431
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's take another one.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I envy you.

433
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Madam.

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Good.

435
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Boss Shen.

436
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The Shen family has purchased western machines

437
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and upgraded the whole house.

438
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's a great achievement for Jiangcheng.

439
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What do you want to say?

440
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You asked a good question.

441
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But I'm afraid I can't answer your question.

442
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You should ask my third wife.

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
She is the real boss.

444
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
She has more right to speak than me.

445
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Good.

446
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Boss.

447
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The third wife's name is Xiuqu.

448
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
She should be known and seen by everyone.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's take a picture.

450
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Boss.

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Let's take a picture together.

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Madam.

454
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Sister-in-law.

455
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You stand in the middle.

456
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Come on.

457
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Come on.

458
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
One, two, three.

459
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Bastard.

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Tell me.

461
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Did you let them go on purpose?

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Why did you betray me?

463
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Since the first wife has a conclusion,

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I have no use in arguing.

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But I have two words to say.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You once told me that the Qing gang is loyal.

467
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I respect you.

468
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But you only deserve this.

469
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But you are innocent this time.

470
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You threatened the Shen family.

471
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What's the difference between you and those bandits?

472
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You...

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
One day,

474
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
one day, you will understand me.

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You will be punished for your crime.

476
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You will be punished for your crime.

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Zhang Ze, Si Shi,

478
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
take the sword.

479
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yes.

480
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Why are you like this?

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's all my fault.

482
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If it weren't for the tiger,

483
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
you wouldn't tell me, right?

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Why are you angry?

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not dead yet.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You can still smile.

487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Sit here and don't move.

488
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll help you with the wound.

489
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then you can see the doctor.

490
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Okay?

491
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You...

492
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Does it hurt?

493
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
No.

494
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Knife wound, gun wound,

495
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I've been injured in both arms and legs.

496
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I've been through a lot.

497
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It doesn't hurt anymore.

498
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You're still talking back to me.

499
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm...

500
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm in front of a woman.

501
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I can't just pretend.

502
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
What if you have a heart attack?

503
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You sound like

504
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm your man.

505
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I...

506
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I mean...

507
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Mom.

508
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I...

509
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay.

510
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'll go find a doctor for you.

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll take care of the wound.

512
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's so late.

513
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Where are you going?

514
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I...

515
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I...

516
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I just remembered

517
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
that there's a clinic that's still open.

518
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Why don't you wait for me here?

519
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll go.

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

521
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I...

522
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Mom.

523
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I...

524
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I...

525
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Why isn't she coming out?

526
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It's so early.

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I just finished my work.

528
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's snowing so hard.

529
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why don't we go back together?

530
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
How about it?

531
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's okay.

532
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I can do it myself.

533
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I know your worries.

534
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Wait.

535
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The rain falls, the clouds disperse.

536
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The tears are like thousands of years.

537
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,900
The red and yellow are like the

538
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,000
eyes that are about to blink.

539
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I look at the world,

540
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and all my loved ones are like a dream.

541
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
A bouquet of flowers is left behind.

542
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It seems like a thousand years have passed.

543
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
The world is full of twists and turns.

544
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's not often that love is broken.

545
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I can still be a perfect man for a hundred years.

546
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The rain falls, the clouds disperse.

547
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The tears are like thousands of years.

548
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The red and yellow are like the

549
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
eyes that are about to blink.

550
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I look at the world,

551
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and all my loved ones are like a dream.

552
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
A bouquet of flowers is left behind.

553
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It seems like a thousand years have passed.

554
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The world is full of twists and turns.

555
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's not often that love is broken.

556
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I can still be a perfect man for a hundred years.

557
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I look at the world,

558
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and all my loved ones are like a dream.

559
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
A bouquet of flowers is left behind.

560
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It seems like a thousand years have passed.

561
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The rain falls, the clouds disperse.

562
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
The tears are like thousands of years.

563
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The red and yellow are like the eyes that are about to blink.

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I look at the world,

565
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and all my loved ones are like a dream.

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
A bouquet of flowers is left behind.

567
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It seems like a thousand years have passed.

568
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The fate is running through your face.

569
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The ancient times have passed.

570
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The ancient times have passed.
