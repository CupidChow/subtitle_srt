00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The Shen Family

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
will be the richest family in Jiang City.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I will be in the capital

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
to marry into this golden dragon.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Shen Family

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Madam put the gold bracelet

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
into my wrist and said

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Master is very affectionate.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He will love you.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But the tail of his hair

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
still missed the bottom.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The beautiful porcelain vase

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
of the Shen Family

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The bride's father crossed the river.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The jade coffin

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that can be passed on

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
to generations of generations.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Master Liu

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you taught me to write the word freedom.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's even more important.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You said that the new school

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
can make me fearless.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Bow to heaven and earth.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But I still didn't dare to

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
break this heart.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Bow to heaven and earth.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yang Yuan, the first emperor.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I said I would teach my western dance.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Bow to the high school.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I just started.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bow to the high school.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I just started.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I just stopped.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sun Man Tang.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now the crystal blood you gave me

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is in the corner of my body.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The land is smooth.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's three times harder

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
than the Southern Mo Di Bai of the Western School.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Listen.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The Liu Su of the Western School is laughing.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Be careful that the bride

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is not hiding the rouge under her head.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The Liu Su of the Western School is laughing.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Be careful that the bride is not hiding the rouge under her head.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or the heart of the three people is bleeding?

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Long Ballad

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Episode 16

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Classmate, look at the hand-pulled handkerchief.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's made by yourself.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here, two of them.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Classmate, look at the hand-pulled handkerchief.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Here, two of them.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Classmate, look at the hand-pulled handkerchief.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Here, two of them.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Classmate, look at the hand-pulled handkerchief.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's made by yourself.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can keep it for a few days.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Classmate, look at the hand-pulled handkerchief.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's this?

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a lucky day.

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It means a happy day.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The lucky day represents love.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The lucky day represents the four seasons.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Did you make it yourself?

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How much is it?

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You like it so much.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Five of the same version, three of the same version.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
One more, please.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, one more.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mom's medicine costs 50 silver dollars.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if I can earn 50 coins a day,

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
it still takes 100 days.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But I can't afford to be sick.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hurry up.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Coming.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll pay for the medicine.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll pay for the medicine.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
49 coins are missing.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Master Shen donated his life to help school.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How many Han people in the school have benefited from it?

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm grateful for your kindness.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Five times the price of a brush and a chair.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In the future, the price of a chair is 60 yuan.

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
100 yuan for a chair.

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The price of a chair and a brush and a chair is three times the price of a chair.

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The price of a chair and a chair is three times the price of a chair.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The price of a chair and a chair is three times the price of a chair.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The price of a chair and a chair is three times the price of a chair.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This girl is very difficult.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She comes to the classroom every day after the school is finished.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She comes to the classroom every day after the school is finished.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We see her and we are angry.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's rare that she's in the mud.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But she's so stubborn.

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's more like my old Liu is not good.

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
She's wasting my hard work.

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yanzhou has a good heart.

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She will be able to be proud of her.

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I wrote the topic on the blackboard.

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please look.

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good for her.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to see what kind of blood she has.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
President.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello, sir.

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shen Yanzhou.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You solve this question.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What?

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you back?

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't mention it.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
How much money does she have?

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
She doesn't have money.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't talk nonsense.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How can you, a stubborn kid,

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
hold the family business of the Shen family?

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Again and again.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Every time, I'm like this.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm stubborn.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,980
Get me up.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Waitress.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Come on in.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,040
Tell us the answer.

164
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Baby,

165
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,960
I find your winning talent in math

166
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
is illustrated

167
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,080
more song.

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,720
Really?

169
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,840
How about

170
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
I allow you to attend school and have lessons when you know it?

171
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,680
But remember,

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
if you don't understand those things,

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
you must know let alone pay attention.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Six hundred yuan.

175
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,980
Six hundred yuan.

176
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,080
Six hundred yuan.

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Six hundred yuan.

178
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,520
Six hundred yuan, that's a lot.

179
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Really?

180
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,200
I can't believe that.

181
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,600
Where did she get this?

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,200
I have no idea.

183
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
That's right.

184
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,080
She has no clue.

185
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,240
That's right.

186
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,960
Young Master Liu of the Shen Family

187
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
is just like a little girl.

188
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
San None of you should Wo covet it.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,220
It is~!!

190
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
Where does the野丫头 storm from?

191
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,620
Let who come near you

192
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,100
assail my Sixth Prince in the first place?

193
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,640
I never intended tony hum an annoyy to someone.

194
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,940
Sir Cl tiene said

195
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,300
that everyone's hurts are some lukewarm words.

196
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,980
You...

197
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,020
Why are you running so fast?

198
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,980
Wait for your sixth master.

199
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,420
Sixth master.

200
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,660
How dare you stand in front of your sixth master?

201
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,020
Sixth master.

202
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,540
Sixth master.

203
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,620
You can't swim.

204
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,380
That... That's your mother's relic.

205
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,460
I can't swim.

206
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,260
How about you go down?

207
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,260
You little brat, you're looking for it yourself.

208
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,980
You...

209
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,620
Mother.

210
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,940
Here.

211
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,140
Drink the medicine.

212
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,460
One more.

213
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,620
Mother.

214
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,060
I've seen this medicine so many times.

215
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,220
The medicine is scattered.

216
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,940
I'll try to make money as soon as possible.

217
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,980
It's all my fault.

218
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,540
I've dragged you down.

219
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,540
You're my mother.

220
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,620
Why are you dragging me down?

221
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,700
Mother.

222
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,660
Look.

223
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm about to make enough money.

224
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,100
I knew it.

225
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,980
My daughter is the most capable.

226
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,180
Hurry up and hide it.

227
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,460
Don't let your brother and sister-in-law see it.

228
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,980
Hurry up.

229
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,020
What did you see?

230
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,940
What's going on?

231
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,340
You went out for a long time.

232
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,660
You're so talented.

233
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
I've been with you for so many years.

234
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,900
Does the Embroidery Bureau live here?

235
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,260
Don't touch it.

236
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,820
You brat.

237
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,340
Where are you going now?

238
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,220
This is my house.

239
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,300
Why should I run?

240
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,140
Give it back to me.

241
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,900
You care about this thing too?

242
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,620
How dare you?

243
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,980
You've been against me for three times.

244
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,820
What do you want?

245
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
What do I want?

246
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,180
Master Six.

247
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,940
Don't you remember?

248
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,060
You're allergic to chrysanthemum.

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,060
This girl is so good at it.

250
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,020
No wonder.

251
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,100
I'm not a good match for her.

252
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,860
My daughter.

253
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,300
Chrysanthemum is a lucky flower.

254
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,180
With it blessing you,

255
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,980
your life will be harmonious and smooth.

256
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,140
I'm willing to use my life

257
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,980
to make up for my mother's death.

258
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,300
A rotten flower.

259
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,620
Is it necessary?

260
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,820
You brat.

261
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,660
Don't hit me.

262
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,460
Who are you?

263
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,660
What did you do?

264
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,260
What do you want?

265
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,700
Do you still want to be in trouble?

266
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,020
It's Master Six.

267
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,860
You brat.

268
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,980
How much trouble are you causing?

269
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,540
Kneel down and apologize to Master Six.

270
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,500
Apologize to him.

271
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,180
I'm just answering Master Six's questions.

272
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,700
He's just asking others to take revenge on me.

273
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,260
You brat.

274
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
What are you saying?

275
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,740
He's just asking others to take revenge on you.

276
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm not that petty.

277
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,940
Yes.

278
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,100
Master Six is right.

279
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,580
You guys did it.

280
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,740
Fine.

281
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,700
You're no different from me.

282
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,860
You're really good at it.

283
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
You're really a fool.

284
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,180
I'm not.

285
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,900
But...

286
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,740
He lost the relic your mother gave you.

287
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,780
That's more than paying off.

288
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,660
That's right, Master Six.

289
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,620
What should we do?

290
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,380
Let him go.

291
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,100
Kneel down.

292
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,260
Fine.

293
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,460
It's not necessary.

294
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,940
I'm just a little girl.

295
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,460
Besides, he didn't do anything wrong.

296
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,740
Thank you for your forgiveness.

297
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,180
You...

298
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,460
Thank him, Master Six.

299
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,860
I'll thank you for this.

300
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,220
I won't owe you anything.

301
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,420
You...

302
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
You brat.

303
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,420
Are you serious?

304
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,500
It's getting dark.

305
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,540
It won't be easy to find him later.

306
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,500
It's almost here.

307
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,620
Let's just go.

308
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,580
What?

309
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,980
We're here.

310
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,220
It's not here.

311
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,340
Why won't we just go take a few shots?

312
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,260
It's all right.

313
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,060
Old Jin,

314
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,300
I already do as you want.

315
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,160
I promise,

316
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
you'll customer will have to submit to me.

317
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,340
Why are you so bald?

318
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,900
Don't you ever try to prove again?

319
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,220
Let's watch the fox.

320
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,200
read it together.

321
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,140
fu cuy.

322
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,300
The fox is here.

323
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,900
Shen Yanzhou. Shen Yanzhou.

324
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,100
Wake up, Shen Yanzhou.

325
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,300
Shen Yanzhou.

326
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,300
Shen Yanzhou.

327
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
You're awake.

328
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,700
Shen Yanzhou.

329
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,300
You won't choose to save me, will you?

330
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
I'll return the item to you.

331
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,500
I don't owe you anymore.

332
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,300
Now I owe you.

333
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
But I accidentally gave you a bouquet of flowers.

334
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
You left as soon as you came up.

335
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
It's very important to you, right?

336
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Actually, I understand.

337
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,700
The flower is for you.

338
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
It's like the flower is for me.

339
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
My mother passed away when I was born.

340
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
This is the only thing

341
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,100
she left me.

342
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,100
Thank you.

343
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,100
Help me find her.

344
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,700
And,

345
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
today's thing

346
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,700
is all my fault.

347
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,100
I shouldn't have touched your flower.

348
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,900
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,100
You're the 6th Prince.

352
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
You admit your fault?

353
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Didn't you say

354
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
you should admit your fault?

355
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Let's go.

356
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,300
You...

357
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
You should go back now.

358
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Be gentle.

359
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,300
Master is resting.

360
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,100
Don't bother him.

361
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,700
Okay.

362
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,100
After cleaning up the study,

363
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,500
remember to restore the original.

364
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,100
Yes.

365
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,700
And,

366
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
Master's favorite ingredients

367
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
must be prepared

368
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
before tomorrow morning.

369
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,700
Don't forget it.

370
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Madam.

371
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,100
Sister-in-law.

372
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,100
Sixth Brother.

373
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,100
Every time my brother comes back,

374
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
the house is like a New Year's Day.

375
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
I think

376
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
it's better not to come back.

377
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,300
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm not talking about you.

379
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm talking about you.

380
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
What are you talking about?

381
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,500
Your brother finally comes back.

382
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,900
Of course it's like New Year.

383
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,900
You...

384
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,500
Madam.

385
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,100
Sixth Brother.

386
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Nonsense.

387
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Sister-in-law

388
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
raised me up.

389
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,100
I'm the closest to her.

390
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm no different from my parents.

391
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,900
Why are you so sweet today?

392
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,900
Do you have something to ask me?

393
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Tell me.

394
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
I won't agree to it later.

395
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,700
I...

396
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,900
I have a classmate.

397
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
His mother is sick.

398
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
I don't need money.

399
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Can you arrange a job for him?

400
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,300
Classmate?

401
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,900
Female classmate.

402
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,900
Sixth Brother.

403
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,100
Are you

404
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,900
having a feud with someone?

405
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,900
I'm a man of my word.

406
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,300
Am I that kind of person?

407
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,300
I...

408
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
I'm so embarrassed.

409
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,900
It's...

410
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,500
It's about my face.

411
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,700
Fine.

412
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,300
How can you not give your face to Mr. Shen?

413
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,300
How about this?

414
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,300
You

415
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,100
take your classmate to the police station.

416
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,900
I'll take a look.

417
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Really?

418
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
Jinniang.

419
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
You arrange this.

420
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,100
Yes, Madam.

421
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,300
How is it?

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

423
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:35,900
Then...

424
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,500
I'll go.

425
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,300
Go.

426
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,100
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

427
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,300
Go.

428
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
This is done.

429
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Slowly.

430
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Be careful.

431
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,700
You're the embroidery bureau?

432
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
This child

433
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,700
is so attractive.

434
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,500
This garden

435
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,300
is the starting point

436
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,500
of our Shen Family's family.

437
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,100
Master relies on this family business

438
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,700
to make our Shen Family

439
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,100
able to stand firm in Jiangcheng.

440
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,100
Usually,

441
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
he's busy with business in the city.

442
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
But I

443
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,700
am alone in the countryside

444
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,900
guarding this garden.

445
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Because after all,

446
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,500
this is the root of our Shen Family.

447
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
By the way, Xiuqu.

448
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
You and I

449
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,900
don't know why we're so close.

450
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,700
Since you're introduced by Sixth Brother,

451
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,100
don't be polite to me.

452
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,700
If you have any work to do,

453
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
just tell me.

454
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,300
I don't pick any work.

455
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
I can do

456
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
whatever they can do.

457
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,700
Zhou,

458
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,900
come here.

459
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,100
This is the embroidery bureau.

460
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,900
How about this?

461
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Go to the bureau to have a look

462
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,100
and arrange for him

463
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
if there's any work.

464
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Okay, let's go.

465
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,900
Go.

466
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,100
Thank you, Madam.

467
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,100
That's all for today.

468
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Come early tomorrow.

469
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,900
Okay.

470
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
Little girl, don't go.

471
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,300
Master Six.

472
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
I'm sorry.

473
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
You...

474
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
Thank you for your kindness.

475
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Why do you always come back so late?

476
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,100
I have to sell flower skewers.

477
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,900
You like to do business?

478
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,500
Yes.

479
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,100
Every time I do a business,

480
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,500
I feel very accomplished.

481
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,500
It makes me feel

482
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
that I'm very useful.

483
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,700
I believe that

484
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
as long as I work hard,

485
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,700
my mother and I

486
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
will live a better life.

487
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Besides,

488
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,300
now I have the medical expenses.

489
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
It's worth it no matter how hard it is.

490
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,500
Achievement?

491
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
You come home so late every day.

492
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
It's not safe.

493
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,100
I'll send you home.

494
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,700
Let's go.

495
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,100
Let's go.

496
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
You don't have to come every day.

497
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,900
Be careful.

498
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,900
Xiaoju.

499
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,700
Come here.

500
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,900
What's wrong, Mr. Zhou?

501
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
This is not qualified.

502
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,100
This kind of bad orange

503
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,500
can't be used.

504
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,300
It's just a quality item.

505
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
It's just wasted.

506
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,100
The Shen family is a big family.

507
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,500
It's all famous.

508
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,500
This kind of orange

509
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
can't be used.

510
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,500
How to deal with these oranges?

511
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,500
Whatever.

512
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,900
People will be happy.

513
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm not a big family.

514
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,100
I'm just a small family.

515
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I'm not a big family.

516
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
I'm just a small family.

517
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,700
Whatever.

518
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,500
Throw it away.

519
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
I have to go back to work.

520
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,900
You dare to steal the things of the Shen family.

521
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,500
I didn't.

522
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:58,900
Go.

523
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't.

524
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
I didn't steal.

525
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,100
I really didn't steal oranges.

526
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,100
Hurry.

527
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,700
Master.

528
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Catch a thief.

529
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,900
Sir.

530
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,700
It's you.

531
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,700
Master.

532
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,900
I didn't steal anything.

533
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,300
Then what's in your bag?

534
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,900
These oranges

535
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
are not qualified

536
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,900
and are going to be thrown away.

537
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,900
The orange will become a bad thing.

538
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
Instead of throwing it away,

539
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,300
let them use it.

540
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,700
Since they are not qualified,

541
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
what's the use of them?

542
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,500
Bad fruits

543
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
can be used as fertilizer

544
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
and fertilizer.

545
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,500
Good fruits can be used to make juice

546
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,300
and can be used to make orange juice.

547
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,100
Orange juice?

548
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Yes.

549
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
I have it in my bag.

550
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
My mother taught me this.

551
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
It tastes sweet and sour.

552
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,300
It can be stored for a long time.

553
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,300
But it's really useless.

554
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,700
Master.

555
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,700
Can you believe me now?

556
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,700
Master.

557
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,700
I just heard from the workers.

558
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't be angry.

559
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I will discipline this little girl

560
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
in the future.

561
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
I will never let her

562
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
to be a grass and a tree in the garden.

563
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,700
The orange juice is good.

564
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
You can make more.

565
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
You mean

566
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,100
you won't punish me?

567
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
I don't need to punish you.

568
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,700
I just want to make it difficult

569
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,700
for a little girl for these useless things.

570
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
From today on,

571
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,700
all the oranges in the garden

572
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
can be handled freely.

573
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Thank you, master.

574
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
Thank you, madam.

575
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,300
Go.

576
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,300
Here.

577
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,500
Try this.

578
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
I will work hard in the future

579
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,100
to protect the garden

580
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
and repay you.

581
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,300
OK.

582
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,300
The Embroidery Bureau

583
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
His name is Xiu Ju.

584
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,100
Sixth brother is bothering me.

585
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,100
He wants me to introduce him to a maid.

586
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
I didn't know that Sixth brother would ask for help.

587
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
He is also interested in the side.

588
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,500
I heard that

589
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
the girl

590
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,100
has a hard life.

591
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
Now he is working hard to make money

592
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
to treat his mother.

593
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Master.

594
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,300
This year,

595
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,100
the first tea and orange in the garden

596
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,100
are all red.

597
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,100
I will pick one

598
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
and give it to you.

599
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,900
OK.

600
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Let's go, Madam.

601
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Be careful, madam.

602
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Be careful.

603
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,300
Thank you, master.

604
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Your foot is white.

605
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,700
It's OK.

606
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,700
Just a little injury.

607
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,500
Xiu Ju.

608
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
Are you OK?

609
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,900
Where is it? Let me see.

610
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,100
It's OK.

611
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
Just a little injury.

612
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
You have a foot injury?

613
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Go.

614
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,300
Brother.

615
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,700
I will take her to see the doctor.

616
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,500
Let me down.

617
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,300
It's OK.

618
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,500
You are really OK.

619
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,500
Master.

620
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,300
Master.

621
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
What's wrong?

622
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,500
Come on.

623
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,900
I picked one for you.

624
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,300
The biggest and sweetest.

625
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,100
Try it.

626
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,700
OK.

627
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,500
How is it?

628
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,900
This year's orange

629
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,500
is good.

630
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,900
It seems to have waited for ten billion years

631
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,700
It's hard to stay awake, it's hard to stay awake

632
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,300
A dream, a long year

633
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,300
The four seasons of love, fate is coming

634
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,700
The hard-to-fix gift and the sad story

635
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,500
are all in the past

636
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,300
If we meet again, it will be better than tomorrow night

637
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,100
The rain pours, the clouds disperse

638
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,900
Tears flow, thousand years

639
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,500
The red and orange are again in the dust

640
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
The eyes are quick to open

641
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,300
Counting down this world

642
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,500
Who will make the wish of lovers

643
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,700
A bouquet of flowers

644
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,900
It seems to have waited for ten billion years

645
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,500

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,700
If we meet again, it will be better than tomorrow night

648
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
The rain pours, the clouds disperse

649
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,900
Tears flow, thousand years

650
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,900
The red and orange are again in the dust

651
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,300
The eyes are quick to open

652
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,700
Counting down this world

653
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Who will make the wish of lovers

654
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
A bouquet of flowers

655

It seems to have waited for ten billion years

656
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,300
The hard-to-fix gift and the sad story

657
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,700
are all in the past

658
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,700
If we meet again, it will be better than tomorrow night

659
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,700
Counting down this world

660
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,700
The old days are like the old days

661
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,100
A bouquet of flowers

662
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,100
It seems to have waited for ten billion years

663
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,900

The hard-to-fix gift and the sad story

667
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,500
are all in the past

668
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,900
A bouquet of flowers

669
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,900
It seems to have waited for ten billion years

670
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,500
The fate is based on the face that is looking at you

671
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Like the old days, the smoke of the smoke flowers

672
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,500
Like the old days, the smoke of the smoke flowers

673
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,900
Like the old days
