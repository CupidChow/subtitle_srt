1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Jackpot好吧

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,520
No.

3
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,700
I have my problem.

4
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,920
But my husband-

5
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,160
and the same thing happened

6
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,580
are the loss of a happy family.

7
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,540
Be careful,

8
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,980
take rest

9
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,980
You care about me and run away from me.

10
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,620
All these things happened now.

11
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,180
I help you now

12
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,820
because you're from the Shen family.

13
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,060
You're my husband's brother.

14
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,060
We're responsible for the Shen family.

15
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,060
You're very good to me.

16
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,060
When you were in Nanyang,

17
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,060
my mother was ill.

18
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
Master died.

19
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
He died with me.

20
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
I was so worried.

21
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,060
I was worried about you.

22
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,060
I was worried about you.

23
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,060
I was worried about you.

24
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
I was worried about you.

25
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
You're the most difficult time in my life.

26
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,060
He's my husband.

27
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Don't you understand?

28
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,060
If you hadn't come back suddenly,

29
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,060
we would have lived a normal life.

30
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
Should I not have come back?

31
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,060
Should I die in Nanyang?

32
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,060
At least you'll love me forever.

33
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
You remember me before you die.

34
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
Life is precious.

35
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
Take care of yourself.

36
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,060
I'll end it here.

37
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Master.

38
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,060
Are you satisfied?

39
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,980
What do you mean?

40
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
You know I'm listening.

41
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,940
I was just pretending.

42
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
Pretending?

43
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
You heard so much behind the screen.

44
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,080
I was sincere.

45
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,460
You said I was pretending.

46
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,080
I have no guilt with Sixth Master.

47
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm sorry for Master,

48
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,120
for Madam,

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,540
for the Shen Family.

50
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
If you still don't believe me,

51
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
I'll kill you.

52
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,280
I can only prove my innocence

53
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,540
in this way.

54
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,500
What are you doing?

55
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,880
Do you think

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,380
I only want your body?

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Then I can tell you now

58
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,620
that I never want anything like this.

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,660
Such a long wait.

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I want your love,

61
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
your loyalty,

62
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,960
instead of being so soft and fragile

63
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
like now.

64
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,460
I can wait for you to be ready.

65
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
But what you've done

66
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,460
will only make me doubt

67
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,840
if I'm too nice to you.

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,500
It's not like you have no rules in front of me.

69
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,500
Since Sixth Master came back,

70
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,640
everything has changed.

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,140
Everything is a suspicion.

72
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
These days,

73
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,140
you've been trying to test me.

74
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,640
What do you want me to do?

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
I don't even know what I want.

76
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,640
Tell me what to do.

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,140
What should I do?

78
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Is it really that hard

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
to make you love me?

80
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Hi.

81
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
You mean

82
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
you're my little sister?

83
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,140
You're really my big brother.

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
What happened back then?

85
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Why did we

86
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
disappear for so many years?

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't know.

88
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
I just want to know

89
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
if it wasn't for the Shen Family,

90
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,640
we could have been happy together.

91
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,640
But Shen Yanqing used the trick of Xia Sanlan

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
and made us a family.

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Master,

94
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
how did we become like this?

95
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Why did Master suddenly want to come here?

96
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I don't know.

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
When did Master come here?

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Sixth Master.

99
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Sixth Master,

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
this afternoon at the end of the month.

101
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
I knew he wouldn't treat me like that.

102
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Now,

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Jinye and the Shen Family have made up.

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
They're like water and fire.

105
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
We're like

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
what's written in your play.

107
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
We're like

108
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Romeo and the Pearl.

109
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Romeo and the Pearl.

110
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Liang Shanbo and the Pearl.

111
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
We're almost the same.

112
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
It's like we

113
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
can't be together

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
but we have to be together.

115
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I've seen the tragedy of Sixth Master and the Embroidery Bureau.

116
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
I've figured it out.

117
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
There's no way out without a struggle.

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Love is to fight until the end.

119
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Shen Zhi Le,

120
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
since I had you,

121
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I don't want to fight anymore.

122
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I want to quit the Qin Gang

123
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
and marry you.

124
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Really?

125
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Really.

126
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
If Uncle

127
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
doesn't like our relationship,

128
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
I'm willing to fight for you

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
until the end.

130
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
If he doesn't like us,

131
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I'll take you away

132
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
at the worst.

133
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
At the worst,

134
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
we'll be cooked by rice.

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
At the worst, I...

136
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Cooked rice?

137
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Are you afraid?

138
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
I knew it.

139
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
You're just a wild girl.

140
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Shen Zhi Le,

141
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
are you trying to make fun of me?

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I didn't...

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Are you trying to make fun of me?

144
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I don't want to.

145
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
When have you ever been afraid?

146
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
I don't want to.

147
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,640
The autumn moon is gone.

148
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
The snow is falling.

149
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,640
The sea is frozen.

150
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
The flowers are falling.

151
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,640
The sky is blue.

152
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
The moon is shining.

153
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,640
The person is gone.

154
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
I asked you to come

155
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
to tell you a good news.

156
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
I talked to the boss of Nanyang

157
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
about a business.

158
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
The demand for the stock

159
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
has increased tenfold

160
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
in recent years.

161
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
The short-term profit is rich.

162
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
In the long run,

163
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
I can take over

164
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
all of Nanyang's markets.

165
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Master,

166
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
should we be more cautious

167
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
about this matter?

168
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
We have to take great risks

169
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
to order such a large amount

170
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
in advance.

171
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
There is also the pressure of production lines.

172
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
It's right to be worried,

173
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
but we don't have to.

174
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm going to take all the flow funds

175
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
and make a huge sum

176
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
to ensure the supply and supply of raw materials.

177
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
The profit and the risk are equal.

178
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
If you want to do a big business,

179
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
you have to take this opportunity.

180
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
All the funds?

181
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Brother,

182
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
this is not a business.

183
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
This is a good land.

184
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
Why are you still teaching me?

185
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
This is a good land for you

186
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
because you lack experience.

187
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
But for me,

188
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
I have experienced

189
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
countless tests.

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
This is a good opportunity

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
to get a good answer.

192
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Brother,

193
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
those so-called experiences

194
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
are not just for fun.

195
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Yes, Master Six is right.

196
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Master, we should...

197
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
All right, stop talking.

198
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I am the host of the Shen family.

199
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I have already accepted the order from Nanyang.

200
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
You can do as you want.

201
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Master, please think twice.

202
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
We can send someone to investigate

203
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
the Nanyang market

204
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
or negotiate with Boss Chen

205
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
to make sure that our business...

206
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Why do you always

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
stand in my way?

208
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
You are my Third Madam,

209
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
but you keep following me

210
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
and defying me.

211
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Where do you put my dignity and dignity?

212
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
It's because I see myself as a member of the Shen family.

213
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
So I think about everything carefully.

214
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
If you want me to be a good host,

215
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I will do it.

216
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
I will do it.

217
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
I will do it.

218
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
I can't do anything

219
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
but to see you

220
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
as a good host.

221
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I can't do it.

222
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
I want you to stand by my side

223
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
even if it's just once.

224
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Is it that difficult?

225
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I will give you everything.

226
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
I can take it back.

227
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
From now on,

228
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
hand over your business.

229
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
The Shen family's business has nothing to do with you.

230
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
You can be your Third Madam.

231
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
So in the eyes of Master,

232
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
you are the one who

233
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
is responsible for everything.

234
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
I am not.

235
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I am not.

236
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I am not.

237
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I am not.

238
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I am not.

239
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
You are happy.

240
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I am your host

241
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,640
or

242
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
at any cost

243
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
I can bow the veils from the Song.

244
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
I misunderstood you before.

245
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
And IOld of myself.

246
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,220
So you're against me..

247
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,460
You know I said I will earn what I deserve

248
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,320
And I can't do it anymore

249
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,520
Here

250
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,900
I just want to see you

251
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,840
Sword

252
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,820
stupid

253
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,580
don't go

254
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,020
You can't just sit there and do nothing

255
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,120
You're not going to come here

256
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,240
to talk to me

257
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,340
So I sent him tohis office

258
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,580
when we were talking

259
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,500
Actually it was a nice target

260
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,760
why

261
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,760
You are my sister.

262
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I can't stand you being wronged.

263
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Sister.

264
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Sister.

265
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Look.

266
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,760
This is our business card and seal.

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Our Han family business

268
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
will be handled by you.

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,760
You can try your best to show your ideals and ambitions.

270
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
This...

271
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Brother.

272
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Do you really believe me?

273
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I believe you.

274
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Of course I believe you.

275
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
You are the only family in the world.

276
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I didn't do my duty as a brother in the first half of my life.

277
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I just want you to have a happy life in the second half of your life.

278
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
But I only have one thing.

279
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Don't forget your family grudges.

280
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I want to avenge you.

281
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,760
But I also want to repay you.

282
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I...

283
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Sister, don't worry.

284
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,760
I will never give you up.

285
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,760
You just need to help me and Boss Chen in Nanyang.

286
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Leave the rest to me.

287
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,760
I have to get this big order from Shen Yanqing.

288
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Only in this way can we have the capital to fight against each other.

289
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
But I don't think it's safe.

290
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
It's risky.

291
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
And it's hard to predict.

292
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
I don't know.

293
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Boss Chen is very famous in Nanyang.

294
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,760
That's why Shen Yanqing is so confident.

295
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
But as long as the money is in the way,

296
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
it's nothing.

297
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,760
You have to be kind to others.

298
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
I can't betray the Shen family.

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Sister,

300
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Shen Yanqing caused our family to be destroyed.

301
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Our parents died in the Ming family.

302
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
We have been living together for ten years.

303
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,760
If your conscience can get through these grudges,

304
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
I will never mention it again.

305
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Please.

306
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
Please.

307
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Hello.

308
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
This way, please.

309
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Boss Chen,

310
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
if you order me,

311
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
I will be three times cheaper than Shen Yanqing.

312
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
What do you think?

313
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Okay, no problem.

314
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Good.

315
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Happy cooperation.

316
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Happy cooperation.

317
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Here.

318
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Okay.

319
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Thank you, Boss.

320
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Thank you.

321
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Thank you, Boss Han.

322
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Shen Yanqing, Shen Yanqing.

323
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Nanyang's order and Qu Yuan's order are all in my hands.

324
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Even if you are a criminal,

325
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,760
you can't go back to heaven.

326
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Boss.

327
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Uncle Zhou,

328
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
what's wrong?

329
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Boss Chen asked someone to burn the letter

330
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
and handed the order to Han Shijie.

331
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
He doesn't cooperate with the Shen family.

332
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Why so suddenly?

333
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
A few days ago, I went to the restaurant to ask for money.

334
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I happened to meet the Third Madam

335
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
and introduced Boss Chen to Han Shijie.

336
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I dare not to make any conjectures.

337
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I just told the master the truth.

338
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Impossible.

339
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Did you do something wrong?

340
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
How dare I make such a big deal?

341
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
There must be a secret in it.

342
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
It should be that the embroidery bureau has its own plan.

343
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Master.

344
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
You tell me or I'll tell you?

345
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I don't know what you mean.

346
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Kneel down.

347
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Even if I have to kneel down,

348
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
you have to let me kneel down.

349
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
You secretly gave Boss Chen to Han Shijie.

350
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Isn't it?

351
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Yes.

352
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
You revealed the details and the price of the order to him.

353
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Isn't it?

354
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Yes.

355
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
You betrayed me, betrayed the Shen family.

356
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Isn't it?

357
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
I didn't.

358
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Then what's going on?

359
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Boss.

360
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,760
We know what kind of person the embroidery bureau is.

361
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
He must have his own reason for doing this.

362
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Didn't you hear what he said just now?

363
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
I heard.

364
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
What's your motive?

365
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
If you tell me everything,

366
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
she is Han Shijie's biological sister.

367
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
She has already stood on the side of the Han River.

368
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,760
I have put all the money of the Shen family in it.

369
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm afraid the Shen family is going to fall.

370
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I...

371
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Brother.

372
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Master.

373
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Uncle Zhou, hurry up.

374
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Call the doctor.

375
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Master.

376
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Brother.

377
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Brother.

378
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Madam.

379
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Xiaoju.

380
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
I...

381
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
You are too much.

382
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
You'd better pray that Master is safe.

383
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Otherwise, I will never forgive you.

384
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Sister.

385
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
How is Master?

386
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Brother.

387
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
It's a fire attack.

388
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
The doctor said there was no life.

389
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
But I don't know when it will wake up.

390
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,760
I didn't think it through.

391
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
I've been acting so hard lately.

392
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,760
You don't ask me or question me?

393
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
I believe you.

394
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
You are not a person who is ungrateful.

395
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
You have your own difficulties, right?

396
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
No matter what decision you make,

397
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I will believe you unconditionally and support you.

398
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Your fate will arrive tomorrow.

399
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Once Master falls,

400
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I'll see who can protect you.

401
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
What are you doing?

402
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Let me go.

403
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
What are you doing?

404
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Let me go.

405
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Let me go.

406
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
What happened?

407
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
You even opened a ancestral hall.

408
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
You have disturbed the elders.

409
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
It's about the Shen family's 100-year reputation.

410
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Do you think it's a big deal?

411
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Shut up.

412
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
You are not a decent and serious lady.

413
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
You have no right to speak here.

414
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
You are a person who is ungrateful.

415
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
In this way, the Shen family is not so serious.

416
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Nonsense.

417
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
How dare you make trouble here when my brother is in a coma?

418
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
You...

419
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
The second lady is always threatening me.

420
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
And now, while the master is in a coma,

421
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
there is a crisis.

422
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
What is your intention?

423
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Everyone knows it.

424
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I have no intention.

425
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,760
I just want to share my worries for the master.

426
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,760
I have a love letter from our sixth master and third madam.

427
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I want to ask you to read it carefully.

428
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
This...

429
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Your Highness.

430
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,760
You just want to frame them by making up a love letter with an unknown origin.

431
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Are you so despicable?

432
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I am not stupid.

433
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,760
I must have been well prepared for such a big thing.

434
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
These two are the murderer of Xiuzhi.

435
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
They can testify.

436
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
That's right.

437
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,760
My sixth master and my sister have been getting along well.

438
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
They have been secretly communicating.

439
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
After he married the master,

440
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
he was afraid that something bad would happen to him.

441
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
He even tried to kill him.

442
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,760
He forced me to hand over all the love letters they had.

443
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Fortunately,

444
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
I left some.

445
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
There are all kinds of evidences.

446
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Third Madam,

447
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
speak to the ancestral tablet.

448
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Did you have any personal feelings with the sixth master?

449
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I have a love letter from my sixth master and third madam.

450
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I want to ask you to read it carefully.

451
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
I have a love letter from my sixth master and third madam.

452

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,760
I think of this world.

487
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Who will make a love letter like a dream?

488
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
A bouquet of flowers is left.

489
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,760
It seems to have waited for a thousand and ten thousand years.

490
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I escape from destiny.

491
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I run to welcome your face.

492
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Like an ancient dream, the flowers bloom.

493
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
What year?

494
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Like an ancient dream, the flowers bloom.

495
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,760
What year?
