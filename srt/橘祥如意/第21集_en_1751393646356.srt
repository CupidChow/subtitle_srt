1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What?

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You guys

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
also have something to ask me?

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Big brother

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Xiu Ju and I

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
really love each other

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please allow me

11
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I hope you allow me

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This illness is also a new life for me

13
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The diseases that have been left behind

14
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
should be completely solved

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I hope from now on

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can forget everything in the past

17
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you understand what I mean?

18
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But big brother

19
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can't force it

20
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Master

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We have made up our minds

22
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Please

23
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Look over there

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's your benefactor

25
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How are you going to deal with him?

26
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But big brother

27
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Xiu Ju is the biggest victim of this tragedy

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you can't even get through this

29
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Then your so-called love and courage are a trap

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't even get through this

31
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can't even get through this

32
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You can't even get through this

33
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're laughing at me

34
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you really think love can touch everyone?

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Forgive such a big crime

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I understand what you mean

37
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I should bear the responsibility

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if it's a thunder and lightning

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But if it's not

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even if it's a dust on my body

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have to take it away

42
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Big brother

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't look at me like that

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like I've committed a big crime

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I love Xiu Ju

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Xiu Ju loves me too

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Love is not a crime, big brother

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you have plenty of reasons to take Xiu Ju away from me

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In this world

50
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No one can defeat me

51
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Except you

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
One is my only brother

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One is my only beloved woman

54
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Only your betrayal can completely crush me

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you understand?

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I understand

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Brother

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you want to say that I'm a big traitor again?

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But you tell me

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is this theft?

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Is it theft for a man to marry three wives?

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is it theft for a lover who just robbed his brother?

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This marriage

64
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Was originally built on the basis of threat and coercion

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is this what you call theft?

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Brother

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But now it's been so long

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Shouldn't we look back?

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What will others see in the future

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What do you think of the Shen family?

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You will be like Wen Shen

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let people point fingers

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Must be afraid

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There is no place for the gods after this

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And the Shen family will also be accused of being in chaos

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The ancestors are fierce and the whole city is laughing

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sixth

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't think I'm just for myself

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm also protecting you and Xiuqu

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If you have no concern for this

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I wouldn't have died that time

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
People only know after they die

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Living

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Must do what you want to do

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
People who love to love

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Otherwise, it is not called living

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The internal organs

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Brother is sorry for you

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You want to divorce the old man

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He is your husband

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How can you do this

94
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, madam

95
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He is your husband

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Not mine

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Shut up

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You belong to me

99
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I belong to the old man

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You naturally belong to the old man

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Madam

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am not a miscarriage

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And not someone's belonging

104
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I am not a miscarriage

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And not someone's belonging

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am a person

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A person can control his behavior

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But only can't control his feelings

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have tried

110
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Also try to convince myself

111
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But I love

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not the old man

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You still love the old man

114
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The old man

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you still love him

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are so rebellious

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is called chaos

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You should know

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If this continues

120
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Not only you

121
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Our whole Shen family

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Will be punished by God

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Who do I love

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Before I married into the Shen family

125
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Madam is already very clear

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You and the old man have been kind to me

127
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I can sell my life to the Shen family

128
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But love is not forced

129
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Madam

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You want to kill me

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are my only hope

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Madam is grateful to me

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I dare to say

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Madam has suffered for a lifetime

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She has been guarding the Juyuan

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Buried everything in the Shen family

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But the Shen family is a gorgeous house

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She has also been taking care of you for a lifetime

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Rather than relying on others' love

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It is better to break the cocoon and revive

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
To make your own appearance

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Shut up

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't need you to tell me this

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Give me your hand

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are so rebellious

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So rebellious

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You are so talkative

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I see you dare to divorce the old man

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I see you still say you love the old man

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will beat you to death today

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Beat you to death

152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You are a sinner

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Beat you to death

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Beat you to death

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Madam, are you not leaving today?

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I haven't finished packing

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why should I leave?

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't bother me

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Get out

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to divorce

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But I can't live

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I am afraid something big will happen to the Shen family

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Master

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You are in pain now

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You feel sorry for me and madam

166
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And you are thinking

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know how I will deal with you

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right?

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Master

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I am sorry

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I am sorry

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I am sorry

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I am sorry

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's my fault

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am sorry

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You don't have to say sorry

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am here to ask you

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Have you ever

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ever had a single thought for me?

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Never

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
All my efforts

182
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In the end, I was moved by myself

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Master

184
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Your health

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Thank you for your concern

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I will do my best to treat you

187
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You never lied to me

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You never said you loved me

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now you are not

190
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
a kind of confession

191
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If only you could lie to me once

192
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It would be great

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I am sorry

194
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I owe you

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I owe you my whole life

196
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Is it true what you told uncle?

197
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Back then

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The bad news of Yanzhou and my mother's death

199
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
was that you and master

200
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
went through the most difficult

201
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and darkest days with me

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Master

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
loved me so much

204
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He was so kind to me

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He was so kind to me

206
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
He was so kind to me

207
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How could I not

208
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
have loved him?

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't want to be the third wife of the Shen family

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I just want to be the embroiderer

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You are right

213
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The Shen family

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
is like a huge cocoon

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No matter how gorgeous it is

216
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it is still a cocoon

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If we can resist the storm

218
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
it is to break the cocoon and revive

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If we can't break it

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we can only live our own lives

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Embroidery Bureau

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Life is short

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We have to live for ourselves

224
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Master, don't drink anymore

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Master, you can't drink anymore

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I know you are suffering

227
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's all my fault

228
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that I didn't manage the embroidery bureau well

229
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Master, I am sorry

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I am sorry

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I am sorry

232
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You are wrong

233
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I am also wrong

234
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You are wrong to force the embroidery bureau to close

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I am wrong

236
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I thought I could move him

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and even replace the position in his heart

238
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Now I finally understand

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Love

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
can't be forced

241
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I signed the divorce papers

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Now the embroidery bureau is no longer the third wife of the Shen family

243
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You take me to give it to him

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let them go far away

245
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to a place where no one knows

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I am a woman

247
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't let Yan Qing

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
help them

249
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, master

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is ridiculous

251
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You are the master

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and the master of the family

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You and the embroidery bureau became husband and wife

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your reputation in your life

255
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
can't be because of this

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Husband and wife

257
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have the name of husband and wife with the embroidery bureau

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I have never had a husband and wife

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I guess I am not his husband

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What?

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You and the embroidery bureau have never been married?

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I said that

263
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Go

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Go

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Once the divorce papers are handed over

266
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the embroidery bureau will never be kept

267
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
As long as they don't hand them over

268
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and hide the divorce papers

269
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
it will be a help

270
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
No one will know about the divorce papers

271
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
How can that be?

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They will never give up

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Besides, the master

274
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
will never hide it

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I

276
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I have a stupid idea

277
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Tell me

278
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In the end

279
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the third wife and the master

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
never get married

281
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So they can't stop thinking about each other

282
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You mean

283
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This woman

284
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
is really thoughtful

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If she can get married with the master

286
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
as soon as possible

287
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
there may be a chance

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Let me see your hands

289
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Does it hurt?

290
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You are a good girl

291
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I know

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Even if it hurts

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
you will say it doesn't hurt

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was really angry at that time

295
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So don't blame me

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I understand

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Madam

298
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But what I said that day

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
was all nonsense

300
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I think I understand

301
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
what you said to me

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But

303
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't have the courage

304
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
nor the luck

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Luck?

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You mean

307
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
the master agreed?

308
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If you have time

309
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
go say goodbye to the master

310
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I hope he will love you

311
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
with all his heart

312
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Come on

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Drink some smoke

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
to make up

315
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is it good?

316
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then drink more

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can do it myself

318
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You have to take good care of yourself

319
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What's wrong?

320
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Madam

321
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I feel dizzy

322
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's normal

323
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You are weak now

324
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Then take a rest

325
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Go to sleep

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm leaving

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Okay

328
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Go find a servant

329
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and bring the master here

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes

331
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What are you doing here?

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Didn't you get kicked out?

333
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You and your wife

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
are biased against the family

335
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You are fighting for love

336
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You are really a good wife

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't understand what you are talking about

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Don't be mad at me

339
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Get out

340
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I haven't left the Shen family

341
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And you are so anxious

342
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to treat me as an outsider

343
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's a pity

344
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I don't want to leave

345
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You have to let me go

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You want to leave

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm afraid you can't leave now

348
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What do you mean?

349
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Your embroidery

350
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is still dirty

351
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
by someone

352
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Now it's like a dead body

353
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm sorry

354
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm sorry

355
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm sorry

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What about Jisuke?

357
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And the old man

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is going to his room

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What do you think will happen?

360
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The electric fan

361
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
will be blown out

362
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What are you in a hurry?

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I haven't finished yet

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They were going to do this

365
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But I

366
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
have to mind my own business

367
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll be a good person

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
to help you

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Miss

370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Stop

371
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Send the old man to the guest room

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Well

373
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then

374
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Put this in Jisuke's wine

375
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What?

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You have to think it over

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You can't earn it for several lifetimes

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Take Jisuke back to the room

379
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
of the third generation

380
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Tomorrow morning

381
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
remind the old man to go and see him

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
When this is done

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You can leave the Shen family

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and live your life

385
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Shen Yanqing

386
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You care about your face the most

387
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I want to see

388
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
When this scandal gets big

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What's the face

390
