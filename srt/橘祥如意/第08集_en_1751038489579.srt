00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 15

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Master Shen, please come in.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're so kind and brought so many things.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come, come, come. Please sit there.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let me wipe it for you.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Master, sit.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Jiu Jue,

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you came to meet me.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please sit, please sit.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I saw you just now.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You were so bright.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You were sitting there

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
like a living Buddha.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You were so kind.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come, come, come.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Master Shen,

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to tell you something good.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's funny.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A few days ago,

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
my legs were so sore.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I couldn't walk anymore.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Today, when you came,

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
my legs were fine.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look, they're all...

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, okay.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's not talk about

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the official position.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Zhou,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
this is a little bit of my heart.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't let your father down.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or else,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
some irrelevant people

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
will take advantage of you.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Steward Zhou,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Steward Zhou.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sister, that...

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let me ask you.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Where's mother?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why didn't I see her?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mother...

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mother, isn't she

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
not feeling well?

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So I let her

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
rest in her room.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't worry.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We took good care of her.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's good.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's good.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Jiu Jue,

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you go.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let your sister-in-law

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
chat with me.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Go.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Master Shen,

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
welcome.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Welcome.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mother.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Jiu Jue.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mother.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jiu Jue,

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you're back.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Tell me,

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
how are you doing in the Shen Family?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Madam,

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Master,

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and Master Six

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
are all very good to me.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't worry.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Child,

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
it's all my fault.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If I had known

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that you were because of me,

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I would have just died.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I couldn't bear to sacrifice you.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
After all,

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you and Master Six...

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mother,

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
there's only one mother in this world.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Compared to your kindness,

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it's nothing.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, right.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Jiu Jue,

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
this is the money I secretly gave you.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Take it.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Make a living under the people's roof.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Help yourself with more money.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mother,

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
don't you know my daughter?

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She can be independent and strong in any way.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Besides,

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Guo Jiang is doing well in his business.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't have to worry.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's not talk about this.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I'm not here,

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
will they make things difficult for you?

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Didn't you see that?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm doing well.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's good.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mother,

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to hear you sing.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
When you were little,

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you worked in the fields.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I sat in the back of your house.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I fell asleep listening to you sing.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was so beautiful at that time.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I even dreamed of it.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at how old you are.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You still want to hear me sing?

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're a child.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll sing for you.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want to, I want to,

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to go to my grandmother's house.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Grandmother's house.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mother,

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
what's wrong?

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where did this burn come from?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's my fault.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I fell by accident.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did my sister-in-law do this?

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mother, tell me the truth.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Get in!

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're forcing me to do this.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll kill you if you don't save me.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't blame me for being cruel.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mother,

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
if you don't ask the Embroidery to take the money,

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll ask for the money.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Or I'll laugh at you.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mother, are you okay?

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Mother, let me help you up.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mother, the master of the Shen family is taking the Embroidery back.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you don't want to embarrass the Embroidery,

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you have to play this show with us.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're still human?

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mother is seriously ill.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't bear to lock her up in the woodshed and let her suffer?

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, sister, you misunderstood us.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The biggest evil of a person is not filial.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What you did is unbecoming.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, no, master Shen.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Xiaoju, I'll handle this.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I won't bother you, master.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll take care of it myself.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you doing?

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Go away.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sister, sister, sister.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sister, sister, sister.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let go of me.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What are you doing?

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You misunderstood us.

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm your brother.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sister, sister.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sister, what are you doing?

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What are you doing?

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Xiaoju, Xiaoju.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Stop it, stop it.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Xiaoju.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Master, can you do me a favor?

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is my mother's house.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I should leave if I cut them off.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why?

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm her biological son.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're still...

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Stop it.

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't think I had a son like you.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mother.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Get out of here.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Get out of here.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mother.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mother, don't be angry.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Mother.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You go.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Mother.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Xiaoju.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mother.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Listen to your third madam.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you hear me?

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go.

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Master.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't drive me away.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Master.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Go.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't drive me away.

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me go.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm your biological son.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let me go.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let me go.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let me go.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let me go.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Madam.

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Xiaoju, let's go back first.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll send someone to take care of your mother.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't worry.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Take care of yourself.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Xiaoju, you're a dead woman.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You made us homeless.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't think about the consequences.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Master.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is your mother okay?

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How is your sister-in-law?

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you for your concern.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If there's anything else, I'll go first.

217
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm so angry.

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Master Six used to come to Xiuju.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Their relationship is very close.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It seems that they often write letters.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you think they...

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why are you here?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is the Juyuan of the Shen family.

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Someone will drive you out soon.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're just in time.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let them see

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
the dirty things

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
of the third madam of the Shen family

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and the little uncle.

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Give it to me.

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This letter is really hidden.

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was so angry.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I tell you.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Your brother and I

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
didn't tell this to anyone

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
because of our friendship for many years.

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You want to get rid of me?

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not going to let you go.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to get rid of you.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you want to get rid of me,

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you have to get the money.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How much money can satisfy your greed?

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're so silly.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You want to threaten me with this?

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just give up this letter.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then we'll go to Master Shen.

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think he'll be very interested.

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Give it to me.

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Please come with us.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How dare you

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
to make a fool of yourself in the place of the Shen family.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're really saying that.

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You really love your sister-in-law.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait.

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Show some respect.

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you okay?

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay.

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I remember this punch.

262
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I have to pay more.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Master Six.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We can do this business with you.

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Five hundred silver dollars.

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You take the letter.

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Otherwise,

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you'll be the biggest joke in Jiangcheng.

269
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't be fooled.

270
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They are not guaranteed.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can give you the money.

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I don't have cash on me now.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to bother you to go with me.

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Master Six is so cool.

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't worry.

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll handle it.

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's go.

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Please.

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Come on.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How long?

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't worry.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't worry.

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll be there soon.

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Boss.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This...

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This doesn't seem right.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This...

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Master Six.

290
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Master Six.

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Aren't we taking the money?

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Where is this?

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't you want money?

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll find someone to burn more for you.

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Master Six.

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Master Six.

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We don't want money.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Master Six.

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Master Six.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We don't want it.

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll give you the love letter.

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How do I know how much love letter you have?

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What if...

305
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No way.

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Master Six.

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I only have this one.

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You can't go to him.

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll give you the love letter.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you tell others about this...

311
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Only the dead can keep quiet.

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Master Six.

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We'll get the love letter first.

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Master Six.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We'll leave the car.

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No comment.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We'll put the pressure on him.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Master Six.

319
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Master Six.

320
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you dare to harass Xiu Ju again,

321
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I promise you won't see the sun tomorrow.

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I won't.

324
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Get lost.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you, Master Six.

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We'll really leave.

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Go.

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Go.

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Zhi Le.

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I love you.

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Give me another chance.

332
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I only have you in my heart.

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Zhi Le, I love you too.

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Zhi Le, I love you too.

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I love you too.

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You.

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You.

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And you.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You and I are just acting.

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't bother me anymore.

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Love is something you can't force.

342
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Give me another chance.

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I know.

344
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Give me another chance.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I know.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Give me another chance.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I know.

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Back off.

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Back off.

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm in the casino.

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Not a love casino.

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you don't bet money,

353
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
get lost.

354
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Wait.

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Today,

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I happen to introduce you.

357
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is my true love.

358
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You can give up now.

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why would he do that?

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're trying to get rid of us.

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're trying to lie, right?

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's trying to fool us.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He's trying to fool us.

365
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He's trying to fool us.

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He can't compare to me.

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Your brain...

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is he just a young man

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
who's just a young man?

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
How dare you hold on to my love?

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're so arrogant.

372
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're so arrogant.

373
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're so arrogant.

374
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Look at this.

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is this the place you're going to?

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Get lost.

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's go.

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Was that your first kiss?

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You look down on me.

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Get out.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
How could that be?

382
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Get your hands off me.

383
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Captain.

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you okay?

385
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm fine.

386
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How did it go?

387
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I cut them off.

388
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I've taken care of it.

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Don't worry.

390
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
They won't use this to threaten you anymore.

391
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What did you do?

392
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Nothing.

393
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I just scared them.

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't mean to scare you.

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's okay.

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is our past.

398
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm leaving it to you.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Decide what to do with it.

400
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The past is gone.

401
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's all in the past.

402
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We're not the same anymore.

403
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We should let go of the past.

404
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And start over.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The End

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Master.

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why are you here?

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I heard that your wife is crying again.

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Are you okay?

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've sent her away.

411
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What's that smell?

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's just a hand-painted painting.

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm too embarrassed to take it out.

414
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's burnt.

415
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not safe to burn in the house.

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Leave it to the maid to handle it.

417
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay.

418
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Tomorrow morning,

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm meeting with Mr. Su from Jinxiu.

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And Mr. Smith from Xiyang.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Master.

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Master.

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Tomorrow is the birthday of the embroidery bureau.

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Tomorrow is the birthday of Mrs. San, who is 21 years old.

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But Mr. Su and Mr. Smith have already arrived in Jiangcheng.

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The End

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The End

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The art of drawing is the foundation of our family.

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to know it as soon as possible.

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The rules of growth.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I can help you in the future.

432
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Good.

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You've grown up.

434
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Brother.

435
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You came to see me.

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Tomorrow is the birthday of the embroidery bureau.

437
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm busy with business.

438
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't know if I can ask you to do it for me.

439
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Of course.

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Don't worry, brother.

441
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'll help you.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay.

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The End

444
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Propose marriage.

445
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why should I cry?

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Two people with different identities.

447
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
After many hardships.

448
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Finally, they are in love.

449
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You don't understand.

450
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay.

451
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
If you like it.

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll prepare a grand wedding ceremony for you.

453
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Who asked you to propose?

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I mean.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
When you're willing to marry me.

456
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That day.

457
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It will be the most beautiful moment.

458
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's your most beautiful appearance.

459
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll put a picture on each orange.

460
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let the starry night be our seat.

461
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let the starry wind be our companion.

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
In your favorite orange color.

463
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Propose marriage to you.

464
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you promise me.

465
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We'll get married.

466
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
If you don't promise me.

467
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I've been asking.

468
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Until you promise me.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll get married.

470
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll get married.

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000

I'll get married.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll get married.

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll get married.

525
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Come on.

526
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Come on.

527
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
under the perfect

528
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I...

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I know you don't like those fake hard-to-get things.

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But I don't understand what that girl in the paper said about Romantic.

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So I asked the sixth to help me with it.

532
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I hope you will like it.

533
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Master, I don't understand.

534
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't understand.

535
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't understand.

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't understand.

537
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't understand.

538
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't understand.

539
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I hope you will like it.

540
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Master, actually you can...

541
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You don't have to do this.

542
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's already a great honor for you to remember my birthday.

543
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I should do everything for you.

544
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, right.

545
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I prepared a small gift.

546
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I feel very happy when I see it.

547
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I hope you can always remember me when you wear it.

548
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
This is too expensive.

549
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I can't afford it.

550
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You can afford it.

551
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Here.

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Keep it well.

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Go and have a look.

554
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The lie doesn't mean a lie

555
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Only when you forget the past can you start over.

556
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Xiao Jin,

557
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
as long as you can be happy,

558
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I will be at peace.

559
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Let me stay in the sunny sky

560
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to protect you and me.

561
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The best summer...

562
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Master, why are you back?

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Didn't you go to Xiu Ju's birthday?

564
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Why isn't Liu Su there?

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Are you hiding something from me?

566
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What can I hide from you?

567
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I know everything about Xiu Ju and Liu.

568
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What?

569
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
How did you know?

570
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You really know.

571
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The fate is playing a game to conquer your face

574
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Like a flower that has no fragrance and no fragrance

575
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I look at this world

576
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Who will make the appearance of a lover

577
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
A bouquet of flowers

578
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It seems to have waited for ten billion years

579
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The fate is playing a game to conquer your face

580
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Like a flower that has no fragrance and no fragrance

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Like a flower that has no fragrance and no fragrance
