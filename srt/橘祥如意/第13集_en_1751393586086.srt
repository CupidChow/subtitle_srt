1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
z Z goodbye

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Brother Ye.

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You...

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're so rude.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just say it.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jin Yuan told us

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to sweep the cave tonight.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I see.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go when we're done

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
with the guys.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Wait.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't go.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Didn't you say

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you'd discuss the script with me?

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll be back after I finish my business.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not going to the cave.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to the cave.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll be back after I finish my business.

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What business?

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's none of your business.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're always talking about business.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You don't understand.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ye.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Listen.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What's important to me

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is what's important to me.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're not going anywhere today.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is this important?

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is this important?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is this important?

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Shen Zhi Le.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm a member of the Qing Gang.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have to go out and play every day.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I may not have a tomorrow after today.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're different.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're the eldest daughter.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Everyone is a good daughter.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can spend your whole life in a good mood.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't have time to play any love games with you.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you understand?

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then you just push out the Qing Gang.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I push out the Qing Gang and you support me.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I support you.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
As long as you don't have any opinions.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have opinions.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have opinions.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't ever bother me again.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How could you do this to me?

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Before, the embroidery bureau and the royal family made an agreement.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, one season has been made.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The result should be divided.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Since I started to make the embroidery,

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the total profit is 3656 dollars.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's three times more than the previous season.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, you're just a stone hitting your own foot.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The embroidery bureau is now out of the way.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're not the same old girl.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm afraid you'll be hit in the head in the future.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You don't want me to cooperate, do you?

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think you're not smart enough.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
These are the dividends of this season.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I promise you.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There will be more and more in the future.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Good.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mrs. Shen is indeed a businesswoman.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's the luck of our Shen family.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We are willing to bet.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the business card of the Shen family.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Good.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good.

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Good.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is a good dish.

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I just didn't feel it.

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's good.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's good.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's good.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't blame me for being cruel.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Master is mine.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't try to take it away.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's good.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hurry up.

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

100
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hurry up and save the fire.

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Master, what's wrong?

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The fire is too big to open the door.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Master, you can't go.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If anything happens to you,

106
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the Shen family will collapse.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't care about that.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't die.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't agree.

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Master.

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Master, what are you doing?

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Master.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Master.

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you doing?

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hurry up and save me.

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Master.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Master.

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Xiaoju.

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Xiaoju.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Xiaoju.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Xiaoju.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Xiaoju.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Xiaoju.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Xiaoju.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Xiaoju.

126
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How are you?

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Master.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hurry up.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hurry up.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hurry up.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hurry up.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Master, are you okay?

133
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Xiaoju.

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Xiu Ju.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's great.

136
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're finally awake.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you know you make me so worried?

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What happened to your hand?

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's okay. It's just a small wound.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm fine.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What are you doing up there? Lie down.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let me see.

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why is it so serious?

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll go find a doctor to bandage it.

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You just woke up.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't worry about this.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't worry. I'm fine.

150
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll ask Zhou to prepare some supplements tomorrow

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to help you recuperate.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll be relieved when you're awake.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll come back to see you.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yan Qing.

155
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What did you call me just now?

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Say it again.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yan...

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Qing...

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

162
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I like to hear you call me that.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you think

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll look good

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
with this hairpin?

166
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Of course.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You...

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll put it on for you.

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How is it?

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's good.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's good.

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
From now on, we won't ask about the past.

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We'll only look at the future.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay.

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We won't ask about the past.

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We'll only look at the future.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I hope we can

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
live a peaceful life.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll cherish you.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll cherish you.

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll cherish you.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You've given me enough.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's enough to make me happy.

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Not enough.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll never feel that way.

186
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I have a lot of places to show you.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you remember

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the specialties I found for you?

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want to hold a grand wedding for you.

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

195
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll get you married in a grand way.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not afraid of the cold.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The more the rain, the more the people.

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The more the people, the more they are.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm not used to it yet.

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're still here.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm not afraid of the cold.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The more the people, the more they are.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The time has come.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The ceremony can begin.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm not afraid of the cold.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The time has come.

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The ceremony can begin.

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The ceremony can begin.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Xiaoju, Uncle, Aunt.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Look who's back.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you can see through me,

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
there's a desert in my eyes.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you can see through me,

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
there's a desert in my eyes.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you can see through me,

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
there's a desert in my eyes.

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In the depths of the soul,

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
there's a maze.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The road of destruction

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
is covered with the leaves of the leaves

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that are left to bloom.

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The human race is separated

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
by different dimensions.

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who can cross the line

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and accompany me to see the end of the day?

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
In the darkness,

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the world is shaking.

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The sound of the flute is humming.

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The time is coming.

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The time has come.

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The time has come.

245
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The time has come.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The time has come.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The time has come.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The time has come.

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The people are locked up.

250
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They are not qualified to give up their lives for love.

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
In the maze of the world,

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
why do you have to be so careful?

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're the one,

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you're back alive.

255
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Maybe you're drunk

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and I feel happy.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll lock you up with my hands.

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
At the end of the day,

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll announce that

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you're back with me.

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll announce that

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you're back with me.

263
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
In the darkness,

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the world is shaking.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The sound of the flute is humming.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The time is coming.

267
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The time has come.

268
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The time has come.

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,460
The time has come.

270
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,460
The time has come.

271
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
The time has come.

272
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
The time has come.

273
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,460
The time has come.

274
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
The time has come.

275
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
The time has come.

276
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,460
The time has come.

277
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
The time has come.

278
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
The time has come.

279
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
The time has come.

280
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,300
You're the one who locked me up

281
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
I'll be your friend in the end

282
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,140
If you don't come with me

283
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,020
I'll be afraid to let you go

284
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,980
That's great

285
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,700
It's been a long time since the Shen Family was so lively

286
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,900
Don't you think so, Yuan?

287
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,420
Yes, Mrs. Cheng

288
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,700
How will this big show be performed?

289
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm so excited

290
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,500
When the ship was on the sea

291
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,460
Everyone fell into the sea

292
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,940
Fortunately

293
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,020
I climbed on an old lifeboat

294
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,340
In the boundless sea

295
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,420
I drifted for days and nights

296
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,260
Then I couldn't hold my strength

297
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
So I passed out

298
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,060
And then?

299
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,220
I shouldn't have died

300
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,780
The old lifeboat

301
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,980
Drove to the seaside of Nanyang

302
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,900
And was rescued by a local family

303
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,220
God bless

304
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,660
It's so good to be alive

305
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,300
There's something even happier

306
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,380
I heard from Uncle Liu

307
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,580
The family who rescued him

308
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,180
Is a famous trader in Nanyang

309
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,540
He won a fortune this time

310
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,940
And made the trade between the Shen Family

311
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,620
And Nanyang

312
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,180
Really?

313
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,300
Yes

314
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,740
In the future, the goods of our Shen Family

315
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,220
Can be handed over to him to handle

316
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,660
What's going on, Uncle Liu?

317
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,900
During my recovery

318
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,180
The family

319
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,740
Take care of me

320
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,500
As a first-time

321
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,100
I helped them deal with some business problems

322
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,740
They trusted me

323
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,060
They promised

324
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,740
Not only can they take over all our goods

325
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,020
But also take away the profits of Yicheng

326
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,540
Really?

327
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,580
Yes

328
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
You're so great, Uncle Liu

329
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,540
He's as good as you were

330
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,820
He's a single-man

331
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,900
And made such a big deal

332
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
No

333
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,660
Come on

334
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I want to propose a toast to you

335
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,060
First

336
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,540
I want to thank you

337
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,180
For your sacrifice

338
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,140
Second

339
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,540
I want to congratulate you

340
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,460
For the great work of the Shen Family

341
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,700
Thank you

342
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Come on

343
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Come on

344
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,060
What makes me happier

345
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,100
Is seeing you

346
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,180
So sensible

347
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,820
And more calm than before

348
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,620
Brother

349
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,020
Yes

350
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,900
I've been through a lot this time

351
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,940
I want to understand a lot of things

352
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,780
And I've seen a lot of things

353
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,900
Come on, Liu

354
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,740
I'll give you a toast, too

355
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,900
People say

356
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,060
You'll be blessed with a great life

357
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,260
I hope you can be as successful as your brother

358
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,980
And have a bigger business

359
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,060
Thank you, Sister-in-law

360
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,940
Master Liu

361
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,620
As the saying goes

362
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,300
We should live in harmony

363
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,780
Your life will be rich and noble

364
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,540
I'll give you this cup

365
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,300
Thank you

366
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,020
By the way

367
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,100
Xiuju

368
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,340
As your sister-in-law

369
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,700
You should say something

370
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Master Liu is blessed with a great life

371
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,820
This is a big deal for the Shen Family

372
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,900
Don't you think so?

373
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,860
Okay

374
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I'll give you a toast

375
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,740
Master Liu, I'm happy for you

376
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,060
And happy for the Shen Family

377
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,340
I hope you can be successful

378
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,260
And achieve your dream

379
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,340
Thank you, Sister-in-law

380
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,620
Great

381
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,420
We're all together today

382
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,500
We're happy today

383
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,020
Okay

384
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,660
Eat more

385
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,420
Okay

386
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,380
Come on

387
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,700
Eat

388
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,500
Come on

389
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,420
Eat more

390
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Thank you, Sister-in-law

391
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,260
Eat more

392
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,660
Thank you, Brother Li

393
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,100
It's better to eat at home

394
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,620
Master

395
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,140
I saw you drank a lot tonight

396
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,340
So I asked my servant to make you a bowl of soup

397
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,180
Master Liu, you came back safely

398
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,500
It's a big deal for the Shen Family

399
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,380
I think you're happy

400
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,340
So I drank two more cups

401
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,220
These two happy events are together

402
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,660
It seems that our celebration has been smooth

403
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,860
Seeing the look of Master and Madam today

404
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,700
It makes me feel that nothing is more important than family reunion

405
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,660
Come on

406
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,220
Come on

407
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,940
Old friends of the Shen Family

408
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,140
They all came back when Liu came back

409
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,100
You should drink the soup and have a rest

410
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,140
I'll go and light it

411
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,580
Come on

412
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,300
Love in love

413
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,580
I was so stupid to admit that

414
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,500
Love will always change

415
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,020
Proposal

416
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,060
What's so good about it?

417
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,820
Two people with strange identities

418
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,500
After many hardships

419
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,340
Finally, they are in love

420
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:09,940
You don't understand

421
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,180
The love we had together

422
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,740
Will never leave anything behind

423
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
Finally we forgive the fragments

424
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,100
A mistake is always too great

425
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,100
You are just like this by me

426
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Even thought to yourself

427
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,100
You promised to trust too much

428
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,300
In the beginning, you wereDRception

429
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,540
Killing one with a smile

430
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,180
Even the tears I shed

431
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,620
Those hurt'm girls

432
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,760
So I can learn to love

433
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,180
Than keep myself

434
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
He's familiar

435
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,520
with calligraphy

436
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,560
term death

437
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,920
Someone who's suffering

438
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,940
away

439
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,280
The erotic

440
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
words

441
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,860
the

442
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,700
animals

443
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,660
accident

444
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,420
Eureka

445
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,460
Thankicus

446
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:25,080
Yes.

447
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,920
Youzer sent Fuyuan back beyond the force.

448
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,920
I don't work all by myself.

449
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
Master, madam trust I'm loyal.

450
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,380
You trusted me.

451
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,740
And the workers helped me a lot.

452
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,460
I've checked the market in Nanyang.

453
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,980
The orange juice is selling well there.

454
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,220
I can sell it over there.

455
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,260
Since it's business,

456
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,460
let's go back and discuss it with Master.

457
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,900
Xiujun.

458
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,820
Zhi Le told me everything.

459
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,460
You agreed to marry my brother

460
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,780
to save your mother.

461
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,500
It's all in the past.

462
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,900
I'm just thinking

463
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
if I had known the truth earlier,

464
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,980
would all of this happen today?

465
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,220
Everyone said I was lucky

466
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,840
and escaped from the

467
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,580
Ghost Realm.

468
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,100
But I knew it only in my heart.

469
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,620
I was lying in the Old Life Hall

470
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,020
and drifting in the endless sea.

471
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,380
The only thought that kept me alive was

472
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,740
to come back and see you again.

473
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,540
But there are so many

474
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,300
ifs and buts in this world.

475
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Some people

476
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,340
have missed it.

477
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,460
They have missed it.

478
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,700
From now on,

479
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,380
if it's not about the Shen Family,

480
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,780
we two

481
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,900
should never meet again.

482
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,260
The world is like a dream.

483
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,260
Who will make a wish when they are in love?

484
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,700
A bouquet of flowers

485
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,740
seems to have been in responded for ten billion years.

486
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,820
Two lives will be suffering for the rest of one's life

487
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,980
while the beautiful dream has TM.

488
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,340
As love holy soap, four seasons a familiar death would be scary.

489
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,840
Be sure to check it properly.

490
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,980
The bitter sadness and sufferings

491
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,180
exist only in my heart.

492
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Of course,

493
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,820
he would be so lazy and godless

494
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,200
at work at the embroidery bureau.

495
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,080
Since you're here,

496
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,280
help me pick them up.

497
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,000
I understand.

498
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,200
Green tangerine is sour,

499
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,760
but it's hard to forget

500
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
if you have a bite.

501
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,200
These tangerines are delicious,

502
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,240
but it's hard to replace

503
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,000
the unique taste of green tangerine.

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,120
When your pocket

505
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,920
is full of tangerines,

506
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,920
you can't take them anymore.

507
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,200
Then you can throw

508
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,680
all the tangerines out.

509
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
Xiaoju,

510
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,960
as long as you're brave,

511
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
you can get everything you want.

512
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,680
But in this life,

513
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
you can't just think about yourself.

514
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,920
You're so...

515
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,240
You're almost like St. Mary.

516
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,280
Don't talk about me.

517
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
You're still the same.

518
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
You're a doctor, but you can't be a doctor.

519
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,560
I...

520
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,200
You're always talking about others,

521
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,600
but you're always talking about yourself.

522
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,240
You're so confused.

523
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm not confused.

524
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,760
Didn't you see the mirror?

525
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,400
Your dark circles

526
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,920
are almost like a panda.

527
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,280
You dare to say that

528
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,880
it's not because of the night,

529
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,040
that you can't rest well.

530
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,440
What...

531
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,160
What night?

532
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,360
Isn't that just a man?

533
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,760
I'm not lacking in anything.

534
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,080
How many months have you been drinking?

535
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
What are you doing there?

536
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,920
Are you listening to me?

537
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,560
Liu, you still like orange so much.

538
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,480
Wherever I go,

539
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,040
as long as I see an orange,

540
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,280
I have to cook one for you to enjoy.

541
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I like it.

542
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,240
If I like it, it won't change.

543
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
You're right.

544
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,360
I've always liked oranges.

545
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It won't change.

546
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,120
Do you know

547
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,600
if you want to have a good orange,

548
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,200
you must be skilled?

549
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,640
You must remove the weeds and insects in the spring.

550
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,720
After picking the fruit in the autumn, you must be careful.

551
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,720
You can't be lazy at all.

552
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,040
Brother.

553
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,680
Don't think I only like oranges and not the fruit.

554
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
You can plant a orange tree

555
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,840
at the same time as me.

556
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
Let's have a competition.

557
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,560
Whose tree is more beautiful and has more fruit?

558
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay.

559
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,680
What about the loser?

560
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
What about you?

561
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,640
You can't touch anything related to oranges anymore.

562
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
I'm going to be a good orange.

563
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm going to be a good orange.

564
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,760
I'm going to be a good orange.

565
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,160
I'm going to be a good orange.

566
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm going to be a good orange.

567
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,640
I'm going to be a good orange.

568
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,680
I'm going to be a good orange.

569
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm going to be a good orange.

570
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,160
