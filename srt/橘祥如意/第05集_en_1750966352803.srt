1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm your husband now

5
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Your husband is back

6
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,880
You have to ask first and then take off my coat

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
You

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Master is back

9
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Come over

10
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Look at my eyes

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
The most favorite thing to see as a husband is his wife's eyes

12
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
For me

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Just forget it

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Can't count

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,800
If he doesn't serve you well, he will make you suffer

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Look at me

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Ok

18
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Ok

19
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
That's it

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
It's over

21
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Can't end

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Your husband likes to read books and write in the study

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Handle documents

24
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
You as a wife, you have to accompany him

25
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Tea, salt, ink, red, and fragrant

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
You

27
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The embroidery bureau has always been smart

28
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I think it's better than what I did back then

29
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Really?

30
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
You haven't told the embroidery bureau yet

31
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
How long have you been like this?

32
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
20 years

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Then these 20 years, are you happy?

34
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Happy

35
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Happy

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm happy when you're here

37
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Now there is an embroidery bureau with me

38
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm happier

39
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Ok

40
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Then wish you all the best

41
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
It's better to have a short-term relationship

42
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
You have to remember

43
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Master is the one who is responsible for this

44
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
You have to remember

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Master is the one who is responsible for this

46
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
You have to remember

47
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Master is the one who is responsible for this

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Master is the one who is responsible for this

49
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I have something to tell you

50
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
We have nothing to say

51
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
If you don't want to make a scene, just come with me

52
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Come

53
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
How are they together?

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
And they are so close

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Did you see it?

56
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I saw it

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I also heard that Master Six and Third Madam were classmates

58
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Classmates?

59
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I thought they were good friends

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
They are the same age

61
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
The moon is black and the wind is high

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
The fire is strong

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You go and keep an eye on them

64
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm looking for Master

65
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Hurry up

66
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Let me go

67
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Let me go

68
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Now you can't even stand me talking?

69
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
What are you talking about?

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You are so different from your real identity

71
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
And my brother cares about you

72
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
It's like a knife

73
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's like a knife that is stabbing my heart

74
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Is this our ending?

75
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
We are like this chrysanthemum

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
We shouldn't have met

77
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
But we are entangled

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
It's a mistake

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Maybe it's the best choice for us to separate

80
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Can you let me go?

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
And let yourself go

82
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I can't let go

83
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
This is the first time we hugged

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
We promised to take care of the chrysanthemum together

85
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
And the second time

86
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I haven't asked you to dance the second half

87
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I can do anything

88
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll take you away, okay?

89
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Let's go to a place where no one knows us

90
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
And start a new life

91
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Can you stop being childish?

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Look at me now

93
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Don't you understand?

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
We can't go back

95
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
We can't go back

96
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
We can't go back

97
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I don't care

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
I only want you

99
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I thought it was a maid

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Master, look

101
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
It's really the third madam and the sixth master

102
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Meeting here

103
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
What are you doing?

104
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,800
The two sisters-in-law are alone here

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
The one who spent money

106
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Is not the one who is here to steal money?

107
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Shut up

108
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I want to hear them

109
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Master

110
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Master, look at her

111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
She is clearly guilty

112
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I think

113
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I'll tell the servants to tie up their dog and woman

114
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Stop

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I said, second madam, what are you doing?

116
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
First madam, why are you here?

117
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I want to ask you

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm rehearsing a play

119
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Why are you suddenly jumping out?

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Zhilu, what's going on?

121
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Uncle

122
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I asked the sixth uncle and the embroidery bureau to help me rehearse the play

123
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
It's on the stage

124
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
He messed it up

125
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
You are doing things in secret

126
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
In case someone wants to trouble him

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
The sixth master said he hated it

128
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
He still has a grudge against him

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I hate him

130
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
But I can't let someone else hurt him

131
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Remember, if there is a situation

132
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Go to the bureau

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
When they were talking

134
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
The third madam is not here

135
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Why did you become an actor here?

136
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I know

137
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
You three are connected

138
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Are you trying to fool me?

139
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
The best of the world

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Zhilu is my brother

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
The embroidery bureau is my wife

142
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
How can you make such a big deal to hurt him?

143
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Yes

144
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Let's go home

145
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Uncle, the bureau hasn't finished rehearsing the play for me

146
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
It's not big or small

147
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Call the third madam

148
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
That's all for today

149
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
What are you waiting for?

150
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Go back

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
The second madam is really a good cook

152
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
She only uses these dirty tricks

153
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay

154
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I want to see how high your sixth master is

155
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I don't believe you

156
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
You are really not a cat

157
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I don't believe you

158
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Since you are a woman

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Don't go to school anymore

160
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Don't go to the play

161
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Don't go to the play

162
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Madam, although I married into the Shen family

163
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
But I have my own dream

164
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Dream?

165
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Your dream is to be a father and have children as soon as possible

166
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
But that's yours, not mine

167
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Going to school is my last persistence

168
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
You want to take this off?

169
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
How is your mother's health?

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
She should be much better

171
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Much better

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I have to thank you

173
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
That's good

174
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I will keep taking care of your mother

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
But you have to understand

176
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
God gave you to me

177
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
It's like our fate is tied together

178
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Since I belong to the master

179
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Then you also belong to the master

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Understand?

181
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Madam doesn't even let you go to school

182
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
She always loves me

183
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I will help you

184
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
No need

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Why?

186
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You just accept your fate?

187
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Madam is a woman of the old times

188
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
She is conservative and strict

189
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
She has been a woman of the old times

190
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
She is a woman of the old times

191
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Did you really get influenced by her?

192
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I understand what Madam is doing

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I hope I don't have any ulterior motives

194
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
I hope I am obedient and obedient

195
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I hope I am like her

196
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
I hope I am like her

197
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I hope I am like her

198
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I hope I am like her

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I hope I am like her

200
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Then why don't you continue to fight?

201
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Because I understand everything

202
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
So I can't be suspicious

203
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Madam is not suffering

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
She has been keeping her heart

205
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
She has been keeping her heart

206
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
She has been keeping her heart

207
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
She saved my mother

208
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I have to repay her kindness

209
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I have to repay her kindness

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I have to repay her kindness

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Why do you do this?

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Look at the four corners of the house

213
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Do you look like a cage?

214
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
You have broken your clothes

215
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
You have broken your sixth uncle's thoughts

216
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Life is bitter

217
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Xiu Ju

218
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
This is for you

219
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Life is bitter

220
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
I have my own way

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I have my own way

222
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
He knows

223
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
If the butterfly can't endure the torture of cutting

224
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
It will become a dead cut

225
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,800
So there will be no chance for me to fly away

226
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
So there will be no chance for me to fly away

227
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I have a chance to fly away

228
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You seem to be afraid of me

229
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Master, why are you here?

230
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
The bride and the bridegroom are not in line with the rules

231
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I will teach you

232
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
What do you think?

233
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Really?

234
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Thank you

235
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
You don't care

236
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,800
The sea of ​​lust is scattered in your ears

237
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
The flowers fall into the sky

238
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
The water flows in the blue sky

239
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
The water flows in the blue sky

240
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
The morning has dawn

241
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,800
The tears are like people are gone

242
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Little uncle

243
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
The sea of ​​lust is scattered in your ears

244
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
This is for you

245
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Read a paragraph

246
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Let me see what you young people like now

247
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
There will always be someone in this world

248
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Let you touch your heart

249
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Experience this life

250
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Just like the hand

251
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
The soul will be deeply in harmony with it

252
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Co-compete

253
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
The most perfect palm

254
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Maybe

255
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Although only like fireworks

256
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Obviously fall in the moment

257
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Leave endless darkness

258
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
But in memory

259
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
It's always the most brilliant look

260
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I know

261
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
You don't want to be locked in the basin

262
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Anyway, one day

263
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I will marry you into the Shen family

264
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Let's take a bath together

265
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Work hard to bloom

266
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Xiujue

267
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Xiujue

268
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Xiao'er

269
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
What are you thinking?

270
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm envious of them

271
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Well written

272
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Young people have a special passion

273
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
It seems to you

274
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Is a bit older

275
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Age is not the age

276
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
But the mentality

277
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
You always surprise me

278
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
This is your most unique place

279
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Buddha's friend

280
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Let Xiuqu

281
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Beget the child of the master

282
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I eat and pray every day

283
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
That is the seven kings

284
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
This one thing

285
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I hope the master can be happy

286
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
He has love

287
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
He will love

288
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
He just doesn't love me

289
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Why?

290
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Why?

291
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
I have never believed

292
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
The more beautiful the hug is separated

293
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
The more difficult it is to fall in love

294
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Who knows

295
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
The sky in the dry sea

296
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Has become dark

297
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Not to mention the heartless love

298
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Good

299
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
At that time I was so stupid to admit

300
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Sixth master has a reward

301
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Be careful

302
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Reward

303
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Sing well

304
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Sing

305
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Sixth master, slow down

306
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Sixth master, wait

307
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I will come to thank you after removing the makeup

308
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
This play

309
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Already sang into the heart of the world

310
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
And I

311
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Is the world's first

312
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Big joke

313
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
No, sixth master, you can't drink anymore

314
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
You can't drink anymore

315
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Sixth master

316
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I know

317
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I can't wait

318
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I can't wait for him to know

319
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Sixth master, don't say

320
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
He is my woman

321
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
He took my woman

322
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Sixth master, don't say

323
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I said

324
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Thank you, sixth master

325
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I love you

326
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Sixth master

327
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Sixth master

328
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Are you really

329
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
No more good feelings

330
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
What did I do wrong

331
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
I can change

332
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Don't leave me, okay

333
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
As long as you don't leave me

334
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Don't leave me

335
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I won't go

336
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I will accompany you

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I will never leave you

338
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Okay

339
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Don't go

340
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Don't go

341
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Don't go

342
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Why are you here

343
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Last night

344
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Sixth master doesn't remember

345
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
What do you want to say

346
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I am a woman

347
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
But I always take a step

348
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Last night

349
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Sixth master

350
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
took my woman

351
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Sixth master doesn't want to admit

352
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Drink tea, Xiaoju

353
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Last night

354
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Did you have

355
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Last night

356
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Sixth master was in the second lady's room

357
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
What

358
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
You

359
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
I am a woman

360
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
What is the dignity

361
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Although your family is big

362
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm afraid no one can cover your life

363
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
What happened

364
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I said so much, I'm waiting for someone to pull you

365
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
I tell you, this is very shallow

366
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
What are you waiting for

367
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
What are you doing, pull her down

368
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Give her clothes, this is not decent

369
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Come down, come down

370
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Don't mess with me

371
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
What are you doing

372
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Master

373
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
What happened

374
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Master

375
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
You have to help me

376
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Last night, Sixth master asked me to come to the god's house to sing

377
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I was drunk and red

378
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I accidentally touched my body

379
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
For my reputation

380
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Please help me

381
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Please help me

382
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
What

383
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Sixth master, is he telling the truth

384
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Is it true

385
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Is it important

386
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Does anyone care about me

387
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
It's not like this

388
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Sixth master, don't be angry

389
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
I swear, it's the sixth master he seduced

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
It's better to communicate with the son of the play

391
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I think our sixth master is so noble

392
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I think our sixth master is so noble

393
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
You panic

394
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
You are always so reckless

395
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
You are so bold

396
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
You even seduced a woman

397
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
You have been humiliated

398
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Humiliated

399
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Brother, you forgot

400
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
This is the humiliation of our family

401
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
You marry a dancer, I sleep in the theater

402
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Who is more noble than us

403
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Bastard

404
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm a bastard

405
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
What's your name

406
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I

407
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
From today on, you are called Qu

408
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
As long as you are willing to be my wife

409
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I will not let you

410
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Be a concubine

411
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
The marriage of the four-leaf clover

412
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Disrespectful

413
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Lao zhou, open this hall

414
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
After the family law, beat him to the point

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Master

416
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Master

417
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Don't be angry

418
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
17

419
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
18

420
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
19

421
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
20

422
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
What should I do

423
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
This sixth master is really a stubborn person

424
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
He won't admit his mistake

425
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Master, can you stop beating

426
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Forget it, okay

427
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Wife

428
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
He is so rebellious

429
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I let you get it

430
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I didn't teach well

431
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,800
But master, you have to think about it

432
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
If you keep beating, you will break people

433
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
29

434
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Master

435
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Sixth master is not such a person

436
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
There must be some misunderstanding

437
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Master, don't hurt your brother's feelings because of a momentary anger

438
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Master

439
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
33

440
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
34

441
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
35

442
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Stop fighting, stop

443
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Stop, stop

444
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Sixth master

445
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Go

446
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Give him the medicine

447
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Sixth master, go back to the room

448
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Don't say it's my will

449
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Okay

450
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I'll drink the medicine first

451
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Then I'll let you apply the medicine

452
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
You still have me in your heart

453
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Right?

454
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
No

455
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Then you tell me

456
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Is it Xiuqu or sister-in-law who is giving me medicine now?

457
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm sorry

458
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800

459
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
