00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,654
Goodness! Hello.

3
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,031
Long time no see!

4
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,866
Hello.

5
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,578
I came to work earlier than usual
because I woke up early.

6
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,830
I guess this is what you call
a miracle morning.

7
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,708
You're not open yet, are you?

8
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,419
I spotted Mr. Choi's car
in front of the convenience store.

9
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,506
You know he hasn't been coming by lately.

10
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,175
I wonder where he went
after parking his car there.

11
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,556
Speaking of which,
my boss has been acting strange too.

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,642
It's way past opening time.

13
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,478
Mr. Choi!

14
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
-You forgot your belt.
-Hold on.

15
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,233
-Here--
-My belt.

16
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,943
Give me my belt.

17
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,487
Why--

18
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:59,160
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

19
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:27,063
THERE ARE NO CORRECT ANSWERS
IN LIFE, ONLY BEST ANSWERS

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,440
EPISODE 6

21
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,775
Look.

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,612
I had no plans whatsoever
to hide this from you.

23
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,489
But Mr. Choi saidâ€¦

24
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,623
It had to be a secret at all costs.

25
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,379
I mean, he said it'd be a huge problem

26
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,464
if people found out that he was tutoring.

27
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,509
He's neither the president nor a top star.

28
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,386
Why is he fussing about this?

29
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,223
As you already know, he's very--

30
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,809
Jeez. How ugly.

31
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,477
No.

32
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,521
You know how self-important he is.

33
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,316
He emphasized that no one
apart from my family

34
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,901
should know about this.

35
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,906
Yeong-ju.

36
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,368
Are you listening to me?

37
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,080
Please don't talk to me, ma'am.

38
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,999
I'm just an employee here.

39
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,461
From now on, I won't meddle

40
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,006
in your family affairs
and just focus on work.

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,801
So please don't cross the line
or address me casually.

42
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,555
After all, we're not family.

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,816
What do I do, Jae-woo?

44
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,027
She's going to sulk for a while.

45
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,739
The delivery!

46
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,285
Haeng-seon, the waffle maker
will be delivered today.

47
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,662
I wonder what time.

48
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,872
They usually deliver
either at 2 p.m. or 4 p.m.

49
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,792
I feel lonely.

50
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,836
I'm so lonely.

51
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,592
This is absurd
no matter how you look at it.

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,261
This is unlike you!

53
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,430
If it's because of their food,
I'll look for another place.

54
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,890
Or I'll become a chef myself--

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,892
It's not just because of her food.

56
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,188
It kept bothering me how she was
kicked out of the All Care program.

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,233
I get to eat,
and she gets to catch up on math.

58
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,276
It's a win-win.

59
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,195
Not at all. If people find out,
only you will suffer.

60
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,864
You're being quite pessimistic these days.

61
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,574
-What's wrong?
-What do you think?

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,909
It's because of you.

63
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,705
What's done is done. I don't care.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
Big whoop.

65
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,040
Mr. Choi!

66
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,128
At least put your belt back on.
You look weird carrying it around.

67
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,301
You know how fussy the moms here are
when it comes to their kids' education.

68
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,552
What about the students?

69
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,929
The online community blows up
when you just high-five someone.

70
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,972
But tutoring?

71
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,182
-If people find out--
-We won't let them.

72
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,060
Why do you keep jinxing it?
Are you trying to tempt fate?

73
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,147
Two people have already found out
within a day of your first class.

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,356
That's unbelievable.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,399
It is indeed.

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,404
There was an unpredictable variable.
Was I always such a lightweight?

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,282
Has it been that long since I drank?
I wasn't this bad before.

78
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,076
Mr. Choi.

79
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,371
I don't think this is right.
It's not too late--

80
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,416
Dong-hui, this is a private matter.

81
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,085
I'm using the personal time
I have after work.

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,255
Strictly speaking, it's not even tutoring.
I'm not getting paid.

83
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,132
It's a skill exchange.

84
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,675
-But still--
-Stop.

85
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,343
That's enough.

86
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,845
Okay?

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,103
What is it, Hyo-won?

88
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,487
Hello, Mr. Choi.

89
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,988
Is Chiyeolsucks at it again?

90
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,074
Yes, they posted on Skymom.net just now.

91
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,326
They just don't change, do they?

92
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,244
At this point, they're my biggest fan.

93
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,788
Why can't the police find them?

94
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,540
Because the user is using
an overseas IP address.

95
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,833
I'll look for another way.

96
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,961
They're trying really hard
but to no avail.

97
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
Wait.

98
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,715
I think you need to see this one.

99
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,218
It's quite heinous.

100
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,178
What's it about?

101
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,187
SKYMOM.NET
THE CURSE OF CHOI CHI-YEOL

102
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,526
Do you know why that student
who killed himself a few days ago

103
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,444
jumped off The Pride Academy's building?

104
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,696
The police are hushing it up,

105
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,825
but the student had a fight
with Choi Chi-yeol just beforehand.

106
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,745
What's creepier is that
this isn't the first incident of its kind.

107
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,581
Choi Chi-yeol may have
cleaned up his image now,

108
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,960
but he had a scandal with a female student
back when he was an assistant.

109
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,380
He was sacked from that academy,
and the girl committed suicide.

110
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:07,093
What's even more shocking is that
her mom died not too long after,

111
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,263
and the police suspected
her younger brother.

112
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,431
That's right.

113
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,977
Choi Chi-yeol was the cause
of that infamous murder case.

114
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,523
He's responsible
for destroying that family.

115
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,995
Hello?

116
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,372
Thank you. Goodbye.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,624
They removed the post.

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,673
The post was recent,
so the view count wasn't high.

119
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,593
And since Chiyeolsucks is known
to write many malicious posts,

120
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,927
people won't care.

121
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,182
Mr. Choi.

122
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,269
-Yes?
-Don't let it get to you.

123
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,855
Chiyeolsucks makes up stories
every now and then.

124
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,901
All right. You may go.

125
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,611
Okay.

126
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,296
THE CURSE OF CHOI CHI-YEOL

127
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,307
MURDER CASE OF A MIDDLE SCHOOLER'S MOM

128
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,277
NOKEUN-DONG MURDER CASE
OF A MIDDLE SCHOOLER'S MOM

129
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,698
ACQUITTAL BY THE SUPREME COURT
SHOCKS EVERYONE

130
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,411
Here you go.

131
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,122
-Cook the biji stew beforehand.
-I will.

132
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,833
You don't even use
artificial flavor enhancers, right?

133
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,460
You're truly a great cook.

134
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,296
Not at all.
I'm not the one you should compliment.

135
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,424
Ms. Kim plays
quite a big role in our food.

136
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,260
She's the best cook ever.

137
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,429
Ms. Kim has a perfect palate.

138
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,681
I see.

139
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,724
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

140
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,809
-Come again!
-I will.

141
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,352
-Have a good day!
-Thank you.

142
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,690
The waffle maker is here!

143
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,693
Haeng-seon, can I stop by our house?

144
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,361
I need to try it out right away.

145
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,364
If there's an issue with it,
I can exchange it for free.

146
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,490
And if I don't like it,

147
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,159
the Act on the Consumer Protection
in Electronic Commerce

148
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,161
says I must cancel my order within a week.

149
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,290
Okay. Go test it out right away.

150
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,041
Thanks, Haeng-seon!

151
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,460
Gosh, he's so excited.

152
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,255
He's going to be obsessed
with making waffles for some time.

153
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,173
Brace yourself to eat a ton of them.

154
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,262
Catch! Gosh.

155
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,348
-Hey! Do you want to die?
-Sorry.

156
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,728
My accuracy isn't that great today.

157
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,400
It's still nice to hear you talk.

158
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,821
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,197
Forgive me, will you?

160
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,742
The silent treatment is killing me.

161
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,329
I'll cook you your favorite
potato pancakes for lunch. Okay?

162
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,913
-Okay?
-Hey.

163
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,166
What's with you? Stop bothering me.

164
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,210
Yeong-ju, I'm sorry.

165
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,422
I guess I'm like
all the other moms after all.

166
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,842
Did you just smirk?

167
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,178
Here comes the final blow.

168
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,263
Stop it!

169
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,059
You burst into laughter! Oh, yes.

170
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,565
Hey.

171
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,527
Betray me like this again,

172
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,321
and I'm cutting ties.

173
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,614
All right.

174
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,784
I was in the wrong, so please forgive me.

175
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,119
And those pancakes?

176
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,454
I'll make them.

177
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,541
It's so nice to talk with you again.

178
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,210
I was suffocating earlier.

179
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:13,214
There's one thing
I've been dying to ask but didn't.

180
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,465
About that star teacher.

181
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,135
Why did he come out of your place
in the morning scantily dressed?

182
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,389
He wasn't scantily dressed.
It was just his belt, so don't exaggerate.

183
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,641
Exactly. Why did he remove his belt?

184
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,643
Was he giving extra lessons
after tutoring?

185
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,770
That was because he can't hold his liquor.

186
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,734
Stop giving me that dirty look.

187
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,445
What are you imagining?
I wasn't home alone.

188
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,324
So if you had been home alone,
you two would have done something?

189
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,160
You're crazy.
You're practically begging me to hit you.

190
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,747
Gosh! You're so disgusting.

191
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,374
Haeng-seon.

192
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,252
What--

193
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,004
What's wrong with her?

194
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,425
He just arrived.

195
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,676
One minute, please.

196
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,178
-Mr. Jeon, this is for you.
-Okay.

197
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,347
Jeon Jong-ryeol speaking.

198
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,741
I have class in 30 minutes.

199
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,535
Whatever it is, make it quick.

200
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,704
Remember what you said at the bookstore?

201
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,331
Was it about this?

202
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,084
NOKEUN-DONG MURDER CASE
OF A MIDDLE SCHOOLER'S MOM

203
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,629
You just realized that?

204
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,091
Does that mean Su-hyeon's brotherâ€¦

205
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,134
Are you serious?

206
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,264
Have you been living under a rock?

207
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,726
That case was
the talk of the town back then.

208
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,020
You weren't aware?

209
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,481
I was struggling in the countryside.

210
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,026
I heard about the case
but never thought it'd be about Su-hyeon.

211
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,823
After she died,

212
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,161
her mom went insane and started obsessing
over her younger brother even more.

213
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,872
In the end, she jumped off a building.

214
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,208
Her son was next to her,

215
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,502
so the police arrested him
for murdering his mom.

216
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,421
Luckily, he was acquitted and released.

217
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,134
Then where is he now?

218
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,678
I'm not sure. Wellâ€¦

219
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,597
I heard he went missing.

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,646
Ignorance really is bliss, isn't it?

221
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,274
The guilt I felt for giving you

222
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,069
the education director's number
continued to haunt me.

223
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,239
I shouldn't have picked up your call.

224
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,449
I should've thought it through.

225
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,284
I shouldn't have given you the number.

226
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,287
Then Su-hyeon would still be here.

227
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,830
So would her mom and brother.

228
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,250
Jong-ryeol, had I known
that teacher's intention,

229
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,918
I wouldn't have called you.

230
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,672
Forget it.

231
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,049
It doesn't matter anymore.

232
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
Whether you were aware of it or not,

233
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,888
to me, you're still an asshole.

234
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,434
Don't ever call me aboutâ€¦

235
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,352
Actually,

236
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,729
just don't ever call me again.

237
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,244
Mr. Choi!

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,705
I have a question.

239
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,709
Mr. Choi, I'm really having a tough time.

240
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,460
I just don't show it.

241
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,589
The kids at my school are too smart.

242
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,217
My mom even collapsed
after seeing my midterm grades.

243
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,761
She yelled at me
saying my life will be ruined

244
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,306
if I don't get good grades
for college admissions.

245
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,183
Look at your face.

246
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,895
Don't you feel bad and want to protect me?

247
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,149
Don't worry. I'm stronger than I look.

248
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,985
But to cheer me up,

249
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,112
can you give me that pen?

250
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,072
You always carry that around.

251
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,365
Sure. You can have it.

252
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,408
It wasn't expensive.

253
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,916
Hello, sir.

254
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,544
Don't you have a friend
at Jeonsin Foreign Language High School?

255
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,379
I do. Jeon Jong-ryeol, a math teacher.

256
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,380
Why do you ask?

257
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,926
Our academy is holding an info session
on foreign language schools,

258
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,803
so could you look into
their education director's number?

259
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,888
Wellâ€¦

260
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,975
Hey, Su-hyeon.

261
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,022
Su-hyeon, what's wrong?

262
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,857
Did you flunk your finals?

263
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,905
Mr. Choi.

264
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,333
My mom had given me worksheets
to work on before the finals.

265
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,962
But during the exam, I noticed

266
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,172
the questions were identical.

267
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,384
I turned in the test anyway,

268
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,137
but I'm so scared.

269
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,516
What do I do, Mr. Choi?

270
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,602
Is that why you wanted
their education director's number?

271
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,562
To leak the exam questions in advance?

272
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,356
I wasn't the one who leaked them.

273
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,900
I just helped Su-hyeon's mother
by serving as a bridge.

274
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
By using me and my friend as that bridge.

275
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,490
How could you do this?
This is a serious felony.

276
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,574
Do you knowâ€¦

277
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,661
how much pain Su-hyeon is in right now?

278
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,622
Admissions is just a process,
not the end goal,

279
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,458
-so why--
-I can't take this any longer.

280
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,460
How dare you lecture me?

281
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,922
Are you getting cocky
because I've been going easy on you?

282
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,009
Do you want to stop teaching
once and for all?

283
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,430
Threaten me all you want,
but you still need to fix this.

284
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,472
Hey!

285
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,266
I can't believe this.

286
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,061
Get out.

287
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,397
You're fired.

288
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,232
Move out of the dorm too.

289
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,650
Okay.

290
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,485
I will do that.

291
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,780
But if you don't fix this,

292
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,907
-I'll report you.
-Report me?

293
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,910
Be my guest.
What do you think will happen?

294
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,996
What's done is done.

295
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,915
She'll get a zero on the test,
and her mom will go to jail.

296
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,877
It'll be all over the news,
and that'll be the end for her.

297
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,920
Is that what you want?

298
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,756
Is it, you bastard?

299
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,762
You know she grew up without a dad, right?

300
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,058
Don't meddle in their affairs
and ruin the entire family.

301
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,768
Just get lost.

302
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,689
This is all her mom's doing.

303
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,509
JEONG SU-HYEON

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,723
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

305
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,976
You got fired because of me.

306
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,439
But Mr. Choi,

307
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,358
I'm so exhausted.

308
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,654
I wake up every single morning,

309
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,738
and I feel hopeless.

310
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,035
School is a nightmare,
and my house is a living hell.

311
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,372
I want some peace now.

312
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,168
But I was able to breathe a bit
thanks to you.

313
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,171
Thank you so much.

314
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,849
Su-hyeonâ€¦

315
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,769
Why?

316
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,981
Why did you do this?

317
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,616
Go home.

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,827
You have exams next week.

319
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
Can I justâ€¦

320
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,790
stay here?

321
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,561
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
JEONSIN FOREIGN LANGUAGE HIGH SCHOOL

322
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,063
What's this rumor
about the exam questions leaking?

323
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,858
Before Su-hyeon died,

324
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,485
she told her school

325
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,946
about the exam questions getting leaked.

326
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,491
The principal just swept it under the rug,

327
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,411
but all the students found out.

328
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,372
-Unbelievable.
-Tell me about it.

329
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,459
Sir.

330
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,256
You're Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

331
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,133
Right?

332
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,011
Yes.

333
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,184
Su-hyeon told me a lot about you.

334
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,270
She also said she took your pen.

335
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,524
I gave it to her.

336
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,693
So it's hers.

337
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,005
I'm done, Mr. Choi.

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,174
What?

339
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,301
The problem.

340
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,845
Right. Let's see.

341
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,309
You did well.

342
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,979
-Solve the rest on your own.
-Okay.

343
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,188
If you get stuck on any,

344
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,107
-we'll review them next class.
-Okay.

345
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,407
Are you done?

346
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,786
Did you talk it out with Mr. Ji yesterday?

347
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,955
Somewhat.

348
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,916
Right, your lunch box.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,544
I've packed a lot
of spicy marinated crabs.

350
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,672
Put the leftovers in the fridge
and throw away the ice packs.

351
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,590
-Okay.
-Here.

352
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,677
Mr. Choi, have this. I made it myself.

353
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,805
I bought him a waffle maker.

354
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,683
Doesn't it fill our house
with a European vibe?

355
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,477
Thank you,
but my stomach's not feeling well.

356
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,646
Really? I should've made porridge instead.

357
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,857
-I can make it in 20 minutes.
-No.

358
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,983
I'm fine.

359
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,693
I see.

360
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,777
Goodbye then.

361
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,822
-Get home safely.
-Goodbye, Mr. Choi.

362
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,334
I really worked hard to make this.

363
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,919
It looks scrumptious. Let me have a taste.

364
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,423
Me too.

365
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,721
Is it really good?

366
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,805
It's so tasty.

367
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,807
Uncle, you could sell this.

368
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,310
Yes. You definitely could.

369
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,936
Okay, I'll make some more.

370
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,818
Hey, didn't Mr. Choi look down today?

371
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,196
A bit.

372
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,740
Is it because of earlier?

373
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,118
It's burning--

374
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,870
Jae-woo.

375
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,541
So you think it's round

376
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,211
and made of either glass or metal?

377
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,129
Okay.

378
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,299
Please take another look
once I find a clearer photo.

379
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,009
Goodbye.

380
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,179
Gosh, you startled me.

381
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,263
What are you doing?

382
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,974
Why so startled?
What shadiness are you up to?

383
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,102
It's nothing shady.

384
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,061
Look at this.

385
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,562
This shiny thing.

386
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,107
I asked forensics about this,

387
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,067
and they think it's round glass or metal.

388
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,402
Maybe it's a small ball.

389
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,530
-A glass or metal ball.
-So?

390
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,949
Maybe this thing scratched his face.

391
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,494
Cut the nonsense
and write up the final report.

392
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,580
I better not catch you
doing something else.

393
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,124
Make it quick.

394
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,670
I swear this smells fishy.

395
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,419
I want the head too.

396
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,589
It's the tastiest for stew,
but you always leave it out.

397
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,926
WILD-CAUGHT ABALONE

398
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,137
How much is the abalone?

399
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,306
They're wild-caught, not farmed.

400
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,516
Exactly. So how much is it?

401
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,059
How much do you want?

402
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,312
Did you win the lottery?
You've been splurging.

403
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,480
200,000 won for 1kg.

404
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,775
What--

405
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,612
Where are the farmed ones?

406
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,872
You're going to add just one abalone?

407
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,708
It's not a truffle.
It's not just for the scent.

408
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,919
It's wild-caught,
so it's bigger than normal.

409
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,174
This is Andong sikhye.

410
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,218
It's a natural digestive.

411
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,970
I thought you rarely made this
because it was a hassle.

412
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,057
I didn't make much.
Can you put it in that glass bottle?

413
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,227
Jeez.

414
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,854
You talked about
cooking exclusively for him.

415
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,149
Have you decided
to become his personal chef?

416
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,151
From abalone porridge to this sikhye.

417
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,821
This isn't the royal kitchen.
It's a side dish store.

418
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,741
It's the least I can do
when he's teaching Hae-e for free.

419
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,076
Don't you know who he is?

420
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,203
He's a star teacher.

421
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,579
That's true.

422
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,832
I looked him up,
and he's way above tutoring,

423
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,459
regardless of the form of payment.

424
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,880
I don't know what's up,
but he didn't look well yesterday.

425
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,762
It seems after that whole belt incidentâ€¦

426
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,516
you've become more concerned about him.

427
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,475
Am I right?

428
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,645
Where are the marinated crabs?

429
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,147
I ought to rip out your tongue
with their claws.

430
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,274
You little brat.

431
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,405
Hold on.

432
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,366
The sikhye could go bad
if he doesn't refrigerate it right away.

433
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,671
Is he still asleep?

434
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,773
Mr. Choi, I'm sorry for waking you up.

435
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,568
I was worried you wouldn't
refrigerate this properlyâ€¦

436
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,159
Excuse me.

437
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,497
Thisâ€¦

438
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,595
I'll put it in the fridge and leave.
You can go back to bed.

439
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,975
Did he work until late?
He's still half-asleep.

440
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,315
How marvelous.

441
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,943
Exactly how big is this place?

442
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,616
It feels so empty for such a big space.

443
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,160
He should raise a few dogs.

444
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,629
Why is the fridge so empty?

445
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,589
There's nothing in here.

446
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,238
Nothing in life is easy.

447
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,618
Everyone struggles with their own demons.

448
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,038
Goodbye.

449
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,345
What?

450
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,604
What's wrong with this?

451
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,814
Wait.

452
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,698
I see. So that's how you open it.

453
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:04,909
I didn't want you to wake up,
so I was going to leave quietly, butâ€¦

454
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,802
What kind of man
just passes out like that?

455
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,103
Why does he have a sleeping bag
next to this comfortable bed?

456
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,735
I guess you can have it all
and still be unhappy.

457
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,895
Su-hui, she's the most
well-known tarot reader

458
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,397
-when it comes to college admissions.
-I see.

459
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,859
She's able to predict
the school's initials.

460
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,778
-Right.
-Her accuracy is almost 100%.

461
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,238
I've heard.

462
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,989
She must really have such powers,

463
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,116
judging by where she's living.

464
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,287
Countless influentials and VIPs
ask her for help.

465
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,288
Butâ€¦

466
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,082
you know me.

467
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,836
She only made time for us
because she's my sister's friend.

468
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,254
All right. Stop bragging.

469
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,713
Goodness.

470
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,343
What? Isn't that Ms. Nam?

471
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,596
You're right.

472
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,765
What is she doing here?

473
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,059
-Tell me about it.
-Delivery?

474
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,352
This early?

475
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,646
They only deliver for bulk orders.

476
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,939
Then why is she here?

477
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,023
Who knows?

478
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,531
By the way, did you read
what Chiyeolsucks posted yesterday?

479
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,534
-It gave me the creeps.
-Don't be absurd.

480
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,413
It's obvious that they removed the post
out of fear that they'd get sued.

481
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,498
-I asked Su-a about it.
-Yes.

482
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,960
She said Mr. Choi didn't argue
with Young-min that day.

483
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,962
The kid just acted out on his own.

484
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,465
The director of the academy
has been around for years,

485
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,010
but even he has never heard
of that scandal before.

486
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,636
-Really?
-Yes.

487
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,349
Does that mean that story
is completely fake?

488
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,852
That's what Chiyeolsucks does.

489
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:39,063
Successful people are always cursed
with the likes of Chiyeolsucks.

490
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,357
Hey.

491
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,361
Seeing how you're siding with Mr. Choi,
the All Care Program must be going well.

492
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,739
They're all top students, you know?

493
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,408
They're strong-minded,
and their teacher is excellent too.

494
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,621
By the way,

495
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,835
doesn't the All Care Program have
its own materials and textbooks?

496
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,755
Could you just share them with Dan-ji?

497
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,591
I'll treat you to an expensive meal.

498
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,011
-Hey.
-Yes?

499
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,263
At times, you say things

500
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,892
that make you seem less intelligent.

501
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,436
If we were going to share them,

502
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,814
why would our kids have gone through
the hassle of taking the level test?

503
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,573
That's rich, coming from
a no-name university graduate.

504
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,870
They brought the gimmari back! Let's go!

505
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,834
Let's have some gimmari.

506
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,087
-Come on.
-I don't like it.

507
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,171
I want tteokbokki.

508
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,547
-Come on.
-Let's go.

509
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,384
Let's go.

510
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,312
What is she working so hard on these days?

511
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,665
This is good.

512
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
-It's so spicy.
-Jeez.

513
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,965
I told you not to eat that.

514
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,342
-Here.
-Thank you.

515
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,719
It's super spicy.

516
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,470
You're so weak.

517
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:35,972
Give me that.

518
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,851
That's so spicy.

519
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm so tired.

520
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,774
Hi, Geon-hu.

521
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,693
I'm too tired to say hi back.

522
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,113
Is that tasty?

523
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,907
-Hey, Hae-e.
-Yes?

524
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,036
Do I really have to memorize
100 English words by today?

525
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,871
Yes, they're basic ones.

526
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,706
You need them for reading comprehension.

527
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,958
Hey.

528
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,836
There's steam coming out of my head.

529
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,629
I have a splitting headache.

530
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,298
Hey, she's eating.

531
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,925
Don't be a baby.

532
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,968
Just memorize them.

533
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,472
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,390
I should. Of course.

535
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,559
Of course.

536
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,145
There's one gimmari left.

537
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,068
This is good. Where did you get this?

538
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,069
Are you insane?

539
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,071
That was the last one!

540
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,449
Why are you so worked up about this?

541
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,659
-Spit it out.
-Spit it out?

542
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,037
-Spit it out.
-I can't do that!

543
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
Spit it out!

544
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,666
-Spit it out.
-There's no more?

545
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,051
What are you doing?

546
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,512
Why does Hae-e have this?

547
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,307
This is Mr. Choi's material.

548
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,684
How does she have
the All Care Program's material?

549
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,229
Did you lend it to her?

550
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,731
Or did she steal it?

551
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,025
It's mine.

552
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,193
I lent it to her.

553
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,070
What gives you the right to do that?

554
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,948
And what gives you the right
to rummage through her backpack?

555
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,074
Put it back before she comes.

556
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,659
Or should I tell the others

557
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,036
that you snoop around
when no one's looking?

558
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,181
Hey, Mr. Ji. I just woke up.

559
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,516
Mr. Choi, are you sick?

560
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,811
I'm feeling under the weather.

561
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,025
Do I have one CSAT repeater class today?

562
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,694
Did you read
Chiyeolsucks' post yesterday?

563
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:42,074
People should look into it
even though he's a star teacher.

564
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,869
But is the post even true?

565
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,831
Chiyeolsucks is a hater
who's obsessed with Chi-yeol.

566
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,499
That may be true,

567
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,752
but if you look at it,

568
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,630
I don't think he was
just posting baseless accusations.

569
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,798
After the recent incident,

570
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,800
Chi-yeol was the only one
who was interrogated.

571
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:05,223
But still, to say that he's the cause
of that murder is just pushing it.

572
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,891
What do you mean?

573
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,561
Her precious daughter committed suicide
after being used by him.

574
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,438
So of course the family would go crazy.

575
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,275
Choi Chi-yeol
basically annihilated a family.

576
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,028
If I were him,
I wouldn't be able to kill myself,

577
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,614
but I wouldn't be brazen enough
to continue workingâ€¦

578
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,950
-What's wrong?
-I have class.

579
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,785
Where are you all going?

580
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,212
Look, Mr. Choi.

581
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,172
I justâ€¦

582
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,569
Mr. Ji, it's me.

583
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,446
I don't think I can make it today.

584
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,449
Let's reschedule the classes
so I can take the next two days off.

585
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,993
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thank you.

586
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,292
Yeong-ju.

587
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,879
-When we used to train before our matches,
-Yes?

588
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,840
our coach made us do a certain exercise
to help us sleep better.

589
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,216
What was it again?

590
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,801
The sleep exercise? This?

591
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,220
That's it.

592
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,056
And then?

593
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,516
Then like this.

594
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,895
Right.

595
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,898
Shake it off.

596
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:26,989
Right.

597
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,118
Today's class is canceled.

598
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,378
NO EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY,
SUICIDE AS A RESULT OF ACADEMIC STRESS

599
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,841
Ganghyeon Station, Detective Division.

600
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:51,138
Officer, I hear popping sounds
outside my window every night.

601
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,226
It's so loud that I can't go to bed
for the life of me.

602
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,977
Is that so, ma'am?

603
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,315
But you should contact the local precinct
or patrol station for that.

604
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,609
This is the Detective Division.
We deal with violent crimes.metal ba

605
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:07,446
But someone shot and killed
some stray cats with metal balls.

606
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,573
Isn't that a crime?

607
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,867
Exactly. Those metal ballsâ€¦

608
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,997
Ma'am, did you just say "metal balls"?

609
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,629
Someone must have been
feeding the stray cats

610
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,882
because they've been
gathering around and annoying me.

611
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,511
But the popping sounds have been
getting on my nerves as well.

612
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,972
Was it last week?

613
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,306
Yes, it was.

614
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,934
I came out in the morning, and dear me.

615
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,311
One of the cats was already dead.

616
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,565
And another one
was bleeding and running away.

617
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,900
When did you first hear the sounds?

618
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,153
It's been a while.

619
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,615
At first, I thought some kids
were playing with firecrackers

620
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,617
and would stop eventually.

621
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,119
But I was wrong.

622
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,329
It's still going on to this day.

623
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,499
The sound is driving me crazy.

624
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,586
How did you know they were metal balls?

625
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,923
I once spotted them on the ground.

626
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,677
That's when I realized
they were shooting them.

627
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,264
But later on, they all disappeared.

628
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,891
I guess they picked them all up.

629
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,108
WOORIM HIGH SCHOOL

630
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,486
Isn't it great
to come to school during the break?

631
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,862
You get to see your friends.

632
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,282
Don't waste your weekends on your phones.

633
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,034
I can't stress this enough.

634
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,995
Your phone time and your grades
have an inverse relationship.

635
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,830
After the break,

636
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,083
the September mock
will be waiting for you. See you.

637
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,596
Hae-e, we need to talk.

638
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,972
-Okay. Hold on.
-Hey.

639
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,058
I finished memorizing.
Hurry up and quiz me.

640
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,644
-I might forget them.
-Geon-hu.

641
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,646
I'm talking to her.

642
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,147
I don't care. Don't talk to me.

643
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,399
I'm going to forget the words.

644
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,568
I said I need to talk to her.

645
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,403
Do it tomorrow.

646
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,740
Tomorrow is Saturday.

647
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,743
It's a bit much
to take up her time on the weekend.

648
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,664
Hae-e.

649
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,545
I promised Geon-hu first,

650
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,837
so if it's not urgent--

651
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,923
I can't even talk to you
if it's not urgent?

652
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,519
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

653
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,396
I'm done. I'm all ready.

654
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,149
Wait.

655
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,444
I need to pack and get changed as well.

656
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,821
We still have time before the train.

657
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,533
Look at him. He's so excited.

658
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,451
It's been a while since we last camped.

659
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,828
-I'll just pour it.
-Okay.

660
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,583
Mom, why couldn't Mr. Choi come yesterday?

661
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,792
Beats me.

662
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,378
He just texted
and said that he couldn't make it.

663
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,464
I'm a bit worried.
He looked unwell two days ago too.

664
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,966
You're right.

665
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,093
He did seem a bit unwell.

666
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,346
Hold on.

667
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:29,857
MR. CHOI, ARE YOU FEELINGâ€¦

668
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,693
Are you not done yet? Hurry up.

669
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,236
Stop rushing me!

670
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,487
Jeez.

671
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,490
-Hae-e, finish up while I get changed.
-Yes?

672
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,575
Okay.

673
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,578
â€¦is very popular.

674
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,748
Plastic wastes are heated,
and the fibrous tissues

675
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,001
are reprocessed to make clothes and shoes.

676
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,544
Compared to making new onesâ€¦

677
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,951
-Go! Hey!
-Go!

678
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,542
Everyone came out on the weekend.
This place is packed.

679
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,670
You're right.
Where should we put up our tent?

680
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,297
There's a fishing area.

681
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,217
Haeng-seon, let's go over there.

682
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,259
Sure, let's go.

683
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,553
I think there will be fewer people there.

684
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,193
What is it?

685
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,153
That's Mr. Choi.

686
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,865
Mr. Choi is fishing.

687
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,867
Right.

688
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,202
It really is him.

689
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,621
Chi-yeol!

690
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,582
Mr. Choi!

691
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,751
Whatâ€¦

692
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,130
-What are youâ€¦
-Hello.

693
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,259
Whatâ€¦

694
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:23,971
What are youâ€¦

695
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,516
Whatâ€¦

696
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:28,892
Wellâ€¦

697
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,065
You really don't want ramyeon?

698
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,280
Mr. Choi.

699
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:45,576
Didn't I tell you to just ignore me?

700
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,493
You did.

701
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,705
But it's not easy for me to ignore someone
who's right in front of me.

702
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,624
I was worried
when you canceled your class,

703
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,376
but here you are fishing outside.

704
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,921
You must not have eaten anything.
Come have a bite.

705
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
Come on.

706
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,052
Gosh.

707
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,805
It looks so scrumptious.

708
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,225
That's hot.

709
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,061
Haeng-seon, Hae-e's ramyeon
tastes better than yours.

710
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
That's true.

711
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,607
Hers is tastier.

712
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,072
This is so delicious.

713
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,581
Did you catch one?
Haeng-seon, he caught one!

714
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,499
No way.

715
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,553
Why did you let it go?

716
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,599
It's too small.
I'm letting it grow bigger.

717
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
You're so cool.

718
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,469
I'm not in Seoul.

719
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,097
What? Where are you?

720
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,474
I'm at a camping site.
There's a fishing area too.

721
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,060
Camping, all of a sudden?

722
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:39,690
JANG DAN-JI

723
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,611
JANG DAN-JI: THAT SOUNDS FUN. I'M JEALOUS.

724
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,905
I'm working as a maid here.

725
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,490
I'm still so jealous.

726
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,952
I'm at a study cafe. Save me.

727
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,750
NAM HAE-E

728
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,213
I'm so childish for being jealous.

729
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,180
Lucky you.

730
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,807
Relax while you're there.

731
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
Hui-jae.

732
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,566
What are you doing?

733
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,072
Hui-jae.

734
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,158
Do you need money?

735
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,623
I have some.

736
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,509
By the way, why do you need it?

737
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,238
Hae-e and Jae-woo are washing the dishes.

738
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,324
That's their job whenever we go camping.

739
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,827
I don't hear any music.

740
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,538
Have some coffee.

741
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,540
I don't drink instant coffee.

742
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,211
This isn't just any instant coffee.
I blended it myself.

743
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,295
Take a sip.

744
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,632
How do you even blend instant coffee?

745
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,768
How did you do it?

746
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,188
It's instant coffee.

747
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,941
The tastiest coffee is made
by big companies.

748
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,192
Trust me on that.

749
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,865
I have a question.

750
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,076
Ms. Namgoong Seon.

751
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,662
Jeez. You even got my surname wrong.

752
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,038
It's Nam Haeng-seon.

753
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,708
It's not Ho Nam-seon or Nam Haeng-sun.

754
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,543
And it's definitely not Namgoong Seon.

755
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,211
Shouldn't you know my name by now?

756
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,505
I'm not good with names.

757
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,631
Okay.

758
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,466
Ms. Nam Haeng-seon.

759
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,303
Is it your hobby to cross boundaries?
I'm genuinely curious.

760
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,057
It runs in the family.

761
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,560
My mom used to be the nosy type.

762
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,272
Then what about you?

763
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,233
Isn't it tiring to always draw the line?

764
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,235
Isn't the opposite more tiring?

765
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,739
-Jeez, you always have the last word.
-Gosh.

766
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,409
Isn't it nice to drink some coffee?

767
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,164
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

768
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,796
What is it this time?

769
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,381
Is something bothering you again?

770
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,678
Someone I knew said
the exact same thing in the past.

771
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,430
Who?

772
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,141
Your first love?

773
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,104
She was my savior
who fed me when things were tough.

774
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,691
I see. But now I'm the one feeding you.

775
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,986
This is making me competitive.
I should try harder.

776
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,281
By the way,

777
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,492
why did you cancel yesterday?

778
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,577
You're crossing my boundaries again.

779
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,664
It seems like you have a lot on your mind.

780
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,752
Maybe your head is too full of
difficult math questions.

781
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,505
I take a nap when I'm stressed,
and my mind clears out.

782
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,258
But math is black and white.

783
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,385
There's always an answer.

784
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,222
But my life isn't like that.

785
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,475
There are no set formulas or rules.

786
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,855
Every time I make a mistake,
I become dispirited.

787
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,358
But stillâ€¦

788
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,861
you become that much closer to the answer.

789
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,115
Take handball for example.

790
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,285
If this angle doesn't work,
you change angles.

791
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,289
If your throw is weak,
you switch up the muscles you use.

792
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,917
That's how you improve your success rate.

793
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,502
That's life.

794
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,672
We're all fumbling for the answers.

795
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,508
We try out different approaches.

796
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,471
Don't overcomplicate things.
No wonder you have insomnia.

797
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,057
How did you know I have insomnia?

798
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,772
You're obviously very sharp,

799
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,108
so it was just a deduction.

800
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,651
I'm sensitive, not sharp.

801
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,113
A sharp person is sensitive
and vice versa.

802
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,240
Anyway.

803
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,743
I should turn on some music.

804
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:06,224
Promise me

805
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:10,478
That you will protect me

806
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:16,902
Tonight

807
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,160
Right. Mr. Choi, get up.

808
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,203
-Why?
-Just do it. I'll teach you something.

809
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,705
What is it?

810
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,833
This is something national athletes do
to sleep better.

811
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,418
Follow me.

812
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,714
Like this.

813
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:39,966
Move your arms.

814
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,096
What is this?

815
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,641
Good. Legs shoulder width apart.

816
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
Raise your arms.

817
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,232
Like this.

818
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,317
I'm doing it.

819
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,362
Raise your arms up to here.

820
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,113
Up to here.

821
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,867
Your shoulders--

822
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,203
Oh, no!

823
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,669
I sincerely apologize.

824
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,421
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

825
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,678
Haeng-seon.

826
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,221
What happened, Mom?

827
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,724
Are you okay?

828
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,483
So cold.

829
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,196
Whatâ€¦

830
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,324
Gosh, that's cold.

831
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,256
Have some tangerines, Chi-yeol.

832
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,676
Why so polite? Am I older than you?

833
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,720
Yes, I looked you up online.

834
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,513
You're one year my senior, Chi-yeol.

835
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,352
No, thank you. I don't like sour food.

836
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,437
Okay.

837
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,939
I love your car, Chi-yeol.

838
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,527
The interface is spectacular,
and the seams look very professional.

839
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,654
A smooth ride like this

840
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,657
should have either a multi-link
or a double wishbone suspension.

841
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,911
But this is my first time
experiencing this, so I'm not sure.

842
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,662
The dashcam is built-in,

843
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,248
and you can connect it
to your phone, Chi-yeol.

844
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,334
Hey, smarty-pants.

845
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,252
Why don't you just eat the tangerines?

846
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,421
You're being awfully chatty.

847
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,673
Okay, Haeng-seon.

848
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,137
The weather is warm enough, right?

849
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,847
I doubt you'll catch a cold.

850
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,518
I see. Did you push me
so that I could cool down?

851
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,894
I'm so touched.

852
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,065
Nevertheless, thank you
for offering to drive us home.

853
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,400
Your house is on the way anyway.

854
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,570
You can sleep if you're tired.

855
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,114
That's not right.

856
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,449
It'd be rude to doze off
in the passenger seat.

857
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,368
I'm used to going to the morning market.

858
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,327
Don't worry.

859
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,133
This is an accident blackspot.

860
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,801
Please be careful.

861
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,636
Be careful.

862
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,471
You need to be careful.

863
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,681
Watch out.

864
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:16,933
Okay?

865
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,863
In 300m, reduce speed to 80 km per hour.

866
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,453
In 200m, reduce speed to--

867
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,221
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

868
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,681
-No problem.
-Get home safe!

869
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,934
Goodbye and thank you, Mr. Choi.

870
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:00,894
No problem.

871
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,437
Goodbye, Chi-yeol.

872
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,356
Can you all just say goodbye at once?

873
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,192
Should we do that? Attention.

874
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,568
Say goodbye to Mr. Choi.

875
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,320
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Choi.

876
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:18,953
Goodbye.

877
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,377
She's so over the top.

878
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,547
She doesn't know moderation.

879
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,436
Let's go inside.
I should unpack and open the store.

880
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,566
Let me. I'll bring it in later.

881
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,986
-I need to make a call first.
-Okay, but this is heavy. Goodness.

882
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,373
Hey, Hae-e.

883
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,542
You picked up.

884
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,753
I didn't expect you to
since you ignored my texts yesterday.

885
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,547
I checked my phone too late.

886
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,049
-Are you home?
-Yes, just got back.

887
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,052
You have the All Care class today, right?

888
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,262
Can we meet before that?

889
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,478
How are you feeling? Do you feel better?

890
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,106
Yes, I think so.
Did you schedule the makeup classes?

891
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,191
Yes. I just need to announce it.

892
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,361
Okay. Do we have
the third talk show scheduled?

893
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,530
Yes, the association called.

894
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:39,492
They're thinking the 30th of next month
and asked if you'd be free.

895
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,203
-You don't have classes that evening.
-Okay, let's do that.

896
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,038
Okay. Anything else you need?

897
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,081
Noâ€¦

898
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,082
Actually,

899
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,293
do you know this song?

900
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,138
Can you be a bit more preciseâ€¦

901
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,396
What song is that?

902
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,609
I have perfect pitch.
You may have hearing issues.

903
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,027
I have perfect pitch too.

904
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,070
Perfect pitch isn't that common.

905
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,669
I guess it's common.

906
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,797
By the way, what about that song?

907
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,300
It's just a song that's been
stuck in my head.

908
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,343
It's annoying me.

909
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,761
I see.

910
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,221
Give me a more accurate melody,
and I'll record it--

911
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,515
Forget it if you don't recognize the song.

912
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,976
You always go over the top too.

913
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,980
I tend to be like that
when it's about you.

914
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,940
There's someone else like that?

915
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,695
Yes. Someone who's even worse.

916
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,003
I'm so sick of this song!

917
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,507
You've been replaying this song
thousands of times already!

918
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,967
I'm going to vomit, Haeng-seon!

919
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,552
Let's listen to something else!

920
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:25,807
Or how about we just listen to a playlist?

921
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,017
There's nothingâ€¦

922
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,229
Hey! As your boss,
I can pick what we listen to!

923
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,609
Unbelievable.
Why are you suddenly into this song?

924
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,029
I've always liked this song,

925
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,407
but now I love it even more
for some reason.

926
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,951
I love the lyrics

927
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,661
and the melody.

928
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:56,129
Spend the rest of your life with me

929
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:02,468
I say this to you again

930
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,930
With confidence

931
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,729
It's so tasty to eat out
after eating at home every day.

932
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,022
It feels good to eat some MSG
every now and then.

933
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:17,984
I agree.

934
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,862
This is better than
the convenience store burgers.

935
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,242
Hey.

936
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,578
Were you upset with me two days ago?

937
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:32,957
Yes.

938
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,834
I was.

939
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,670
You've been prioritizing Geon-hu.

940
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,590
That's not true.
It's just that I promised that I'd help.

941
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,925
And you're my closest friend.

942
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,139
Anyway, I'm sorry.

943
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,310
What did you want to tell me yesterday?

944
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,854
Right.

945
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,696
That day, after the supplementary class,

946
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,574
I caught Su-a
rummaging through your backpack.

947
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,284
Su-a?

948
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,495
Why would sheâ€¦

949
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,875
She said you had
the All Care Program's material.

950
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,171
I told her it was mine
and that I had lent it to you.

951
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,341
Sun-jae, you seeâ€¦

952
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:25,760
Anyway, it's top secret.

953
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,720
It stays between us and Mr. Choi. Got it?

954
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,892
It's okay.
You can tell me when you're ready.

955
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,645
Let me know if you need any materials.

956
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,069
Thanks, Sun-jae.

957
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:45,404
Don't worry about it.

958
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:48,825
You're free, right?
We need to blow off some steam.

959
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,793
Why is everyone so down?

960
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,920
What's the problem?
Say something

961
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,089
-The vibe is so cold
-The vibe is so cold

962
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,341
-Is that the trend nowadays?
-Is that the trend nowadays?

963
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,552
Why is everyone so boring?

964
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,762
I'm one of them

965
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,430
-Tell me what
-I got to do

966
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,267
-Turn on the Bluetooth right now
-Turn on the Bluetooth right now

967
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,644
-Turn on any song
-Turn on any song

968
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,855
Turn on any fun song

969
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,481
Dance however you like

970
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,109
-So that you look okay
-So that you look okay

971
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,652
-I don't want to think
-I don't want to think

972
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:31,492
When the sun shines

973
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,037
I naturally wake up and open my eyes

974
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,790
Everything

975
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,294
Seems to have changed

976
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,131
Like that

977
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:50,553
Heart-fluttering events
That I thought only happenedâ€¦

978
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,475
Are happening to me

979
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,688
Hey, where are you?

980
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:03,566
Why would I tell you?
You're just going to tell me to drop it.

981
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:07,612
I get that this area in Gangnam
is about to be redeveloped,

982
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,739
but how could there still be
no CCTV cameras?

983
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,408
What?

984
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,119
I swear that was empty a moment ago.

985
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,134
Hey.

986
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,677
Who are you? Stop!

987
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,825
Darn it.

988
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,709
Right?

989
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,630
Gosh.

990
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,096
I'm already hungry again.
Should we grab something to eat?

991
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,056
Do you have time?

992
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,224
I do.

993
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,018
You have an hour left.

994
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,103
Sure, let's eat.

995
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,149
Hey!

996
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:40,955
She's my friend.

997
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,333
Hello.

998
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:49,380
-Wellâ€¦
-He's my older brother.

999
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,676
I see. Hello.

1000
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:00,891
Aren't you hot?

1001
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,567
Why the hell did he run away?

1002
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,735
Who is he?

1003
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,371
Come on.

1004
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,462
Yes.

1005
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,256
He's my brother.

1006
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:37,887
Were you surprised?

1007
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,724
Yes. A bit.

1008
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,271
My brotherâ€¦

1009
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,940
never went to the UK to study.

1010
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,862
He stays home all the time.

1011
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,699
You know what a shut-in is, right?

1012
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,579
That's him.

1013
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,457
He usually stays in his roomâ€¦

1014
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,794
and quietly goes out once in a while.

1015
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,046
And then todayâ€¦

1016
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,758
he ran into me.

1017
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:20,721
He wasn't always like this.
He had good grades in school.

1018
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,600
But our mom forced him to retake the CSAT
to get into a better school.

1019
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,187
But thenâ€¦

1020
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,816
he disappeared on the day of the CSAT.

1021
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,568
He didn't take the exam.

1022
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,947
Our entire family searched everywhere,

1023
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:40,574
only to find him at home.

1024
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,870
He had locked himself in his room.

1025
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:48,999
That was the start.

1026
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,546
Our mom refused to let me fail as well,

1027
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,674
so we moved here
despite our dad's disapproval.

1028
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,515
You're going out often these days.

1029
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,142
Where were you?

1030
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:37,339
I feel better now that I've said it.

1031
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:43,804
I've wanted to tell you this
numerous times, but I just couldn't.

1032
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:46,432
I understand.

1033
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,560
I totally get it.

1034
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,984
Sun-jae.

1035
01:09:57,526 --> 01:10:01,155
I can't tell you everything,
but I must confess something.

1036
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,117
The All Care Program's material

1037
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,578
was from Mr. Choi.

1038
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,496
He's tutoring me these days.

1039
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,292
-What?
-He felt bad that I was kicked out.

1040
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,423
He told me to keep it a secret,
so I couldn't tell you.

1041
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:25,512
But I feel like
I should at least tell you this.

1042
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,098
Why?

1043
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,309
Because I told you a secret?

1044
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,645
That's part of it.

1045
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:42,905
Okay.

1046
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,324
Thank you for telling me.

1047
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,285
Your secret's safe with me.

1048
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,123
Okay. I trust you, Sun-jae.

1049
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,125
So trust me too.

1050
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:21,360
If we were to draw the question,
it would look like this.

1051
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,778
Look at these two triangles.

1052
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:26,156
This one and this one. What are they?

1053
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,074
-Congruent.
-Congruent.

1054
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:30,369
That's it. Then this length will be two.

1055
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,496
And the length of BH will be the same.

1056
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:37,459
Then how will we get the radius
of ABC's circumcircle?

1057
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:42,506
That'll be 2 square root of 65
over the square root of 2.

1058
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,009
-The answer is square root--
-Of 130.

1059
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,595
Who was that?

1060
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,722
Me.

1061
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,765
Are you sure it's 130? Positive?

1062
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,100
Yes.

1063
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,019
How are you so quick? Are you a machine?

1064
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:57,896
You can take over.

1065
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,279
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

1066
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:06,655
Can you give me some room?

1067
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:10,909
The square root ofâ€¦

1068
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,749
I made spicy stir-fried octopus
and two fried eggs.

1069
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,251
This is my attempt
at surpassing that savior of yours.

1070
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,379
You seemed more energetic
after getting some rest.

1071
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,714
Going to Nation's Best?

1072
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,176
Yes.

1073
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,180
-Hae-e needs a makeup session too.
-That test is for her, right?

1074
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,640
You left it on your desk.

1075
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,393
You saved me the trouble. Thank you.

1076
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:40,356
I'll prepare her material from now on.

1077
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,648
I'll print it out.

1078
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,109
I'd be grateful for that.

1079
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,652
This doesn't mean I approve.

1080
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,113
I'm still against this. Goodbye.

1081
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,163
He's so charming.

1082
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:57,664
How is he still single?

1083
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,334
But then again,

1084
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:03,962
I'm super charming myself,
but I'm also single.

1085
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:06,507
It's understandable.

1086
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,349
I'm glad they still had some croissants.
They usually sell out quickly.

1087
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,558
-Mom.
-Yes?

1088
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:21,355
I think Sun-jae is leaking
All Care materials to Hae-e.

1089
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:24,441
Seriously? Are they dating?

1090
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,152
I don't know, but they're awfully close.

1091
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,822
I never took him for that type,

1092
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,116
but he's so thoughtless.

1093
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,159
How can he leak those materials?

1094
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,411
Whatever.

1095
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:37,454
It's so annoying, and it bothers me.

1096
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,792
Of course. You studied hard
to get into that program.

1097
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,920
I'll speak with Sun-jae's mom.

1098
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,840
-She's not a thoughtless person.
-That was Mr. Choi's car!

1099
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,217
-Where?
-There!

1100
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,261
It's him. That's his plate number.

1101
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:55,180
You're right.
But why is he in our neighborhood?

1102
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,423
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1103
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,551
I'm surprised
by how easily startled you are.

1104
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,886
You must have weak energy.

1105
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,471
-Hello? Why did you--
-Mr. Choi!

1106
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,307
You're truly the best. I respect you!

1107
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,225
Yes!

1108
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,810
Did you really give Hae-e
the All Care Program's material?

1109
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:24,853
Have you gone insane?

1110
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:28,565
Go.

1111
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,609
-What are they doing?
-It's a downing match.

1112
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,570
She's married and the mother
of my student at that.

1113
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:36,240
What's wrong with my heart?

1114
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:38,367
It's almost done.

1115
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,453
I'm certain that he's totally into you.

1116
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:51,421
