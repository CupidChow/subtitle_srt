00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,190
SU-JA'S CHUEOTANG

3
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,525
I haven't seen you in ages.

4
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,610
EPISODE 8

5
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,280
I thought you'd left the country
or something, you brat.

6
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,949
I'm sorry.
I've been busy making ends meet.

7
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,493
How's business?

8
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,577
So-so.

9
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,288
By the way, who is he?

10
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,540
Your boyfriend?

11
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,209
Just a neighbor.

12
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,419
He's a very famous star teacher.

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,172
I see. He's a teacher.

14
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,381
Enjoy.

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,133
Eat up, Haeng-seon.

16
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,259
Thanks, Auntie.

17
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,596
Eat up. It's tastier when it's hot.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,399
Nothing's changed.

19
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,195
The kitchen, the tables,

20
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,948
and even the chairs.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,538
Hello.

22
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,124
Hey.

23
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,084
What are you craving today?

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,586
The baekban, as usual.

25
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,505
Wait here.

26
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,933
Thank you for the meal.

27
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,351
Hey, come here.

28
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,853
Sorry?

29
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,105
All right.

30
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,775
Take more meal tickets.

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,986
For my favorite regular.

32
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,280
-You don't have to do this.
-Take them and go.

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
Thank you.

34
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,418
It's pretty shabby in here, right?

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,754
It's exactly how it looked
back when my mom ran this place.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,133
So I get to reminisce whenever I visit,
which is nice for me.

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,263
When did your mother pass away?

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,477
The year the World Cup was held
in South Africa, so…

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,772
That was in 2010.
It was the week before chuseok.

40
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,985
I had gotten a special leave
from the dorm for the holiday.

41
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,654
The week before chuseok…

42
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,240
in 2010?

43
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,201
Come in and eat.

44
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,913
I've used up my meal tickets.

45
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,373
Cripes. I never asked for one.

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,336
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

47
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,378
Hurry up.

48
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,342
Cripes, don't make me repeat myself.

49
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,426
Just come in.

50
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,138
Mom!

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,473
Haeng-seon.

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,477
Guess who's here?
It's your national athlete daughter.

53
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,187
Salute.

54
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,444
Be careful. It's hot.

55
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,535
She was a very healthy woman.

56
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,497
But she suddenly passed away
due to a car accident

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,332
that happened in front of our house.

58
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,671
I hated the world
for taking someone as kind as her.

59
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,548
It was so unfair and infuriating

60
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,426
that I used to run to the temple
mid-training to visit my mom.

61
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,097
There's a small temple in Seongbuk-dong
that my mom used to go to,

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,890
and her ancestral tablet is there.

63
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,519
I'd bawl in front of hers
and vent my anger.

64
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,856
Then everything
would be bearable for some time.

65
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,859
I did that for a few years.

66
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,529
Please.

67
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:12,854
CHANCE BECOMES FATE
THROUGH INDUCTIVE REASONING

68
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,652
Here.

69
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,656
-So? Did you look into it?
-I did.

70
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,991
Nam Hae-e.

71
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,869
Her mom runs a side dish store
near Imperial Apartments.

72
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,747
And she rose to the top of her class
in the September mock.

73
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,292
After just a few tutoring sessions
with Chi-yeol?

74
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,668
I hate that guy.

75
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,838
Wait. Her mom runs a side dish store?

76
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,507
I thought she'd be from a wealthy family.

77
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,719
But why is he tutoring her?

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,805
I'm not sure if this is related,
but in the All Care Program,

79
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,307
a student was pushed out,

80
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,100
-and Young-min took that spot.
-Right.

81
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,394
That student was Hae-e.

82
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,731
Chi-yeol said he'd quit the program too
if they didn't bring her back.

83
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,361
He seems to have
one favorite student every decade.

84
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,988
You're right.

85
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,115
The past incident
didn't get much attention,

86
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,492
but this will be different.

87
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,577
This will be a huge scandal.

88
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,496
Right? It'll be quite a story.

89
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,960
Okay. Let's get to it right away.

90
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,338
SU-JA'S CHUEOTANG

91
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,552
Did we park in that alley?

92
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,887
It's a bit further.

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,306
Turn right at the dry cleaners
towards the church.

94
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,520
I'm the one who used to live here,
but you know the streets better than I do.

95
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,437
How fascinating.

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,273
I have a good sense of direction.

97
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,943
This is so fascinating.
How are you so accurate?

98
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,321
This is why one should be
wary of smart people.

99
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,491
You never forget how much money
you lend people, do you?

100
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,920
START STUDY CAFE

101
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,881
STUDY HARD SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY

102
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,424
Today is Lunar New Year,

103
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,011
and many highways are already congested.

104
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,932
We will brief you on the routes
to and from Seoul.

105
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,811
It'll take about seven hours
from Seoul to Busan.

106
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,230
That's four times the usual traffic.

107
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,983
Be wary of accidents due to illegal turns.

108
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:26,154
Please drive safely
and enjoy the holiday with your family.

109
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,156
This was Reporter Choi So-hui from JBN.

110
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,601
SEON'S CAFETERIA

111
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,322
What?

112
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,078
I'd like to pay.

113
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,255
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,591
I bought this, so I'm a bit short.

115
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,967
Could you take the pen too?

116
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,968
Forget it.

117
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,845
Just give me what you have.

118
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,263
Then put it on my tab.

119
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,933
Cripes, what tab?
You don't even have money.

120
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,603
If you feel bad, just come by more often.

121
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,898
And take this.

122
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,483
-But--
-Here. Just go.

123
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,154
Thank you.

124
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,572
Go on then.

125
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,824
-Thank you!
-That little…

126
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,422
But I only ordered baekban.

127
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,757
I had some leftover meat.

128
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,888
This is burnt. You take care of it.

129
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,557
It doesn't look burnt.

130
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
Thank you, ma'am.

131
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,926
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

132
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,307
Thank you for today.

133
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,726
Ice your wrist again when you go home.

134
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,104
And refrain from using your left hand
as much as possible.

135
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,272
Okay. You can go.

136
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,232
Go first. I'm home anyway.

137
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,525
I'll see you off.

138
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,486
Bye.

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,378
He was acting like a baby at the doctor's,
so why is he suddenly so quiet?

140
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,130
He was even teary-eyed.

141
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,719
I'm sleepy.

142
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,056
Now I understand

143
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,392
why I was able to only stomach her food,

144
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,145
why I'd become teary-eyed for no reason,

145
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,859
why I was drawn to her and her family.

146
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:47,498
ENTER PASSWORD

147
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,378
MOM
TAP TO LOAD PREVIEW

148
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,382
DOWNLOADING PROGRAM

149
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,321
This is so surreal.

150
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,658
She's the daughter of the savior
you always talked about?

151
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,286
I can't believe it either.

152
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,873
She fed me in Noryangjin

153
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,417
twelve years ago,

154
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,962
and now her daughter
is feeding me in Nokeun-ro.

155
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,882
What are the odds?

156
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,884
Very low.

157
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,511
You got that right.

158
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,847
Seoul is a big city, you know?

159
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:32,228
JUNG YEONG-SUN, SURVIVED BY
NAM HAENG-JA, NAM HAENG-SEON, NAM JAE-WOO

160
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,690
When times are extremely tough,

161
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,902
there are memories
that get you back on your feet.

162
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,529
Of course.

163
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,948
That's what her cafeteria is to me.

164
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,826
Whenever I would lose
all hope to live in this world,

165
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,122
I'd think of the warm food
that she prepared for me,

166
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,668
and that would motivate me to stay strong.

167
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,754
She's the reason I'm here today.

168
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,175
Now it's as clear as day.

169
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,512
She really does take after her mother.

170
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,473
That's why I was drawn to her.

171
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,434
Nothing's wrong with
my sympathetic nervous system.

172
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
I was naturally drawn to her.

173
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,772
-Sorry?
-Yes.

174
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,732
That was it.

175
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,192
Right.

176
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,612
Anyway, I'd like to repay the kindness.

177
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,822
No, I must.

178
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,907
What does that family need the most?

179
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,869
Do we need to stop using it already?

180
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,163
It's still hot throughout October.

181
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,915
We don't need AC in the fall.

182
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,584
We should conserve when we can.

183
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,419
Gosh, you're such a scrooge.

184
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,462
You don't even have AC at home.

185
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,299
Almost all houses have AC now,
you know that?

186
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,761
But then again,
it has become common for landlords

187
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,680
to install them for free.

188
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,933
Anyway, this building's landlord is just…

189
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,144
Hold on. Isn't rent due today?

190
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,856
Yes. You're right.

191
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,735
How do we have to pay rent
every single month?

192
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,864
-That's because it's monthly rent.
-I know that!

193
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,450
I'm just frustrated!

194
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,620
Are we paying rent so we can make money
or vice versa?

195
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,246
Which came first?
The chicken or the chick?

196
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,333
They're basically the same, Haeng-seon.

197
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,003
You mean the chicken or the egg.

198
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,880
Anyway.

199
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,302
Gosh. Hello, sir.

200
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,180
I was just about to wire you the rent--

201
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,267
Is that so?

202
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,102
So that means…

203
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,855
someone else is the landlord now.

204
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,442
I hope the new landlord
doesn't want us to move out…

205
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,987
That's a relief.

206
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,282
What about our rent?
Will it stay the same or…

207
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,745
Did it go up?

208
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,706
Reduced by half?

209
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,708
-Why?
-Really?

210
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,043
Why?

211
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,587
Haeng-seon, something is outside.

212
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
Hey, go out there.

213
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,804
Hey, what's going on?

214
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,787
IMPERIAL APARTMENTS

215
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,874
Our client is here.

216
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,170
Why are you so startled?

217
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,339
Did I catch you red-handed?

218
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,549
Can you please knock?

219
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,175
This isn't our bedroom.

220
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,437
Like I would come into our bedroom.

221
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,574
PURCHASING METAL BALLS

222
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,668
PURCHASING METAL BALLS

223
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,631
FORCE OF METAL BALLS

224
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,348
That'll be all for the day.

225
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,435
The teaching assistant has
an announcement, so don't go just yet.

226
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,812
And I'm Choi Chi-yeol.

227
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,648
Thank you.

228
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,611
I'll cut to the chase.

229
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,697
All right. The ID is

230
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,326
"care2022,"

231
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,497
and the password is "262923."

232
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,208
This is the makeup class we talked about.

233
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,628
You can access it on the academy's website
until midnight on Saturday.

234
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,756
And I'm sure you know
the login credentials are confidential.

235
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,840
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

236
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,383
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

237
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,765
What? Going to send it to Hae-e again?

238
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,272
Did the AC get there okay?

239
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,150
Yes. I thought it'd seem odd
to only install one in her store,

240
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,944
so I had them installed
in the entire building.

241
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,737
-Excellent work.
-No problem.

242
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,907
The purchase will be finalized once we get
the documents from the seller tomorrow.

243
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,117
Okay.

244
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,994
Make sure they don't find out
that I'm the new landlord.

245
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,957
I'll do my best,
but I think you'll get caught eventually.

246
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,961
They could always get a copy of
the registration and see your name on it.

247
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,505
I'll just say it's someone else.

248
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,174
-Or should we use your name instead?
-That's illegal.

249
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,260
I'll give you the building.
It'll be yours.

250
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,389
That's a bit too much,
and you're just being obnoxious.

251
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,890
Is that so?

252
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,767
Then let's think this through.

253
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,186
-And dinner?
-I booked it.

254
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,689
The Deluxe A Course at Shangri Hotel.

255
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,525
I need to go inside
and schedule your classes.

256
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,442
Enjoy your meal.

257
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,944
Okay. Thank you.

258
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,237
No problem.

259
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,245
Wait up.

260
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,092
You're really something.

261
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,219
To fit that into your busy schedule…

262
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,679
I wouldn't be able to do that.

263
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,892
It's a compliment.

264
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,561
I respect you. You're incredible.

265
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,190
People's tastes rarely change,

266
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,983
whether it's 12 years ago or now.

267
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,612
But why female students?

268
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,156
A teacher shouldn't do that, you know.

269
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,505
Yes. What is it?

270
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,342
Okay.

271
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,559
The tutoring part alone
won't be as impactful.

272
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,438
That'll only shock people in this area,
not the wider public.

273
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,691
Why is Choi Chi-yeol only tutoring her?

274
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,946
Because they have an illicit relationship.
That's the key point.

275
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,365
And you also have a photo of Nam Hae-e.

276
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,158
Blur her face out.

277
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,453
And blur the side dish shop's name
and post that too.

278
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,580
We need visual aids for this,
don't you think?

279
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,166
Darn it.

280
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,710
You should obviously post it
as Chiyeolsucks.

281
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,462
Okay.

282
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,006
Send it to me once you're done.

283
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,966
Bye.

284
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,426
What an idiot.

285
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,563
So it was you?

286
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,774
You're Chiyeolsucks?

287
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,444
"Chiyeolsucks"? What's that?

288
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,419
I thought you were all bark.
I didn't know you'd bite.

289
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,797
So? What'll you do about it?

290
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,259
Don't hurt Nam Hae-e.

291
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,470
If you post about the private tutoring,

292
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,264
I'll put you behind bars

293
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,975
for repeated fabrication and defamation.

294
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,936
Then I'll sue you for damages
until you go broke.

295
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,023
And you'll never be able to teach again.

296
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,736
Do you understand, Mr. Jin?

297
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,999
Damn it.

298
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,588
So he's going to let this slide
as long as I keep my mouth shut?

299
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,093
Is there really something
going on between them?

300
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,624
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

301
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,880
The new landlord installed
new AC units in every room?

302
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:02,964
I'm telling you.

303
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,008
They must be really rich.

304
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,135
I wonder what they do for a living.

305
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,805
Mr. Choi is here.

306
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,348
-Oh--
-Hae-e, let me.

307
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,808
-Let me.
-Jeez.

308
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,687
-Hello, Chi-yeol.
-Hi.

309
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,231
-Hello.
-Hello.

310
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
Something's different, right?

311
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,612
Doesn't it feel cool?

312
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,992
You must've bought an AC unit.

313
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,911
You used to only have a half-broken fan.

314
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,372
We have a new landlord.

315
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,998
The rent has been reduced by half,

316
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,251
and AC units are now in every room.

317
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,710
I see.

318
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,296
So are you happy?

319
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,965
-No.
-What?

320
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,049
Something feels off.

321
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,426
Isn't that strange?
They just bought the building.

322
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,470
It's not like we're a charity case.

323
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,143
Why would you bad-mouth
someone's kind gesture?

324
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,813
Doesn't this call for a party?

325
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,524
You only have to pay half the rent,
and you got an AC unit.

326
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,026
I never said it out loud,
but it was boiling in here.

327
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,404
I feel great.
It's so cool and dry in here.

328
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,656
-Jae-woo, isn't it nice?
-Yes, it is.

329
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,907
What do you think, Hae-e?

330
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,451
Yes, I guess it's nice.

331
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,079
-Should we hold a party?
-What?

332
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,540
Didn't you say
good news was worth celebrating?

333
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,208
Don't you all love to party?

334
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,170
Let's party.

335
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,421
I'm down.

336
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,341
Okay?

337
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:29,968
Well…

338
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,095
-Okay?
-Okay.

339
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,221
This way, please.

340
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,268
Come on. Hurry up.

341
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,478
Jae-woo.

342
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,771
I'm coming, Chi-yeol.

343
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,773
Hae-e.

344
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,234
He doesn't expect me to pay, does he?

345
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,819
I'm not sure.

346
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,322
Don't you think he'll pay
since he brought us here?

347
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,490
Let's go in for now.

348
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,122
Mr. Choi.

349
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,792
Look, I know you want a big party,
but this is a bit…

350
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,628
Don't worry. It's on me.

351
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,962
Why?

352
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,798
Because I love that you have AC.

353
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,843
My teaching environment has improved.

354
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,221
I'm also grateful
that you took me to the doctor.

355
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,056
I can't believe it's all better.

356
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,935
I see.

357
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,650
We have the amuse-bouche and aperitif.

358
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,445
It's comprised of mango,
muskmelon, and jamón.

359
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:34,908
I advise you to start with the latter two,
then finish off with the mango.

360
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,331
I see.

361
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,936
Today's appetizer is
southern rough shrimp and scallop.

362
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,897
The sauce on top of the scallop
is made with sea urchin roe.

363
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,900
It is the best quality
sea urchin roe you could have.

364
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,488
Have a taste of the sauce first,
then have it with the scallop.

365
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,679
Excuse me.

366
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,432
I appreciate your explanations,

367
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,143
but could you bring out
the dishes faster, please?

368
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,397
My family tends to
digest food fairly quickly.

369
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,648
I see.

370
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,026
Should I bring out the soup?

371
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,571
Yes, I'd love that.
I was actually just craving some.

372
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,114
I'd love that.

373
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,700
Actually, could you just
bring out all the dishes

374
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,285
except for dessert, if possible?

375
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,912
We're quite hungry.

376
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,417
There's nothing like a table full of food.

377
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,086
It's a feast for the eyes and the heart.

378
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,087
It's tasty.

379
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,464
It really is, Mr. Choi.

380
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,548
Really? Order more.

381
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,924
I'll ask for the menu.

382
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,968
No, this is already more than enough.

383
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,803
I bet you spent a hefty sum already.

384
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,680
Don't worry about that.

385
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,016
Jae-woo, eat up.

386
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,684
Okay, Chi-yeol.

387
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,647
Mr. Choi, since when did you and Uncle
start addressing each other casually?

388
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,232
When we played foot volleyball.

389
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,902
He said, "Hey, Jae-woo,
keep your eyes on the ball."

390
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,445
-Did I say that?
-Yes.

391
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,906
It's easy to bond over team sports.

392
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,408
Yeong-ju and I didn't get along at first.

393
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,203
But we became best friends
after a few years of training.

394
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,413
I think it's all thanks to
her personality.

395
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,332
Nam Hae-e. Come on.

396
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,294
Mr. Choi, how are you?

397
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,713
I'll be having a recital in two days.

398
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,923
Please come.

399
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,552
Jae-woo, have some more meat.

400
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,013
Today is his lucky day.

401
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,935
To solve this, the left-hand limit…

402
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,147
and the right-hand limit…

403
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,282
What should they be? Equal.

404
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes. It was definitely this handwriting.

405
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,974
Why would Mr. Choi
have written on Sun-jae's material?

406
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:55,108
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

407
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
Let me open it.

408
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,904
Thanks.

409
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,491
Thank you so much for today.

410
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,952
I hadn't eaten out in a while,
so it was so tasty.

411
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,537
It was nothing.

412
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,621
Hey.

413
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,165
-Hello, Mr. Choi.
-Hello.

414
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,250
Did you have something tasty?

415
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,294
-Yes.
-Yes, it was insane.

416
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,422
It was so luxurious and delicious.
It was absolutely superb.

417
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,008
Seeing how excited he is,
it really must've been grand.

418
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,885
You can come too next time.

419
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
-Gosh!
-Jeez.

420
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,805
Goodbye then.

421
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,142
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Choi.

422
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,103
Forward!

423
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,563
Forward!

424
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,522
Move.

425
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,815
For--

426
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,275
-It was so nice.
-Let's go.

427
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,581
I didn't know I had run out of flour.

428
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,417
Darn it.
I should've bought some this morning.

429
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,669
What a busy day.

430
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,591
KKIRI REAL ESTATE

431
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,890
Did I leave anything out?

432
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,642
No, sir. This is very thorough.

433
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,565
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

434
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,359
Mr. Ji.

435
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,569
Why are you here?

436
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,197
Isn't that my former landlord?

437
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,159
Does that mean…

438
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,286
the landlord…

439
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,627
Good morning.

440
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,837
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

441
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,256
Would you like a sandwich
if you haven't eaten, sir?

442
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,966
-That's okay. You can eat it.
-Okay.

443
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,927
Is this breakfast or lunch?

444
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,805
It's brunch. We didn't have breakfast.

445
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,349
You should have a proper meal,
not just some bread.

446
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,476
Hold on.

447
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,815
So Mr. Choi is the new landlord?

448
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,776
Unbelievable.

449
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,945
But why?

450
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,408
Mr. Ji said it was an investment.

451
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,786
Apparently, he bought
a few other buildings in this area.

452
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,331
He thought they were worth investing in
since he frequents the area.

453
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,501
All right, fine.

454
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,004
But why did he cut the rent in half?

455
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,840
Apparently, he's known to be
a Good Samaritan.

456
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,177
All the other tenants are paying
half their original rent too.

457
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,015
Apparently, he doesn't like
showing off his good deeds.

458
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,184
Mr. Ji said to keep this a secret,
or else he'll flip out.

459
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,396
-But you know what?
-What?

460
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,733
Why do I feel so uneasy?
This feels really uncomfortable.

461
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,485
He even treated us to an expensive meal.

462
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,115
Does our family look like
we're struggling in his eyes?

463
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,117
Is he pitying us?

464
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,036
I'm not sure.

465
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,830
I don't get it either.

466
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,793
With his wealth, he should've bought
a building near the main street.

467
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,671
Why would he invest in
this old building in an alley?

468
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,797
This is…

469
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,175
What's your take?

470
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,636
I'm certain that he's totally into you.

471
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,638
Jeez! There you go again.

472
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,723
You were so wrong last time too.

473
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,725
No, I'm sure of it this time around.

474
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,520
I saw his face
when he dropped you guys off yesterday.

475
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,983
He was looking at you, Hae-e, and Jae-woo
with so much warmth and affection.

476
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,611
Especially the way he looked at you.

477
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,031
A lovey-dovey gaze. I'm sure of it.

478
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,866
He likes you,

479
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,537
but he can't be direct
since he thinks you're married.

480
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,165
All he has is money,
so he's expressing his love with it.

481
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,501
I'm sure of it this time.

482
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,002
That's what you said last time.

483
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,172
You don't think
he's all that bad either, do you?

484
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,425
You did say he was surprisingly cute.
You said that last time.

485
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,220
Confess to him that you're single.

486
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,639
-You can tell him that.
-Just drop it.

487
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,933
You coax me into doing things
all the time.

488
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,644
That's not what I'm doing.

489
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,687
You know what?

490
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,605
You're right. It's for you though.

491
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,066
Stop working like a dog.

492
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,069
Marry a rich guy and live comfortably.

493
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,613
Okay?

494
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,241
Haeng-seon, we have a group order.

495
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,661
All right.

496
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,621
Come inside.

497
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,173
He halved your rent, got you an AC unit,

498
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,760
treated you to an expensive meal,
and now, a group order?

499
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,929
He knows exactly how to help you out.

500
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,350
How is he so transparent?
I can see right through him.

501
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,937
Less flapping of the mouth,
more flipping of eggs.

502
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,356
I mean, think about it.

503
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,819
He saw you yesterday,
but he's already missing you this morning.

504
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,946
Hey, can you please just cook?

505
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,323
Go bring the containers.

506
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,492
Yes, of course, ma'am.

507
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,540
I'm coming with you.
I can't miss out on the spectacle.

508
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,835
She's so over the top.

509
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,049
Why would he like me?

510
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,886
Jeez, that brat.

511
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,222
No. It's impossible.

512
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,226
Never. No.

513
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,773
I'm glad you came with me.
This is too heavy to carry by myself.

514
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,031
-By the way,
-Yes?

515
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,616
did my mom visit your store?

516
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,367
Probably.

517
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,411
She's a regular there.

518
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,371
Right.

519
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,042
Why do you ask? What about her?

520
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,377
It's nothing.

521
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,215
Don't lie.

522
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,716
Tell me.

523
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,218
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

524
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,095
-I said it was nothing.
-Say it.

525
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,554
-Never mind.
-Spit it out.

526
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,806
Stop that.

527
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,891
-Come on, tell me.
-Stop that.

528
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,768
-Tell me.
-Stop.

529
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,562
Gosh. What's so funny?

530
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,106
-Hey, Geon-hu.
-Yes?

531
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,149
I'm glad you're here. Thank you.

532
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,067
Carry that for me.

533
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,904
She got me.

534
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,825
Is this fun for you? Stop smiling.

535
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,786
Thanks, Sun-jae.

536
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,621
Hey, Geon-hu.

537
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,165
Hey, come back here!

538
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,213
Guys, grab a supplementary
English workbook.

539
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,519
Sun-jae.

540
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,313
That test material
that you lent Hae-e last time,

541
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,149
can I borrow that?

542
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,733
Why?

543
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,069
I have to check something,
but mine is at home.

544
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,989
I know you always have yours.
Can I borrow it?

545
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,534
Fine. Hold on.

546
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,585
Here.

547
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,133
I don't need it, so take your time.

548
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,093
Forget it. I don't need it.

549
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,180
What's her deal?

550
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,059
Have some more if you want.

551
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,103
-Okay.
-Thank you.

552
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,023
Even Michelin three-star restaurants
couldn't satisfy me,

553
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,317
but her lunch box did.

554
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,528
-This looks tasty.
-Stop ordering chicken or burgers.

555
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,281
You should eat rice.
Rice is our staple food, you know?

556
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,742
-Okay. Thank you for the meal.
-Okay. Thank you for the meal.

557
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,285
-Thank you for the meal.
-Enjoy.

558
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,121
Isn't it good?

559
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,540
I haven't had a bite yet.

560
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,876
-Try it.
-It's good.

561
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,045
-Thank you for the meal.
-Tell me if it's good.

562
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,963
We'll be ordering from them from now on.

563
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,506
-Okay.
-Okay.

564
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,925
It's really scrumptious.

565
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,929
Stop it. Cut it out, you brat.

566
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,472
It's so good.

567
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,266
-Mr. Choi--
-Hello, Mr. Ji.

568
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,561
Hello, Mr. Ji. Come sit down and eat.

569
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,146
-Okay.
-Sit down.

570
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,481
You have a guest, sir.

571
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,607
A guest?

572
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,948
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.

573
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,409
I was visiting Ra-mi at the academy
and heard your office was nearby.

574
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,207
I see.

575
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,334
How have you been?

576
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,296
Good. I brought some snacks for you.

577
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,839
-I see.
-Gosh.

578
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,883
-We'll take that.
-Thank you.

579
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:41,926
-It's okay.
-Here.

580
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,345
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

581
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,724
Should I prepare some coffee?

582
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,977
Sure.

583
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,271
Let's have some coffee.

584
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,692
-Is coffee okay?
-Yes. Thank you.

585
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,570
-Excuse me.
-Sure, go right ahead.

586
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,038
-Who is she? She's stunning.
-Seriously.

587
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,916
-I've never seen a woman visit him before.
-I think I know.

588
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,043
She's the blind date
Ms. Jung set him up with.

589
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,878
-He goes on blind dates?
-A blind date?

590
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,338
No way.

591
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,883
She said that woman
was Mr. Choi's biggest fan.

592
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,553
She's a pianist from a wealthy family.

593
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,055
But I didn't know she'd be that pretty.

594
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,890
-She's gorgeous.
-Right?

595
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,267
Look, egg tarts.

596
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,311
Didn't they recently launch in Korea?

597
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,313
-I saw it on social media.
-You're right.

598
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,189
-There's shine muscat too.
-I want that.

599
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,900
These are so expensive.
She's so thoughtful.

600
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,652
-Take a picture.
-I want one too.

601
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,529
-Let's have this one first.
-Me too.

602
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,576
Thank you.

603
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,002
I'll be honest.
I didn't come by to visit Ra-mi.

604
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,670
I came to see you.

605
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,088
Sorry?

606
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,424
I see.

607
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,345
Was our date bad enough
that you didn't reply to my texts?

608
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,474
Honestly, it hurt my pride a bit.

609
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,601
I'm sorry. I was a bit busy yesterday.

610
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,979
Still, you could've replied
after you finished work.

611
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,939
Unless you're not interested.

612
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,739
That's why…

613
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,118
I brought the invite myself.

614
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,330
It didn't seem like texting
would do the trick.

615
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:35,915
I see.

616
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,920
I didn't want to give up.

617
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,548
And I was already
interested in you from the get-go.

618
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,803
I hope you'll come to watch me perform.

619
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,389
That's a very special seat.

620
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,016
If you don't come, it'll be a huge waste.

621
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,228
You'll come, right?

622
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,071
Hey.

623
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,489
Hey!

624
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,282
-What? Stay there!
-Come.

625
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,535
You little brat. Stop!

626
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,787
-Goodness.
-Jeez.

627
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,291
-You little brat.
-What?

628
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,464
The egg tarts are delicious.

629
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,299
-They're so tasty.
-They're so good.

630
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,093
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

631
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,262
I'll get going then.

632
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,930
Okay. Goodbye.

633
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,268
You better come to my recital tomorrow.

634
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,187
I'll cry if you don't.

635
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:46,861
We should butt out--

636
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,362
We should get going.

637
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,321
Goodbye.

638
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,990
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

639
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,408
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

640
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,535
There are a lot of leftovers.

641
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,871
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

642
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,038
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

643
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,969
That's so strange.

644
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,138
Was I wrong?

645
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,266
I was certain he was
interested in you this time.

646
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,147
But Mr. Choi's seeing someone?

647
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,984
A beautiful pianist from a wealthy family?

648
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,819
I told you you were wrong.

649
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,657
Or was he after both of you?

650
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,035
Did he buy her a piano or something?

651
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,745
That's enough!

652
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,997
You just don't know when to stop.

653
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,709
If you utter nonsense about him
being interested in me ever again,

654
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,960
I'll really get mad.

655
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,214
There's something wrong with you.

656
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,716
Why do you make everything about romance?

657
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,176
You have serious issues.

658
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,969
All right.

659
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,931
Still, you're treating me like
I'm abnormal or something.

660
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,849
Of course, you are! You're not normal!

661
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,941
Why is she so furious?
I feel so embarrassed!

662
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,653
Jeez. I'm right.

663
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,821
I was right.

664
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,699
I thought he was busy,
but seems he still has time

665
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,786
to invest and go on blind dates.

666
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,393
Hey, Mom.

667
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,192
Good work, Su-a.

668
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,736
Here, you must be hungry. Eat this.

669
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,446
-Mom.
-Yes?

670
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,824
The All Care Program material
that Hae-e had.

671
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,866
Yes?

672
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,453
-I don't think Sun-jae lent it to her.
-What do you mean?

673
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,998
I checked his paper, and it was different.

674
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,459
There were these handwritten parts
on Hae-e's sheet,

675
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,295
but they weren't on Sun-jae's.

676
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,339
And that handwriting belongs to Mr. Choi.

677
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,175
Mr. Choi wrote on her paper?

678
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,761
I'm sure you're mistaken.

679
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,887
I'm not.

680
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,973
I've seen his handwriting countless times.

681
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,600
And it wasn't just his handwriting.

682
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,810
Numbers two, eight, and the limit symbol.

683
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,314
They were all written in his style.
I'm sure of it.

684
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,275
-Also,
-Yes?

685
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,778
we saw him in front of
Hae-e's house last time.

686
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,904
That was odd too.

687
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,450
He must've seen the store was closed
from his car, so why get out?

688
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,951
And it was late at night.

689
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,288
It can't be.

690
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,874
You think he's tutoring her separately?

691
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,044
I think so. But I don't know why.

692
00:43:55,924 --> 00:44:00,471
Su-a, are you positive
that it was his handwriting?

693
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,097
Yes.

694
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,893
Yes. I want to go see you too, honey.

695
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,270
There's no food here either.

696
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,608
Everyone in this house ignores me.

697
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,986
Then let me see if I can sneak out…

698
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,659
All right, Mr. Shin.

699
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,952
I'll see you later. Bye.

700
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,997
Hi, Su-a.

701
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,667
How was your…

702
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,471
Honey.

703
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,935
Don't you sometimes use
detective agencies for your business?

704
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,395
-Detective agencies?
-Yes.

705
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,690
Yes, a few times due to money issues.

706
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,733
Can they also do background checks

707
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,736
and follow people around?

708
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,114
Like they do in the movies.

709
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,951
Yes, but why do you ask?

710
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,663
It's not for me, is it?

711
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,378
Why would I need to keep an eye
on someone as transparent as you?

712
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,756
I just need them for something.
Give me their number.

713
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,633
Okay. Hold on.

714
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,678
Hello?

715
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,141
Hello. Well…

716
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,853
Bang Dae-geun gave me your number.

717
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,604
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

718
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,647
Do you like it?

719
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,277
Is this really for me?

720
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,236
Yes.

721
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,156
I was using that, but I got a new one.

722
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,116
All the students study with those lately.

723
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,328
It doesn't look used. It looks brand new.

724
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,873
I know I got first place,
but this is a bit much.

725
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,791
I often get gifts for my students

726
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,127
when they get first place
or raise their grades.

727
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,214
You know it's rude
to adamantly refuse a gift, right?

728
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,384
Just be thankful and use it well.

729
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,181
Okay. I'll do that.

730
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,307
Thank you.

731
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,225
-Let me see that.
-Okay.

732
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,436
-This here.
-Yes.

733
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,272
It's a math app.

734
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,859
You can download sample questions
and solve them on this app.

735
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,110
If you get stuck,

736
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,070
you can watch the explanations too.

737
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,824
I filmed the CSAT explanations
for the past two years.

738
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,040
When did you move here?

739
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,336
In eighth grade.

740
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,588
Where did you live before?

741
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,131
In Jangseo-gu.

742
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,384
That's where my mom opened
her first side dish store.

743
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,888
Business was good,
so we lived there for a while.

744
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,934
Then we suddenly moved here,
partly because of me.

745
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,897
Did something happen?

746
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,693
I was just going through puberty.

747
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,862
Why do you ask?

748
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,489
I was just curious.

749
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,993
You must barely remember your grandmother.

750
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:10,994
Sorry?

751
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,792
That's true. She passed away
when I was really little.

752
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,599
Chi-yeol, are you free
from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. tomorrow?

753
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,434
Tomorrow?

754
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,812
It's Chicken Day.

755
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,523
Let's watch a movie
and have chicken together.

756
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,234
Are you talking about
that famous Chicken Day you have?

757
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,570
Yes. We'll be watching
a documentary tomorrow.

758
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,532
It's my favorite documentary,
Reservation Bengal Tigers.

759
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,409
There's a place called
Bandhavgarh National Park,

760
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,328
which was built to protect these tigers.

761
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,498
It's about the tigers that live there,
and it's really entertaining.

762
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,251
I'm not really into documentaries.

763
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,460
He can't, Jae-woo!

764
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,046
He has an important appointment tomorrow.

765
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,424
You have a recital to attend.

766
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,136
We can skip tomorrow's lesson too
since you'll have to get ready.

767
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,179
No, I should--

768
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,640
No, that's okay. We can take a rain check.

769
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,351
It'd be shameless of us
to interfere in your love life.

770
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,854
Make sure you clap a lot
and have some wine afterward.

771
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,148
Here's your lunch box. Oh, right!

772
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,691
You won't need one tomorrow, right?

773
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,569
I'll be free tomorrow night!

774
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,696
We can have Chicken Day
right after I close.

775
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,742
That's the tea.

776
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,161
Get home safe
and have a great time tomorrow.

777
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,805
Jeez.

778
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,476
Why would she order me around
when it's my love life?

779
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,562
I should drink wine and clap a lot?

780
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,149
She's one nosy woman.

781
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,201
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

782
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,292
Hello.

783
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,299
Jeez.

784
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,018
Did something happen between you two?

785
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,188
What do you mean?

786
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,068
He seemed a bit different today.

787
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,779
He didn't provoke you like usual
and just passed by.

788
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,781
Maybe he finally grew up.

789
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,032
Come on.

790
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,909
That can't be.

791
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,954
I'll explain later. Don't worry.

792
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,712
You'll attend the recital, right?
Should I get some flowers?

793
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,341
Do you think I have the time
to appreciate culture?

794
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,554
Just think of it as socializing
and go to the recital.

795
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,597
I spoke with Ms. Jung today,

796
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,225
and you're one of the reasons why
Ms. Hong set the recital on a weekday.

797
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,601
She's waiting for you.

798
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,562
Then I'd rather appreciate culture.

799
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,814
I detest wasting my energy on socializing.

800
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,484
But you're socializing
quite a bit these days.

801
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,486
You played foot volleyball
and repaid the kindness.

802
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,404
That's because--

803
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,991
Fine.

804
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,535
All right.
You can get flowers or whatever.

805
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,371
I'm tired.

806
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,125
Wake me up when we get there.

807
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:00,265
HONG HYE-YEON'S SOLO PIANO RECITAL

808
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,559
Come back for the braised pollock.

809
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,770
-Okay. Thank you.
-Goodbye.

810
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,858
Have all the customers left?

811
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,777
Let me give Hae-e this pumpkin porridge.

812
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,861
Okay.

813
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,405
-Haeng-seon.
-What?

814
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,741
Is Chi-yeol really not coming today?

815
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,909
No, he's not.

816
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,161
How many times have you asked that?

817
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,622
Once. I only asked once.

818
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,751
I wanted to watch
my favorite documentary with him

819
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,628
and chat with him over some chicken.

820
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,966
Jae-woo, Chi-yeol seems to have
a fickle heart.

821
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,093
He's here one day and gone the next.

822
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,680
Are you free tonight?
Join us for Chicken Day.

823
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,391
No. I'm not your rebound.

824
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,977
Today's my first day at the Drone Club.

825
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,896
You signed up for a Drone Club now?

826
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,648
Do you even know how to fly one?

827
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:33,984
Of course not.

828
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,529
That way, the other members will teach me.

829
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,155
Then after flying some drones,

830
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,616
the next thing that will be flying
is the sparks.

831
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,994
Good for you, Ms. Love Doctor.

832
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,746
I'll order four chickens just in case.

833
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,831
Order three.

834
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,960
Hey, order four chickens.

835
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,712
Gosh, that brat.

836
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,857
We'll take a ten-minute intermission.

837
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,944
Please return to your seats on time

838
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,322
and turn off your phones upon re-entry.

839
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:05,492
Mr. Choi, I'm trying to watch
the explanations on the app,

840
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,785
but it's not working.

841
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,703
How can I watch them?

842
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,331
HAE-E

843
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,966
-Hello?
-Hae-e, so for that,

844
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,344
you need to solve the problem first
to watch the explanation.

845
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,682
Aren't you at the recital right now?
You can tell me--

846
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,183
No, I can talk right now.

847
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:33,186
If you just want to watch the explanation,
go to the settings.

848
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,981
Okay. Settings.

849
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:39,317
Do you see the wheel icon
at the top-right corner of the main page?

850
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,403
I found it, Mr. Choi.

851
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,739
Gosh, that's hot!

852
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,782
Mom, are you okay?

853
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,576
-That's hot.
-What's wrong, Hae-e?

854
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,161
What's wrong, Hae-e?

855
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,788
Come on.

856
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,667
Right. I'm sorry.

857
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,171
I'm sorry,
but could you please talk outside?

858
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,425
Okay. I'm sorry.

859
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,868
It could've been much worse.

860
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,495
Thank God it was just your hand.

861
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,622
If you had spilled it on your feet,

862
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,416
that's at least a second-degree burn.

863
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,752
I guess I was lucky.

864
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,797
Are you okay?
Do you need to go to the hospital?

865
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,509
It's just a bit sore.
I iced it and put gauze on it right away.

866
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,678
You may be clumsy,

867
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,764
but you're always careful
when carrying hot food.

868
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,557
You should've been more careful!

869
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,060
I must've been distracted.

870
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:58,188
Hey, you have your Drone Club. Just go.

871
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,689
I'll wrap up, so go.

872
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,608
Can I?

873
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,110
Never mind. You burned your hand.

874
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,238
I'm okay. I'm going to finish up
and head to Chicken Day.

875
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,907
Leave it.

876
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,996
-Just leave it.
-I'm done.

877
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,254
Mr. Choi?

878
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,718
Are you okay? Where did you get hurt?

879
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,806
-Gosh.
-I slightly burned the back of my hand.

880
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,184
But why aren't you at the recital?

881
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,479
I doubt it's already over.

882
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,438
Right.

883
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,524
Did you leave in the middle?

884
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,781
Hae-e didn't know how to use the app,
so she couldn't solve the problems.

885
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,326
That's why you're here?

886
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,039
It's detestable
to haphazardly explain things.

887
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,167
Plus, I'm supposed to be
tutoring her right now anyway.

888
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,546
And I prioritize plans
that I make in advance.

889
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,716
-Jeez.
-Let me.

890
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,944
Anyway,

891
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,738
I'm glad it's just a slight burn.

892
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,867
Let's go inside.

893
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,538
What's with him?

894
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,373
Really?

895
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,085
You're sure about this?

896
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,506
Then could you send me
the photos right now?

897
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,468
Thank you.

898
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,563
No way.

899
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:07,942
Goodness.

900
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,282
I can't believe this.

ALL CARE GROUP CHAT

902
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:32,926
I wondered why the usually aloof Ms. Jang
wanted to treat me to a meal.

903
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,136
You wanted to ask me about a case?
How boring.

904
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,598
You're the aloof one here, Judge Yoo.

905
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,981
I'll be honest. This feels good.

906
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:51,110
The great Jang Seo-jin caved
to ask me for a favor.

907
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,280
The client must be high-profile.

908
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,118
It's about the son
of Sun-jae's education director.

909
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,498
I guess the great Jang Seo-jin
is also just a mom after all.

910
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,707
What do you mean?

911
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,377
Our classmates used to call you
"Seo-jin the Best."

912
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,713
You had the best grades,
educational background, and family.

913
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,924
And the worst personality.

914
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,470
Right. You also have the best husband.

915
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,599
He's handsome, rich,
and has a great personality.

916
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,434
You really have it all.

917
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,603
And two sons who are smart on top of that.

918
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,565
How annoying.

919
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,150
How's your married life going?

920
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,279
You know. It's just normal.

921
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,572
As if.

922
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,907
"Normal" and "Jang Seo-jin"
don't go hand in hand.

923
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,287
Let's get back to the case.

924
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,248
So about the education director's son…

925
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,960
He has always been studious.

926
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,546
But he befriended the wrong group.

Haeng-seon napped for 14 hours once.

959
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,381
It was close, but she lost to the tigers.

960
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,593
Fourteen hours
isn't considered a nap, is it?

and can't wrap my head around it.

973
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,615
About that…

974
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,869
I have a hobby of investing in buildings.

975
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,455
And people like me
should also give back to society.

976
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,250
Is that really why you treated us so well?

977
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,335
You halved our rent, installed an AC unit,

978
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,046
and even treated my family
to an expensive meal.

979
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,634
Is it wrong to treat you well?

980
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,803
What a weird thing to question.

981
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,976
Mr. Choi, one more thing.

982
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,060
Mr. Choi.

983
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,063
Then what about today?

984
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,859
Did you really come here because of Hae-e?

985
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,238
Is that the only reason why you're here?

986
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,659
Or…

987
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,496
Or is it because…

988
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,881
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

989
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,508
I'm tutoring her.

990
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,385
How are you so brazen?

991
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,053
-Will you arrest me?
-Wait!

992
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,264
-I begged him to tutor Hae-e.
-Excuse me.

993
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,182
-We need to talk.
-I--

994
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,226
What is the real reason they're upset?

995
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,477
Bring it on.

996
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,649
Even still, how could we have
absolutely no customers?

997
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,401
Like mother, like daughter. Impressive.

998
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,528
If I tell the truth,

999
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,365
Mom wouldn't be misunderstood,
and Mr. Choi wouldn't suffer like this.

1000
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:35,324
What's wrong with him?

1001
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,953
What are you doing here?

1002
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:42,123
I have feelings for this woman.

1003
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:52,717
