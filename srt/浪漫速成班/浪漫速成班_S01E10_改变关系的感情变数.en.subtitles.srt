CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,980
Did you even read the post?

3
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,983
Look at it in context.

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,112
He didn't lead her on.

5
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,200
She's the one who made a move
and threw herself at him--

6
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,242
It's not like that.

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,708
I offered to tutor the student.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,754
And I'm the one who had feelings.

9
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,798
Not her.

10
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,220
She only treated me as a teacher,

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,014
so I'm the one at fault.

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,978
I never deserved her.

13
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,398
She is extremely kind-hearted

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,985
and shines so brightly.

15
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,990
I had a crush on her.

16
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,370
So please mind your words.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,474
I see.

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,188
-Let's give him a round of applause.
-Oh, my.

19
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,024
What is Choi Chi-yeol saying?

20
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,527
He had a crush on her?

21
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,323
So Ms. Nam didn't throw herself at him.

22
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,618
He was lonely, so…

23
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,414
He's total garbage.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,586
Please give a round of applause
to Mr. Choi Chi-yeol…

25
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,005
Hae-e, I made some waffles
with ice cream--

26
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,132
-Thanks.
-Hey, that's Chi-yeol.

27
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,509
Wow, is this vanilla?

28
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,267
It's so good. Can you make more?

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,852
-Okay.
-Thanks.

30
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,032

00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,958
MISSED CALLS

35
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,822
MS. NAM HAENG-SEON:
MEET ME IN ROOM TWO AT VERSAILLES

36
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,909
"Room two at Versailles"?

37
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,956
VERSAILLES COIN KARAOKE

38
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,856
Thank goodness.

39
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,026
When I read "room two at Versailles,"

40
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,361
I got all tense.

41
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,531
It sounded like a motel.

42
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,579
How are you joking right now?

43
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,498
That's all I can do.

44
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,377
So why are we here?

45
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,880
To sing?

46
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,298
Are you kidding me?

47
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,675
We can't meet at a cafe,
and I don't have a car.

48
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,178
And it's not like I can talk to you
on my scooter.

49
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,733
Four, eight, seven, zero, three.

50
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,693
Start.

51
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,781
Why did you do that? Why…

52
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,202
Did you pity me?

53
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,995
Because they were bad-mouthing me?

54
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,039
Is that why you decided to take the fall?

55
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,666
You tutored Hae-e for free.

56
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,667
You halved our rent.

57
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,753
You even took the fall for the scandal.

58
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,670
Why?

59
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,011
Don't tell me you really…

60
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,475
No, right?

61
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,271
That can't be. Why would you like--

62
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,564
I like you.

63
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,870
I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat…

64
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,165
I tried denying it,

65
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,002
and I tried to rationalize it.

66
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,257
But nothing worked.

67
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,177
It's true.

68
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,597
I like you.

69
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,729
Maybe it's just my brain malfunctioning
due to being overworked.

70
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,024
Or is it my heart?

71
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,320
Anyway.

72
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,703
Don't worry.

73
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,124
I know I shouldn't have feelings for you.

74
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,836
I'll end it.

75
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,550
I'm the one who found
the wrong answer again.

76
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,956
-No, you can't get a full refund.
-You can cancel his class online.

77
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
-A refund won't be possible.
-Yes.

78
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,167
-A teacher's private life
-Yes.

79
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,503
-is unrelated to the academy.
-I'll check that.

80
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,931
Have you decided to ignore me?

81
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,726
I'd rather you get mad at me.

82
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,230
You're scaring me.

83
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,943
I know.

84
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,862
I've made an irreparable mess
that even you can't fix.

85
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,948
But I had no choice.

86
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,952
I was the one at fault,
but they were blaming it on her.

87
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,830
So please understand me--

88
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,914
I understand.

89
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,086
It's possible to have someone
you want to protect at all costs.

90
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,214
That's why it's even more infuriating.
Because I get it.

91
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,966
But that person just had to be--

92
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,301
I know how you feel.

93
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,556
So when will you quit sulking?

94
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,562
Don't drag it out for too long.

95
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,983
I'm sure there's more trouble up ahead.

96
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,158
We trusted Mr. Choi!

97
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,495
But he betrayed our trust!

98
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
He abandoned us!

99
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,418
Mr. Choi!

100
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,254
Is your heart burning passionately
with forbidden love?

101
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,841
Then we'll burn you too!

102
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,676
KICK CHOI CHI-YEOL OUT
FOR FALLING IN LOVE WITH A MARRIED WOMAN

103
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,011
AND ABANDONING HIS STUDENTS!

104
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,847
CHOI CHI-YEOL'S CLASS NOTES

105
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,108
I was so shocked and pulled my kid
out of his class right away.

106
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,819
I hear all the parents
are demanding refunds.

107
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,988
The offline classes
are about to shut down,

108
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,990
and many dropped out
of his online classes.

109
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,493
Jeez. He got what he deserved.

110
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,953
How could he fall
for his student's mother?

111
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,413
Tell me about it.

112
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,291
And Ms. Nam just ended up
becoming the scapegoat.

113
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,797
By the way,
shouldn't you apologize to Ms. Nam?

114
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,132
What?

115
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,884
Think about it.

116
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,720
You blamed her for seducing him
based on some assumptions

117
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,472
when she never did such a thing.

118
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,808
If I were her,
I would've snatched your hair.

119
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,518
Thankfully, she's a softie.

120
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,436
Was that too much?

121
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,313
-Aren't you leaving?
-What?

122
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,025
This is a gathering
for the moms of the All Care Program.

123
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,571
So what's your plan?

124
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,825
This is quite a flustering situation,

125
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,244
but we have no alternative.

126
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,873
I believe one's ethics and competence
should be judged separately.

127
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,252
If we have no other options,
then you're right.

128
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,296
But it's a different story if we do.

129
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,430
This is still off the record.

130
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,349
But Director Kang
is in contact with Song Jun-ho.

131
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,144
Song Jun-ho from Perfect M?

132
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,729
-He seems to be on the rise lately.
-You're right.

133
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,606
He cuts to the chase

134
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,068
and prepares his students
solely for the CSAT.

135
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,820
That's great.

136
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,156
And it's always better
to have a younger teacher.

137
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,949
They're up to date with the recent CSATs.

138
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,242
-Right.
-Right.

139
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,121
Song Jun-ho would be a good replacement,
but is this confirmed?

140
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,914
Isn't it a breach of contract?

141
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,958
Director Kang will take care of that.

142
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,711
We just need to deliver our opinion.

143
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,755
Are you really not going
to apologize to Ms. Nam?

144
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,676
I want to go buy some side dishes,
but I feel a bit uncomfortable.

145
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,721
I told you to leave.

146
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,890
You're not supposed to be here.

147
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,225
How did you know we'd be here?
Who told her?

148
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,482
Hey, what are all these radishes
doing here?

149
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,195
We still have a week's worth
of perilla leaves to sell.

150
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,199
And why the cabbage?
We just made geotjeori.

151
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,453
I'm going to make some seokbakji.
I'll make some and have the leftovers.

152
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,997
Haeng-seon.

153
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,125
I know you're purposely
keeping yourself busy.

154
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,045
But just make up your mind.

155
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,006
It's obvious that
you have feelings for him too.

156
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,424
Who wouldn't?

157
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,969
A wealthy and good-looking guy
says that he likes you.

158
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,722
So why would you decline?
What's there to think about?

159
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,184
I'm sure Hae-e will understand
if you explain everything.

160
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,770
But most of all,

161
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,273
he still confessed his love
despite thinking you're married.

162
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,275
That means it's genuine.

163
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,697
So stop tormenting yourself
and tell him the truth about Hae-e.

164
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,742
He's the only one who needs to know.

165
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,452
Shut it and chop up some radishes.

166
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,996
-Nam Haeng-seon.
-He said he'd end it. It's only right.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,248
So drop it.

168
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,291
That's because he thinks you're married.

169
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,960
We're too different!

170
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,921
Like you said, he's wealthy.

171
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,214
And look at what happened.

172
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,758
One scandal and our shop is barren.

173
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,261
It's just too much.
I don't need to tell him anything.

174
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,639
Hello.

175
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,307
Hello.

176
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
Hello, Ms. Lee.

177
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,852
I'm sorry, Ms. Nam.

178
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,523
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions
and stopped coming here.

179
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,440
So…

180
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,444
What's today's special?
Dan-ji has been craving your braised tofu.

181
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,738
I see. Of course, we have some.

182
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,282
-Take over.
-Go.

183
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,957
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

184
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,585
-Hello!
-Hello!

185
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,006
Hello.

186
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,674
-It's been a long time.
-Seriously.

187
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,884
This place is so good.

188
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,802
I've been craving japchae.

189
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,054
-Hey!
-Hey!

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,973
-Come on.
-Wait up.

191
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,527
Lee Hui-jae.

192
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,739
You've been in there for days.
What's going on?

193
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,158
You should at least eat.

194
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,386
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

195
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,554
THE CSAT MIRACLE BY CHOI CHI-YEOL
D-30 KICK-OFF

196
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,847
You know what?

197
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,267
I thought I had seen everything

198
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,853
in over 20 years
of working in this business.

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,356
But this…

200
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,068
It's been an absolute nightmare
to deal with.

201
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,488
I've never seen this many
refund requests before.

202
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,658
What's with your taste in women?

203
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,244
Plenty of decent single women
would line up to date you!

204
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,578
My heart breaks…

205
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,376
First,

206
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,170
take a two-week break.

207
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,923
At least pretend to be sorry.

208
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,009
Sure.

209
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,012
-I'll record videos for the makeup class--
-Forget it.

210
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,431
Who'd take the makeup classes
in this situation?

211
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,100
I'll find a way to deal with all of this.

212
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,186
So rest up and recharge yourself.

213
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,106
You've been working like a dog until now.

214
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,696
Okay, I'll do that.

215
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,283
I'll also compensate the academy
for all damages.

216
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,327
Don't feel too hurt, okay?

217
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,997
I do support you.

218
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,791
You can't control
how you feel about someone,

219
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,670
and such a forbidden love
tends to be so alluring…

220
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,184
What did Song Jun-ho say?

221
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,396
When's the meeting?

222
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,398
Okay.

223
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,819
Make sure Chi-yeol doesn't find out
about this before everything's set.

224
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,406
And have you been able to
reach Mr. Jin yet?

225
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,826
God, that bastard.

226
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,622
Why is he being a headache
on top of all this?

227
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,539
This is great.

228
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,750
One causes a mess,
and another goes missing.

229
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,876
Darn it.

230
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,588
What should we have?

231
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,006
How about kimchi stew?

232
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,965
Sure.

233
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,844
What is it, Lulu?

234
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,346
What are you barking at?

235
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,974
What? What's that?

236
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,559
What is it?

237
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,034
GANGHYEON POLICE STATION

238
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,830
The body was found in Incheon,
but they gave us jurisdiction.

239
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,039
How come?

240
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,583
It seems the body was abandoned
and floated down there.

241
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,211
Upon identification,
it turns out he was from this area.

242
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,297
He was a teacher

243
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,508
at The Pride Academy.

244
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,096
EVIDENCE 2, EVIDENCE 3

245
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,639
We need an autopsy to be sure.

246
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,767
But for now, they don't think he drowned.

247
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,311
If you look at the picture,

248
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,440
it's evident that he was hit
in the forehead with a blunt object.

249
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,277
Don't touch that. Just look at it.

250
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,444
This.

251
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,990
-What is this?
-A metal ball. Odd, right?

252
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,367
It was found in his pocket.

253
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,494
We're going to run a fingerprint
and DNA test.

254
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,454
Isn't this…

255
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,123
a dying message?

256
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,624
Right?

257
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,126
DYING MESSAGE:
A MURDER VICTIM'S LAST MESSAGE

258
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,962
I was so shocked
after watching that video.

259
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,881
Has Choi Chi-yeol gone insane?

260
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,425
Solving all those math questions
must've gotten to him.

261
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,719
Your dad doesn't know, does he?

262
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,430
I heard he offered to tutor you first.

263
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,223
Hold on.

264
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,352
Do you think he used you
as an excuse to approach your mom?

265
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,605
It's not like that.

266
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,108
Don't be ridiculous. He's total garbage.

267
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,193
Hey.

268
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,198
She said it's not like that.
You should believe your friend.

269
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,700
And can't you see
that I'm finally studying?

270
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,452
Please be quiet.

271
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,457
Fine. You can study, Geon-hu.

272
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,459
Bye.

273
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,960
Bye.

274
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,302
I'd be struggling too

275
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,429
if my mom had a scandal.

276
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,306
Well…

277
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,516
It's not common, you know?

278
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,978
And having such a handsome guy
sitting next to you

279
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
must make it hard to study, right?

280
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,570
You know what?

281
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,280
You're really not normal.

282
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,409
Yes. I agree with you.

283
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,246
Jeez.

284
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,211
I can't get used to
this sudden influx of customers.

285
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,797
We're already refilling the food.

286
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,591
I think we could sell out of everything
by the end of today.

287
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,676
You're right.

288
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,974
Chi-yeol, why is your phone off all day?

289
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,351
Call me when you get this.

290
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,061
Jeez.

291
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,064
What's wrong?

292
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,316
Don't call him. You shouldn't.

293
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,485
-Why not?
-Because…

294
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,364
No reason. Just listen to me.

295
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,866
No. He and I are close too.

296
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,745
He said I could call him whenever I want,
so I'll do just that.

297
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,957
Why are you doing this?
Give me back my phone!

298
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,960
Promise me you won't call him,
and I'll give it back.

299
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,670
No.

300
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,672
A promise is made when two sides agree.

301
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,674
But I don't agree with you.

302
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,217
That's why I can't promise.

303
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,344
Explain why I shouldn't--

304
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,930
You must promise. It's all for his sake.

305
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,851
I have my reasons for doing this.

306
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,104
Please don't call him, Jae-woo.

307
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,359
Okay, I won't.

308
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,738
I won't call him.

309
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,157
Give it back to me.

310
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,494
I won't call him.

311
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,307
I just can't understand you.

312
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,769
Do you really dislike him,
or are you forcing yourself to?

313
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,694
TODAY'S SPECIAL
ROLLED OMELET WITH POLLOCK ROE

314
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,779
Hey.

315
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,489
Gosh.

316
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,823
You're home early.

317
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,283
Yes, we didn't have CEA today.

318
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,910
CEA…

319
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,204
I don't know what that is.

320
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,122
There's still so much I have to learn.

321
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,040
Go home.

322
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,417
I've set out some hardboiled eggs
and sikhye on the table.

323
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,045
Also, can you do the laundry for me?
I forgot.

324
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,382
By the way… Auntie.

325
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,805
Do you like Mr. Choi too?

326
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,765
No--

327
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,726
It's not what you think.

328
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,645
He just said that to protect me…

329
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,274
Anyway, don't worry
and just focus on your studies. Okay?

330
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,319
Okay. I'm going home.

331
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,370
Get your head on straight.

332
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,834
Just focus on Hae-e for now.

333
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
Focus.

334
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,067
Uncle, are you upset?

335
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,736
Yes, I'm mad at Haeng-seon.

336
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,906
I'm worried about Chi-yeol,
but she won't let me call him.

337
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,992
Chi-yeol and I are close.

338
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,077
She's being a dictator.

339
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,120
She's ugly.

340
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,644
It's so green.

341
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,068
We all crave a cup of tea after lunch.

342
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,530
This cafe, located in Yeouido,
has a menu of…

343
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,585
What am I doing?

344
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,838
I have no one to meet.

345
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,919
Hey.

346
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,510
Why would a rich guy like you
have cup noodles?

347
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,850
No, I'm filthy rich.

348
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,355
Still bragging, aren't you?

349
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,192
Then treat me to a meal
since you're filthy rich.

350
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,654
How about

351
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,365
we grab a drink instead?

352
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,242
-Table 13.
-Enjoy.

353
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,577
Can we have more of this?

354
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,383
Hey.

355
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,678
Let me ask you one question.

356
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,515
It better be just one.

357
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,393
Did you…

358
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,939
really not know the truth
about the incident 12 years ago?

359
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,816
No, I didn't.

360
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,361
I really didn't.

361
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,988
I had no idea.

362
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,532
What an idiot.

363
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,620
I am.

364
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,461
I really am.

365
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,966
Even to this day…

366
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,512
I'm still an idiot.

367
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,475
But everyone

368
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,478
calls me the star teacher.

369
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,897
The Trillion Won Man.

370
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,910
How hilarious.

371
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,871
Hey.

372
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,801
Let's drink together.

373
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,221
You're an idiot,

374
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,766
and I'm your even more idiotic friend
that hates you.

375
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,071
Bottoms up.

376
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,880
You're wrong, you idiot.

377
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,882
I had a higher GPA than you.

378
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,800
I got a 4.3. Don't make me laugh.

379
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,594
For one semester, you idiot.

380
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,096
It was only for a single semester.

381
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,349
Jeez, no wonder you became a teacher.

382
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,518
That's right. I'm a teacher.

383
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,271
"I'm a teacher, and you're a…"

384
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,648
What are you?

385
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,401
I'm just a tormented guy.

386
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,945
Tormented?

387
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,281
Hey, do you think
I've never struggled in life?

388
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,659
You have no idea how well
I fill out official documents.

389
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,120
-I'll show you.
-Why would you show me that?

390
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,998
Hey, take a look at how good I am.

391
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,876
I'm so good at filling out
official documents

392
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,296
that the vice principal
always makes me do it.

393
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,964
But you…

394
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,718
Why don't I get paid as much as you do
when I have to do all this?

395
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,762
I don't make you fill them out.

396
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,937
I…

397
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,064
love my students.

398
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,777
I bet you don't feel the same way.
You don't know what love is.

399
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,033
No, I don't.

400
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:32,914
I don't know.

401
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,178
Hey, that's enough.

402
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,930
I have work tomorrow.

403
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,431
I don't.

404
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,602
-Can we have one more bottle of soju?
-Sure.

405
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,437
-No, make that two.
-Okay.

406
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,355
Wait…

407
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,315
But I'm drunk.

408
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,694
I shouldn't drink more, you idiot.

409
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,488
I'm not even a little bit drunk.

410
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,073
I wish I were.

411
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,993
But I'm not.

412
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,465
Cripes.

413
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,138
I miss her.

414
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,022
Cripes.

415
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,785
Hey, Chi-yeol.

416
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,541
He's long gone.

417
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,794
I don't even know where he lives.

418
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,672
Come on.

419
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,349
Haeng-seon.

420
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,560
It's Chi-yeol. What do I do?

421
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,688
Should I pick up?

422
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,150
You only said not to call him,
so I'm going to pick up.

423
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,236
I'm picking up.

424
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,156
Hi, Chi-yeol.

425
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,869
Hello, I'm Chi-yeol's friend.

426
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,955
Do you know where his house is?

427
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:19,956
Chi-yeol's house?

428
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,209
Chi-yeol's house?

429
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,595
Haeng-seon, I'm in front of his house.

430
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,516
It's okay. I can carry him.

431
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,228
Okay, Haeng-seon.

432
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,110
Chi-yeol--

433
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,614
Chi-yeol, what is your passcode?

434
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,285
What is your passcode?

435
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,414
Zero, two, seven, two, four.

436
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,326
Why…

437
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,080
Why did he drink so much?

438
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,513
He's burning up.

439
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,700
You're in my dreams again.

440
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,717
Let me be with you just this once.

441
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:32,523
Gosh.

442
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,026
What was that dream?

443
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,323
How will I get over her?

444
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,078
Cripes.

445
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,875
Darn it.

446
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,127
Darn it.

447
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,343
CHOI CHI-YEOL IN LOVE
WITH A MARRIED WOMAN

448
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,599
HOW DISGUSTING
THAT HE ANNOUNCED IT IN PUBLIC

449
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,731
STAR TEACHER? MORE LIKE STAR ADULTERER!

450
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,525
I'M SO FURIOUS I EVER LET MY KID
TAKE HIS CLASS

451
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,495
Your call cannot be completed.

452
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,539
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep…

453
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,712
Mr. Choi, call me when you see this.

454
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,494
Your call cannot be completed.

455
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,580
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep…

456
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,855
Your call cannot be completed…

457
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,508
How was the seokbakji from last time?
Was it all right?

458
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,344
It was so tasty.

459
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,138
My husband was asking for some
yesterday as well.

460
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,766
I'll make it again.
I hear fall radish is good for you.

461
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,683
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

462
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,018
-Thank you.
-Goodbye!

463
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,728
-Goodbye!
-Thank you!

464
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,693
Goodness, Mr. Ji, it's been a long time.

465
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,321
-Hello.
-You never stopped by even once.

466
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,075
I was wondering
if you could reach Mr. Choi.

467
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,868
Well…

468
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,287
The last time we talked was last week.

469
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,955
Can you not reach him?

470
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,504
No. His phone's turned off,
and he's not home.

471
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,048
So I wondered if he called you.

472
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,345
Okay. Goodbye then.

473
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,180
Goodbye.

474
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:59,063
If you ever get in touch with him,
please tell him to call me.

475
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:00,981
Thank you.

476
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,150
Sure.

477
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,529
Hey, what's going on?

478
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,656
Mr. Choi has gone off the radar?

479
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,075
He's even ghosted Mr. Ji?

480
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,163
Your call cannot be completed.

481
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,333
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep…

482
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,670
Where is he?

483
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,715
Your call cannot be completed.

484
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,759
You will be redirected to voicemail…

485
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,045
Goodbye.

486
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,630
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Come again!

487
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,340
-I will.
-Come again!

488
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,260
-Do you have braised pollock?
-Yes, we do.

489
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,429
This isn't braised pollack.

490
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,431
-Goodness.
-Yes, we do!

491
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,184
-Gosh.
-Here you go.

492
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,643
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.

493
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,146
I guess there was only one.

494
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,230
Jae-woo.

495
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,734
You can go home. I think we'll close soon.

496
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,069

STAR PLUS, 20% COUPON…

497
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,285
Beef, stir-fried eggs,

498
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,412
and braised pollock.

499
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,790
Jeez, I'm so exhausted.

500
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,877
Drink this and come to your senses.

501
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,588
What do you mean? I'm fine.

502
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,256
Don't lie.

503
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,134
You've been out of it
ever since Mr. Ji stopped by.

504
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,596
Don't worry.

505
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,139
He's a grown man.

506
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,350
I'm sure he's out to get some fresh air.

507
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,644
He's been pushed to the brink.

508
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,938
He's softer than he seems.

509
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,650
You say you're not interested in him,
yet you're worried sick.

510
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,151
Will you still deny it?

511
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,782
Yeong-ju.

512
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,785
I need to go somewhere. I'm sorry.

513
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,120
-Please wrap up without me.
-Where are you going?

514
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,498
Where are you going?

515
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,590
Sir, can you take me to Gimpo?

516
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,883
I only drive within Seoul.

517
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,635
I'll double the pay.

518
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,053
Please.

519
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,555
Thank you.

520
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,120
Mr. Choi!

521
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,334
Mr. Choi Chi-yeol!

522
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,226
Why are you here?

523
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,020
"Why"?

524
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,772
"Why"?

525
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,149
I'd like to ask you the same question.

526
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,194
You should've told those around you
if you were going somewhere.

527
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,279
You're not a rebellious teenager anymore!

528
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,323
Why would you worry me like that?

529
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,785
You deliberately confused me.

530
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,372
If you were going to get over me,
you should've done so quietly.

531
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,248
Why did you have to make me go crazy?

532
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,509
What I'm trying to say is
that I was worried about you.

533
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,180
Why?

534
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,725
Did you think
I'd kill myself because of you?

535
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,561
No, it's not that.

536
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,860
-To be honest--
-It seems you don't know me very well.

537
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,364
I'm incredibly narcissistic.

538
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,206
Treat me to a meal.

539
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,292
I haven't eaten anything,
and I'm starving.

540
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,387
SU-JA'S CHUEOTANG

541
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,893
You said you were starving.
Why come all the way here?

542
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,399
Are you not eating?

543
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,694
I'm okay.

544
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,830
Do you remember when I told you

545
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,041
about my savior
back when we were camping?

546
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,005
She used to run this place.

547
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,507
Seon's Cafeteria.

548
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,886
Does that mean--

549
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,763
I lived in this area
while studying to become a teacher.

550
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,602
And your mother fed me countless times.

551
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,522
I could only have one meal a day,
and it was at this place.

552
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,737
She was always so generous to me.

553
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,869
I think she mentioned you several times.

554
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,749
She said you were poor
but studied hard for the exam.

555
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,836
You were like a son to her,
so she wanted to take care of you.

556
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,551
How could this be…

557
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,055
I was surprised too
when we came here last time.

558
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,516
I couldn't believe this coincidence.

559
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,197
I came to visit her after
becoming a teacher at the academy.

560
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,866
But the sign had changed.

561
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,664
I wanted to show her
how successful I'd become.

562
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,375
I owe so much to her.

563
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,879
SU-JA'S CHUEOTANG

564
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,090
And I've finally come to a conclusion.

565
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,176
What?

566
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,721
I thought long and hard.

567
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,349
And I think…

568
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,312
I was just confused.

569
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,693
My gratitude towards your mother,

570
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,321
and how big of a coincidence this is.

571
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,701
Because it felt so special to me,

572
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,745
perhaps…

573
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,873
I mistook that as feelings for you.

574
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,212
Or maybe I went momentarily crazy
due to boredom.

575
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,758
But I've come to my senses…

576
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,970
after seeing your face.

577
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:20,439
I should go back to where I belong.

578
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,859
You should go in.

579
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:06,777
And…

580
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,279
I'm sorry for worrying you.

581
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,120
By the way,

582
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,957
I'll pay the full rent from now on.
Let me do that.

583
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,920
That's okay.
I halved everyone else's anyway.

584
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,508
Take care.

585
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,136
Good luck with your business too.

586
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,596
Thank you.

587
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,672
Haeng-seon.

588
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,550
What's going on? Where have you been?

589
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,467
Answer me.

590
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,137
Did you go looking for Mr. Choi?

591
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,515
So? Did you find him?

592
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,272
Answer me, will you?

593
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,982
Cat got your tongue?

594
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,943
Yeong-ju, Mr. Choi said…

595
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,571
that he got over me.

596
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,990
He said he was just confused.

597
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:40,620
It all worked out for the best,
but my heart is ripped into shreds.

598
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,331
I must've liked him.

599
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,626
I must've liked him a lot, Yeong-ju.

600
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,835
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

601
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,670
Mom, I'm off to school.

602
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,464
-Hae-e, have some of this.
-What?

603
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,842
-Today is the math performance assessment.
-I need to go and read this--

604
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,970
Okay, but you need
some carbs to fuel your brain.

605
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,306
Right, and take one of these.

606
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,225
It's a must-have for test takers.

607
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,644
Squeeze it.

608
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,941
Well done.

609
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,526
-Happy? I'm leaving now.
-Okay.

610
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,320
-Good luck!
-Okay.

611
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,613
-You can do it!
-Thanks.

612
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,920
Good morning.

613
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,840
Did you all get some good rest?

614
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,138
Where's everyone else?

615
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,308
Did you not tell them
to show up for work today?

616
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,644
I did.

617
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:30,856
But they must've looked
for other jobs while you were gone.

618
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,774
They apologized for leaving so abruptly.

619
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,026
Hyo-won too?

620
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,820
Yes.

621
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,323
I'd just managed to memorize their names.

622
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,744
That's okay.
We're just colleagues, not family.

623
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,459
You, top student at your med school.

624
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,586
Yeon-gyeong.

625
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,920
Yeon-gyeong.

626
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,130
Do-jin, the bread lover.

627
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,799
-No, Do-jun--
-Seo-jin. It's Hyeon Seo-jin.

628
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,717
-Seo-jin.
-Yes.

629
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,553
Yeon-gyeong and Seo-jin.
Okay, I won't forget your names.

630
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,847
Yeon-gyeong, print out the test material.

631
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,308
-Seo-jin, print out the Q and A list.
-Okay.

632
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,934
The CSAT repeater class is at ten?

633
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,561
Yes, you have about 30 minutes.

634
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,105
No way, I'm so touched.

635
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,857
I'm no longer just "kid."

636
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,985
Taking some time off
must have changed him.

637
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,153
He feels more human.

638
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,238
This feels so strange.

639
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,742
I'm nervous after taking two weeks off.

640
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,161
Just be yourself.

641
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:30,123
"Pride maketh math.
For math, Choi Chi-yeol."

642
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,877
We've spent years together,
but you still haven't mastered it.

643
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,838
Pride maketh math.

644
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,507
For math, Choi Chi-yeol.

645

SPECIAL MATH

646
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,698
Oh, no! I'm sorry.

647
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,201
I totally forgot to call you, Mr. Ji.

648
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,663
We switched your classroom.

649
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,956
I'm sorry.

650
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,627
It's nice to meet you in person.

651
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,587
Hello, I'm Song Jun-ho.

652
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,006
I see.

653
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,602
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

654
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,312
This is nice and cozy.

655
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,238
The microphone isn't set up.

656
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:51,871
The teachers don't use a microphone here
since it's a small classroom.

657
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,332
But if you want,
I'll set it up for you next week.

658
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,961
Do you think you could just
speak a bit louder for today?

659
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,964
-Okay. I'll do that.
-Thank you.

660
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,935
Does this mean
you guys are the loyal ones?

661
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,564
I'm close enough to see your pores.
How nice.

662
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,275
I might even memorize all your names.

663
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,992
Let's begin.

664
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,454
You reviewed trigonometric functions
for the past two weeks.

665
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,914
Now, we will learn about sequences.

666
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,673
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

667
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,385
-Did you find anything?
-No, nothing definite yet.

668
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,220
We need to look around more.

669
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,478
Can I retrieve the evidence now?

670
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,520
Yes.

671
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,491
METAL BALL CASE
BODY FOUND ON OCTOBER 11, 7:45 P.M.

672
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,659
LEE YOUNG-MIN
FELL FROM THE PRIDE ACADEMY BUILDING

673
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,786
-Sir.
-Yes?

674
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,954
We retrieved the victim's call records.

675
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,791
-Really?
-Based on his time of death,

676
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,002
he must've been killed near his house
or around that area

677
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,712
before being tossed into the river.

678
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,714
Let's wait for the results.

679
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,718
First, check the CCTV cameras
in his building and around that area.

680
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,221
Remember the guy
from the convenience store

681
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,597
during Lee Young-min's case?

682
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,807
Hey!

683
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,268
Didn't I tell you to keep
Lee Young-min's case out of this?

684
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,312
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

685
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,189
Do you think I'm a joke?

686
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:45,735
Just look into Jin I-sang's case
and don't connect it to that one!

687
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,364
Just because they're both from The Pride
doesn't mean this is a serial murder.

688
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,116
It doesn't mean it's not.

689
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,451
Metal balls were found
at both crime scenes.

690
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,954
This time, it was in the victim's pocket.

691
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,455
We've requested a warrant.

692
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,291
We're going to bring
as many men as possible

693
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,877
to look around Saeam Vista,
the assumed crime scene.

694
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:04,921
That's all.

695
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,883
Why, that little…

696
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,760
Darn it.

697
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:19,018
I really didn't want things
to go this far either.

698
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:24,190
But you know very well
how extreme these moms can be.

699
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,944
They don't want a teacher
with moral issues teaching their kids.

700
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,156
They were blowing up our phones.

701
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,366
So what choice did I have?

702
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,495
Students were dropping out,
and the parents were demanding a solution.

703
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:42,167
So I urgently reached out to Song Jun-ho.

704
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,296
Our vice director is a close friend
of a college alumnus of his.

705
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,257
Yes, I understand.

706
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,925
Right? You do, right?

707
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,636
Exactly. I knew you'd understand.

708
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,305
However,

709
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,685
I don't see the need
for both him and me to work here.

710
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,774
I'm afraid I'll have to resign
from The Pride.

711
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,613
Look. You don't have to be so extreme.

712
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,364
Let's take some time and think--

713
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,824
Thank you for everything.

714
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,328
But…

715
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,706
It's such a pity
for us to part ways like this.

716
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,626
Jeez, my heart is breaking.

717
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,835
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

718
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,967
Hello.

719
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,094
It's been a long time.

720
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,514
What brings you here?

721
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,556
Well…

722
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,226
We keep finding reasons to come back here.

723
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:45,813
Goodbye then.

724
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,940
Goodbye.

725
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,446
Is he an assistant?

726
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,823
He looks familiar.

727
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,082
Good work.

728
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,042
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

729
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,586
Hey, Hae-e.

730
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,464
What was this test?

731
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,343
I didn't even get the questions.

732
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:19,639
I read each question ten times,
but I still couldn't understand.

733
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,141
Our school always gives
hard free-response questions for math.

734
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,227
This test isn't as important
as the midterms,

735
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,396
so just focus on redeeming yourself then.

736
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,773
Hae-e.

737
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,278
Why was the assessment so hard this time?
I'm done for.

738
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,446
Hey, did you get 14 for the last question?

739
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,906
-What?
-Can I see?

740
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,409
-I got 14 too.
-Hey, don't cross-check.

741
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,911
You have no manners.
I couldn't even begin solving it.

742
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,246
Dan-ji.

743
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,456
Forget about them.

744
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,166
Let's drink this.

745
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,170
Nothing like something tasty
when you're stressed.

746
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,891
Hey, you better not cross-check.

747
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,936
Or I'll chew you guys up
like this coconut jelly.

748
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,232
Fine, I won't.

749
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,109
Fine.

750
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,447
No way. This is shocking.

751
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,699
My mom sent me a link.

752
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,369
They removed Mr. Choi's photo
from The Pride's website.

753
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,746
He must've gotten sacked.

754
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,914
Are you sure? Maybe he's on another page.

755
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,917
No, I think they just kicked him out.

756
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,837
But then again, he DOOG.

757
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,921
DOOG: DIG ONE'S OWN GRAVE

758
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,632
But this is harsh, right?

759
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:09,499
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

760
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,095
Hey, Hae-e.

761
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,639
-Mr. Choi.
-I…

762
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,057
I was just passing by

763
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,393
and remembered
I had to send an urgent email.

764
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,690
I'll get going then.
Good luck with your midterms.

765
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,151
Okay.

766
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:31,956
Mom.

767
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,250
When did you get here?

768
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:41,132
I came outside to get some sunlight
since the weather was so nice.

769
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,135
Staying indoors all the time
has made me lack vitamin C.

770
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,971
Vitamin D.

771
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:48,806
Big difference.

772
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,435
Anyway, care to come inside?
I made some japchae.

773
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,021
That's okay. I'll just go home.

774
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,607
All right. Go rest up.

775
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,403
The weather is lovely today.

776
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:03,696
-Bye!
-Bye.

777
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,183
LAWYER JANG SEO-JIN

778
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,101
Sun-jae goes to The Pride, right?

779
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,355
Why the sudden interest?

780
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:38,773
I'm a parent too.

781
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,818
I may not be as extreme as you,
but I'm not uninterested in him.

782
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,444
Why are you here?

783
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,698
I was at the police station with my client
to get the plaintiff's statement

784
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,951
and overheard some officers talking.

785
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,495
One of their teachers was killed.

786
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,081
A student fell to his death recently too.

787
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,707
Are you sure about that academy?

788
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,417
Is it safe?

789
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:03,798
Who was the teacher?

790
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,550
I don't know. I didn't get the name.

791
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,428
They were mentioning
a metal ball serial murder or something.

792
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:14,559
On my way here,
I saw officers patrolling Saeam Vista.

793
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,352
That must be where the teacher lived.

794
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:21,232
SAEAM VISTA

795
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,276
What are you up to, Hui-jae?

796
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,904
Why are you here?

797
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,992
Look into it
and switch academies if need be.

798
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,286
How will he focus there?

799
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:49,719
HUI-JAE

800
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:54,891
Your call cannot be completed…

801
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,327
Stop staring.
You'll bore a hole right through me.

802
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,370
I wasn't looking at you.

803
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,249
I was looking outside
to check the weather.

804
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,251
The weather is lovely.

805
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,465
Should we have burgers later?

806
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,382
I'm down.

807
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,552
I want a cheeseburger with extra cheese,
no pickles or mayo.

808
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:32,887
Sure.

809
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,891
Or how about some jajangmyeon?
Let's order some.

810
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:38,976
I'm craving some.

811
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,562
I'm down. I want fried rice
with no carrots or peas.

812
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,356
Sure. I'm fine with anything.

813
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,316
Jae-woo.

814
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,735
Call Hae-e and ask what she wants.

815
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,237
Okay, hold on. I'm watching something.

816
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,531
You've been on your phone all day.

817
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,950
Do you want to die? Hurry up.

818
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:56,577
-You bastard.
-That little…

819
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,957
Mr. Popular! Haeng-seon.

820
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,459
He's on his way to see Chi-yeol.

821
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,590
MR. POPULAR WILL MEET
THE ADULTERER, CHOI CHI-YEOL

822
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,093
Welcome to Mr. Popular's World.

823
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,846
I, Mr. Popular, was the first
to reveal his love interest

824
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,141
and played a big role
in revealing the truth.

825
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:25,356
Today, I will finally meet
the star adulterer, Choi Chi-yeol,

826
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,566
and hear his thoughts.

827
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:32,154
Let's find out how he feels
about his great fall from his peak

828
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:36,575
and see if he's still in love
with that married woman.

829
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,663
Where could he be? Beats me.

830
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:44,375
Where could he be? Right here.

831
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:47,253
"For math, Choi Chi-yeol."

832
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,840
This is his math academy building.

833
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,384
Let's go inside.

834
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,846
Welcome to Mr. Popular's World.
Let's get it.

835
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,936
Let's deliver the test materials
to the students before I quit.

836
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,566
I'll get their email addresses
and reach out to them.

837
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,156
Mr. Choi, it's nice to meet you in person.

838
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,116
You're so handsome.

839
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:18,909
Who are you?

840
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,829
I'm Mr. Popular,
delivering hot news faster than anyone.

841
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,497
Welcome to Mr. Popular's World.

842
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,166
WHO'S THAT GUY?
IT'S MR. JI!

843
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,250
Mr. Popular?

844
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:30,046
Guys, Mr. Choi knows me.

845
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,839
That'll be enough. Thank you.

846
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:37,636
Is it true that you
no longer work at The Pride?

847
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,972
How does it feel to hit rock bottom?

848
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,057
Just leave!

849
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,809
You can't seem to answer me.
Then next question.

850
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,563
How do you feel about her now?
Are you still in love?

851
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,024
How do you feel about being
the center of a cheating scandal?

852
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,275
It's not a scandal!

853
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,611
What?

854
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,615
I KNOW HER!
WHAT?

855
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:58,991
WHO IS SHE?
FROM WOORIM HIGH!

856
01:07:59,075 --> 01:07:59,909
WOW
SHE'S PRETTY

857
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:00,993
SHE'S MY TYPE
ANYONE HAVE HER NUMBER?

858
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,036
It's not a scandal.

859
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,121
Hae-e.

860
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,374
It's Hae-e.

861
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,834
Haeng-seon, it's Hae-e.

862
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,212
Why is she there?

863
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,297
She went to see Mr. Choi?

864
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,761
Because my mom…

865
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,223
isn't actually

866
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,308
my mom.

867
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,104
She's my aunt, and she's single.

868
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,397
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN?
NO WAY

869
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,149
So this isn't a scandal.

870
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,318
It's just a romance.

871
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,653
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SERIOUSLY?

872
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,904
ROMANCE?
SHE SAID ROMANCE!

873
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,275
EPILOGUE

874
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:15,442
Mr. Choi is sick?

875
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,279
Exactly how is he sick?

876
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,241
I don't know, but his face is red and hot.

877
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,370
He's burning up. What should I do?

878
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:57,276
You're in my dreams again.

879
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,124
Let me be with you just this once.

880
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,378
At least in my dreams.

881
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,257
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

882
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,008
This is such a huge mess.

883
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,385
You like her too.

884
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,303
-Right?
-Nam Hae-e.

885
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,472
Express your feelings to the man you like.

886
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:09,473
And go on dates.

887
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,351
I guess I was the only one who missed you.

888
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:16,438
What about you?
When did you start having feelings for me?

889
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,233
The police are investigating the case
to find the killer.

890
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,026
Why on earth were you there?

891
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,988
Hui-jae! What's wrong?

892
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,990
The police think he was murdered.

893
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,534
Why do these incidents keep occurring?

894
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:38,836
