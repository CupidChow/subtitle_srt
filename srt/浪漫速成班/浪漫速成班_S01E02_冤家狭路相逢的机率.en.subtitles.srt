00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,607
EPISODE 2

3
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,196
Well…

4
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,452
Enroll me in the star teacher
Choi Chi-yeol's math course.

5
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,371
The star teacher Choi Chi-yeol?

6
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,288
Yes.

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,415
Math is my biggest hurdle.

8
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,626
Can I take just that course, please?

9
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,643
"Nation's Best"?

10
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:35,864
PROBABILITY OF ENCOUNTERING
YOUR ENEMY AT YOUR WORST

11
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,972
-Here.
-Thank you.

12
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,433
It's all yours, so slow down.

13
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,519
Do you want more
rolled omelets and anchovies?

14
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,857
Maybe just some more anchovies.

15
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,941
Jae-woo.

16
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,572
Anchovies.

17
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,489
Okay.

18
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,366
Goodness.

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,076
No matter the reason,

20
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,289
a grown man like you should eat
at least twice a day to function properly.

21
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,542
How do you manage to live
with only a single meal from here?

22
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,758
Preparing for the civil service exam?

23
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,468
No, the teacher certification exam.

24
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,054
You want to become a teacher? Why?

25
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,847
It's my father's wish.

26
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,808
He regrets not having studied much.

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,519
What a great son you are.

28
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,980
Kids these days
don't listen to their parents.

29
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,775
My daughters certainly don't.

30
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,526
They do the exact opposite of what I say.

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,862
They're going to be the death of me.

32
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Eat up.

33
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,205
Excuse me.

34
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,042
Hello?

35
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,642
Father.

36
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,313
Father!

37
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,819
Dad! Why?

38
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,991
He came by recently after getting hit
by a bike while picking up scrap paper.

39
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,576
I insisted that he get an MRI scan,

40
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,578
but he refused, saying he wasn't in pain

41
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,497
and didn't want to waste any money.

42
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,418
He likely died due to internal bleeding.

43
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,723
Come in and eat.

44
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,519
I've used up my meal tickets.

45
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,230
Cripes. I never asked for one.

46
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,151
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

47
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,235
Hurry up.

48
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,866
Cripes, don't make me repeat myself.
Just come in.

49
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,221
Mom!

50
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,347
Haeng-seon.

51
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,141
Guess who's here?

52
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,893
It's your national athlete daughter.

53
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,854
-Salute.
-Why are you here?

54
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,939
You should be training
if the match is over.

55
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,650
Come on, I need to rest too.

56
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,194
I can't always be training.

57
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,280
-I missed home-cooked meals.
-Cripes, don't be ridiculous.

58
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,323
This isn't our house.

59
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,576
Help out if you want some food. Come here.

60
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,453
Fine.

61
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,330
Stop pretending like
you're not happy to see me.

62
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,915
Here. Give this to him.

63
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,251
Gosh, that's hot.

64
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,048
Be careful. It's hot.

65
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,514
Is he crying?

66
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,768
-Did he get dumped or something?
-This won't be an easy hunt.

67
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,481
-Cry all you want.
-Its location has been exposed.

68
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,859
-The hunt…
-Hello.

69
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,323
Mom.

70
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,880
She's my daughter. Her name is Hae-e.

71
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,550
Please take care of her
for the time being.

72
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,009
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,637
"For the time being"?

74
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,598
Exactly how long is she talking about?

75
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,643
How dare she ask us for help

76
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,645
when she left and cut all ties with us?

77
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,646
What is this?

78
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,692
What does she expect you to do?

79
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,906
Hey, kid.

80
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,329
Did your mom drop you off here?

81
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,584
Where did she go?

82
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,422
Cripes, that little brat.

83
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,593
Mom! She's long gone now.

84
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,729
Again?

85
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,065
You skipped practice last week
with the same excuse.

86
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,693
My brother had his checkup then.
Today, it's my niece.

87
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,155
The daycare center took her to the ER,

88
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,699
but her fever isn't breaking,
and she's looking for me.

89
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,617
Nam Haeng-seon.

90
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,911
You think this is a welfare facility?

91
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,662
I can't excuse you every time.

92
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,289
You must think you're entitled

93
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,625
after I cut you some slack
since your mom's death.

94
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,668
You're not the only breadwinner here!

95
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
I'm sorry.

96
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,673
-But just for today--
-And she's not even your daughter!

97
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,092
Forget it.

98
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,678
I don't care how good you are.
I won't allow this.

99
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm warning you.

100
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,681
You better not leave.

101
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,809
I'll let you go if your niece dies.

102
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,938
What?

103
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,356
What's with that glare?

104
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,276
So just pick one.
Is it your niece or handball?

105
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,861
Pick one!

106
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,406
In that case…

107
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,535
I'll quit.

108
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,245
What?

109
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,247
Stop right there.

110
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,332
I'll kick you out for good
if you leave now!

111
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,125
You better never set foot back here!

112
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,338
Haeng-seon.

113
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,216
Are you serious? What's wrong with you?

114
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,510
I would've had to quit
in the end, Yeong-ju.

115
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,387
This is as far as I go.

116
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,027
-Mom!
-Mom!

117
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,946
Mom!

118
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,916
Hae-e!

119
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,671
Hello.

120
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,174
I'm sorry, Hae-e. Did you wait long?

121
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,845
I was going to come on time,
but customers suddenly came.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
Hae-e.

123
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,777
Are you mad at me?

124
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,571
Are you?

125
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,406
Is it because I was late?

126
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,908
Cut me some slack.

127
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,244
Your auntie is trying
to make ends meet here.

128
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,830
Do you want some ice cream?

129
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,333
The expensive one that comes in a tub.

130
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,876
I'll buy you one.

131
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,421
Auntie.

132
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,090
Hae-e, what's wrong?

133
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,301
Did something happen today?

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,597
Can I just call you Mom?

135
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,189
Sure.

136
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,399
Why not?

137
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
Don't cry.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,154
Hae-e!

139
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,281
Mom!

140
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,139
Hey, that's enough.

141
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,142
Are you punishing yourself?

142
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,020
Stop.

143
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,236
This is nice.

144
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,698
Let's close the shop early
every now and then and relax.

145
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,867
We rarely have customers
at this hour anyway.

146
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,371
I said that was enough.

147
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,958
Can you please stop blaming yourself?

148
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,502
I just feel so pathetic.

149
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,048
I had no idea Hae-e wanted
to attend an academy.

150
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,384
I considered myself lucky

151
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,762
that she didn't want private classes
and counted my blessings.

152
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,347
Why am I so dense, Yeong-ju?

153
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,267
Hey, it's not your fault.

154
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,311
How would you have known
when she never expressed it?

155
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,188
It's not like you can read her mind.

156
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,941
I should've known.
She's not the type to express herself.

157
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,570
After how much she struggled back then…

158
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,906
I thought everything was fine.

159
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,869
I told myself that she was adjusting
just fine to make myself feel better.

160
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,287
I was busy making ends meet.

161
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,706
Am I working too hard?

162
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,417
How is that a problem?

163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,669
Slacking off would be an issue.

164
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,006
I think I'm something special
when I'm actually just like everyone else.

165
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,469
Hey, how is your life
just like everyone else's?

166
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,346
You have a disabled brother
and a niece your sister abandoned.

167
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,267
Let's be frank.
You did all but breastfeed her.

168
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,228
You're basically her mother.

169
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,481
She's the reason why
you quit the national team.

170
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,069
If anyone ever bad-mouths you,
I'll kill them.

171
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,576
That was…

172
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
pretty touching.

173
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,041
I meant that, you brat.

174
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,960
Not everyone is like you.

175
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,921
I truly

176
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,839
admire you.

177
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,757
Seriously.

178
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,885
I don't deserve to be admired.

179
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,929
I still lack so much.

180
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,556
Hey, moms make mistakes too.

181
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,767
You can always redeem yourself.

182
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,437
Understand Hae-e's wishes
and give her your support.

183
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,941
Show everyone
what a passionate mom looks like.

184
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,693
-Do you think it's possible?
-Of course.

185
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,696
It's not that you couldn't do it.
You just never considered it.

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,739
Aren't I right?

187
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,625
It'll be a cakewalk.
I've lived around here for years now.

188
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,044
I'll just visit her school and academy

189
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,588
and gather some information.

190
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,720
Ms. Nam.

191
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,307
I rarely tell parents this.

192
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,644
But you owe your daughter an apology.

193
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,314
She could've easily become
the top student.

194
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,984
How could you have neglected her?

195
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,653
That's why I've decided
to support her from now on.

196
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:27,074
I hear the most popular math teacher
is the star teacher here.

197
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,201
Yes. He's Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

198
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,079
You're in luck.

199
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,124
Enrollment for his next course
starts tomorrow.

200
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,001
Really? Tomorrow?

201
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,252
However,

202
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,004
and I'm not sure if you know this,

203
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,715
it won't be easy to sign up.

204
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,636
Let me introduce
an online community site to you.

205
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,431
It's called Skymom.net.

206
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,059
Read up on some enrollment
and admission tips.

207
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,480
As we speak,
I'm pretty sure a war is brewing

208
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,066
among the neighborhood moms

209
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,193
because of tomorrow's enrollment.

210
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,115
Is Perfect M crazy or what?

211
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,826
How could they overlap
their English course enrollment

212
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,453
with Choi Chi-yeol's?

213
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,996
-Darn it.
-It's a counterattack.

214
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,497
From what I know,

215
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,376
Perfect M tried to recruit him,
but he never budged.

216
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,462
They've overlapped the dates on purpose.

217
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,463
Unbelievable.

218
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,007
Because their star teacher
for English is more popular.

219
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,508
Is that why?

220
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,428
-Why would they--
-Excuse me! Another beer, please!

221
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,471
Stop drinking.

222
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,890
-You won't be able to wake up tomorrow.
-Why?

223
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,892
You said alcohol ruined your life.

224
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,602
She was 22 and drunk

225
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,479
when she slept with Dan-ji's dad.

226
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,272
Be quiet!

227
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,066
Keep your mouth shut! That's TMI.

228
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,275
-Don't believe her.
-Anyway,

229
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
even if I have to
give up on the English course,

230
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,405
I'll make sure my kid
gets signed up for Mr. Choi's course.

231
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,075
-My kid needs to take English too.
-Mine too.

232
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,577
-My husband should take the day off
-This isn't right.

233
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,954
so we can get both classes.

234
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,206
-Exactly.
-Or should I hire a line stander?

235
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,376
Are you even listening? Darn it.

236
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,252
I'm going to ask Sun-jae's mom.

237
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,837
TO: SUN-JAE'S MOM
HI SUN-JAE'S MOM

238
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,673
CAN YOU CONNECT ME WITH A LINE STANDER…

239
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,518
Come in.

240
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,228
Ms. Jang.

241
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,815
Can you look over this?

242
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,191
You can leave it here.

243
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,109
Wait.

244
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,278
Can you cancel
my evening meeting tomorrow?

245
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,656
I'll be leaving early
due to an important matter.

246
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,157
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,833
You really cried?

248
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,710
Yes.

249
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,378
I did.

250
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,214
Profusely.

251
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,216
And you finished an entire meal?

252
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,134
Yes.

253
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,719
I did.

254
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,473
What is going on with me?
Do I have bipolar disorder?

255
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,892
I don't think so.

256
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,064
Due to your obsession and anxiety
about maintaining your position,

257
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,358
you're suffering
from eating and sleep disorders.

258
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,778
So the fact that
you found something you can eat

259
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,697
is quite hopeful.

260
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,949
You didn't throw up…

261
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,994
You weren't nauseous, were you?

262
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,328
Not at all.

263
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,206
My stomach felt fine,
and I didn't even need sleeping pills.

264
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,919
It felt nice.

265
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,130
I felt relieved.

266
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,633
What about that female student?

267
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,219
Does she still keep appearing?

268
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,057
Well, every now and then.

269
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
This is great.

270
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,730
This seems like a good sign,
so let's see how it goes.

271
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,649
This could be a temporary thing,

272
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,609
or perhaps

273
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,612
it's the beginning of an emotional change.

274
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,201
That'd be T. All right.

275
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,953
Considering that it's squared,
what would T be?

276
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,874
-It would be two.
-It would be two.

277
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,709
-Next.
-That was superb.

278
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,754
Gosh, I have a knack for talking.

279
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,631
I'll use this again in my senior class.

280
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,383
If you calculate the sequence
based on this equation, M is…

281
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
-Hello.
-Hello.

282
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,555
Hello.

283
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,310
I guess we're keeping this here.

284
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,687
Hey, Hyo-jin.

285
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,981
You cut your hair, didn't you?

286
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,817
It's Hyo-won, Mr. Choi.

287
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,027
And my hair's been the same
this whole year.

288
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,614
Right? It looks perfect and natural.

289
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,533
Print out a test paper for me, Hyo-jin.

290
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,328
This is so demotivating.

291
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,579
I give up.

292
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,498
I'll just change my name to Hyo-jin.

293
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,459
He seems to be in a good mood today.

294
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,378
Did he have some ginseng on his day off?

295
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,295
I know, right?

296
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,631
I looked around
to see if there were any cameras.

297
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,383
That's how he sounds when teaching.

298
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,384
-Shocking.
-Hey.

299
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,761
Let's ask for a vacation
since he's in a good mood.

300
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,013
We've been working endlessly
since winter break.

301
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,474
We can't do that when Season 2
is around the corner.

302
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,725
If you're that desperate,

303
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll ask him after Season 2 classes begin.

304
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,646
-Okay.
-Okay.

305
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,982
-Okay.
-We got turned down already.

306
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,234
That's Royal Consort Ji for you.

307
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,402
Royal Consort Ji?

308
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,154
He's like Royal Consort Jang.

309
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,448
He's always right beside Mr. Choi
and doesn't let anyone approach him.

310
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,868
-A perfect nickname.
-He could win the king's favor.

311
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,704
-"Your Majesty."
-Stop that!

312
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,998
Here's your coffee, sir.

313
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,293
The admission talk show starts at 6 p.m.

314
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,753
-Here are the expected questions.
-Thanks.

315
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,964
The association is loving it.

316
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,842
They didn't expect you,
a money-grubber, to do this.

317
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,802
Do they think I'm a miser?

318
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,181
I'm not a money-grubber.
I just have my priorities.

319
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,765
Time is precious to me.

320
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,352
I like the purpose behind this,
and anyone can come for free.

321
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,104
I know.

322
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,315
Right, Mr. Ji.

323
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,317
The lunch box you gave me yesterday.

324
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,694
It said "Nation's Best Banchan" on it.

325
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,279
Is that the name of the store?

326
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,197
Yes.

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,991
People like it because they can
pick the side dishes themselves.

328
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,075
Did you like it?

329
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,661
Yes, it wasn't bad.

330
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,746
Let's go there today.

331
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,040
-You too?
-You said I could pick the side dishes.

332
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,666
I'll pick them myself.

333
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,753
You must've really liked it then.

334
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,173
You hate wasting your time
even when it comes to eating.

335
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,342
I'm so proud of myself.

336
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,344
My doctor told me to eat well.

337
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,222
I know my time is valuable,
but my body comes first.

338
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,184
Should I be more charismatic

339
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,061
during this upcoming talk show?

340
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,855
Adding a bit of humor
would be better, right?

341
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,107
Yes.

342
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,111
Did that answer your question?

343
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,613
Let's move on to the next one.

344
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,114
2ND ADMISSION TALK SHOW
WITH STAR TEACHER CHOI CHI-YEOL

345
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,951
STUDY MATH FIERCELY WITH CHOI CHI-YEOL!

346
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,410
-Hello.
-Hello.

347
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,914
I am a mother of a daughter in 11th grade.

348
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,000
Whenever she takes an exam,

349
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,128
she runs out of time
and fails to fill in all the answers.

350
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,216
During her usual studies, however,
she completes most questions.

351
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,427
What should we do in this situation?

352
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,139
Time management is extremely important.

353
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,475
Since she's smart to begin with,

354
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,896
she just needs to find a way
to secure enough time to solve

355
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,984
the killer questions,
which are numbers 21, 29, and 30.

356
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,488
One killer question requires
at least 15 to 20 minutes to answer.

357
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,117
She needs to complete
the other questions in 40 minutes to SWFC.

358
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,539
That means
to "succeed with flying colors".

359
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,165
Please forgive me.

360
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,877
This is the result of teaching Gen Z.

361
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:41,133
Anyway, she should use a timer
when studying on a normal basis.

362
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,927
This time, how about
we get a question from a student?

363
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,637
Yes?

364
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,811
I'm an avid fan of yours,

365
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,147
so I even skipped school
and came here from Daegu.

366
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,943
Mr. Choi, could you please show us
your signature move?

367
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,446
I only saw it online,
so I'd love to see it in person.

368
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,408
I don't think this is the right place
to show off my kick…

369
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,452
But I'll do it!

370
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,288
You even skipped school for this.

371
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,497
What do you say?

372
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,124
How about my signature dance move?

373
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,710
You've got to hand it to him.

374
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,962
He's normally so cold

375
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,256
and hates moving around.

376
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,926
-Thank you for that kick, Mr. Choi.
-He's the epitome of a cappie.

377
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,386
-Please applaud.
-Gosh.

378
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,471
Cappie?

379
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,598
A capitalist pig.

380
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,184
He's only doing that to make money.

381
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,101
Gosh.

382
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,563
Let's move on to the next question.

383
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,983
Let me repeat myself once again.

384
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,445
I will need help
from both of you tomorrow.

385
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,200
Whether Hae-e can enroll
in that star teacher's course or not

386
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,162
depends on your cooperation, my effort,

387
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,290
and one percent luck.

388
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,376
Just cut to the chase.
What do we need to do?

389
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,629
Jeez.

390
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
-Is this it?
-Yes.

391
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,939
"Nation's Best Banchan."

392
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,941
It's cleaner than I thought.

393
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,276
They have great food. You first.

394
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,870
Let's go.

395
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,122
What's wrong?

396
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,498
Who are those guys?

397
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,794
What's going on?

398
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,129
What's she doing there?

399
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,965
Is she the owner?

400
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,216
What's wrong?

401
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,512
Mr. Ji, tell me about the owner
of that shop.

402
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,099
Based on what
her regular customers posted online,

403
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,184
she used to be
on the national handball team.

404
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,728
Her husband runs
a taekwondo studio in the Philippines,

405
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,147
and her co-worker was also--

406
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,399
A former handball player. No wonder.

407
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,317
That's why she was so fast.

408
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,319
Do you know her? How--

409
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,237
I…

410
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,032
Don't ask. I want to forget about it.

411
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,410
Anyway, don't come here ever again.

412
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,413
Not this place. Do you understand?

413
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,917
Sir, you can't park here.

414
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,879
Go.

415
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,049
What's his problem?

416
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,718
What?

417
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,969
Gosh.

418
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,805
He should be ashamed.

419
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,891
How dare you try to park
in front of my shop?

420
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,477
Yeong-ju,

421
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,647
shouldn't we post a sign that says
"Customer Parking Only"?

422
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,524
Next time. Tell us your strategy first.

423
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,651
What's the plan for tomorrow?

424
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,652
Hold on.

425
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,076
According to Skymom.net,
enrollment starts at 10 a.m.

426
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,995
But I should get in line by 7 a.m.

427
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,830
So let's open our shop late tomorrow.

428
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,541
Do the grocery shopping
and prepare the side dishes.

429
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,543
Jae-woo, help her out. Okay?

430
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,214
But I have to go for a walk at 8 a.m.

431
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,132
and have some waffles at a cafe.

432
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,135
Ms. Kwon Jin-gyeong
makes the waffles at 8 a.m.,

433
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,597
and they're a hundred times better
than Ms. So Hyeon-yeong's at 12 p.m.

434
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,308
Take a rain check for tomorrow.

435
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,645
I'll pay you 9,000 won per hour.

436
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,232
Then 10,000 won. No more.

437
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,150
Deal.

438
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,704
This is tasty.

439
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,166
This place is good too.

440
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,129
I knew it.

441
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,716
It's just food.

442
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,888
I'll never go back there
no matter how good their food is.

443
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,723
No way.

444
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,549
Breaking down food waste.

445
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,093
It works well.

446
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,054
It's clean.

447
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,931
Doesn't smell either.

448
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,205
Mom.

449
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,461
Hey.

450
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,296
Sun-jae, you're home.

451
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,256
You're late.

452
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,634
I was asking
a teaching assistant for help.

453
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
I see.

454
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,306
Did you drink a lot?

455
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,225
No, just a bit.

456
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,480
I need to wake up early tomorrow
for enrollment, but I couldn't sleep.

457
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,900
I'm going to have one last glass
and go to bed.

458
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,946
You should stop.
I'll make you some honey tea.

459
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,430
Sun-jae.

460
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,478
You know you're all I have, right?

461
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,732
If something happens to you as well,

462
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,151
I'll have no will to live.

463
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,155
You know that, right?

464
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,205
No need for that.

465
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,290
Go to your room.

466
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,375
Go study.

467
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,876
Okay.

468
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,211
Go study.

469
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,900
Goodness.

470
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,407
No, I won't be able to park.

471
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:01,966
I'm hungry.

472
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,640
Darn it.

473
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,767
I'm still hungover.
This is driving me crazy.

474
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,144
I should've stopped drinking
earlier yesterday.

475
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,814
Jeez. I told you not to drink so much.

476
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,816
You always overdo it.

477
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,651
Oh, no.

478
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,736
There are already over 100 people in line.

479
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,988
-Gosh. Really?
-Yes. Let's hurry.

480
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,284
-Hold on.
-Goodness.

481
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,494
She's on her own.

482
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,578
I'm going ahead!

483
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,312
I am a changed woman now.

484
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,022
I will become a passionate mom

485
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,067
who will do everything she can
for her daughter's education.

486
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,069
Today marks the beginning of my rebirth.

487
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,363
I am going to enroll Hae-e
in that star teacher's course.

488
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,281
Done.

489
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,657
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

490
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,993
What?

491
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:10,910
What do you want?

492
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,038
When are you opening?

493
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll be opening late
due to personal reasons.

494
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,835
Please stop by again later. I'm sorry.

495
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,088
Exactly when? What time?

496
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,549
-Around noon.
-That's too vague.

497
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,426
That's a bit vague.

498
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,511
Is it noon sharp? Before or after?

499
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:33,141
I can't tell you for sure
since I don't know when I'll be back.

500
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,518
It's your duty
to open on time for your customers.

501
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,312
I'm famished.

502
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,688
I wonder why you're so busy.

503
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,274
I am sorry, but I don't do this often.

504
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,358
I need to go.

505
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,068
You haven't answered.

506
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,987
Is it noon? 12:30 p.m.? 12:15 p.m.?

507
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,406
Noon. Sharp.

508
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,409
I will open then no matter what happens,
so come then. Okay?

509
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,832
Gosh, she's really fast.

510
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,379
I'm famished after staying up all night.

511
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,009
I still have five and a half hours to go.

512
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,135
CLOSED FOR THE MORNING

513
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,182
I'm almost there.

514
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
I'm hanging up.

515
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,154
Goodness.

516
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,545
Goodness!

517
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,482
Gosh, what's this line?

518
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,276
I don't know if I'll make it.

519
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,239
Had it not been for that sunglasses guy,

520
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,658
I would've passed a dozen of them.

521
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,082
I hope that guy has an unlucky day today.

522
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,110
I'm so tired.

523
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,368
I'll hand out your numbers.

524
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,953
What?

525
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,626
I hope I get a number too.

526
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,005
-Congratulations.
-No way!

527
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,006
Thank you.

528
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,975
Dear God, Buddha, and my ancestors.

529
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,520
I have lived a very honest life so far.

530
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,316
I promise to continue
contributing to society.

531
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,777
I'll try not to swear

532
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,278
and cut down on violence.

533
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,405
I'll quit drinking-- No, I'll cut down.

534
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,865
I won't gossip as much either.

535
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,076
I take back the curse I put on that guy.

536
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,410
I'll be kind.

537
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,330
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

538
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,332
-Thank you.
-I did it!

539
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,418
Congratulations.

540
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,503
Thank you.

541
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,089
Congratulations.

542
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,346
Hey.

543
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,057
Hi, Haeng-seon. Hey.

544
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,019
Next person. Here you go.

545
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:05,937
Congratulations.

546
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,486
This won't work.

547
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,154
I have no luck.

548
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,698
How could God not grant me this one wish?

549
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,119
Cripes, I just wanted to do something
for Hae-e for once.

550
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,703
Why am I always the unlucky one?

551
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,789
Does God even exist?

552
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,873
Thank you.

553
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,378
Congratulations.

554
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,131
Thank you!

555
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,882
I'm so elated!

556
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,468
Honey, we did it!

557
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,308
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

558
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,103
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,646
-We've run out.
-You have?

560
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:49,772
I'm sorry.

561
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,274
Yes, there is.

562
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,441
There is a God.

563
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:01,784
WOORIM HIGH SCHOOL

564
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,703
Mom, did you get it?

565
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,039
Okay, thanks.
You're picking me up later, right?

566
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,125
-Bye.
-Hi, Mom.

567
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,962
Seriously?

568
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,090
I got into Choi Chi-yeol's course?

569
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,594
No way.

570
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,138
Mom, thank you so much.

571
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,308
See you later.

572
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,604
Gosh, congratulations.

573
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,355
We'll be taking his course together.

574
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,815
-High-five.
-Yes!

575
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,401
Congratulations.

576
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,611
She's taking it too?

577
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,741
It's open.

578
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,295
Nice, she's not in.

579
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,382
Hello.

580
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,845
Are you here to buy some side dishes?

581
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,057
-No, just a lunch box.
-I see.

582
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,435
Are you a celebrity by any chance?

583
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,103
Sorry?

584
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,147
No, I just have an eye infection.

585
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,483
So how does it work?

586
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,779
The containers are over there.
Pick whatever you want.

587
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,698
Right.

588
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,827
Yeong-ju.

589
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,413
How did it go? Did you get it?

590
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,581
Did you?

591
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,583
Hey!

592
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,043
You did it!

593
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,419
Congratulations.

594
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,672
I made it in the nick of time.

595
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,882
I've had bad luck lately.

596
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,467
Jae-woo suddenly got sick,

597
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,011
and his phone broke,
but it was too expensive to fix.

598
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,472
You're right.
That phone was still pretty new.

599
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,391
I bought it less than a year ago.

600
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,227
I will never forgive that phone thief.

601
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,604
If I ever catch him, I'll just…

602
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,483
Pull out his organs, roll them up,

603
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,151
and make some tripe noodles.

604
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,946
Of course. Let's play a game of pool
with his eyeballs too.

605
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:02,905
Sounds nice.

606
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,909
We had a customer?

607
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,119
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,745
We were just joking around.

609
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,663
Wait.

610
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,041
-You're the guy from this morning.
-Yes.

611
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,003
I had an urgent matter to take care of,
so I opened late.

612
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,046
-Take one of these.
-That's okay.

613
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,383
You should get a membership.

614
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,135
You can get membership points.

615
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,471
You can get a 1,000-won discount
with 1,000 points.

616
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,224
Well…

617
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,602
Sure.

618
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,778
MEMBERSHIP CARD
JI DONG-HUI

619
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,708
This is really good.

620
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,003
All of the side dishes are so fresh.

621
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,341
Have I had them before?

622
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,426
They taste familiar.

623
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,097
How are they not doing well
when their food is this good?

624
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,933
She has no money for a new phone?

625
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,520
Gosh, I keep thinking about that.

626
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,357
Why did it have to break?

627
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,493
Hey.

628
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,464
By the way,
about that guy in the sunglasses.

629
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,548
Yes?

630
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,134
He kept glancing at you very obviously.

631
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,052
Why?

632
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,430
What do you think, idiot?
Because he's into you.

633
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,225
Don't be ridiculous.

634
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,519
How is that ridiculous?

635
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,312
He's totally fallen for you.

636
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,356
You know dating is my forte.

637
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,233
Nonsense.

638
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,610
You've never gone out
with the guys you flirt with.

639
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,656
Plus, you're the one who turned me
into a married woman.

640
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,742
Hae-e's dad runs a taekwondo studio
in the Philippines, right?

641
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,036
You spread that rumor
when we first started out.

642
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,915
That was because all the women
gossiped about you being a single mom.

643
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,834
Even still,

644
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,795
I'm impressed you came up
with an entire story on the spot.

645
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,006
"Her husband runs a taekwondo studio
in the Philippines."

646
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,301
"They were both on the national team
and were such lovebirds."

647
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,221
"His last name is also Nam.
They were meant to be."

648
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,517
And that was the end of that rumor
about you being a single mom.

649
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,435
Whatever.

650
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,146
Don't involve me with men
because people think I'm married.

651
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,315
Sure, that's what they think.
But let's be frank.

652
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,818
You're still a virgin--

653
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,319
Shut it.

654
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,699
Keep running your mouth,
and you will face a painful death.

655
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,411
Let's work. I need to make money
to pay for Hae-e's academy.

656
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,584
-Mom.
-Hey, welcome home.

657
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,131
Thank you for today.

658
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,757
For what?

659
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,385
You mean the enrollment?

660
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,345
That was nothing. Forget it.

661
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,306
Hold on.

662
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,307
What?

663
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,148
I couldn't get one for Auntie Yeong-ju,
so eat it here.

664
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,316
It's your favorite.

665
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,984
Jeez.

666
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,032
DINNERTIME SEAL AT 8 P.M.

667
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,378
It's sweet.

668
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,089
It's so sweet.

669
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,010
Have a bite.

670
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,596
No, thanks. I don't have a sweet tooth.

671
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,139
You're right.

672
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,558
You never had a sweet tooth
as a kid either.

673
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,560
That's rare for a kid.

674
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,813
Be honest.

675
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,734
It was because
you didn't want cavities, right?

676
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,695
Because I'd have to pay
to take you to a dentist.

677
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,780
Isn't that why?

678
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,742
Don't fool yourself.
I wasn't that mature back then.

679
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,286
-So I'm wrong?
-Yes, you are.

680
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,454
Fine then.

681
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,459
You know what?
I almost didn't make it to the enrollment.

682
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,419
It was like a whole new world.

683
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,173
I bet those parents would do anything
to get their kids enrolled.

684
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,134
It's not easy to enroll there.

685
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,678
It was unbelievable.

686
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,346
Hey.

687
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,640
What are you doing?

688
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,434
-Aren't you coming in?
-I am.

689
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,645
-Is she eating something?
-No, she's not.

690
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,355
Hey!

691
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,325
Why does the top student of
Woorim High School look so gloomy today?

692
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,745
Did you know Hae-e enrolled
in Mr. Choi's course?

693
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,247
Yes.

694
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,249
I saw her mom in line this morning.

695
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,876
I can't believe she
enrolled Hae-e in an academy.

696
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,256
-Did you tell her about Mr. Choi?
-I didn't need to tell her about him.

697
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,258
Everyone knows him. What's wrong?

698
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,468
Whatever. I'm so annoyed.

699
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,178
You're smarter than her.

700
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,098
Why be bothered
by the daughter of a side dish store?

701
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,266
I don't know.

702
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,809
I just don't like her.

703
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,562
Why not?

704
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,731
Isn't she amiable and nice?

705
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,399
I don't know.

706
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,693
I hate her pretentiousness.

707
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,200
Sir.

708
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,828
Can you change
my performance assessment date?

709
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,664
It overlaps with the exam period.

710
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,416
I'm not sure.

711
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,253
I doubt anyone would switch
since they have exams too.

712
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,171
Okay.

713
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,422
Sir, I'll switch with her.

714
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,050
I want to get mine over with.

715
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,892
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

716
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,269
This is the last course of Season 1.

717
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,354
Good work, guys.

718
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,441
I know you all have been busy with school,
but thank you for keeping up.

719
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,527
Make sure you review the ones
you got wrong or need to look over.

720
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,613
Did you all sign up for Season 2?

721
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,031
-Yes!
-Yes!

722
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,244
All right. That's it for Season 1.

723
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,163
I'm Choi Chi-yeol.

724
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,290
See you guys again.

725
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,217
-Here.
-You can give them to me.

726
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,594
-I'll give them to him later. Okay.
-This too.

727
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,725
That stalker signed up for Season 2.
It's driving me crazy.

728
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,853
I should've told Ms. Jung about it
and blacklisted her.

729
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,190
She wasn't in class for a few days,
so I'd thought we were in the clear.

730
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,651
It'd be much better
if she didn't sit in the front.

731
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,529
Mr. Ji,

732
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,280
you can go home now.

733
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,532
I'll drive myself home.

734
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,076
-But you must be tired.
-No, I'm fine.

735
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,327
I just want to drive.

736
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,037
I should hone my skills. The keys.

737
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,375
And this.

738
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,627
The new phone you asked for.

739
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,550
Are you switching your phone?
Do you need a new number too?

740
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,926
No, that's okay.

741
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,391
Don't work too hard, okay?

742
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,351
Go home. See you tomorrow.

743
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,646
-Drive safely.
-I will.

744
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,999
Of course, I enrolled.

745
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,794
I'm going to continue sitting up front
to watch his flustered face.

746
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,422
He looks so cute when he's flustered.

747
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,340
What? My mom?

748
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,970
Of course, she doesn't know.
You know how busy she is.

749
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,763
I'm so excited.

750
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,517
What if I really end up
getting married to him--

751
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,074
I'm leaving first.

752
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,368
My fling is coming, so I need to go.

753
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,621
I hope you'll date him this time.

754
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,955
I'll see you tomorrow!

755
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,040
Bye.

756
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,083
Jeez.

757
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,799
Did you leave something--

758
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,094
Hello.

759
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,097
Are you closed for the day?

760
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,142
I was wrapping up.

761
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,271
But go on and pick.
You're only doing me a favor.

762
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,815
Okay.

763
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,638
You're the last customer,
so you get a 2,000-won discount.

764
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,307
You don't have to.

765
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,770
Okay.

766
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,110
Here you go.
You also got your reward points.

767
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,278
Okay.

768
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,241
Hold on.

769
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:51,952
Here.

770
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,163
My friend sells phones,

771
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,040
and he had an extra one.

772
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,501
He's the generous type.

773
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,879
I'm giving it to you
as a new member of this store.

774
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,550
Goodbye.

775
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,844
Sir.

776
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,984
What did I tell you?

777
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,653
I told you he was interested in you.

778
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,780
Who knows?
Maybe it really was an extra phone.

779
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,742
Don't be ridiculous, you fool.

780
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,494
That's why he gave it to you?

781
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,496
A new phone that costs over a million won?

782
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,582
Isn't it possible?

783
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,417
You're so naive.

784
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,962
I'm telling you, he's completely smitten.

785
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,424
He didn't hesitate
to get you a big gift from the get-go.

786
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,717
Look at what he got you.

787
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,303
He's very bold and straightforward.

788
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,555
What does a phone imply as a gift?

789
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,517
It implies he wants you to be his.

790
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,894
That's enough.

791
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,104
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm going to return it.

792
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,607
Why would you?
It's a token of his affection.

793
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,400
Forget it. I have no time for that.

794
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,194
What about Hae-e? I need to make money.

795
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,904
Forget about everything else.

796
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,739
Just look into your heart.

797
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,032
How do you feel?

798
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,492
Feel what?

799
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:16,828
Don't you have any desire to date

800
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,122
and eventually get married?

801
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,543
Not as Hae-e's mom,
but as Nam Haeng-seon, a woman.

802
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,926
Of course, I do.
I want to date and get married.

803
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,887
I even want to go to graduate school.

804
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,931
I want to get a certificate and teach.

805
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,770
But first,
I should send Hae-e to university

806
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,689
and provide a foothold for Jae-woo.

807
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,690
After all that.

808
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,193
And by the time you're done,
you'll be too old.

809
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,528
Don't you worry.

810
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:53,198
I'll live much more happily
than you ever will.

811
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,866
Gosh, I got it on my shirt.

812
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,828
Hey, keep an eye on this
while I get changed.

813
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,759
Don't you have any desire to date

814
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,970
and eventually get married?

815
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,473
Not as Hae-e's mom,
but as Nam Haeng-seon, a woman.

816
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,768
She's right.

817
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,645
I can be pretty too.

818
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,496
Darn it.

819
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,581
Let's work.

820
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,293
Let's make some money, Haeng-seon.

821
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:51,339
Just keep in mind the structures
of the left- and right-hand limits.

822
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:56,261
The right-hand limit
as x approaches one is one.

823
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,013
Now, this one.

824
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:03,018
The left-hand limit
as x approaches negative one…

825
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,729
is three.

826
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,357
So the answer is one plus three…

827
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,319
which is…

828
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,571
four.

829
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,374
INTENSIVE COURSE SEASON 1
CHOI CHI-YEOL

830
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,089
Bang Su-a,

831
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,967
do you have absolutely no respect for me?

832
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,720
Working on your academy textbook
during class?

833
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,764
You should be focusing at school.

834
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,641
But I already know everything.

835
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,017
I learned it in middle school.

836
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,269
So?

837
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,438
Did you get a perfect score
on your June mock?

838
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,523
What about math?

839
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,192
Did this guy not teach you?

840
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,569
That teacher has a name.
It's Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

841
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,029
INTENSIVE COURSE SEASON 1
CHOI CHI-YEOL

842
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,113
Then what about me?

843
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,157
So he's a teacher to you.

844
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,992
What about me? Am I not your teacher?

845
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,832
If I ever see you working
on his textbook again

846
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,001
or see anything
even remotely related to him,

847
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,962
I will call your parents.

848
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,964
-Got it?
-Okay.

849
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,925
You get ten penalty points.
I'll give this back in a week.

850
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,679
That little…

851
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,389
Gosh.

852
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,810
So what if you're the top student
if you have absolutely no manners?

853
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,104
I feel a sense of inferiority
at times like this.

854
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,108
I never expected teachers
to be treated this way

855
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,652
when I was studying hard
to become a teacher myself.

856
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,738
We do need a wake-up call.

857
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,075
Honestly, we don't prepare
as hard as the academy teachers.

858
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,785
It's not because we're lazy.

859
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,413
We just don't have the time to do that.

860
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,000
We work on official documents,
lesson plans, and equipment reports.

861
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,549
It's not us who have to change.
It's the system.

862
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,348
I mean, he's not wrong.

863
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,352
But he's a bit sensitive, right?

864
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,606
Is it jealousy or an inferiority complex?

865
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,819
Gosh, forget about this guy's competence.
He's just good-looking.

866
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,113
Hey, I'm at a bookstore right now.

867
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,949
That tall guy who
goes to the gym every day…

868
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,659
What was the textbook he mentioned?

869
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,871
Text me the title. Okay.

870
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,084
ULTIMATE MATH

871
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,797
Jeon Jong-ryeol?

872
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,841
So you recognize me.

873
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,013
I see your face on the buses
every morning and evening.

874
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,222
Even on my way here.

875
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,392
From pencil cases to tumblers,

876
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,810
you sell all sorts of things.

877
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,771
Right.

878
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,523
Which school do you work at?

879
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,483
Woorim High?

880
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,485
Are you actually curious?

881
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,404
I hope you never ask me
to have a meal with you

882
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,031
just because I work nearby.

883
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,409
I have some trauma when it comes to you.

884
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,373
But I guess all that money
isn't buying you happiness.

885
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,249
You've become thinner.

886
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,545
More than when you could only afford
one meal a day living in Noryangjin.

887
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,548
Despite choosing money over a dream,

888
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,094
doing something you shouldn't have,
and working like a dog,

889
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,014
does it feel like
everything you've done is futile?

890
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,768
I had no idea
about what happened back then.

891
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,727
Is that so?

892
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,897
I see. You didn't know.

893
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,983
That's why you ghosted everyone.

894
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,693
-That was because--
-Enough.

895
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,697
A student died
as a result of that incident.

896
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,825
Her entire family was torn apart.

897
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,619
You should at least feel guilty.

898
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,121
Please.

899
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,417
Right.

900
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,091
I heard you didn't even call
when Yeong-seok's mother died.

901
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,219
Everyone is talking about
how you're a bad guy.

902
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,305
Hope you're happy.

903
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,709
A student died
as a result of that incident.

904
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,294
Mr. Choi!

905
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,047
I have a question.

906
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,591
Her entire family was torn apart.

907
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,719
You should at least feel guilty.

908
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,513
Please.

909
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,349
Mr. Choi.

910
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,226
Is this why you asked for their number?

911
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,896
This isn't right!
You shouldn't have done this!

912
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,315
JEONG SU-HYEON

913
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,929
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

914
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,598
I guess he's not coming today.

915
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,434
I should return this soon.

916
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,439
I'm so bad at rejecting people.
What do I do?

917
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,430
I've seen him somewhere. Who is he?

918
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,226
I swear I've seen him before. Who is he?

919
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,314
"Real math from a star teacher.
For math, Choi Chi-yeol."

920
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,942
Who is he?

921
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,661
-Mom, I'm off. Bye, Auntie.
-Bye.

922
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,288
Going already? Where's your uncle?

923
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,205
Taking a walk.

924
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,916
He'll probably have
Ms. Kwon's waffles at 8 a.m.

925
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,834
I see.

926
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,005
Mom, you know I'm going to
the academy starting today, right?

927
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,257
Of course. I'm a changed mom now.

928
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,926
I'll head there straight from school.

929
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,845
Also…

930
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,057
NAM HAE-E

931
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,184
That's for your wrist.
Use it while you work.

932
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,811
Bye.

933
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,276
Hae-e, study hard today!

934
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,861
Tell me if you want more courses.

935
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,738
I'll enroll you in all of them!

936
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,122
You used to complain about mothers
and private education.

937
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,166
This is a sudden change in attitude.

938
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,335
I was quick
back when I was an athlete too.

939
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,547
How is it?
Doesn't this look nicer than a medal?

940
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,174
Sure.

941
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,885
You've never had one before, have you?

942
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,387
-You want one too, right?
-Hey!

943
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:42,972
Haeng-seon.

944
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,766
Hey.

945
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,685
Who is he?

946
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,687
What do you mean?

947
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,606
Don't cut out the details. Explain.

948
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,857
Okay.

949
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,192
Wait.

950
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,109
Who is he?

951
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,028
The bus station ad.

952
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,906
He definitely looks familiar.

953
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,742
Who is he?

954
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,371
-Jeez.
-What is he rambling on about?

955
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:09,707
Who knows? He'll be mumbling all day now.

956
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,126
Gosh.

957
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,462
That guy…

958
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,631
didn't come yesterday, did he?

959
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:17,548
No.

960
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:19,634
I want to return it as soon as possible.

961
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,279
INTENSIVE COURSE SEASON 2
CHOI CHI-YEOL

962
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,489
Where's your head at?

963
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,075
The course starts today.
What are you going to do?

964
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,620
You kept the ones I didn't want
and removed the ones I wanted.

965
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,871
Who edited this?

966
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,834
Your final feedback wasn't reflected.
I should've checked.

967
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:54,961
Reprint them.

968
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,965
You can get them done
before the course, right?

969
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,009
School just started,
so the print shops are probably busy.

970
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,971
We're gluing on the revised parts.

971
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,514
-I think--
-What?

972
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,434
Is this a scrapbook?
This isn't a trivial mistake.

973
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:12,437
We'll reprint them.
I'll look into shops in Chungmuro too.

974
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,189
Check if there are any other issues
before reprinting them.

975
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,233
You better check it extra thoroughly.

976
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,825
Maybe the rainy season
is coming sooner this year.

977
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,702
The wind feels humid.

978
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,329
I hope you stop by today.

979
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,458
From Nam Haeng-seon,
the owner of Nation's Best Banchan.

980
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,584
What is this?

981
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,798
Get moving!

982
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,133
-Right.
-Yes, sir.

983
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,509
Let's go.

984
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,552
Come on.

985
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,099
Gosh, it's your first day of academy.

986
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,851
How do you feel?

987
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,519
Fine.

988
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,814
Actually, I'm so excited.

989
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:58,900
Right.

990
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,944
You know you have to introduce yourself
and sing on the first day, right?

991
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,738
Do you want to die?

992
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,491
-You can sing. You better sing.
-I'm serious.

993
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,078
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

994
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,213
Go in first. Got a call.

995
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,297
Okay.

996
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,758
Yes, Mom.

997
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,772
Hi, Su-a.

998
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,483
Is that your seat?

999
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,944
I don't think so.

1000
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,953
You didn't book a seat, did you?

1001
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,289
Take mine for today.
It's hard to see him from the back.

1002
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,707
It's okay.

1003
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,126
I totally forgot I had to book one.

1004
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,712
I'll just sit in the back.

1005
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,465
Just sit here. Take my seat.

1006
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,717
No, thanks. I'm not that short.

1007
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,969
I'm really fine.

1008
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,098
Jeez.

1009
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,436
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

1010
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,688
All right.

1011
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,858
Three is the number you get
from multiplying these two.

1012
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,734
That means the two numbers are one and…

1013
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,403
Zero?

1014
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,865
You can just go home.

1015
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:32,952
The other one

1016
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,621
should be three. All right.

1017
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,834
Let's draw the graph. A cubic function…

1018
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,420
would look like this.

1019
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:46,382
The slope of one
should intersect with a cubic curve.

1020
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,800
Let's write the formula.

1021
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,929
It would be f(x) minus x equals

1022
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:56,183
x times x-squared plus px

1023
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,270
plus q minus one.

1024
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,771
We can derive this formula.

1025
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,657
Guys.

1026
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,453
I only expect one thing from you guys.

1027
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,997
Guess what it is.

1028
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,499
Acing the math exam?

1029
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,418
No.

1030
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,794
Grade improvement?

1031
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,088
That'll come naturally
as you take my course.

1032
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,383
I want you guys…

1033
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,555
to be as passionate as I am.

1034
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,059
I truly want the best for you.

1035
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,979
That's why I skip meals
and sleep less to prep for my courses.

1036
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,105
I really devote myself.

1037
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,151
Even as I speak,
I'm eager to teach you more.

1038
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,861
I'm always so impatient.

1039
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,574
Some of you complain that I go too fast,
but this is why.

1040
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,953
I hope

1041
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,624
you're just as desperate and passionate
about this moment as I am.

1042
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,251
I hope…

1043
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,463
you'll be that eager.

1044
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,466
In short,

1045
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,262
stop playing on your phone,
you in the middle row!

1046
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:25,106
Mom, it's insane.

1047
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,649
The atmosphere was so upbeat.

1048
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,694
I totally get why
he's known for his passion.

1049
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,071
I can easily understand him and it's fun.

1050
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:36,033
Also, he shows off his kicks during class.

1051
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,161
He knows how to make
his class interesting.

1052
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,497
But I was the most moved

1053
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,332
by his sincerity.

1054
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,210
He was surprisingly cool and charismatic.

1055
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,922
"I hope you're just as desperate
and passionate as I am."

1056
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,509
You're totally into him.

1057
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,052
He must be handsome.

1058
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:56,887
I'm not sure.

1059
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,889
I sat far away,
so I couldn't see him well.

1060
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,184
But he wasn't ugly.
I guess he was good-looking.

1061
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,021
Why did you sit in the back?
You should've sat up close.

1062
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,691
Oh, no. I should've booked a seat, right?

1063
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,361
I was too focused on the enrollment
and forgot. What an idiot.

1064
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,238
That's okay. You're too busy anyway.

1065
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,281
No.

1066
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,366
I'll be more attentive from now on.

1067
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,035
You should sit up close.

1068
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:19,952
Gosh.

1069
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,705
Don't worry, Hae-e.
I'm all over the place.

1070
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,124
I forgot again.

1071
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:30,379
Were you trying to remember him again?
Give that to me.

1072
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,090
I'll do the calculations for today.

1073
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:34,967
Remember who?

1074
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,762
Beats me. He saw a guy outside
but can't remember him.

1075
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,848
He's been mumbling all day long.

1076
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,391
You're obsessed about this now.

1077
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,352
I'm going to go home and wash up.

1078
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,437
Salute.

1079
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,064
Okay. You go ahead.

1080
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,148
Okay.

1081
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,235
She looks so ecstatic.

1082
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,154
I've never seen her so chatty!

1083
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,074
I guess she's also a kid after all.

1084
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:00,451
Who is he?

1085
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,286
Why can't I remember?

1086
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,246
Hey.

1087
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,083
Say that one more time,
and I'll kick you out.

1088
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,210
You better stop that.

1089
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,547
-Who is he?
-All right.

1090
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,595
Get it together, you punk.

1091
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,395
I knew I could count on you.

1092
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:32,983
Your first course of Season 2
succeeded with flying colors.

1093
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,026
I see.

1094
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,113
Check out these comments.

1095
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,741
Gosh, look at these.

1096
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,993
"Mr. Choi never disappoints."

1097
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,245
"I trust him."

1098
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,163
"I probably failed
because I missed his course."

1099
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,540
-Probably.
-Excuse me,

1100
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,999
but I have an urgent matter.

1101
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,709
You can tell him the rest.

1102
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,754
-But--
-Mr. Choi.

1103
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,594
Should I continue?

1104
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,013
Sure.

1105
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,182
Darn it.

1106
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,685
-You may go.
-Okay.

1107
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:18,779
Are you still open?

1108
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,532
I hurried over for a lunch box.

1109
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,579
We were just wrapping up.

1110
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,206
But you can go ahead.

1111
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,749
Jae-woo, give him a container.

1112
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,005
Hello.

1113
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,173
Thank you.

1114
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,090
Here.

1115
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,849
Hey. What did I tell you?

1116
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:47,850
Wasn't I right?

1117
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:49,768
Stop it.

1118
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:54,940
Excuse me.

1119
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,483
Yes?

1120
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,694
Can we talk for a minute?

1121
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:02,323
I'm listening.

1122
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,160
You see,

1123
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,788
I'm really grateful.

1124
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,833
-But I can't accept this.
-I see.

1125
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,169
I have a complicated personal life,

1126
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,005
and I want to focus on work for now.

1127
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,716
Sorry?

1128
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:25,095
I mean it'd be best for us to remain
as shop owner and customer.

1129
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,557
-Who are you?
-Gosh. Jae-woo, you shouldn't do that.

1130
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,059
That's rude.

1131
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,852
Okay?

1132
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:32,937
I'm sorry.

1133
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,272
-Jae-woo.
-Tiger.

1134
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,316
What?

1135
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,526
Haeng-seon.

1136
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:43,989
It's him.

1137
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,242
Haeng-seon, he's…

1138
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,327
The bus stop.

1139
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,870
He's the tiger!

1140
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,923
How could you call me a tiger?

1141
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,052
I'm so offended that I lost my appetite.

1142
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,139
I'm leaving.

1143
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,057
Wait.

1144
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,149
I'm right, Haeng-seon. I told you.

1145
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:24,488
You're right.
We've definitely met before, right?

1146
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,366
I was chasing you,
and you threw his phone.

1147
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:32,329
I found it odd that you were always
wearing a hat and sunglasses.

1148
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,039
There was a reason for all that.

1149
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,624
Were you disguising yourself?

1150
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,544
Look, I slightly misread
the situation that day.

1151
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:43,090
It's been weighing on my mind.
That's why I got you a new phone.

1152
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,551
Does that solve everything?

1153
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,219
You owe me an apology!

1154
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,263
Please calm down.

1155
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,056
I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

1156
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,644
Anyway, this is a token of my apology.

1157
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,313
Please take it. Are we done here?

1158
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,148
Wait. You can't go yet.

1159
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:03,736
Do you expect me to be grateful
for that new phone or something?

1160
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:07,406
Why are you solving things with money?
I have money too!

1161
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:10,326
You said you didn't
and getting it fixed was too expensive.

1162
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,913
Wait. Hold on.

1163
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,791
You should've pretended
you didn't hear that.

1164
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,543
Okay, fine.

1165
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,253
I don't have enough money.

1166
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,629
And you? Are you that rich?

1167
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,965
What do you do? How well-off are you?

1168
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,551
Why would I tell
a stranger how much I make?

1169
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:30,387
Anyway, that's your compensation.
I'm leaving now.

1170
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,056
I wish you all the best!

1171
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,974
Wait. Take this with you.

1172
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,061
-I can't accept this. I won't.
-Just take it!

1173
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,897
-I don't want to. Take it!
-Just accept it!

1174
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,816
What was that?

1175
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,736
Jae-woo! Get down!

1176
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,046
What was that?

1177
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,128
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1178
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,171
It was pretty much attempted murder.

1179
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,632
I could've been the target.

1180
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,426
-Mr. Choi.
-Mr. Ji.

1181
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,970
Things shatter whenever
I'm around that tiger.

1182
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,806
Hey, why aren't there
many CCTV cameras around here?

1183
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,183
Why is she so hilarious?

1184
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,563
The owner is a bit cold,
but I can stomach her food.

1185
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,148
It's also fun to pick the side dishes.

1186
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,318
When she goes crazy,
she becomes downright insane.

1187
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,070
-There's Choi Chi-yeol!
-Where?

1188
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,864
You just need to choose me.

1189
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,908
Forget the lousy mom from the past.

1190
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,369
I'm going to become a mom
who's passionate about education.

1191
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:27,796
