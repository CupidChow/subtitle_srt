00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,693
-Hui-jae!
-Please step back.

3
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,029
-Please stop.
-Why are you doing this?

4
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,781
Hui-jae!

5
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,242
My brother did nothing wrong! Hui-jae!

6
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,412
Hui-jae! He didn't do anything wrong!

7
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,623
He's sick! Please!

8
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,209
Hui-jae!

9
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,339
Sun-jae.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,216
Ms. Nam.

11
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,220
What's going on? He's your brother?

12
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,306
Yes, he is.

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,767
What do I do?

14
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,063
What will happen to him?

15
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,444
Sun-jae.

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,411
Shocking news. Sun-jae's brother,
who was said to be in the US,

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,330
turns out to have been holed up at home.

18
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,624
The police arrested him
just now for some reason.

19
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,042
Sun-jae was bawling.

20
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,293
Goodness. Really?

21
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,712
No wonder it was so noisy outside.

22
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,633
I thought he was studying abroad.
Isn't he at an Ivy League?

23
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,844
What do you think? It was all a lie.

24
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,846
How unbelievable.

25
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,142
It must have been
so stressful for you lately.

26
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,978
It has been. Thank you.

27
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,563
Sun-jae's mom. I mean…

28
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,440
Ms. Jang, it's all thanks to you.

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,152
They said it would be treated
as a criminal offense,

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,905
but they treated it as a juvenile offense
all thanks to you.

31
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,657
I only did my job.

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,033
Not at all.

33
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,786
This was only possible because it was you.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,456
Gosh, how will I ever repay this kindness?

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,586
If you ever need my help,
don't hesitate to ask.

36
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,629
I'll help you at all costs.

37
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,173
That's very kind of you to say.

38
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,675
I really mean it.

39
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,261
After all, I'm an education director.

40
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,514
I could even help you
regarding Sun-jae's college admissions.

41
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,018
Your phone's ringing.
I'll leave you to it.

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,395
-Get home safe.
-Thank you.

43
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,189
-Call me whenever you need help.
-Thank you.

44
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,274
Goodbye.

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,789
SUN-JAE
MISSED CALL

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,166
SUN-JAE, 10 MISSED CALLS

47
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,215
SUN-JAE

48
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,304
What is it? What's going on?

49
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,273
Mom.

50
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,108
Hello.

51
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,493
Why are you still here? I said to go home.

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,913
Your midterms start in two days.

53
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,539
-Ms. Jang--
-Don't they?

54
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,212
Go.

55
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,424
SUSPECT INTERROGATION

56
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,387
Lee Hui-jae, born on October 24, 2002.
Is this correct?

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,106
Do you know him?

58
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,153
Holding your tongue right now

59
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,531
won't do you any good.

60
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,242
Have you seen him before or not?

61
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,249
What is it?

62
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,382
She's his mother.
She'd like to defend him.

63
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm Jang Seo-jin from T&A Law Firm.

64
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,694
JANG SEO-JIN

65
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,279
Where's your warrant?

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,490
It was an emergency arrest.
The warrant will be issued soon--

67
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,659
In his own home?

68
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,747
That's only legal when there's the chance
of evidence being destroyed

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,582
or the suspect fleeing.

70
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,296
Can you prove that this child,
who was at home,

71
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,214
was fleeing or destroying evidence?

72
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,176
Ma'am, he tried to run away
as soon as he saw us--

73
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,762
You shouldn't have searched the house
without a warrant.

74
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,140
You're aware that's illegal, right?

75
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,224
But ma'am…

76
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,603
Ms. Jang.

77
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,229
Normally,

78
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:00,568
the first thing people tend to do
is ask why the suspect was arrested.

79
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,112
Do you know what his charge is?

80
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,825
Of course not.

81
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,497
I'm only pointing out
the obvious illegality of this arrest.

82
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,377
What's his charge?

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,215
Murder.

84
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,746
Thank you for driving me
to the police station.

85
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,085
I felt like I should go
because Sun-jae looked so shaken up.

86
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,421
He's Hae-e's best friend, so--

87
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,714
I know.

88
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,593
She's mentioned him many times.

89
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,719
I see.

90
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,519
Also,

91
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,148
about Mr. Ji…

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,277
I admit that I got worked up
out of nowhere.

93
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,903
Let's not…

94
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,408
talk about that anymore today.

95
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:58,227
POINT OF INTERSECTION
BETWEEN COMEDY AND TRAGEDY

96
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,730
EPISODE 12

97
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,108
Mom, where's Sun-jae?
Is he still at the police station?

98
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,027
I don't know.

99
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,529
His mom came, so Mr. Choi and I left.

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,365
Will his brother be okay?

101
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,827
I'm not sure.
I think there was a misunderstanding.

102
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,954
Sun-jae was worried sick.

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,082
Despite having experienced it
multiple times,

104
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,169
I was still terrified when I heard
that Jae-woo had been locked up.

105
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,296
Sun-jae must've been scared to death.

106
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,216
But since when did you know
about his brother?

107
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,236
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be…

108
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,492
Sun-jae, are you okay?

109
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,786
Call me.

110
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,176
MR. CHOI CHI-YEOL

111
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,846
Let's not talk about that anymore today.

112
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,063
Was I too cold?

113
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,489
MS. NAM HAENG-SEON
OF NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

114
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,908
What would I even say to her?

115
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,286
I'm the one who didn't want to talk.

116
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,672
DID YOU GET HOME OKAY?
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

117
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,549
No.

118
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:59,265
EARLIER, I WAS TOO SENSITIVE
I OVERREACTED EARLIER

119
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,435
EARLIER, I WAS TOO COLD

120
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,896
Whatever. He was the one being cold,
yet he's not even calling me.

121
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,732
I won't text him.

122
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,235
I won't. Darn it.

123
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,406
MR. JI

124
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,118
-What is it?
-It's about tomorrow's photo shoot.

125
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,829
You should take a look
at the revised concept.

126
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
Why? Does it look weird?

127
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,750
One minute.

128
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,084
MESSAGES

129
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,419
MR. JI

130
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,215
What's wrong with it?

131
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,303
-Hello.
-Hello.

132
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,722
Sir, I loved your abalone from last time.

133
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,767
They're too expensive. Maybe next time.

134
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,060
They're better today.

135
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,812
-Next time. Goodbye.
-Don't buy them from someone else!

136
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,938
How are the cucumbers?

137
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,317
Hey, Ms. Nam. Goodness, they're good.

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,735
I'll give you a big discount.

139
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,944
-Really?
-Yes.

140
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,489
Gosh.

141
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
Hello?

142
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,624
No, thank you.
I don't need a new phone. Goodbye.

143
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,626
By the way,

144
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,004
I saw that video about you.

145
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,840
I had no idea. You're incredible.

146
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,176
Gosh, not at all.

147
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,678
Of course, you are.
You raise your niece like your own

148
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,305
and live so diligently.

149
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,348
I'll halve the price!

150
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,143
No, you won't make any money then.
Just give me a few more.

151
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,603
All right.

152
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,105
-Please put them in here.
-Okay.

153
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,648
By the way,

154
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,068
you're looking good these days.

155
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,029
Your boyfriend must be treating you well.

156
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:37,947
That's right.

157
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,074
-Here.
-That'll be 5,000 won.

158
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,374
Treating me well, my foot.
He's not even texting me.

159
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,708
Here you go.

160
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,460
Thank you. I'll visit again.

161
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,338
Okay, bye. What a sweetheart.

162
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,551
That's good. Nice one.

163
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,679
That's it. Good.

164
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,641
Hold on. Let's get the table
out of the way and have you stand.

165
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,017
-Get rid of the table.
-Okay.

166
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,982
Did I get any calls?

167
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,694
IBS and Top and Top called to scout you,

168
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,195
but I rejected their proposals.

169
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,282
Director Kang called too,
so I said the photo shoot was going well.

170
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,118
I see.

171
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,079
ARE YOU BUSY? YESTERDAY I WAS…

172
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,797
I shouldn't apologize over text, right?

173
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,134
I'm not too sure.

174
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,846
Right, I should either call
or talk in person.

175
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,100
Mr. Choi, let's resume the shoot.

176
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,435
Okay. Let's go.

177
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,149
-Should I stand?
-Let's take some standing up. All right.

178
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,233
Good.

179
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,196
Okay. Good work.

180
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,489
Thanks.

181
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:05,242
Good work, sir.
You looked good on the monitor.

182
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,827
Of course. It's me, after all.

183
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,999
MS. NAM HAENG-SEON
OF NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

184
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,550
How about we move up
the 11 p.m. team meeting?

185
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,262
They've been texting and urging you
to come as soon as possible.

186
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,180
They must be busy.

187
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,556
All right, then.

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,724
How about 10 p.m.?

189
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,895
Okay. Tell them to be ready
so I won't need to repeat myself.

190
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,605
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

191
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,525
Are you Jeong Seong-hyeon?

192
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,238
It's you, right?

193
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,618
Hey, it's been ages.
I almost didn't recognize you.

194
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,955
You lost a ton of weight.
How much did you lose?

195
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,290
I think you got the wrong person.

196
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,336
I didn't. It is you.

197
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,838
I see.

198
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,217
I get that you may not be happy to see me.

199
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,385
I understand.

200
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,428
But I was curious
about how you were doing.

201
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,098
-The guys and I would talk--
-You've got the wrong person.

202
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,726
Didn't you go to Daeseon Middle School?

203
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,728
Eighth grade, class three.

204
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,108
No, I didn't.
Mr. Choi has a busy schedule today.

205
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,444
Oh, I see.

206
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,864
I'm sorry.
You just look so similar to my friend.

207
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,949
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,873
Seeing how persistent he was,
you must really look alike.

209
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,917
I guess so. I have a pretty common face.

210
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,017
It's almost lunchtime.
Will Sun-jae not come today?

211
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,102
Have you called him?

212
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,188
He won't pick up.

213
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,150
I was shocked after hearing the news
from my mom yesterday.

214
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,527
For both you and Sun-jae…

215
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,323
Not everything is
as it appears on the surface.

216
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,868
Once you look closer,
everyone has their own demons.

217
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,495
It made me reflect a bit.

218
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,123
I didn't show it,

219
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,667
but I had been envious
of how perfect you guys were.

220
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,629
"How were they born so perfect?"

221
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,967
But I'm not saying that this
changes my opinion of you…

222
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,429
Darn it. Sorry, I'm not good with words.

223
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,640
Don't worry. I know what you mean.

224
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,309
But this thought came to mind too.

225
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,731
"Could there be a secret
behind my birth as well?"

226
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,943
As you already know,
I don't look like my mom.

227
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,570
-No, you do.
-How so?

228
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,864
Except for the height and double eyelids,

229
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,532
you guys look alike.

230
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,618
I see. So we do look alike.

231
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,871
Don't make me laugh. We don't look alike.

232
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,083
So this is what I imagined.

233
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,960
When I was born,

234
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,587
some other baby and I
had gotten switched up.

235
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,341
And up until now, I just thought
my parents were my birth parents.

236
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,343
And that other baby was…

237
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,095
Hey, where's Sun-jae?

238
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,429
-Well…
-…him.

239
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,806
-Me?
-Yes.

240
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,766
-What do you mean?
-It was you.

241
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,892
What was me?

242
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,935
What?

243
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,689
You look handsome today.
You can go home now.

244
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,774
SUN-JAE, PICK UP
AREN'T YOU COMING TO SCHOOL?

245
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,692
No, you can go.

246
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,904
Don't look at me. Just go home.

247
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,080
These are the psychiatrist's notes,
his prescriptions,

248
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,084
adult guardianship forms,
and psychiatric hospital admittance forms.

249
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,838
Are you claiming insanity right now?

250
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,758
I'm just telling you
that he's in no state to be interrogated.

251
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,178
He's been cooped up in his room
for over a year.

252
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,223
He has bipolar disorder,
anxiety disorder, and hallucinations.

253
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,809
He was going to be admitted to a hospital,

254
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,395
and I was in the process
of applying for guardianship.

255
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,439
Yet you were going to send him to the US?

256
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,358
You had requested a US visa for him.

257
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,028
Oh, that?

258
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,865
I wanted to look for
other treatments abroad.

259
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,454
Excuse me.

260
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,538
Sure.

261
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,293
This is Sun-jae's homeroom teacher.
He didn't come to school.

262
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,211
Please give me a call.

263
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,305
Please release him
and investigate him without detention.

264
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,475
I believe I've thoroughly explained
his current condition.

265
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,851
We can't do that.

266
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,644
This is a murder case.

267
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
Bipolar disorder
doesn't warrant his release.

268
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,356
As I've mentioned before,

269
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,359
he tried to run away twice.

270
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,239
I understand.

271
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,367
-Then let's take a break.
-Sorry?

272
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,788
I need to go somewhere.
We can resume after I return.

273
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,956
There's a time limit
for applying for the arrest warrant.

274
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,291
We can't just--

275
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,794
Let's do that.

276
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,629
We'll take a breather.

277
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,232
Don't say anything until I return.

278
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,027
Don't utter a single word
or react in any way. Got it?

279
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,948
-Mom.
-Shut it! Don't say a single word!

280
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,870
You're claiming insanity
and refusing to talk right now.

281
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,625
I'll take care of the rest.

282
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,431
No wonder.

283
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:06,937
Come to think of it,
Ms. Jang has always been a bit strange.

284
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,772
We're neighbors, you know?

285
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,233
I'd bring her things at times,

286
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,361
and she never once
invited me in for some coffee.

287
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,281
And she had a very good reason for that.

288
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,701
Why would she lie about her son
and say he was in the US?

289
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,912
Probably because he isn't sane.

290
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,623
What do you mean?

291
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,916
I mean…

292
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,419
My friend's husband

293
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,088
is the chief investigator
at Ganghyeon Police Station.

294
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,758
So I asked her about it.
I can't tell you all the details,

295
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,761
but it wasn't a misdemeanor.

296
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,846
What?

297
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,931
It's obvious. He committed a felony.

298
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,183
What?

299
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,354
A felony? Like robbery or murder?

300
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,772
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

301
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,566
-I just got the chills.
-How scary.

302
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,069
No one can find out about this,

303
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,654
or our property values will drop.

304
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,116
We should hold a residents' meeting.

305
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,203
Right. You're the building representative.

306
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,915
She has so many positions.
She's a position collector, isn't she?

307
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,877
What are you saying?
Do you even know what that means?

308
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,379
I only end up in this position

309
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,466
because I volunteer to do things
that others don't want to do.

310
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,511
This world wouldn't be able to operate
if it weren't for people like me.

311
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,515
Yes, ma'am. I will treat you like a queen.

312
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,310
-Right. Ms. Cho, did you hear?
-What?

313
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,356
I ran into Ms. Jung
outside the academy today.

314
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,857
They've rehired

315
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,901
Choi Chi-yeol.

316
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,569
That's great.

317
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,239
What about the All Care Program?
Do you know?

318
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,619
Right. I did hear about that.

319
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,538
But I heard it's not confirmed yet.

320
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,125
But according to Ms. Jung,

321
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,087
he's coming back to the program.

322
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,380
What?

323
00:20:56,463 --> 00:21:00,634
But he wants Hae-e
to rejoin the group as well.

324
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,720
No way. He's being ridiculous.

325
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,431
Is it because
she's his girlfriend's daughter?

326
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,976
But to be honest,

327
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,229
she was supposed to be
in the program from the get-go.

328
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,480
That's right.

329
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,026
She was just kicked out
because you said she wasn't up to par

330
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,821
and wanted to replace her
with another student.

331
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,366
I'm sure the other moms
will be fine with it too.

332
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,785
She's definitely up to par now.

333
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,079
She aced the September mock.

334
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,084
If that's what you all think,
then I'm all for it too.

335
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,506
Anyway, I'll check with the academy.

336
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,967
She should rejoin.

337
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,558
Mom, where's Hui-jae?

338
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,517
Is he okay?

339
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,977
How did it go?

340
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,897
Why are you here?

341
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,025
Why aren't you at school?

342
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,568
I was just too worried.

343
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,069
Even still.

344
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,196
Are you serious?
Your midterms start tomorrow.

345
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,282
The exams aren't important right now.

346
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,867
Then what is?

347
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,869
Your school grades matter a lot this year.

348
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,996
You must get Level 1 in Language Arts.

349
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,207
Do you think you can ace your CSAT?

350
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,876
Will you ruin your life over Hui-jae?

351
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,171
Will my life be ruined
if I fail tomorrow's exams?

352
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,422
Of course.

353
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,300
-Look at Hui-jae.
-You're wrong.

354
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,594
His life was ruined
because you pressured him--

355
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,679
You can resent and criticize me
all you want…

356
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,515
after you get into a university.

357
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,435
As much as you want.

358
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,192
It's too late for school, so go study.

359
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,069
That's your duty.

360
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,738
-Go.
-Mom.

361
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,991
Stay focused.
The exams start in less than 24 hours.

362
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,077
I told you to go to study.

363
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,329
-But Hui-jae…
-Go on.

364
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,747
Mom, I really can't.

365
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,999
Go in right now.

366
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,334
-Sun-jae.
-Mom.

367
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,919
Listen to me.

368
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,604
So a sub six is symmetrical to a sub five.

369
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,358
Then a sub four plus a sub six…

370
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,568
is two a sub five.

371
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,736
SUN-JAE

372
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,113
Is this right?

373
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,990
Is this wrong?

374
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,706
-Hae-e.
-Yes?

375
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,875
Are you done?

376
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,880
Are you that worried?

377
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,590
About Sun-jae?

378
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,136
Sorry.

379
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,179
I'll focus.

380
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,015
You know how it is…

381
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,271
when you're too upset to talk to anyone.

382
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,274
That was how I felt

383
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,360
when I was told I couldn't play
ice hockey anymore after my injury.

384
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,406
You should give him

385
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,741
some time.

386
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,787
That punk.

387
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,165
I know it wasn't intentional,

388
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,085
but what good timing.

389
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,753
-What do you mean?
-It's nothing.

390
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,631
It's something only he and I know.

391
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,100
This won't do.

392
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,268
I can't focus either.

393
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,562
-Shall we call it a day?
-No.

394
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,606
We need to tire our bodies out.

395
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,733
Stop our minds from wandering.

396
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,819
How?

397
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,617
You're doing well.

398
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,577
Don't be scared and let go.

399
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,371
That's it.

400
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,253
See? Aren't you glad you're here?

401
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,297
-You're not worried anymore, are you?
-No.

402
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,591
I'm only focused on not falling.

403
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,428
Stop.

404
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,430
Okay.

405
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,724
Look.

406
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,893
Legs shoulder-width apart.

407
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,603
Knees bent.

408
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,022
-Start with your right foot.
-Yes.

409
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,441
Imagine that you're pressing away the ice.

410
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,654
One, two.

411
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,531
Don't be afraid of falling.

412
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,284
You'll only hurt yourself
if you're scared to fall.

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,537
-So? Are you getting the hang of it?
-Yes.

414
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,748
Two.

415
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,043
You're doing well.

416
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,840
I think your heart just skipped a beat.

417
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,428
-No?
-You're wrong.

418
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,896
I get it, so hold my hand.
You'll hurt yourself.

419
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,814
I'm okay.

420
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,856
-Really?
-Yes.

421
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,442
That's it.

422
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,569
Not bad.

423
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,822
Keep practicing.

424
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,906
Okay.

425
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,003
He's good.

426
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,060
So?

427
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,187
Doesn't it feel nice to exercise?

428
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,481
You can focus now, right?

429
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,026
Yes. I agree.

430
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,989
To be honest,

431
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,327
I wanted to show you how well I skated
at some point or another.

432
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,288
You've only seen my foolish side.

433
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,417
But then again,
I've never really studied before.

434
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
So…

435
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,131
I wanted to show you what I was good at

436
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,883
and that I also worked hard in life.

437
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,469
I wanted to impress you.

438
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,473
Did it work?

439
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,391
There's no need for that.

440
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,269
You're already amazing.

441
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,647
What was that?

442
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,859
Why doesn't your compliment
give me any hope?

443
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,989
This is so hard.

444
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,409
Dating is just as hard as studying.

445
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,253
Sun-jae must feel troubled.

446
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,006
I can tell by his looks
that he's a softie.

447
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,135
Should I pack some side dishes
for his family?

448
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,388
She's probably too distracted to cook.

449
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,473
That's enough.

450
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,809
Didn't she ignore you
at the police station?

451
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,146
I'm sure her ego was bruised
when you saw her there.

452
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,649
Do you think you're a fortune teller?

453
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,068
You and your absurd assumptions
about others…

454
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,820
What matters is that I'm right.

455
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,614
Who noticed
Mr. Choi's lovey-dovey gaze again?

456
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,617
MR. CHOI CHI-YEOL

457
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,247
GANGHYEON DELIVERY

458
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,498
YOUR ORDER IS ON ITS WAY

459
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,627
Who is that? Waiting for Mr. Choi's call?

460
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,088
No, I was just checking my phone.

461
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,923
I beg to differ.

462
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,217
Your eyes were glued to the phone all day.

463
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,552
Right, Jae-woo?

464
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,722
Yes. It wasn't even ringing,
but she checked it 17 times.

465
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,519
I wonder why you haven't gotten
a single call from him today.

466
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,938
They say a man is only out of touch

467
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,899
when he's imprisoned,
mourning, or uninterested in you.

468
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,027
-Did you two fight?
-No way! We're not kids.

469
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,612
We're ripened adults.

470
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,364
Mature. Ripened is for fruit.

471
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,701
Anyway! Same difference.

472
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,828
You did fight.

473
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,913
Hey, stop staring at your phone.

474
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,832
Call him first since you're so ripe.

475
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,791
We didn't…

476
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,920
Why do you never listen to me?

477
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,922
You're so weird.

478
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,141
That brat saw right through me.

479
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,313
I can't believe this guy.

480
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,610
I know I'm impatient
and hate leaving things unresolved,

481
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,736
but I won't give in.

482
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,156
Never. I won't call him first.

483
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,121
But this is so frustrating.

484
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,503
Right. I'm not a teenager
who's playing hard to get.

485
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,339
Be nonchalant

486
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,091
and mature.

487
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,566
That's such a unique color. It's pretty.

488
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,945
Orange-brown.
It's my favorite color these days.

489
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,155
SECOND REVISION

490
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,908
Tomorrow's online class
includes composite functions, right?

491
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,576
-Yes.
-I read the Q and A board,

492
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,621
and the students seem to be struggling
with function graphs.

493
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,164
I think we should go over

494
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,417
how to solve composite functions
by using graphs.

495
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,088
Okay. They seem to struggle
with equations that have graphs.

496
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,423
Okay, let's come up with a few of those

497
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,927
and help reinforce their confidence
when it comes to applied questions.

498
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,053
I'll reorder the questions.

499
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,930
Okay, let's do a test run right away.

500
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,348
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

501
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,725
-Yeon-gyeong, is this a typo or an error?
-Yes?

502
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,102
What? I'm sorry.

503
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,562
I'm not upset.

504
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,729
-Look at this.
-Where?

505
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,147
This one.

506
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,110
-I think it's an error.
-It needs to be smaller.

507
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,990
Are you very busy? I miss your voice.

508
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,741
DELETE

509
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,410
-I'll do it right now.
-Okay.

510
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,912
Next question.

511
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,858
NAM HAE-E

512
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,819
I was going to wait for you to call first,
but I'm too worried.

513
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,364
Can I see you?
I'm at the playground near your house.

514
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,631
SUN-JAE

515
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,216
CAN I SEE YOU?
I'M AT THE PLAYGROUND NEAR YOUR HOUSE.

516
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,643
Sun-jae.

517
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:21,105
Do you know how many times I called?
You didn't reply to my texts either.

518
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,232
I know this is tough for you,

519
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,110
but you should reply since I'm worried…

520
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,357
It's okay.

521
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:27,463
DETECTIVE DIVISION

522
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,804
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail…

523
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,058
Is he studying or what?

524
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,539
It's me, ma'am.

525
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,584
I'm sorry for calling so late.

526
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,256
I was wondering

527
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,010
if your offer was still valid.

528
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,474
About how you'd help me with anything.

529
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,483
I had never seen Sun-jae cry before.

530
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,194
It broke my heart.

531
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,489
What about his brother?

532
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,699
Will he be let out?

533
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:42,163
I'm not sure, but his mom
is trying to help get him out.

534
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,167
So has Hui-jae been cooped up
in his room the entire time?

535
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,044
He came out every now and then,

536
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,089
but his mom wasn't happy about it.

537
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,633
She didn't want people to know
that he wasn't abroad.

538
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,052
Shocking.

539
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,722
I don't exactly know…

540
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,308
what a family is.

541
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,019
Sun-jae has two parents,

542
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,563
both of whom are lawyers,
and an older brother as well.

543
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,027
But he still seemed so lonely.

544
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,865
Everyone is alone in this world.

545
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,992
We all feel lonely despite having company.

546
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,995
-You're lonely?
-Why do you ask?

547
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,539
Shouldn't you be on cloud nine?

548
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,292
I am.

549
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,087
I couldn't be happier.

550
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,021
I swallowed my pride and texted him first,

551
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,231
but he ignores me?

552
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,402
Forget it.

553
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,947
We've barely begun the relationship,
so we can just end it.

554
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,365
I don't need him in my life.

555
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,451
Forget it.

556
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,248
The alarm.

557
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,139
It's really late, right?

558
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,892
What? Right.

559
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,852
It's 3 a.m.

560
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
Time just flew by.

561
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,149
All this work is exhausting
after taking a break.

562
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,026
You must be tired. Grab a cab.

563
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,527
I can drive today.

564
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,653
No, I'll drive you--

565
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,239
Forget it. Catching a cab at this hour is…

566
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,618
Come to think of it,

567
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,164
I don't even know your address.
Can you believe that?

568
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,041
Hop in. I'll drop you off.

569
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,168
That's okay. I'll drive you home.

570
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,255
Jeez, you little punk.

571
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,133
You don't want to tell me your address.

572
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,011
Are you trying to be mysterious or what?

573
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,988
We should depart at 10 a.m. tomorrow
since it'll be a long trip.

574
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,283
Why do I have such a tight schedule?

575
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,744
What am I doing tomorrow?

576
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,455
You have a special class in Incheon
for parents of seniors,

577
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,082
hosted by the Private Academy Association.

578
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,501
I tried to dissuade you back then.

579
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,796
But you said the educational gap
between Seoul and the provinces

580
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,340
needed to be narrowed down.

581
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,258
I did?

582
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,677
I must've been so full of myself.

583
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,887
You should've stopped me.

584
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,556
Next time I do that, just curse at me.

585
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,725
Better yet, just hit me.

586
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,185
Okay. I'll do that.

587
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,940
Yes, smile.

588
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,776
You should smile.
You look friendlier that way.

589
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,785
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Nam?

590
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,163
No. Did she say something?

591
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,498
No, she didn't.

592
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,875
I just want you two to get along.

593
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,629
You tend to look cold
when you're not smiling.

594
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,757
She could get the wrong idea,
so try to smile more often.

595
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,510
Okay, I will.

596
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,395
You must like her a lot.

597
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,480
What?

598
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,233
Yes.

599
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,487
I feel at peace when I think of her.

600
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,908
Come to think of it, you haven't dreamed
of that student lately.

601
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,910
Is that so?

602
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,621
You're right.

603
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,083
How fascinating.

604
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,388
Thanks. Good night.

605
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,765
You too.

606
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,350
I'll come here tomorrow morning.

607
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,702
GOOD LUCK WITH THE EXAM.
I'M OFF TO BUY GROCERIES!

608
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,571
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

609
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,091
You're right behind me.

610
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,096
Hello, ma'am. How are the radishes today?

611
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,307
They're good, of course.
Would you like one?

612
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,184
Yes, please.

613
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,268
Who is…

614
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,229
Is he…

615
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,898
Yes, he is.

616
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,194
Goodness. He's so handsome.

617
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,363
He's so tall too.

618
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,449
-Thank you.
-Goodness!

619
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,534
He even has a nice voice.

620
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,953
Is he really a teacher?

621
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,456
He looks like a celebrity.

622
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,793
He's like a clean head
of napa cabbage. So tall.

623
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,671
Jeez, don't say that.
Speaking of which, I want a cabbage too.

624
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,965
-Please pack them for me.
-Okay.

625
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,511
Gosh, he's so handsome.

626
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,605
This tastes different
from the one at the campsite.

627
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,398
-It's so tasty.
-Right?

628
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,692
I always have a cup
after grocery shopping.

629
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,569
It's tasty.

630
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,242
Did you really wait an hour and a half
since 3:30 in the morning?

631
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,495
I made a mistake, after all.

632
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,581
At least you know.

633
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
Even if you were upset,

634
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,169
how could you ignore the text I sent
after swallowing my pride?

635
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,379
You're so mean.

636
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,340
You sent a text? I didn't get it.

637
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,134
Look at you.

638
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,808
See?

639
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,851
Will you still deny it?

640
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,730
Look. I didn't get it.

641
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,483
You're right.

642
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,735
But it says it was sent on my phone.

643
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,030
Jeez, machines sure aren't
completely reliable.

644
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,909
I would've been in huge trouble
had I not waited for you.

645
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,161
You're right. You were lucky.

646
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,455
When I cut ties with someone,

647
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,834
I am utterly merciless
and make a clean break.

648
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,002
I never look back.

649
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,465
I'm sorry about what I said. I apologize.

650
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:19,430
I just wanted you to get along
with someone who's dear to me.

651
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,308
I was trying to mediate,
but it came out wrong.

652
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,352
I know. I was also being too sensitive.

653
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,229
I twisted your words.

654
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,193
Should we go somewhere
when I become less busy?

655
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,862
Is there anywhere you want to go?

656
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,656
Let me think.

657
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,868
I'm fine as long as
I get out of this neighborhood.

658
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,911
Maybe the sea.

659
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,164
The sea. Okay, let's go.

660
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,749
Which way, east, south, or west?

661
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:47,666
Hold on.

662
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,293
What?

663
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,296
There's also a sea in Incheon.

664
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,766
Why did you suddenly ask me
to come to Incheon with you?

665
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,310
You wanted to go to the sea.

666
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,813
Incheon is well-known
for its coastal drives.

667
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,690
I know that.

668
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,818
But I feel like I'm bothering you
when you're going there for work.

669
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,237
Mr. Ji must feel uncomfortable too.

670
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,990
No, not at all.

671
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,077
This is much more exciting
than just driving with Mr. Choi.

672
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,123
Should I turn on the heater?

673
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,291
No, I'm fine.

674
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,336
If you're sleepy, I can take over.

675
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,796
I'm a great driver.

676
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,256
That's okay. I'm in good condition.

677
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,883
Just sit back and relax.

678
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,347
I still don't know if I should be here.

679
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,099
What about my store?

680
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,559
Didn't you say
you had already made the side dishes?

681
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,728
You got Yeong-ju
and Jae-woo's permission too.

682
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,523
I'm sure they'll do just fine.

683
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,358
I bet they're happy that you're gone.

684
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,489
NO SPECIALS TODAY
BEEF RADISH SOUP AND SIDE DISHES AVAILABLE

685
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,409
Jeez, Haeng-seon must be at the beach.

686
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,246
She must be tying seashells

687
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:10,749
And putting them around his neck

688
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,586
Whereas I'm opening these smelly cockles.

689
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,256
I'm so desperate to be in a relationship.

690
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,258
I don't ask for much in men.

691
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,176
I only want someone kind-hearted

692
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,430
and just two centimeters taller than me.

693
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,729
Who put this so high up?

694
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,525
Jeez.

695
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,410
Here.

696
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,328
Thanks.

697
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,752
He's grown much taller.

698
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,921
He used to be shorter than me.

699
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,471
Maybe I didn't notice because
I never looked at him as a man.

700
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,724
2ND SEMESTER MIDTERMS
MATH

701
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,149
Where is she?

702
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,567
Wait up!

703
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:01,985
Goodbye.

704
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,243
It's 247.

705
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,536
No way, Hae-e.

706
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,454
You got all of the math questions right?

707
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,166
I got lucky. One of the questions
I practiced was on the exam.

708
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,044
Jeez, studying is so hard. I'm done for.

709
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,254
Lucky you.

710
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,425
My mom will definitely nag me.

711
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:51,952
GANGHYEON POLICE STATION

712
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,212
MEDICINE

713
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,317
Your brother brought this.

714
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,444
He asked how you were doing.

715
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,239
He seemed quite worried about you.

716
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,033
Shouldn't you get out of here?

717
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,413
I understand that your mother
wanted you to stay quiet,

718
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,206
but that will only drag the case out.

719
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,250
I just have one question.

720
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,797
You know him, right?

721
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,550
Weren't you at Saeam Vista that night?

722
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,809
What are you doing?

723
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,945
Don't you know that
interrogating him while I'm away

724
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,950
is a violation of his right
to receive help from a lawyer?

725
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:21,041
INTERROGATION RECORDING ROOM A

726
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,086
Let's just request a warrant.

727
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,005
Without further investigation?
We have him for 12 more hours.

728
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,384
We won't get anything out of him
as long as his mother is by his side.

729
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,594
We'll only tire ourselves out.

730
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,889
That's true. That woman is so obstinate.

731
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,808
I get that she's a lawyer, but still.

732
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,144
Her attitude is a bit odd.

733
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,564
If she thought her son was innocent,

734
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,567
she would've gotten
to the bottom of this to clear his name.

735
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,278
But she kept him silent.

736
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
And claimed insanity.

737
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,615
I agree.

738
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,951
She doesn't look very upset either.

739
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,412
I'll request a warrant then.

740
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,351
READING

741
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,069
MOM

742
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,742
Hello?

743
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,869
Are you home? How was the exam?

744
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,913
I did so-so.

745
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,332
Are you serious right now?

746
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,084
Really?

747
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,176
I'll take care of Hui-jae, so don't worry.

748
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,094
Just focus on your exams.

749
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,972
You have Reading tomorrow, right?

750
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,016
Did you see the material on the table?

751
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,437
-Yes.
-Solve them thoroughly.

752
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,105
That wasn't easy to get a hold of.

753
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,733
Don't show it to anyone.

754
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,111
Hello? Are you listening?

755
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,531
Solve the questions by yourself.
Remember that.

756
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,325
Understand?

757
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,786
Okay.

758
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,044
The period before a student enters
their senior year is critical.

759
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,422
Every time someone asks me
how their kid should study,

760
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,051
I give them the same answer
no matter the student's grades.

761
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,223
They must master the hands-on concepts
before the break begins.

762
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:46,937
After that, they should solve
as many practice workbooks as possible.

763
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,899
It's important to figure out
the right strategy for admissions…

764
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:51,900
I…

765
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,238
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

766
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,495
So they enter their senior year.

767
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,580
What strategies must they use now?

768
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,253
I've seen yachts on TV
but never in person.

769
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,337
No way!

770
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,756
Are we really sailing on that?

771
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,050
Of course. Do you think
we're here to just look?

772
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,928
I told you I had planned out
a luxurious premium course.

773
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,596
Hop in.

774
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,598
Do we just hop on?

775
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,517
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

776
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,436
-Watch your step.
-Goodness.

777
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,023
Am I invisible? Am I a ghost?

778
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,068
Jeez, you're so jealous.
Help him out, Mr. Ji.

779
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:36,444
-Should I?
-Yes.

780
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,114
Thank you, honey.

781
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,755
It's the sea!

782
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,634
Have you never seen it before?

783
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,137
How adorable.

784
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,973
It feels so refreshing.

785
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,351
Is this yacht really yours?

786
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,645
Isn't it about time
you understood who I am?

787
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,647
I told you before, but I'm the Trillion--

788
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,274
I know. The Trillion Won Man.

789
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,902
But it never felt real to me.

790
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,404
Gosh, you sure are wealthy.

791
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,993
When did Mr. Ji learn to drive a yacht?

792
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,661
When I bought this yacht.

793
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,372
He said he needed to learn how to drive

794
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,458
all of my means of transportation.

795
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,877
Are you learning how to fly
a light plane next week?

796
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,462
-No, in two weeks.
-In two weeks.

797
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,881
Mr. Ji, you're a great driver.

798
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,303
I must've gotten the wrong idea about him.

799
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,894
I'm glad that you two
have cleared things up.

800
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,275
This is wonderful.

801
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,406
-Are you cold?
-No, it's not so bad.

802
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,787
-You are cold. I'll get a blanket.
-No, I'm fine.

803
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,708
Jeez, I'm really fine.

804
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,795
This feels like a dream.

805
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,030
Haeng-seon.

806
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,750
It's a light scrape,
so the dressing will be enough.

807
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,669
Just in case, get a shot before you go

808
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,796
and disinfect the wound when you get back.

809
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,339
Okay. Thank you.

810
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,553
I'm truly sorry.

811
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,515
I should've been more careful,
but the waves suddenly hit.

812
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,602
That's okay.

813
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,732
I'm an idiot.
I should've controlled the yacht better.

814
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:22,402
You didn't do it on purpose.
People make mistakes.

815
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,486
But still,

816
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,406
she's a cook, and I injured her hand.

817
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,370
You can go. I'll take her home.

818
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,122
No, I should--

819
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,082
Go rest up. You must be startled too.

820
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,709
Thanks for today.

821
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,211
Okay.

822
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,466
I'm truly sorry. Get better soon.

823
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,593
I will. Goodbye.

824
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,652
Hey, you came out as soon as I texted.

825
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,820
As you should.

826
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,657
-Why are you here?
-Here.

827
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,413
They're notes from Reading
from the day you were absent.

828
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,500
The teacher pointed them out,
so those questions will come up.

829
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,380
-Thanks.
-Just do well on the exam.

830
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,882
You need to do well in Language Arts.

831
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,262
-Hae-e.
-Yes?

832
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,972
Wait here for just a minute.

833
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,518
Why?

834
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,524
Right.

835
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,449
No, this is for after the exams.

836
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,701
Yes.

837
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,559
My mom told me
not to share it with others,

838
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,185
so I'm sure it will help.

839
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,188
I've finished them all.
You should work on them too.

840
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,661
Jeez.

841
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:50,884
How reliable.

842
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,052
You've grown up well, Jae-woo.

843
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,346
Thank you for today. Goodbye.

844
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,473
Hey.

845
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,684
Since our boss isn't here, how about we…

846
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,769
have a drink?

847
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:06,232
We should also discuss
the future of Nation's Best.

848
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,443
But I can't drink.

849
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,652
Hey.

850
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,573
I'll be the one drinking.
You'll be the one eating.

851
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:18,119
I think Haeng-seon should be here
if we want to discuss her store's future.

852
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,456
Hey, you tend to overthink things.

853
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,376
We can discuss it first
and report it to our boss later.

854
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,378
Hey, let's go.

855
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,464
It's my treat.

856
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,229
-Here's your food.
-Thank you.

857
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,443
Yeong-ju.

858
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,404
When will we discuss the store's future?

859
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,823
I'm full from the soda.

860
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,076
Jae-woo.

861
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,288
I am truly

862
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,791
lonely these days.

863
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,546
Honestly, don't you think
I'm pretty decent?

864
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,423
My personality? It's great.

865
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,634
My personality is great.

866
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,177
I have a great personality.

867
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,429
Don't you think so?

868
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,890
Yes, you're a decent woman.

869
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,309
Really?

870
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,771
Am I really?

871
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,314
Yes, really.

872
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,281
In that case,

873
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:39,993
if you take a bite of that,
that means we're going out.

874
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,289
-What?
-You said I was decent.

875
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,040
So if you eat that,

876
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,960
it means you're my boyfriend.

877
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,461
What do you say?

878
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,261
That's gross.

879
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,643
"Gross"? Why?

880
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,021
You're Haeng-seon's friend.

881
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,567
You're like a sister and family to me.

882
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,944
So to think that you'll be my girlfriend…

883
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,488
is gross.

884
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,449
It'd feel weird.

885
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,659
I see.

886
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,370
I'm a decent woman,

887
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,664
but to have me as a girlfriend

888
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,500
is gross.

889
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,170
-Yes.
-Right, that's understandable.

890
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,926
Hey. What the heck?

891
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,762
Gosh.

892
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,847
All right.

893
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:46,434
That sobered me up. I should just go home!

894
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,356
Excuse me.

895
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:56,110
Goodbye. Jae-woo, you can pay!

896
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,030
Yeong-ju.

897
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,198
Wait up!

898
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,242
-Live octopus, two bottles of soju,
-What do I do?

899
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,411
-and a soda. 31,000 won.
-What's wrong with me?

900
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,371
Yeong-ju!

901
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:08,873
Yeong-ju!

902
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,882
Her expression was weird.

903
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,470
She looked sad and upset.

904
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,015
Was it because of what I said?

905
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,186
Because I said it was gross?

906
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,028
What was that earlier?

907
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,824
I'm certain he turned the handle
abruptly on purpose.

908
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,875
Are you okay?

909
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,086
What?

910
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,339
How's the wound? Does it sting?

911
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,135
It's okay. It's just a scrape.

912
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,055
It could've been dangerous.

913
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,890
It's lucky you're athletic.

914
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,060
What if you fell into the sea?

915
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,153
You may be okay now,
but it might hurt after some time.

916
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,362
Apply some ointment.

917
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,407
The doctor said to disinfect it
before going to bed,

918
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,616
so don't forget that.

919
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,586
Are you listening to me?

920
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,089
-Yes.
-Make sure you disinfect it.

921
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,512
You seem to be
very startled and out of it.

922
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,722
I'm not.

923
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:50,308
I'll disinfect it. Don't worry.

924
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,648
That can't be.

925
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,400
I'm just being overly sensitive.

926
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,735
Why would he do that?

927
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,033
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

928
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,544
Aren't you dropping me off?

929
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,754
I'm kidnapping you.

930
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:22,381
Kidnapping me? Where are we going?

931
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,926
To my house. You're worrying me too much.

932
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,302
I'll take care of you today.

933
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:30,056
We need to disinfect it,
and you seem out of it.

934
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,559
You don't need to do that.
Just drop me off.

935
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,492
Does it sting?

936
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,702
I'm almost done.

937
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,788
Hang in there.

938
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,007
I should go.

939
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,801
You didn't get any sleep yesterday,

940
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,512
so you should sleep now.
You must have a long day tomorrow.

941
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,638
Good night.

942
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,526
Can you stay the night?

943
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,909
Spend the night.

944
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,580
Stay with me.

945
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:33,948
You're up?

946
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,282
Where are you going?

947
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,244
I need to go home before the kids wake up.

948
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:44,166
Don't leave.
I want to have breakfast together.

949
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,210
Right.

950
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,463
-How's your hand?
-It's okay.

951
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,798
I really should go.

952
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:57,847
I'll drop you off.

953
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,850
But I really need to go--

954
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,018
Just five minutes.

955
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,645
Let's just lie here for five minutes.

956
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,454
-I'm off.
-Bye.

957
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,538
Bye.

958
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,668
Go.

959
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:28,627
Hurry.

960
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,879
Okay.

961
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:42,725
Oh, my!

962
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,851
Hey, Mom.

963
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,479
Good morning.
You're already going to school?

964
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,814
I wanted to get some reviewing in
before the exam.

965
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,899
I see.

966
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,651
I didn't just come home.

967
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,237
I went down to get something--

968
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,280
Okay. I didn't ask.

969
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,240
-Bye.
-Bye.

970
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,201
But Mom,

971
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:01,243
get changed.

972
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,245
Or Auntie Yeong-ju will tease you.

973
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,914
Of course.

974
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:05,998
Bye.

975
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,170
That was so embarrassing.

976
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:17,885
Off to school already?

977
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,971
You're probably too nervous to eat.
How about some juice?

978
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,641
It's okay. Goodbye.

979
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,351
Sun-jae.

980
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,074
I'm at a dead end.

981
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,077
No matter what,

982
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,789
you have to listen to me.

983
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,124
You know that, right?

984
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,090
I'm off to school.

985
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,940
HOLDING CELL 2

986
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,199
He seemed quite worried about you.

987
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,493
Shouldn't you get out of here?

988
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:44,847
2ND SEMESTER MIDTERMS
READING

989
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,307
All right. You may begin.

990
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,596
COURT

991
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:25,281
COUNSEL

992
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,746
A warrant review isn't about
whether you're guilty or not.

993
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,417
They're here to determine
whether to let you go or not.

994
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,837
Just keep your mouth shut.

995
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,300
I'll do the talking.

996
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,971
COURT

997
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,808
Like so, the suspect has no intention
of cooperating with the investigation.

998
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,644
Due to concerns about his fleeing
or destruction of evidence,

999
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,022
we'd like to request an arrest warrant.

1000
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:02,192
Furthermore, not only is he a suspect
in the murder of Mr. Jin I-sang,

1001
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,029
but he's also a suspect
in another murder case.

1002
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,781
-This could be a serial killing--
-Your Honor.

1003
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,075
Please understand
that keeping him in custody

1004
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,120
for other cases
is a violation of the warrant's rule.

1005
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:16,081
JUDGE'S BENCH

1006
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:20,294
Since the warrant only mentions
Jin I-sang's murder case,

1007
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:23,881
the hearing will be confined
within that boundary.

1008
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,509
Mr. Lee Hui-jae.

1009
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,680
Do you admit to the charge on the warrant?

1010
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:36,685
Did you murder Mr. Jin I-sang?

1011
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,856
-Your Honor--
-I saw it.

1012
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,610
What did you see?

1013
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,405
Mr. Jin's last moments?

1014
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,948
Because you murdered him?

1015
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:52,159
Your Honor.

1016
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,954
My client is in
an extremely unstable mental state--

1017
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,414
No, I didn't kill him.

1018
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:09,009
I'm a witness.

1019
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,368
Why does this person
order so many metal balls so often

1020
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:37,996
when there's not even an elevator?

1021
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,748
What's the use of them anyway?

1022
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,502
I'm dying here.

1023
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:45,629
I should get paid more for this.

1024
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:07,109

1027
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,283
Someone else…

1028
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,160
killed him.

1029
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:34,988
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1030
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:35,906
Hey.

1031
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,116
Brother-in-Law.

1032
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,037
Does this mean we'll sleep together
in my room tonight?

1033
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:45,082
What are you doing?

1034
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:46,667
Is this your true nature?

1035
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,210
What are you trying to say?

1036
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:49,503
How is this for my sake?

1037
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,963
You deceived me, you know that?

1038
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:55,050
I told you numerous times
not to show it to anyone else!

1039
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:58,053
Many people's lives
could be ruined because of you.

1040
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:01,848
Even Hae-e could be stressed out
about college admissions.

1041
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,392
Where could Hae-e be?

1042
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:11,024
