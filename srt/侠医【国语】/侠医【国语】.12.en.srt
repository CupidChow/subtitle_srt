1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I like your slogan.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's fearless, painless and limitless.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Most importantly, after the ad,

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
more people will pay attention to our products.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mai Mai Tong is going to make employees

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
compete with the smoke and ashes.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Before things are resolved,

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we're going to cancel today's ad.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Luckily, I saw on the Internet

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
the employees beating people.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Otherwise, if I want to be their spokesperson,

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll be affected by their health.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We didn't expect that.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We're doing business.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's good to compete fairly.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't expect that

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
he would beat people to steal our raw materials.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Henry has been lying in the hospital for a day.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Poor guy.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm just a minor injury.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But Mr. Ma really impressed me.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your right foot was injured a while ago.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You made such a quick effort.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Deng.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's good to call me Xiang Zai.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Xiang Zai, I mean it.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I really appreciate you.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Xiang Zai is very considerate

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and demanding.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He worked hard on physical therapy after he was injured.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He just took a half month off and started training.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This spirit of fighting is suitable for us.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you become the spokesperson,

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
we'll use the pain relieving medicine

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to relieve Hong Kong people from their pain.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Does it make sense?

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We've thought of the slogan.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Say it.

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Even if you were hurt or fell,

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
you never give up.

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You'll be the best.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is it OK?

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
OK.

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you for teaching me.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
To be honest,

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I planned to prepare for the Asian World Championships

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
after the ad.

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The schedule might be a little bit tight.

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I may not have time to come.

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We'll come to you on time.

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It won't take long.

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I was injured.

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If I want to recover,

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I need to have a rest.

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's important.

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's a rest to shoot an ad.

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's good to have more light

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and give back to the supporters.

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But we just pushed Mai Maitong away.

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We'll take your endorsement right away.

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's hard to say the past.

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know Mai Maitong

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is very sincere.

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I won't go back on my word.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We can afford

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
how much Mai Maitong gives you.

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We'll only give more.

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I promise you'll be satisfied.

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll leave the box to you.

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're still watching.

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Please have a rest.

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Be careful of your eyes.

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do we need to see the reaction of the public?

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've already sent it to the forum.

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But if no one supports it,

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
it will sink down soon.

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Azu has never done anything wrong.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I believe it's a chance.

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why did you bring out the love note?

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There will be real wine and love wine.

111
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The company is in chaos.

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I have time to cure the illness.

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The illness is not different from time to time.

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not waiting for people.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Anyway, you need to cure it if you're sick.

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
For example, your sister.

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As long as she's ready,

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can cure her anytime.

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you know my dad is funny?

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He used a thin paper at home

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to pretend to be a needle.

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He said he would practice with my sister.

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My sister is also working hard.

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She's trying to adapt to the feeling of being stabbed.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I think she can overcome it soon.

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The patient's efforts

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
have already made a big step.

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
After this,

129
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll go to your house to see her

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and give her some encouragement.

131
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ming.

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you here, Rachel?

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Did I bother you?

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, I'm leaving.

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Help me to cure the illness.

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ming.

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Didn't you say you wanted to go to my house?

138
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How about having dinner tonight?

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Call me when you're done.

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wish you a happy death.

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, bye.

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
1022 1533 5213

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so beautiful.

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm wearing this because I saw you.

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's so beautiful.

147
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is there more?

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, I drew this.

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dinner is ready.

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm so hungry.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
My sister suddenly said she wanted to eat dumplings.

152
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry to bother you, Grandma Ju.

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No problem.

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Men have a good appetite.

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Men have a good appetite.

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Eat more.

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You really don't have to wait for Ming?

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, he didn't reply.

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's eat first.

160
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Besides, we can't wait for the dumplings.

161
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We'll eat them all.

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You should eat more, too.

163
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're welcome.

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, thank you.

165
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't expect you to develop

166
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to meet your parents.

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No.

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm here to help the machine

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
repair its power supply.

170
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Its computer is too old.

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So the software can't run.

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, Jiajun is very good.

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He can do it in a few steps.

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's time to eat.

175
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll leave it here.

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I really want to have a good grandson-in-law.

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I really want to have a good grandson-in-law.

178
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

179
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who said there are purple dishes?

180
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, Grandma Ju.

181
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is a new style.

182
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is made by Grandma Ju

183
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
according to the machine-designed

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
flying sweet dumplings.

185
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Look at the purple dishes on it.

186
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's her Dou Peng.

187
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Did you see our IG account?

188
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, what account?

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wow, so many.

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are many fans.

191
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The one you're looking at is leek dumplings.

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But speaking of colors,

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I should add some new friends.

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wow, it's still out.

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How long will it take?

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're still out.

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
When will it be out?

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't talk nonsense.

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I didn't agree to it.

200
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you afraid of?

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm happy to share it with you.

202
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Actually, there is a company

203
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that wants to find a loan to invest.

204
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a very famous IP agent company in Hong Kong.

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They're interested in the design of flying sweet dumplings.

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They want to invest in some products in the Asian market.

207
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If it succeeds,

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
they might cooperate with the brand.

209
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Remember to tell me then.

210
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can't buy it if you steal it.

211
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There are not even a single piece of the eight characters.

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's talk about it when it's done.

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Since there is a company to talk to you,

214
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
it proves that your creation has market value.

215
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You should be confident in yourself.

216
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm just worried that

217
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
she won't be able to recover by then.

218
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't have to worry about that.

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm the busier and more energetic.

220
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because the dumpling god who makes dumplings

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is sick,

222
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
but he doesn't want to cure the illness.

223
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So he can't make a good looking dumpling

224
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
when he's shaking his hands.

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why doesn't he cure the illness?

226
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The doctor said that

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
he can recover by steaming the wine.

228
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But he's afraid of being pierced.

229
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He doesn't want to cure the illness,

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
so the illness can't be cured.

231
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If it goes on like this,

232
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
there will be no delicious dumplings in the world.

233
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What should we do?

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The water corner is a mess.

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There is no dumpling god in the world.

236
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't believe you.

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But someone is really afraid of being pierced.

238
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He doesn't want to go to the wine.

239
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mom,

240
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
you want to go to the wine with me?

241
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Dr. Ling?

242
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You don't even trust him?

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How about this?

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you are really afraid,

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can draw a flying dumpling

246
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to cheer you up.

247
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you still feel pain in the abdomen or the spine,

248
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you can use the scapula.

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's probably this position.

250
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It can help with pain in the finger.

251
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's good to use a little force.

252
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ming,

254
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you just helped me to make the wine.

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I really feel much better.

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

257
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're welcome.

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're welcome.

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Did I disturb you?

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you going to eat at the retro house?

261
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why are you so hurt?

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I told you not to fight anymore.

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I listen to you.

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to quit the club.

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I did this last time.

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Come on,

267
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
bring me a bottle of wine.

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Turn around and show me.

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Your spine is very bad.

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I need to help you to make the wine.

271
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you for tonight.

272
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Go back and rest early.

273
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Remember,

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you are cold.

275
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't stay up late.

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't drink.

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The cold is the wound of the foreign gas.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sorry, Rachel.

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Brother Zhi suddenly got a body injury.

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I need to help him to deal with the wound.

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't even see the phone.

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I forgot to tell you.

283
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I also want to eat the feet of Grandma Ju.

284
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can only eat with you next time.

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Stupid.

286
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
After you arrive later,

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you can like what we practiced before,

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
how to create the process of flying dumplings,

289
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
why to persist,

290
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and the whole process of the heart.

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Just say it out.

292
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There should be no problem.

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Stretch out your hand.

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you doing?

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Put it on.

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
OK.

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Later, you go up to see the boss for me.

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I will teach you how to do it in the earphone.

299
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just say what I say.

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No need, thank you.

301
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to.

302
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You said you wanted me to continue painting.

303
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now, a good opportunity is in front of us.

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you think I was rejected because of the wheelchair?

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't want to help you.

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I don't understand you.

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Since you have already come here,

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you just go up.

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There is a lift.

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Then you can go up too.

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, I can go up.

312
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, how can I go up?

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Look at me.

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Look at my hair.

315
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's like a waste.

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How to see people?

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No.

318
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You are different now.

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think you look very handsome today.

320
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't worry.

321
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We have practiced so many times before.

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This time we will be real.

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Come on, good boy.

324
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can do it.

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Try it.

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Come on, you can do it.

327
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hello, I am...

328
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The manager of the original creator of the new batch of flying dumplings, Mo Jiajun.

329
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello.

330
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hello.

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please sit down.

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why is the new batch not here?

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He is a little shy.

334
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I will handle the outdoor things for him.

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's talk.

336
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Actually, I want to know the creative idea behind the flying dumplings.

337
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can you tell me as an agent?

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When I was young, when I was not happy,

339
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
grandma would make me fried dumplings.

340
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She made me happy.

341
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The dumplings she made were really delicious.

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Dumplings are the little happiness in my life.

343
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I really hope that I can share this little happiness.

344
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I drew the flying dumplings.

345
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I hope that she can bring this happiness to everyone.

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What software does she usually use to create?

347
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I usually use Clip Studio to draw grass on the iPad.

348
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then I dare to use the computer.

349
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Photoshop Illustration.

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Illustration?

351
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You mean Illustrator?

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes, Illustrator.

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What about the speed of creation?

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How long can you draw a picture?

355
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Speed?

356
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello?

357
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Can you hear me?

358
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hello?

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How long?

360
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You seem to know nothing.

361
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's really hard for us to talk about the cooperation.

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Maybe because I am an agent.

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know.

364
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I still have to ask Ji Ji.

365
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You look really inexperienced.

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And the original creator didn't come.

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You really have no sincerity.

369
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry.

370
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sorry, please wait.

371
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm an executive.

372
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I drew the flying dumplings.

373
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why didn't you come up just now?

374
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Actually, I have a brain numbness.

375
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I usually need to travel by wheelchair.

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There was a company before.

377
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I saw this situation, so I refused.

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm afraid you will be like them.

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I plan to talk with the work.

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I know I shouldn't escape.

381
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is my problem.

382
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I really admire the temperature and vitality brought by the flying dumplings.

384
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now I see myself.

385
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can be sure that my feeling is right.

386
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We have a good cooperation.

387
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Good cooperation.

388
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Good cooperation.

389
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Good cooperation.

390
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Dad, go to the meeting room.

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Watch TV.

392
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You two come here.

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's watch the live show of the jumping.

394
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why are you so excited if you don't jump?

395
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do we have a head-on salary?

396
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When we jump out of the good result, we have no credit.

397
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Come out.

398
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Now in the camera is the representative of the jumping in Hong Kong, Ma Yi Xiang.

399
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He is also a holder of Hong Kong records.

400
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come out.

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
See if the logo is clear.

402
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Although he was injured before, he is completely recovered now.

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Today is just the first round.

404
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It seems that he can enter the final easily.

405
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Maybe Xiang Zai has a chance to get the first place.

406
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I have a deal with his manager.

407
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
After he finishes jumping, he will use our health care oil in front of the camera.

408
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then the whole of Hong Kong knows that we are the sponsors of the jumping prince.

409
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He jumped out of the 8.11 last season.

410
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Although he was injured before.

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why does Xiang Zai's clothes have the logo of Ren Yuan?

412
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He must be playing tricks in the pit.

413
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He took our spokesperson away.

414
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Ready.

415
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Now it's accelerating.

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Start.

417
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Xiang Zai's first jump is not good.

418
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There are two chances left.

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
See if he can adjust it as soon as possible.

420
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Jump out of the good result for everyone to see.

421
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The second chance is not strong enough even for the pig.

422
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Success.

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is it okay?

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Success.

425
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Xiang Zai jumped out of the 6.60.

426
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But there is another chance.

427
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But it's strange.

428
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He seems to be recovering from the injury.

429
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The whole team is very nervous.

430
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Check his situation immediately.

431
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Can he continue to compete?

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Everyone is worried.

433
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay.

434
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He's out.

435
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But how can he compete with such a twist?

436
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There must be no result.

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But it's expected.

438
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He jumped out of the second 6.60.

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He got the last final place.

440
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Brother Deng, have you played enough?

441
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You wronged me and hang me on the net.

442
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You blacked me.

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Now you took our red flowers.

444
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You even took our spokesperson.

445
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What are you?

446
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Dare to say.

447
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Your cripple horse is not to torture me.

448
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you want to play?

449
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll play with you.

450
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I will not let you go.

451
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You want to play, play me.

452
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't play my big brother.

453
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You want me to carry this black pot.

454
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

455
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I will resign from the Mai Bai Tong.

456
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who do you think you are?

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You are not following my dog behind my cousin.

458
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm too lazy to play with you.

459
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But I appreciate your loyalty.

460
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't you want me to sue you?

461
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You've been a dog anyway.

463
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You kneel down and scream for me.

464
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let me be happy.

465
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll consider not to sue you.

466
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You don't want to go to jail either.

467
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It affects my cousin, right?

468
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Kneel.

469
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Kneel.

470
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Scream.

471
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Scream.

472
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I...

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I...

474
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I...

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You fool.

476
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't let me find evidence to prove that I didn't hit you.

477
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Otherwise, I will sue you.

478
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I paid hundreds of thousands of money for this club.

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
A dog rushed in.

480
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The police will believe me or you?

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Money is great.

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You just let me use money to do these stupid things.

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You do it yourself.

484
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't talk nonsense.

485
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Natalie.

486
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Only you treat her as a fool.

487
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If I give her money, she will be in trouble.

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
By the way, a warm reminder.

489
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Tell that housekeeper not to take so many bed eggs.

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's dirty.

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Go to hell.

492
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Calm down.

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Let go.

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll beat that bastard to death.

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let go.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You fool.

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The time is 15 minutes.

498
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you, officer.

499
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay.

500
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Why are you so impulsive?

501
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I told you many times to calm down.

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why did you suddenly fight with Shi Keng?

503
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Sorry, brother.

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That bastard is really a bastard.

505
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know what to do.

506
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I just want to help you.

507
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm sorry.

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm sorry.

515
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That bastard is talking too much this time.

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't help it.

518
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You hurt someone during the bail.

519
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The police have withdrawn your bail order.

520
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The lawyer said that this situation is very likely to be sued.

521
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Brother, I figured it out.

522
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I will resign as soon as I go out.

523
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This will not affect you and Man Maitong.

524
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who said you should resign?

525
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Now there are many things for you to do.

526
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't think you can beat someone.

527
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All right.

528
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll think about what to do with the lawyer.

529
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But this time is different.

530
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Last time you stopped me.

531
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But did I really do it this time?

532
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm afraid the lawyer can't help me.

533
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Anyway, we will think of a way.

534
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You don't have to worry.

535
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
A Zong got into trouble again.

536
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is it because of Keng?

537
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't worry.

538
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I helped him find a lawyer.

539
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But it may be a bit troublesome to re-offend during bail.

540
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You can deal with A Zou first.

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You don't have to come here so late.

542
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's talk about it later.

543
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Eat quickly, or it will get cold.

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I know.

545
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Bye.

546
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's it. Bye.

547
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You want to buy the shares I have.

548
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No problem.

549
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But there is one condition.

550
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let A Zou go.

551
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Aunt.

552
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's not me who catch people now.

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's the police.

554
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You want to buy the witness.

555
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sister.

556
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Keng is your nephew.

557
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He is beaten like this.

558
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You help an outsider.

559
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Since sister doesn't treat us as her own people.

560
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We have to give him face.

561
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You want us to let that boy go.

562
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Fine.

563
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Then your shares can't be used to pay the assets.

564
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And use the purchase price to calculate.

565
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Keng.

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Help me calculate a good price for him.

567
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Okay.

568
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Go.

569
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't you think it's too much to pay that price?

570
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm beaten like this.

571
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't want to pay that price.

572
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't worry.

573
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You see, Keng is a talented man.

574
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If we let him do what he wants.

575
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
He can help my brother-in-law to grow.

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,800
Sir

577
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,640
Sir

578
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,880
Mom, don't sell

579
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,360
Sorry, I can't stop them

580
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,600
A Min

581
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,920
You have already taken care of your own family

582
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
How my sister deals with the shares of the employees

583
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
It's none of your business

584
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,960
Yes

585
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,600
Do you think this is a sale

586
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,560
Come as you want

587
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,320
A Min

588
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,800
A Zu called me a teacher

589
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
I won't leave him alone

590
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
As long as I can save A Zu

591
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,880
It's worth it

592
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't be so cocky

593
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,400
This guy is obviously

594
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,360
He is using the smoke to hit himself

595
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
Not only the smoke

596
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,200
He also admitted yesterday

597
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,840
He is a regular

598
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,440
Who do you think the police are

599
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,080
I'm here to make a deal with you

600
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
Are you stupid

601
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
We are making a deal with your mom now

602
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
The biggest problem of Ren Yuan now is not A Zu

603
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
It's Ma Yixiang

604
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,280
I know you spent a lot of money

605
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,960
Ask him to be your spokesperson

606
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,760
I believe the investment is not small

607
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,680
Remember the last time he wore clothes

608
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
Because of the logo of Ren Yuan

609
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,400
It means you succeeded

610
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,080
He and Ren Yuan's health oil

611
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,120
Bound together

612
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,360
But now he has a relapse of old injuries

613
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
Can't participate in the game

614
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,920
It completely disrupts

615
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,400
All your publicity plans

616
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,280
According to the plan, there may be a counter-effect

617
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
If you don't do it, it's a loss

618
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,960
It's really a headache

619
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,280
What do you mean by this

620
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,680
It means you are very happy

621
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
You are a disaster

622
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
Half a month away from the final

623
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,400
As long as he wins a game

624
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
You can recover your strength

625
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,440
What are you talking about

626
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,640
He is just a little strong in the final

627
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
Want to win

628
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,160
Half a month is enough to recover

629
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,360
As long as you give Ma Yixiang to me

630
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,560
I use acupuncture to help him

631
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,520
He will have a good performance in the final

632
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,800
Cousin

633
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,520
You really think you are a transfer

634
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Use him to exchange me for not reporting to the Lian Group

635
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Enjoy it

636
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,960
Don't refuse so soon

637
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,160
I want to talk about more than this

638
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,640
It's just that I can't

639
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,120
Say it in front of so many people

640
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,440
I just want to talk to you and you two

641
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
Such a big pepper

642
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,440
Grandma, is it pepper?

643
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,400
grandma

644
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,960
grandma

645
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,080
What's wrong with you, grandma

646
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,720
You answer me, grandma

647
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,040
grandma

648
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,640
grandma

649
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,640
Grandma, wake up

650
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
What's wrong with you, grandma

651
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
Ready to pass the bed, good

652
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,480
Yixiong

653
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,120
Please, you must save my grandma

654
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
We will save you

655
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,680
I bought water and sandwiches

656
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,560
Do you want to

657
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,080
It's okay, you stay for a while

658
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,200
I always thought

659
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,280
My disease is not a restriction

660
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,360
I thought I was the same as others

661
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
I thought I was the same as others

662
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,880
I thought I was the same as others

663
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I thought I was the same as others

664
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
Until my grandma died

665
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
I knew I was a useless person

666
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,320
Yes, I'm good at painting

667
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
My paintings can be used for others

668
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
But when grandma died

669
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I was so happy

670
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,240
Don't think so

671
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,200
I know you

672
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,120
Always very strong

673
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,840
It's useless to be strong

674
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,000
I can't even take care of myself

675
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,680
When grandma wakes up

676
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,720
How do I take care of her

677
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
I will help you

678
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,080
Right

679
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
Your grandma woke up and saw you so filial

680
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,240
Must be very touched

681
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
So you

682
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,680
Think about it

683
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
After grandma wakes up

684
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
She must not want to see you

685
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
Cry so badly, right

686
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,080
She wants to see you

687
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,320
No matter what happens

688
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,160
Still working hard

689
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,800
Take care of yourself, right

690
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,760
I'll see you

691
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,240
See you

692
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,640
Hello

693
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,960
Yes

694
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I'm the Chexing 짚筆's manager

695
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,240
Hello

696
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,320
Why do you call when your Ouña are all

697
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
I know it's my fault

698
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,680
I why

699
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,040
Why big reveal

700
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,640
I should send some fragment

701
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
I figured it out

702
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,120
So I came here

703
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,160
Go

704
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,920
I've decided.

705
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,400
Don't worry.

706
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,880
I'll help you

707
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
to insert these acupoints every day.

708
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,720
It can help you to strengthen your bones

709
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
and make your blood flow.

710
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,160
In short,

711
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,040
it can speed up your recovery of your root.

712
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,880
I'll help you to push your teeth

713
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,560
and relax your muscles and muscles.

714
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,120
It can reduce the pressure of your root.

715
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,000
This medicine can help you to

716
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
make your blood flow and make your blood flow.

717
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,760
Is this treatment really effective?

718
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,480
As long as you cooperate well,

719
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
you will see the result.

720
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,120
I'll help you to do it.

721
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Ma Yiqiang is going to start her first jump.

722
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
She recovered from the injury

723
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,640
a month before the competition.

724
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,960
She almost didn't make it to the final.

725
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,800
She even said that she would have a competition.

726
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,760
But she is great today.

727
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
Eight meters and one third.

728
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
She has broken the record of Hong Kong's dance.

729
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
Congratulations to her.

730
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,520
I think she is going to the dressing room.

731
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,400
Is there any secret dance in it?

732
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,960
Come on.

733
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,120
How is it?

734
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,680
How do you feel?

735
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,600
A little headache.

736
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,980
You'll recover in good Knappiness.

737
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,800
paycheck

738
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,160
Simply me, the agent, just let you go.

739
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,040
Also, made me sign the arrangements in front of your direct competitors.

740
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,620
You don't it much money.

741
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,160
Even if there's not enough light, you'll be able to be令-ing.

742
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
In my eyes, you are just a patient who needs treatment.

743
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
That's enough. Thank you.

744
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Thank you, Dr. Ling.

745
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I wish you good luck.

746
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
Thank you.

747
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
What did you tell Deng Shikeng that day?

748
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Why did they let you treat the spokesman?

749
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Have you heard of the German term for bad omen?

750
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I want to cure Ma Yixiang.

751
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Ma Yixiang is not only a deal-maker.

752
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Actually, it's for my father.

753
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Ma Yixiang is now a spokesperson for the health care oil.

754
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
If she retires because of business,

755
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,160
it will make people doubt the effect of the oil.

756
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
She changed to the root salt.

757
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
As long as she uses the oil to treat,

758
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
she will definitely be able to recover.

759
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
Hong Kong is not just a Chinese doctor.

760
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I will treat her. I don't know how to do magic.

761
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I will give you all the credit.

762
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Why should I trust you?

763
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Do you still have a choice?

764
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Helen told me everything.

765
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
You used money to buy her

766
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
to inquire about our new products.

767
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
The raw materials used and who to be the spokesperson.

768
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
My son has no time to care about your company.

769
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Your charge is very serious.

770
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
There is no evidence to prove it. Don't talk nonsense.

771
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
What are you doing?

772
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Ma Yixiang is not a liar.

773
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
She is not a liar.

774
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Let go of me.

775
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Are you crazy?

776
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Your pulse is so fast.

777
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Are you nervous?

778
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
You are guilty.

779
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
It's true that you touched her hands and said a few words.

780
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
You have a problem with your brain.

781
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I didn't say I have no evidence.

782
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
What is this?

783
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,160
I have already handed the documents to Mr. Deng.

784
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you.

785
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Helen has recorded the process of your sale.

786
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,160
She said I could hand it to the police or ICAC.

787
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,160
If you want to sue A'zu, I will sue you for bribery.

788
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Let's see who will be in trouble.

789
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Even if I don't want to make things worse for Helen,

790
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
I will hand it over to the chairman of the chamber of commerce.

791
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
You are also in trouble.

792
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,160
You can choose between winning or losing.

793
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Okay, let's go.

794
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
There is no more business to be sold here.

795
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Come.

796
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
815.

797
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
We broke the record of Hong Kong and the personal record.

798
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Congratulations to Hong Kong.

799
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
You are wonderful.

800
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
This endorsement is worth it.

801
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Let the media know.

802
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
This will be sold.

803
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
It must be a hit.

804
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay.

805
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
It's a promotion.

806
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Let's interview her.

807
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Let's see how she can help us.

808
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Congratulations, Helen.

809
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
You not only got the gold medal,

810
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
but also broke the Hong Kong record twice.

811
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
What do you want to say now?

812
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I want to thank a famous hero behind the scenes.

813
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
He is the one who keeps the sword.

814
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
I am so lucky to have him.

815
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Thanks to him, I can solve the injuries of so many years

816
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
and help me to ease the pain and lose my weight.

817
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Xiang,

818
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,160
there is a piece of high-grade medicine with 581 on your feet.

819
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Is it him who made you recover so fast?

820
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
581 is my lucky number.

821
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
581.

822
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Lucky number.

823
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
What 581?

824
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
We didn't put the medicine on.

825
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
It seems that we were fooled.

826
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Great.

827
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
We can finally finish the job.

828
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
I am so sorry.

829
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I always ask you to work overtime.

830
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
The other colleagues have finished their work.

831
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Boss,

832
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
this is my resignation letter.

833
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
I am sorry, boss.

834
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I was greedy for a moment.

835
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I betrayed the company.

836
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,160
And you helped me clean up the mess I made.

837
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
You followed me from the store.

838
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I know you very well.

839
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
You took the wrong step.

840
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I think the new product will be on the market soon.

841
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
I thought that Kenshao just wanted to know in advance.

842
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I didn't expect him to cut the supply.

843
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I even made Azu get sued.

844
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Boss, you didn't call the police to arrest me.

845
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I was too easy.

846
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Who is innocent,

847
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
the one who knows the wrong is definitely worth giving a chance.

848
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Thank you.

849
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Take it back.

850
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Helena,

851
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,160
you stayed to help us to make up for the mistake.

852
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Azu and I were sued by them.

853
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
It also affected the company.

854
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
If I had not done anything,

855
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I would have been shameless.

856
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
I am sorry, boss.

857
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
It's a pity.

858
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Helen is my good helper.

859
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I lost a good employee.

860
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
How about this?

861
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Helen is responsible for

862
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
the company's new product.

863
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
I can't do it for now.

864
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
The company's new product is in the war.

865
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Someone has to take over its work.

866
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
But I'm not sure if I can do it.

867
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
But I want to share the burden for you.

868
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

869
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Okay.

870
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
The essence of the current scene

871
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
is the Asian Tianjin Capsule.

872
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
The prince Ma Yi Xiang

873
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
broke the record in Hong Kong

874
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
and won the gold medal.

875
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
The logo on the chest of Xiang Zai

876
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
should have been hung on the pulse.

877
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Now the world is in a trap.

878
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
It's a good thing for you.

879
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
The most important thing is that you're fine.

880
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
That loser.

881
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
He used those sinister tricks to frame me.

882
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Now he took our spokesperson.

883
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Xiang Zai,

884
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
there is a piece of high-pressure medicine

885
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,160
written 581 on your foot.

886
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Is it him

887
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
who made you recover so fast?

888
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
581 is my lucky number.

889
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
581 is the sign of this building.

890
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Richard,

891
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
do you have anything

892
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
to explain to us?

893
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
How's your foot?

894
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
How do you feel?

895
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Even if I can't see the light,

896
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
I'm willing to be a hero.

897
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Thank you.

898
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
In my eyes,

899
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
you're just a patient

900
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
who needs treatment.

901
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Okay, thank you.

902
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
You're so sinister.

903
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
You can even think of such a clever idea?

904
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
I'm just trying.

905
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
I didn't expect the reporters to ask.

906
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I didn't expect Xiang Zai

907
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
to say it was his lucky number.

908
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:31,860
But I promised the

909
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
I didn't write

910
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
the delivery call to see you.

911
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Let's guess what 581 is.

912
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Now 581 has been on the hot search.

913
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
The netizens noticed that

914
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
the building 581

915
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
is the asset of Mai Maitong.

916
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
No one is discussing my case.

917
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Everyone is discussing the magical medicine sticker.

918
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Why don't we

919
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
sell it for 58.1

920
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
instead of the sticker?

921
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
It's worth a lot of money.

922
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I've never

923
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
done anything like this.

924
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
You're too honest.

925
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
A-zu is right.

926
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Deng Shikeng was the one who wronged him.

927
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
He even made up with Mai Maitong.

928
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
Why are you being so polite to him?

929
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
You don't have to feel guilty at all.

930
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Of course, Richard.

931
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I agree with you.

932
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
This is the first time

933
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
I've ever thought of

934
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
making friends with you.

935
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Okay, I'll think about it.

936
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Grandma, I miss you so much.

937
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Grandma, I've really

938
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
made your dumplings more famous.

939
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Many people

940
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
like my flying dumplings.

941
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
And they're very popular now.

942
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
They're so popular that

943
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
they can sell a lot of products.

944
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Let me tell you a good news.

945
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
After that,

946
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
they'll be made into an animation.

947
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
There's a character

948
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
called Grandma Dumpling.

949
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
It's based on what you drew.

950
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Those stories are recorded

951
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
as the starting point of our lives.

952
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
When you wake up,

953
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
we'll watch it together.

954
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
And

955
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
my flying dumplings

956
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
will represent Hong Kong.

957
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Then we'll go abroad

958
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
to have art exchanges.

959
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Isn't your Sunny World

960
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
great?

961
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Until now,

962
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I finally feel that

963
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I've done something meaningful.

964
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm no longer a useless person.

965
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm not affected by this disease.

966
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm really like a flying dumpling.

967
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
I'm so happy.

968
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
But without you,

969
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
I wouldn't have been able to fly

970
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
as high as I can,

971
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
as far as I can.

972
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
It doesn't make any sense.

973
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Grandma,

974
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
don't leave me behind.

975
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Do you know that?

976
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,160
One month later

977
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Move!

978
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
You're blocking my way!

979
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
He's probably a fool!

980
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
You fool! Move!

981
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Stop it!

982
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Don't bully my sister!

983
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
She's your sister!

984
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Move!

985
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Don't bully my little sister!

986
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Princess Dumpling, change!

987
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
Dumpling!

988
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Let's go!

989
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Don't bully my sister!

990
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Are you ok, sister?

991
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Don't worry. I will protect you.

992
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Princess Dumpling

993
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Sister, what are you doing?

994
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Little Park, I remember you fell down.

995
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,160
I was bullied and you were pushed down.

996
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,160
I dreamed that you became Dumpling Princess and protected you.

997
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Does your foot hurt?

998
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I don't remember it for a long time.

999
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Now you protect me.

1000
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
If you feel hurt, tell me.

1001
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
I will protect you.

1002
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
You protect me and I feel sleepy.

1003
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Mi.

1004
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Coming.

1005
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Lin Wei Ming, I'm not afraid of needles and beards.

1006
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm not afraid.

1007
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
I'm brave like Dumpling.

1008
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
No wonder you put Dumpling on your body.

1009
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Yes, my daughter won't take off her clothes.

1010
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Now we are ready, let's start.

1011
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I will help her to get close to the acupuncture point.

1012
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
It will help her a lot.

1013
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Let's start now.

1014
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Sister.

1015
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Let's start.

1016
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
It's ok.

1017
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Don't be afraid, sister.

1018
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Doctor Ling has finished the acupuncture point.

1019
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Sister, does it hurt?

1020
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,160
A little bit, but I can bear it.

1021
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Leave the acupuncture point for 28 minutes.

1022
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Sister, you are so brave.

1023
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Let's see if your children's pelvis is high or low.

1024
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,160
If it's high, they may have a problem of the spine.

1025
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,160
The earlier you find out, the easier it is to improve.

1026
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
I taught you the shoulder exercise.

1027
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,160
It can prevent the spine and malformation of the family.

1028
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,160
The first time I saw you, I was so afraid.

1029
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1030
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1031
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1032
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1033
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1034
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1035
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

1036
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave.
