Why don't you answer me

106
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,000
I sent you a lot of messages

107
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
You don't even reply to me

108
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,320
Don't you know that's rude?

109
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Are you still sleeping?

110
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,320
Hello

111
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Are you Luo Yingchen?

112
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,440
Yes, who are you?

113
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
I'm from Cui Zhan

114
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
I haven't paid you back yet

115
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm calling to ask you to pay me back

116
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
What money?

117
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,520
When did I owe you money?

118
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,960
Your bank card

119
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,200
You've been in debt for three months

120
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Now the bank has transferred the debt to us

121
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Bank card?

122
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,440
I have money to save every month

123
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,680
Did you check it carefully?

124
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520
Don't be so stubborn, Bapeng

125
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll break your back

126
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Enough

127
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,080
You called me Bapeng in the morning

128
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
Are you okay?

129
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a house in the 18th floor

130
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
You can come to me if you have the guts

131
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Good morning, Situ

132
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,160
You forgot to check the time

133
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,520
The guests are here

134
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
Are you still at home?

135
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Why don't you talk?

136
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Are you dumb?

137
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Tell the guests

138
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll be there soon

139
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm eating breakfast now

140
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,840
What am I eating?

141
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Help

142
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,920
Hello

143
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,520
Miss Luo Yingchen

144
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,640
We are from Cui Zhan

145
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
Brother, I told you not to call

146
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
I don't owe you money

147
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,560
If you call again, I'll call the police

148
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Miss Luo

149
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,120
We asked you to pay us back according to the procedures

150
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,160
Do you have an AC Bank credit card?

151
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,120
AC Bank

152
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,800
Don't you know it yourself?

153
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,520
Don't pretend to me

154
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
Because I don't have a single card

155
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,440
Wait a minute, I'll take a look

156
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
My leg

157
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
It hurts

158
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,880
Is it broken?

159
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
Help

160
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
Miss Luo, are you okay?

161
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,520
Why did you drive?

162
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm sorry

163
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it

164
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm sorry, it hurts

165
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,640
You are a big man

166
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,680
You hit so many cars

167
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Are you okay?

168
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
Wait a minute

169
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm calling an ambulance

170
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,080
I'm calling an ambulance

171
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
Are you trying to run away?

172
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm not trying to run away

173
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
My phone is still on the car

174
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,760
I'm calling an ambulance with my phone

175
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,240
Miss Luo, how can I make money

176
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
if I go to the hospital?

177
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,400
How about this?

178
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
You pay him 5,000 yuan as medical expenses

179
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
That's it

180
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
It's cheaper for you, right?

181
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
Right?

182
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,960
Right

183
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
Wait a minute

184
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
He's hurt so badly

185
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
I can't call an ambulance

186
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
And my car is going to be locked

187
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
I must call the police

188
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
Wait for me

189
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,480
You call an ambulance

190
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Maybe the police will come

191
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
It's possible that

192
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
you are accused of driving dangerously

193
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
and cause others to be injured

194
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,840
You will be punished

195
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
You may be jailed if you are punished

196
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
5,000 yuan

197
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Solved the problem

198
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,600
Right?

199
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't make it worse

200
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
Don't make it worse

201
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,040
My leg

202
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,080
Is it broken?

203
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Sir, you are injured

204
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,160
Don't move

205
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
I'll check it for you

206
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
It hurts

207
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
If his leg is broken

208
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll follow his blood

209
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,640
He won't feel pain

210
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
It hurts

211
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,200
It hurts

212
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Don't do it

213
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Do you know how to do it?

214
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,240
It hurts

215
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Yes

216
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
You are the ones who do it

217
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
You lied to me

218
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
Why did you stand up?

219
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,160
It hurts

220
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
You are hurt by him

221
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
You are fine

222
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,040
What's wrong with you?

223
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,400
It's her car

224
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
You should compensate her

225
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
Miss

226
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,560
5,000 yuan, okay?

227
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
At least 5,000 yuan

228
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,800
You are in cahoots

229
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Compensate her

230
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
If you don't, I'll call the police

231
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Yes

232
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
Compensate her

233
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,160
Run

234
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
Don't run

235
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,680
Miss

236
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,760
Are you okay?

237
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
It hurts

238
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
Come, sit down

239
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,680
Come

240
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,600
If you don't mind, I'll check it for you

241
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,960
It'll be fine soon

242
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,000
Put it on

243
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,760
Your tendon is loose

244
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,280
You often don't use it

245
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
Yes

246
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,680
It's okay

247
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,480
After I rubbed it for you

248
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
You'll feel much better

249
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,080
What's this bottle?

250
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
It smells so strong

251
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,800
This bottle of oil

252
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,760
Can help you to relieve your pain

253
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
You'll feel much better

254
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
It's almost done

255
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Try it

256
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
See if it's better

257
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
It's better

258
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,760
Let me help you

259
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
I can do it myself

260
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,560
Okay

261
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
Come

262
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320
Thank you

263
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
This bottle of oil is for you

264
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,840
It'll help you to relieve your pain

265
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,120
When you have time

266
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Thank you

267
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm leaving

268
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
What's wrong?

269
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Boss

270
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm in the enemy camp

271
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,320
They're so cruel and cunning

272
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,080
I'm afraid I can't get out of here alive

273
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
What are you talking about?

274
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,440
If I can't get out of here alive

275
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
You must take care of yourself

276
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,560
But Mrs.

277
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't die yet

278
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,560
I'll go there now

279
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,480
You can drink it like tea

280
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
It'll help you to relieve your pain

281
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,760
Shuai, you're full of toxins

282
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,280
The whole bottle is black

283
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes, what should I do?

284
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,920
The red line of the red light in the red light

285
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,160
Can help you to relieve your pain

286
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
It'll stimulate your brain

287
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
That's great

288
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
I'll arrange a doctor

289
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
To give you a free consultation

290
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,080
This red light will help you to clear your blood vessels

291
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Your brain will become clear

292
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
Shuai, this way

293
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
It'll help you to relieve your pain

294
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
Doctor Chen

295
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,120
This handsome man has a secret

296
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
Okay

297
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
Stretch out your hand

298
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
I'll help you to pull out your pulse

299
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
Stretch out your tongue

300
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Your pulse is too thin

301
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,920
It's too thin

302
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,200
From a Chinese doctor's point of view

303
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
You're too weak

304
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
You're too weak

305
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Okay

306
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
But it's okay

307
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,440
It's just a small problem

308
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
You can use this pulse to get out of the oil

309
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
First, you need to lie on the bed of PomaLin

310
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Then drop some MaiMaiTong

311
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
The oil will drop on your belly

312
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Then use the red line of PomaLin

313
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
The medicine will slowly

314
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,960
Sink into your belly

315
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,720
It'll be warm

316
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
It'll improve oxygen

317
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,520
And new functions

318
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,000
Actually, what's your relationship

319
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,280
With MaiMaiTong?

320
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,240
You know MaiMaiTong

321
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
You know we trust you

322
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,120
Actually, this health station

323
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
Is sponsored by us

324
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,840
To have a Chinese medicine consultation

325
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,280
All our products

326
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Are strictly regulated by the quality

327
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
That's great

328
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
But this helmet is 3500 yuan

329
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
It's a bit expensive

330
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,120
It's just a price

331
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,560
If you buy it today

332
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
We'll send you a box of MaiMaiTong

333
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,960
And you can buy another one

334
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
We'll send you the goods directly from the factory

335
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,200
It's half cheaper than the medicine

336
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
That's cheap

337
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,280
I'll think about it

338
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Dr. Chen

339
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
There's a woman outside

340
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
Who said she's a blood test

341
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
She wants you to go out and explain it to her

342
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay

343
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
Buy some monosodium glutamate

344
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
And soak it every day

345
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,800
To make sure you don't get sick or hurt

346
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,280
But XinYing said I have a blood test

347
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,120
I can't eat anything

348
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
Monosodium glutamate

349
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
Is a very good Chinese medicine

350
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
Any body can eat it

351
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,160
Really?

352
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,440
Granny, don't do it

353
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,960
You have to bleed to get the effect of monosodium glutamate

354
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,560
But

355
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,600
Because you have a blood test

356
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
If you drink it

357
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,960
Your blood test will get worse

358
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,520
Then I won't drink it

359
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,160
Sir

360
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
Don't talk nonsense

361
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
Monosodium glutamate is the Chinese medicine we usually use

362
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
It can improve blood circulation

363
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
Of course, ordinary people can eat monosodium glutamate

364
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,320
But because Granny has a blood test

365
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
If she drinks it

366
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
It will cause a big problem

367
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
Then I won't buy it

368
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
Granny

369
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
I don't want it

370
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
I've taken the evidence

371
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
And contacted WuXingMei

372
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
She must be caught

373
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
MaiMaiTong, CaoGong, GuLuoYou

374
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
You can buy both the outer and inner clothes

375
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Buy a few more

376
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
And you'll be in a bad mood

377
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
You really sold it to MaiMaiTong

378
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
Your printing is bad

379
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,240
And you didn't roll your head

380
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
And you got into the law

381
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
You even let people wear the outer and inner clothes

382
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,760
You'll be poisoned if you use it

383
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm poisoned

384
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,640
Don't talk nonsense

385
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
If you don't understand, don't talk nonsense

386
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,080
What if MaiMaiTong gets sick?

387
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,800
Of course not

388
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't listen to her

389
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
It's a misunderstanding

390
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Mr. Mei is so serious

391
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,520
Since we are colleagues

392
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
Why don't we talk it over?

393
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
And communicate it

394
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
Please

395
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
Didn't you say you'd come out and talk it over?

396
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
What do you mean by asking people to come?

397
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,880
You're the one who provoked us

398
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
We opened the door and did business

399
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
You said that

400
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,160
You're hitting me

401
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,080
Who hit you?

402
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,000
Now you're the one who faked my MaiMaiTong

403
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm the original product

404
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,360
Don't talk nonsense

405
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,920
You added the gorgon in the fake goods

406
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
And let people eat it

407
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
Do you know that after you went out

408
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
You can't run away

409
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,080
You guys

410
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,160
Don't do anything

411
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,880
I'll tell you

412
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
I took your evidence

413
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,160
You're dead

414
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
Give me the gorgon

415
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Can't you talk it over?

416
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,520
Go

417
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,200
Go

418
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,360
Brother, can't you talk it over?

419
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
You must beat them up like this

420
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
Go

421
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,800
Mr. Deng, Mrs. Deng

422
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
Sorry to keep you waiting

423
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm Rachel from ChengFeng

424
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
My surname is Luo

425
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,000
This is...

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,120
You're finally here

427
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
Who do you think we are?

428
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,400
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

429
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,760
We're all real estate agents

430
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
How can your boss teach you

431
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,840
when you're so busy?

432
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,320
Miss Luo

433
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,960
Don't you have a watch?

434
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,600
How about this?

435
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
Let's open the house first

436
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
Don't waste time

437
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,160
Okay

438
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
Sorry, Mrs. Deng

439
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Sorry, Mr. Deng

440
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,760
Mrs. Deng

441
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
Mr. Deng, be careful

442
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,840
This type of villa

443
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,120
is rarely sold in this area

444
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
And it's only in this house for a few years

445
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
You see

446
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,280
The light here is very sufficient

447
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,800
And very wind-free

448
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
The owner bought it back with one hand

449
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
Later, he only rented it to a couple

450
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,440
So you see

451
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
It's very well maintained

452
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,080
I wonder if the decoration here

453
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,240
matches the feelings of Mr. Deng and Mrs. Deng

454
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
I think

455
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,800
You can consider

456
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
to make a special wall on this side

457
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
And then in the living room and the dining room

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
There can be different colored floors

459
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
It's easy to separate them

460
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,200
It really depends on

461
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,640
what style you like

462
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
Miss Luo is so professional

463
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,520
in interior design

464
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,200
I've learned a little before

465
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,440
You don't have to be an estate agent

466
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
You talk so much

467
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I've seen more of such houses

468
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,000
than you

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
in the past

470
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,080
Here, a house of 30 million

471
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,640
30 million

472
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,480
Mrs. Deng, actually, 30 million

473
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
may be a little different

474
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,680
from what the owner expects

475
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,920
Then you can bargain with the owner

476
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
You have to bargain with every single one

477
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
You can collect money

478
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,880
But you can't do things

479
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,160
Yes, I will talk to the owner

480
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll go to the toilet

481
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
I'll leave after I come back

482
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,600
Mr. Deng

483
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Actually, 303 is really low

484
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
If it's 303

485
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not sure the owner will agree

486
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,200
I understand

487
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
But I have to respect

488
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
my wife's opinion

489
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,480
How about I help you

490
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
find another house

491
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
Or you and Mrs. Deng

492
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,840
will be suitable for others

493
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,960
She is just to make a mess

494
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,280
My house

495
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
is bought by my company

496
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm the head of the company

497
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm the one who makes the final decision

498
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
If it's 303

499
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,880
it's 13200

500
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,080
13...

501
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
Okay, I'll try

502
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,600
Thank you, Mr. Deng

503
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,920
Good news

504
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,640
Okay

505
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,440
I'm leaving

506
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,480
Okay, bye

507
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,800
I'll send you out

508
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,720
Bye, Mrs. Deng

509
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,840
Bye

510
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,960
You failed the order

511
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,080
The car was hit by you

512
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,040
What do you want?

513
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,480
I told you

514
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
I was hit by a car

515
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
The car was hit by them

516
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,880
And

517
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,840
Mrs. Deng

518
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,280
is too picky

519
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,320
The owner asked the owner

520
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,360
to reduce the price by 3 million

521
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,640
How can I do that?

522
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
Because you are late today

523
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,040
She is in a bad mood

524
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Of course, she is

525
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,440
You are still here

526
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
blaming others

527
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
She said she would reduce the price by 3 million

528
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,880
You should think of a way

529
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,560
to reduce the price by 300,000

530
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
Otherwise, I won't talk to you

531
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
You can talk to the owner yourself

532
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,160
Right?

533
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
Are you here to make money?

534
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,000
If you don't want to make money

535
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
don't bother the earth

536
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
There are many people waiting outside

537
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Boss

538
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,640
I made a cup of coffee for you

539
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,840
to drink

540
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,720
Let me have a sip first

541
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,760
What are you doing?

542
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,800
What?

543
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,080
You are here to save her?

544
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
You are close friends?

545
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
Are you going to help her

546
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,360
to get the sales?

547
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
The company is not in the target this month

548
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
Are you going to explain to the company?

549
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
Are you kidding?

550
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
I don't have the ability

551
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Don't bother about other things

552
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
But I want to talk to you

553
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
Come on

554
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
Rent

555
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
How much does it cost?

556
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
Boss, don't say that

557
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Rent is also very important

558
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
You know

559
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
we have to get the sales every month

560
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,520
Do you remember?

561
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
It's very hard

562
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
By the way, boss

563
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm going to

564
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,880
get the sales this month

565
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,040
Do you have any rewards?

566
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,560
If you don't mind, I'll go first

567
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,880
Don't go first

568
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
Don't say that I don't give you a chance

569
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
You have to finish

570
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
the sales this month

571
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
And

572
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,120
drive yourself to fix the aircraft

573
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,840
Didn't you say there was insurance?

574
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,880
What insurance?

575
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
Go out and find a business

576
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Rent

577
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
Rent

578
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,600
Are you unwell again?

579
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,480
You take medicine again

580
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,840
Fortunately, you just appeared

581
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,080
Whatever happens, he got you

582
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,880
Please

583
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,000
Leave her alone

584
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
He is just pretending to be the boss

585
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
If he hadn't got guards

586
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,320
to talk with, he would be drunk

587
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
He can't even eat shit.

588
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
It's almost the end of the month.

589
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,320
If you can't open the order, you'll be the one who eats it.

590
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
What's wrong?

591
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
What's wrong? I can't remember that I have this card.

592
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,320
I've been being urged to pay the debt. I said I didn't.

593
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Then you can pay the debt.

594
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Sister, I've spent too much this month.

595
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
I don't think I can reach my performance. Can you do it?

596
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
I want to help you, but I really can't.

597
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,320
You can ask me, but you can ask a really rich person.

598
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,320
How's the conversation with the guest this morning? It's hard to talk.

599
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Ren Yuanbao has a limited company.

600
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,320
The chairman and the general manager, Deng Litu.

601
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Wow, it's a rich person.

602
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
If you can coax him to buy a house, you can pay the debt.

603
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,320
I'll help you. Call him.

604
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Hello, I want to ask if Mr. Deng Litu is here.

605
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
It's okay. Please tell him that when he comes back,

606
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Ritual Law of Chengfeng Real Estate has found him.

607
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Yes, we are a very professional real estate agent.

608
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,320
We can meet all the clients' requirements.

609
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Yes, thank you. Bye.

610
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Done.

611
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Here's your coffee.

612
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Thank you.

613
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
He called me back.

614
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
He called you back and said it.

615
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Hello, Mr. Deng.

616
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Okay, okay.

617
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Tonight? Okay, no problem.

618
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Okay, see you tonight.

619
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Okay, bye.

620
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
How's it going? Is it okay?

621
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
He said he wanted to see the house again.

622
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Do you need me to accompany you? We can coax him together.

623
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
No, if he wants to see it again, he should want to buy it.

624
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
I'll go back and get ready. I'm afraid I'll be late again.

625
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Good luck. Bye.

626
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Mrs. Deng didn't come with you?

627
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
I told you this morning.

628
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
This time, buying a house is not my business.

629
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Yes.

630
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm sorry to ask you to come so late.

631
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
It's okay. Many clients are like this.

632
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,320
They like to come and see if it's noisy around here.

633
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Do you mind if I call you Rachel?

634
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
No.

635
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
I don't know why,

636
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,320
but I always feel that you are different from other salesmen.

637
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,320
I don't know if it's because you are good at interior design.

638
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Mr. Deng, don't joke.

639
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I can't make money from interior design, so I'm doing real estate.

640
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
The bedroom is upstairs, right?

641
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Do you mind if I go upstairs?

642
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Okay, I'll take you upstairs.

643
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll try to convince the owner to lower the price to 3200.

644
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
If the owner disagrees, we can talk about the cost.

645
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
The most important thing is that you and Mrs. Deng are satisfied.

646
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Don't mention her.

647
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
I bought the house.

648
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I'm the CEO, which means I have the final say.

649
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:50,320
So the most important thing is that you want me to be satisfied.

650
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Yes.

651
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
You will make me satisfied, right?

652
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
We will try to satisfy the customers.

653
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,320
I appreciate your professional attitude.

654
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Whether I buy the house or not,

655
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,320
depends on your performance tonight.

656
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Excuse me, I have to answer a call.

657
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Hello, sister.

658
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Sister, I've eaten.

659
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,320
I didn't tell you that I have to buy a gift tomorrow.

660
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm at work now. I'll call you later.

661
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Bye.

662
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
What are you doing?

663
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
What are you doing?

664
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
What do you mean?

665
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
You said you would satisfy me.

666
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
You're pretending to be innocent.

667
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
You don't have to expect this deal to be successful.

668
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Stop it, I don't want to do it.

669
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,080
She is so stupid that she snores in my room.

670
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,320
Is she so stupid?

671
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,620
No.

672
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,880
In my room there are no werewolves.

673
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,560
Thank God

674
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm what my parents look at me like.

675
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,200
How do I know?

676
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm a rival to you.

677
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Are you kidding me?

678
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
You mean Mr. Deng?

679
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Yes.

680
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I want to vomit.

681
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
I just slapped him.

682
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
He said he didn't expect to be involved in this.

683
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Why am I so unlucky?

684
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm sick.

685
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
What should I do this month?

686
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
How about this?

687
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Don't think about anything now.

688
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Go home and take a shower and sleep.

689
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
You'll be fine soon.

690
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I'll help you return the key.

691
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
And I'll close the door here.

692
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Don't worry.

693
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Come on, be good. Go back and rest.

694
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Be careful.

695
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I don't need to do this.

696
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I still have a lot of work to do.

697
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Hang on, Mr. Deng.

698
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
You remember that.

699
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
On your birthday.

700
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
You're in dad's shoes.

701
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
If dad didn't know your dad's shoes,

702
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
why did you do that?

703
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Mr. Deng

704
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,120
Hello, Mr. Deng. I'm Natalie from Chengfeng Real Estate.

705
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm Rachel's colleague.

706
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,160
I want to apologize for what happened tonight.

707
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,320
You can't be.

708
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,680
You think I would still buy a house in your company?

709
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,520
Mr. Deng, I know my friend made you a little unhappy.

710
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,280
But since I'm here,

711
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,960
why don't you give me a chance to make up for you?

712
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,640
I can't get inside

713
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,960
Unless you get invited

714
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
My guards are strong

715
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm never alone

716
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,520
Whatever you're thinking, don't try it

717
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,640
I don't feel pain

718
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,800
You know my name

719
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,920
You give me praise when I walk by

720
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
To hate me's a crime

721
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,240
If you do it, you die

722
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,400
The price that you'll pay with your life

723
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,840
Cause I am the queen of the castle

724
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,120
They have my feet unraveled

725
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,280
Baby bow down

726
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,400
Give me my crown and my gavel

727
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Cause I am the queen of the castle

728
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
How is it? Are you happy?

729
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Just a little bit.

730
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Because I said it's a compensation?

731
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,920
What if I want more?

732
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Then we'll see if you'll be successful.

733
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Is that all?

734
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Do you have to slap me?

735
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I have my bottom line.

736
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
You've been in the business for two months.

737
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
You haven't even got a single month.

738
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
You're even learning to talk about bottom line.

739
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I'm selling my house, not my body.

740
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You're so personality.

741
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You'll handle this month's sales.

742
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I won't leave you until next month.

743
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I won't be responsible for Mr. Deng's bill.

744
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
You don't have to be responsible for Mr. Deng's bill.

745
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
He paid the deposit last night.

746
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
That's done.

747
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Learn from your sister.

748
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
That's called strength.

749
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
How is it?

750
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Do you want to eat Japanese food or western food?

751
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Why did you come back with a cheque after a night?

752
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
You won't let him take advantage of you?

753
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Of course not.

754
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
You're such a fool.

755
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
I have my own way.

756
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Is it true that you have a check-in ticket?

757
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
If he doesn't transfer money in three days,

758
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
I'll sue him.

759
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I'll sue him for talking bad about him.

760
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
He's rich.

761
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
He's scared of me.

762
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
But, Rachel,

763
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,960
I'm in charge of the business.

764
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Are you unhappy?

765
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
No. I told Situ I won't take this bill.

766
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
But it's okay.

767
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
If it doesn't work, wait until the next one.

768
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Not every customer is as bad as him.

769
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
You're so good. You're better than me every month.

770
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I don't even know when the next one will be.

771
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Buy something for me.

772
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Don't eat lunch yet.

773
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
I want to ask if this pair has 38 cents?

774
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Miss, these are all the same shoes.

775
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
The biggest is only 35 cents.

776
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I'm sorry.

777
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
What's wrong? Who did you buy it for?

778
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
For my sister.

779
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
It's her birthday today.

780
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Your sister?

781
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I don't have a choice.

782
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I know.

783
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
You want to make a fool of her.

784
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
You're so close to her.

785
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm sorry.

786
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
I'm sorry.

787
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm sorry.

788
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm sorry.

789
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm sorry.

790
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I'm sorry.

791
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
I'm sorry.

792
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm sorry.

793
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
I'm sorry.

794
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I'm sorry.

795
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm sorry.

796
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm sorry.

797
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm sorry.

798
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
I'm sorry.

799
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
I'm sorry.

800
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm sorry.

801
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm sorry.

802
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Fire dragon's moon again shines a big pit.

803
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Cultural has its own subtitle to keep people's health.

804
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
You're awesome.

805
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Your confidence isексually better!

806
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
I'm better than your dad!

807
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Thanks, teacher.

808
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I saw you add more people to support you

809
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
since I was a child.

810
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
How can they be rude if they join ours?

811
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,760
It's a non-material cultural heritage.

812
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
It should be passed down well.

813
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Yes.

814
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
But you're rich and powerful.

815
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,160
You did a good job.

816
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
You're welcome, master.

817
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,160
Brother, I'll go hang up the couplets.

818
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,560
Okay, come on.

819
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,160
You're blind. Look at the road.

820
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
You...

821
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,560
What's wrong? You know him?

822
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,160
Master, you came just in time.

823
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,160
It's them two who came to the health station to make trouble.

824
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,760
It's you two

825
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,160
who hurt them.

826
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
They're useless.

827
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Look at me.

828
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,760
You're the one who's hurt, not your brother.

829
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
You're a loser.

830
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
What did you say? You're a loser.

831
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
What?

832
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Come on, calm down.

833
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I'm not.

834
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,360
Master Xian, I don't know what's your relationship with Wei Ming.

835
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Today is the big day of the Five-fire Dragon.

836
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,360
You should give me some respect.

837
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Master Zhao,

838
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,560
this is a relationship between them and me.

839
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I'll handle it myself.

840
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,960
You heard it.

841
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,760
It has nothing to do with you.

842
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,760
Let's go out and wait.

843
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Master Zhao,

844
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
let's go.

845
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Let's go.

846
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Let's go.

847
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Master Zhao.

848
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Master Zhao, are you okay?

849
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Go out and do your work.

850
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
It's okay.

851
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
It's not enough here.

852
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Master, I'll help you apply the medicine oil.

853
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Relax your neck. Then you'll feel better.

854
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Thank you.

855
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
I can't help it if I don't want to.

856
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Master Zhao, drink some water first.

857
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
It's almost done. Thank you.

858
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,760
You seem to be badly hurt.

859
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Can you fight back?

860
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
Do you want to change the person?

861
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
No.

862
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I'm the general commander.

863
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Now you're fighting back.

864
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
You're making people laugh.

865
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Master, you're badly hurt.

866
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,760
You can't even raise your hand.

867
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,760
If you fall down, you'll be in trouble.

868
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
You know that.

869
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
No one can fight back when the dragon head is so heavy.

870
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
What about my brother?

871
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
He's got a good foundation.

872
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
You'll see how powerful he is.

873
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
I'll have five dragon pigs at most.

874
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I've been wanting to have five dragon pigs for a long time.

875
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Little dragon pig, right?

876
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Little girl, you're back.

877
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Come and sit.

878
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Mom.

879
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Come here.

880
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Put down your things.

881
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
How's it going?

882
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Is your work hard lately?

883
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Same.

884
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Don't work so hard.

885
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
You should have a rest.

886
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Are you rich now?

887
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
You bought so many things.

888
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Didn't you ask me to buy them?

889
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
They're gifts.

890
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Today is your sister's birthday.

891
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Why do you need so many things?

892
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Forget it.

893
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Let's talk about it later.

894
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Did I say anything wrong?

895
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
She only knows how to spend money.

896
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,760
You and I are just a pair of fat guys.

897
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
What?

898
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
What happened?

899
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Today, Cui Zai called me.

900
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,760
He said you had a few thousand-yuan card debt.

901
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
He even scolded me.

902
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
He said if you didn't pay back,

903
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
you could break our red-tube.

904
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Why would they find you?

905
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
How would I know?

906
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Luckily, your dad didn't get scared by them.

907
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
He just finished building the bridge.

908
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
He can't be scared.

909
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
I'm sorry.

910
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,760
I was so busy that I forgot I had that card.

911
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll pay back the debt as soon as possible.

912
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
All right.

913
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I've paid back the money for you.

914
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Give them the money.

915
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
They won't bother you again.

916
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Xiaomei, you're a grown-up.

917
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Can't you be more mature?

918
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Don't expect your dad to help you.

919
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,760
You should think about it.

920
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
We can't take care of you for long.

921
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I rarely come back.

922
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
I just want to buy some gifts for you.

923
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I didn't ask you to pay me back.

924
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
You're still mad.

925
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Am I wrong to say that?

926
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
You want me to move out?

927
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
I can't do that.

928
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Xiaomei.

929
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Do I look good?

930
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,760
I like the purple headband.

931
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I bought one for you.

932
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
I'll have one.

933
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
And you two, one for each.

934
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Thank you.

935
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,760
I sent you 12 messages at 9.20 a.m.

936
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I sent you 6 messages for breakfast.

937
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,760
At 10.55 a.m., I bought a new headband.

938
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I sent you five messages.

939
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
You replied, ha ha.

940
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Give it to me.

941
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm busy.

942
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
And you sent me so many messages.

943
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
How can I reply to you?

944
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,760
It's hard to be busy at work.

945
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Mom said you had a hard time at work.

946
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
So she wanted to move out.

947
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Mom said you should take care of your sister.

948
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Xiaomei.

949
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I have something for you.

950
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Here are some socks.

951
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Here are some small things.

952
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
And these headbands.

953
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
See what you like.

954
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
I can give them to you.

955
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
So you won't have a hard time.

956
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Xiaomei.

957
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Can I go to your house?

958
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Of course.

959
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
I'll take you there next time.

960
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Your Highness.

961
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,760
We can have a great party tonight.

962
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
May we have a peaceful night.

963
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
In the room without the match,

964
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Everybody said they wanted to know

965
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
Who is the Hot Gum Master?

966
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Who are the person who gave the spots to enter?

967
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
And their faces

968
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Where are their brother?

969
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Who are their brothers?

970
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
That...

971
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Tell me.

972
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:24,760
The Manrique

973
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
The Manrique

974
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
But today, someone finally made a move

975
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,760
But this gentleman has a special background

976
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Who is this man?

977
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Please pay attention to the next episode of the city attack

978
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Look at the camera

979
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Sister, look at the camera

980
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Put your hand on my shoulder

981
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Come on, put it on

982
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Hurry up, get ready

983
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Three, two, one

984
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
See if it's good

985
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Look

986
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Happy birthday, sister

987
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Thank you, sister

988
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,760
The pair of shoes he wanted for a long time

989
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,760
You grew up with him. Don't you know his personality?

990
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
I didn't refuse to buy them for him

991
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
The salesman said they were the same shoes

992
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,760
They didn't have an adult's number

993
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,760
I didn't buy them for him even if he couldn't wear them

994
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Don't look at me like that

995
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Do you think you're the only one who's having a hard time?

996
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
I take care of your sister every day

997
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Besides, your dad often goes to the mall to buy shoes for you

998
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,760
And your dad often goes to the hospital

999
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
You're not with me

1000
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Who can I complain to?

1001
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Hurry up, the fire dragon is coming

1002
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I'll go with my sister

1003
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
You stay here with dad

1004
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
We're leaving

1005
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Be careful

1006
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Bye bye, dad

1007
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Bye bye

1008
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Bye bye, mom

1009
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Bye bye

1010
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Can Xiaomei handle it alone?

1011
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,760
She will take responsibility sooner or later

1012
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Give her a chance to practise

1013
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
