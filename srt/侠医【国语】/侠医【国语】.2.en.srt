1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't go!

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't go!

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's very helpful to you to rub in pain.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The End

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to take a walk. I'll be back soon.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sister, why do you always walk away alone?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, thank you. 60 yuan.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
60 yuan?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Where is sister?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sister.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sister.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sister.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Be careful, Miss.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Miss, get on the bike. It's dangerous.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll help you get the balloon.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Give it to me.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, let me go.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm scared.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The wolf is dead!

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
By the way, have you applied the medicine oil I gave you?

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, I'm used to taking painkillers.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Too many painkillers are bad for your health.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So you don't take painkillers?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I asked you to apply the medicine oil.

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The medicine oil penetrates the skin into the meridians.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It can help you to feel pain, but you don't need to eat too much.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's much safer.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you mean by that?

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You mean painkillers can eat bad people?

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's a saying,

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the medicine is three times more poisonous than the poison.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is the wisdom our ancestors left to us.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's better not to take too much medicine.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know you.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Chang's family's chicken.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Does it hurt?

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, it doesn't.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thanks to your sister,

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
she gave me a house.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She gave you a house.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You should thank her.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Where have you been? You're still here.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm back. Bye.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're leaving.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You should go back with your sister.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And... I'm sorry.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's okay.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm leaving.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Bye.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're asleep, right?

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm glad to have you with me.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your mom and I can have a rest.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Actually, we don't want to bother you.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not in a good shape.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm angry.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Dad, don't say that.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You should take care of yourself.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you need anything, call me.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll be home at any time.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How are you recently?

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you can't live with it, tell me.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your mom is a little lonely,

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but she cares about you.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She's afraid you'll suffer outside.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm okay.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't worry about me.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't want to pressure you.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But if you're too tired,

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can move back.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's better to live in your own home.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I see.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Have a good rest. I'm going back.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Be careful.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Dad, this is the sales report of the last season.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No problem.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sign it.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you looking at?

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nothing. I'm just looking at the stock market.

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, my god.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm so happy.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm so happy.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm so happy.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm so happy.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so happy.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mom, didn't you say you'd go to the market this morning?

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm done.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I wanted to go shopping with Mrs. Zhu.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't expect it to rain so heavily.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So I came up to do it.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Give me my shoes. My shoes are wet.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Do you have your slippers with you?

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I told you to bring them back that day.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Did you forget?

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ah-Xia, Ah-Xia, come in.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Did you see Mrs. Cheng's slippers?

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Her shoes are wet and she wants to change them.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Shoes?

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It seems to be in the cabinet.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Which cabinet?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Is it this pair?

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Bring it to me.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hurry up. Give it to her.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You wipe your feet and put it on.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Otherwise, you'll catch a cold.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm going out.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Aunt, take this file out.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dry the shoes in the bathroom.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hurry up.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Dry it.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Be sure to dry it.

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Dear, the real estate company

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
has found another house to sell.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He just sent me a message.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He said that Tong Qi has sold several houses.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And the price is good.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He told us to make a decision as soon as possible.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Otherwise, the price will rise.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That real estate company made me so angry last time.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't let her make a lot of money.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You make the decision.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Actually, dear,

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
it's better to make money yourself than the company.

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why don't you buy it yourself?

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Now I buy this house in the name of the company.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's to tell everyone that you're the general manager.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can make the decision.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ren Yuan, now only you and your son can make the decision.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't need the company's money.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can think of such a stupid thing with your own money.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is there anything wrong?

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Of course you can use it.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Son, you say, right?

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If dad is really so stupid,

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
he won't marry you.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But if you really can't make a decision,

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
leave it to me.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've seen a few houses.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, no, no.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can do it myself.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What are you doing?

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're so hurry.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't even believe me.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Of course I believe you.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You've already given me the check.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I remind you to transfer money.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Just to guarantee your interests.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then my interests are not your interests.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, I'll give it to you in two days.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then I'm ready to make a contract.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And you have to prepare yourself.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So much money.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No wonder you suddenly want to buy a house.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'll call you again.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It turns out to be a leg with the real estate economy.

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's none of your business.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's not my business.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But I want to remind you.

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You buy a house in the name of the company.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And you still have so much money.

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Even if you can get it done,

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
you still have to go through the shareholder level.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For example, aunt.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
mother

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hey.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,780
Li T祖

204
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,480
인품 fighting

205
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,000
worst

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There are still

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Exactly

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Boss

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We'll do the product promotion. Give them some time.

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We'll think of something soon.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We'll work hard.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We'll finish tonight.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right. I didn't want to rush you.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Remember, we need inspiration from life.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Think about how to innovate.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That way, our brand will be better.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Keep working hard.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I know, Ms. Hei Lian.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mom.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're so close. You don't come over for dinner.

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm here now.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We don't care about food.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We bought some food.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Don't make me happy.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't ruin my Ming.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I ruin him, I'll ask him to move back.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Or I'll be the only one to take over the house.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't talk so much. Come here and burn incense.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't talk so much. Come here and burn incense.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Our family used to live a hard life.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now we can finally eat.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ming.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why don't you go back to the company?

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Mom, the pharmaceutical factory is doing well.

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm doing well, too.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Everyone is doing well. Isn't that good?

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, Mrs. Hei.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Men are wise.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And now there are people who sell and sell.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Only successful things can be sold.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't talk to others.

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Work is important.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But your dad is lucky.

246
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't worry. I've been watching your brother.

247
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When he brought the girl home, I took a picture for you.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But he refused to take it.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Ming.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mom.

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you don't meet the girl of He Yan Yuan,

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
tell mom that I asked my friend to introduce some good girls to you.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Okay, mom.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, Mrs. Hei. Hurry up.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know how picky my brother is.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The girls in the pharmaceutical factory say they don't fit.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What should we do?

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hurry up and get a good dress for the blind date.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Master, help.

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Who is it?

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Open the door.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They're all here.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't know you were coming.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why don't you remember my brother-in-law's birthday?

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I remember he liked this roll the most.

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know how good he is to you.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
He pushed all the hard work to pay his brother-in-law a visit.

270
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's so funny.

271
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was his birthday last year.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He didn't come to his mother's birthday.

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He suddenly found out.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's been too busy lately.

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He wants to replace his brother-in-law with the pharmaceutical factory.

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He wants to make Ling Ren Yuan's name famous.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's more practical than paying him a visit every year.

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Right?

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is the best one.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's so delicious that I've lost my finger.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Uncle, these dishes are all made by Dolly.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Dolly needs to be taught by her.

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's divided into two parts.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She's so cunning.

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This hot star is not only preventing the public from being cheated.

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He's also the boss of this real-life oil brand.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He's not only very skilled, but also has a lot of experience.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because his father is the founder of another 10-year-old well-known health oil company.

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Dolly.

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Kang thought you were too busy to come.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The pharmaceutical company he developed and produced has a certain scale.

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because Lin Da Shao is a rich man.

294
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A Ming, he's a salesman.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're close to him.

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's all about the money.

297
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Aunt, we sell and sell and steal from a well-known brand.

298
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's very valuable.

299
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We don't need to spend so much money.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Uncle, aunt.

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm not promoting it.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I went to fight in person.

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't want those eunuchs and aunts to be cheated by others.

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We're making medicine.

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
In addition to making money, we have to fulfill our social responsibilities.

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Did you hear that?

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
My brother said, every word has a place to be.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What's the point of you talking?

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The food is getting cold.

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's eat.

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Before we eat, let's do one thing.

312
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The company wants to give you an autograph.

313
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Xia, give it to me.

314
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How about signing it after we eat?

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No need.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can decide about the company.

317
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's not okay.

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What documents do you want my mother to sign?

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's about money.

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
More than one million.

321
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Three million.

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Buy a house.

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Buy a house for whom?

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Li Tu is the general manager.

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He has to pay a lot for the company.

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Of course he has to pay back.

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The company can make money.

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just think of it as providing a dormitory to the company.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You can hire a maid and give her a room.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Isn't that right?

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's okay to provide a dormitory.

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But we have to see if the company's accounts are well-paid.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Xiaoyi, did the company make a lot of money this year?

334
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
60 million is a little lower than last year.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's only a few million a year.

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And it's going down.

337
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And you have to buy another 50% of the house.

338
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Is that reasonable?

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is it appropriate?

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Have you ever thought about why you will fall?

341
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Is it because you use our name to promote your own products?

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So you are our father?

343
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What are you talking about?

344
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I just put it on TV.

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You use the name of the fight to promote your own products.

346
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Actually, you are using the name of the uncle Lin Renyuan to sell your own products.

347
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I remember when I first came to the company,

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
my dad told me that after you left the door,

349
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you wouldn't interfere with all the operations of our Renyuan Pharmaceutical Factory.

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You are you, we are us.

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Selling and selling is not related to our pharmaceutical factory.

352
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But it seems that it's not now.

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You said it yourself.

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You won't interfere with our company's operations.

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Now my dad is buying a house in the name of the company.

356
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So it's not your business.

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Cousin.

358
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't say something that seems to be very reasonable.

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What is reasonable is that you guys are asking for money.

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What's wrong?

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't say it, but you are angry.

362
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Everyone is free from the harm of the family.

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Family.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There are some things that need to be said clearly.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Cheng's family attacked and said that Lin Renyuan is my dad.

366
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can't deny it.

367
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because this is the fact.

368
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But you said that my formula is to copy Renyuan Pharmaceutical Factory.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I will deny it.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because I didn't copy it.

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I also promised my dad.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Renyuan Pharmaceutical Factory and Selling and Selling will have nothing to do with it.

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Cousin.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you make medicine oil as soon as you are born?

375
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You dare to say that it has nothing to do with your uncle?

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My dad taught me a lot.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He often said that the ship doesn't sail the sea.

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The same ship flies to the enemy country.

380
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There are hundreds of medicine oils in the market.

381
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But each success is different.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Renyuan Pharmaceutical Factory has your selling point.

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My selling point is clear.

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I have my selling point.

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Then I ask you.

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Do you know what the ingredients of Renyuan Pharmaceutical Factory are?

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What are the characteristics of it compared to other medicine oils?

388
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
OK.

389
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Uncle.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You have no reason not to know.

391
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You buy a house with company money.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I have no right to interfere.

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But my mom has shares.

394
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I just give her a reasonable suggestion.

395
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Am I wrong?

396
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So ridiculous.

397
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Son, send me away.

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
People here are popular.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's talk slowly.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's it.

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Aunt.

402
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I send my mom back first.

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Go.

404
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Min.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Actually, I want to buy a house.

406
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Not necessarily to invest in the job.

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's not for me.

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Tu.

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Go to the room with me.

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
OK.

411
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I am the general manager.

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't even have a house.

413
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I want to live in my wife's house.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
She has no face.

415
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So she forced me to buy a house.

416
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Forget it.

417
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Actually, it's not a place without a house.

418
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No need to make sister difficult for you for the house.

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't buy it.

420
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Sister.

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You just pretend that I didn't say that.

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't say anything behind your back.

423
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's no big deal.

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Aunt.

425
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You are in charge of the account.

426
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
How about you take out the account book?

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's take a look together.

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's clear.

429
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't say so much.

430
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You eat apples.

431
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I just say the fact.

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
A'xiang.

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Sign the document for me.

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Sister, sign here.

435
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Aunt.

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Three thousand dollars.

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You really want money?

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't make a scene.

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
My mom has a sense.

440
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Thank you, sister.

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I won't bother you.

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll send A'xiang back first.

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Come and sit down if you have time.

444
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sure.

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Sister, I'm leaving first.

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
OK.

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
OK, I'm leaving.

448
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Amin.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He is my brother.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He has been in a bad situation for decades.

451
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let him take a breath in front of Feng.

452
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The money is like flowing water.

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Our fruit is like sugar water.

454
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My son is great.

455
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't compete with others.

456
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Mom, eat apples.

457
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
OK.

458
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A'xiang.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Mom, eat apples.

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
700 square inches of food.

461
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No, I'm not lying.

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Sorry, I said something wrong.

463
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But the food...

464
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't be like this.

466
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is the case of the call from the sales department.

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This order is not good.

468
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Wait for the next order.

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There is no next order.

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The call from the sales department

471
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
makes me look at the house.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No one cares about me.

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You take painkillers again.

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't eat anymore.

475
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's not good to eat too much.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
How about this?

477
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We go to have afternoon tea.

478
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Take a break, relax and go back to write.

479
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, it's almost the end of the month.

480
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you want to be fired?

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There are still a few days.

482
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can do it.

483
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
By the way, what's wrong?

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Did Mr. Deng pay the check?

485
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Not yet.

486
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But he won't open the air ticket check.

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I deleted him last time.

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know if he will do something.

489
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll tell you when the time comes.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not the only one.

492
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't look at him too simply.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He is very good at it.

494
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If he is just good at it, it's simple.

495
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sometimes you have to grasp these advantages.

496
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't think too much.

497
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Call me on the phone.

498
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It must work.

499
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Come on.

500
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I just want to call you.

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Take it like this.

502
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The money has been confirmed.

503
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Prepare the temporary contract.

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
When the other is also confirmed,

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you can sign.

506
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Did you finish yesterday's matter?

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes.

508
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I've done it all.

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you didn't, I'll go up with you and scold them.

510
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's not to make a deal with him.

511
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You are the president's manager.

512
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What's the problem with that?

513
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So simple, so much talk.

514
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
She is my sister.

515
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
She must be good to me.

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Good?

517
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Your so-called sister

518
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
doesn't have to do anything

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
with her husband's shares.

520
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
She will let you two do everything.

521
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
She sits there to collect money.

522
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
She also wants us to beg her

523
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
to be fired by her dog,

524
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the Yanzu.

525
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's good.

526
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
How dare she speak so loudly

527
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
without support?

528
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's obvious that her cousin

529
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
let that crazy dog out to fire us.

530
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
She even wants to step on her father's name

531
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and raise herself.

532
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm getting more and more angry.

533
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Son, I think highly of you.

534
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Help me beat her up.

535
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't make her so proud.

536
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Now, the two drugs are competing.

537
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't worry.

538
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I won't lose to them.

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Mr. Deng,

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
this is the temporary contract.

541
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If the content is OK,

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
you can sign here.

543
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Thank you, Mr. Deng.

544
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
All right.

545
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We've done our work last night.

546
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's time to do something serious.

547
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Congratulations, Sis.

548
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You've completed the first million orders

549
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
of this month.

550
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You've got such a hard client.

551
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You deserve to be rewarded.

552
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You guys,

553
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
learn from Sis.

554
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yes.

555
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Come in.

556
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You too.

557
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
OK.

558
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Boss,

559
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
you're in front of so many people

560
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
and you're calling me Sis.

561
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I can't take it.

562
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Because you're good.

563
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But the rules are the same.

564
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The rules are the same.

565
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I have to make it clear to you.

566
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This order

567
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
was in the name of Richo.

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Although you've signed the order,

569
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you should pay half of the money.

570
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You deserve the credit.

571
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you want to borrow a Richo?

572
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You two, consider it.

573
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
OK.

574
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
OK.

575
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you OK?

576
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm fine.

577
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But I'm under a lot of pressure recently.

578
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can't do nothing

579
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
without paying half of the money.

580
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
How about I treat you to a meal today?

581
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You think a meal

582
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
can pay me back?

583
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You have to pay me a whole month.

584
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But I can't today.

585
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I have an appointment.

586
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I promise you

587
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll pay you half of the money

588
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
next time I open the order.

589
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OK.

590
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
OK.

591
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You've paid Richo so much.

592
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think your good friend

593
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
won't refuse you.

594
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You said it's the rule.

595
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You can take advantage of her.

596
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The rule is death.

597
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
People live.

598
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's the rule.

599
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Right?

600
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So I always say you're smart.

601
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know it.

602
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What should I do

603
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to follow your rule?

604
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Why do you coax Mr. Deng?

605
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm not a man.

606
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm a woman.

607
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You coax me like this?

608
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're the best.

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
OK.

610
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Richo,

611
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
you've been taking the bottom line

612
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
for the past two months.

613
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It means you owe the company money.

614
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Even if you pay half of the money,

615
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
you still have to pay the company.

616
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
What do you mean?

617
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If you don't want the money,

618
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
give it to her.

619
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
She can pay you back.

620
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's OK to give it to her.

621
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's not my credit anyway.

622
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But I haven't paid the bill this month.

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Didn't you say

624
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
if I didn't pay the bill for three months,

625
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
the company would be angry?

626
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The rule is death.

627
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
People live.

628
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I can help you

629
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
with your performance this month.

630
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's great.

631
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Come in.

632
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Boss, what can I do for you?

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Your sister said

634
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
she wouldn't pay your half of the money.

635
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Are you really afraid I'll be angry?

636
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No.

637
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
She's giving me more time to catch up.

638
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm embarrassed to share your money.

639
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Thank you.

640
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll treat you to a meal for a month.

641
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Be careful.

642
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Here.

643
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

644
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
She bought a house for tens of millions.

645
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Some servants are using it.

646
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What are you doing here?

647
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Spray it.

648
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Be smart.

649
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The disease is more than the air.

650
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Anger is the air.

651
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The air is slow when it's happy.

652
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The air is the answer.

653
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
As long as we can do

654
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
what we like to do,

655
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
our mood will be happy.

656
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Then our blood can

657
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
flow smoothly.

658
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you know the rules,

659
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
you can learn from your uncle and aunt.

660
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's good to like something

661
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
expensive and useless.

662
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's better than

663
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
saving these old things every day.

664
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's good to break things.

665
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's just the emperor's inner energy.

666
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
If you can't catch up with women,

667
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
how can you explain to your aunt?

668
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Be careful of my medicine pot.

669
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If it breaks, you can't afford it.

670
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
What's wrong with this medicine pot?

671
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's okay.

672
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Okay, I won't touch your things.

673
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm going out.

674
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't want to break your things.

675
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay?

676
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Go.

677
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I can't stand it.

678
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Wei Min,

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
bring me a bottle of medicine oil.

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Master Lin,

681
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
can I leave soon?

682
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm sure you can.

683
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Of course you can leave soon.

684
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
My dad is great.

685
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
He can definitely cure you.

686
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This world is changing.

687
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Our medicine oil is changing too.

688
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I think whether it's the package

689
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
or the ingredients,

690
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
it's better to wait.

691
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I think we should wait.

692
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I think we should wait.

693
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We should wait.

694
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I think whether it's the package or the ingredients,

695
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
we should make a new reform.

696
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Min, Ren Yuan is an old man.

697
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What if after the reform,

698
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the old masters don't accept us?

699
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
How can I explain to your uncle and aunt?

700
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They are also shareholders.

701
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No, dad.

702
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm very confident that we can succeed.

703
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Do whatever you want.

704
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If you have ideas,

705
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you can make a ship and break in.

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Okay, I know.

707
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I know, dad.

708
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I've decided.

709
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
From today,

710
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I will develop a new oil

711
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
that is completely different from Ren Yuan's.

712
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
This house is used by the owner to make milk.

713
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Now the owner's business has failed.

714
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He dumped the milk and took the house back.

715
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Boss, you're so great.

716
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How do you know this kind of thing?

717
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The point is not this.

718
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The point is that the owner is in a hurry to raise money.

719
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The price is 500,000 yuan lower than the market price.

720
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
This piece of fat pork is cheap for you.

721
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And the house is difficult to find.

722
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You are professional.

723
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Thank you, boss.

724
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm going out to work.

725
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What's wrong?

726
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Do you think I'm biased?

727
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No.

728
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But I want to remind you.

729
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm the one who wants to chase the performance.

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm just and fair.

731
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Whoever is good, I'll let them go.

732
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If you don't chase the performance,

733
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
our company will also chase.

734
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I let you in.

735
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I won't let you work.

736
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Work depends on character.

737
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This kind of house is most suitable for you with personality.

738
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
A whole hole in the cross-section.

739
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Turn over immediately.

740
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm going to work.

741
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm going to work.

742
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000

I think no one is here. I just slept here.

900

Don't call an ambulance.

901
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You fainted suddenly. You might have other problems.

902
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You'd better go to the hospital.

903
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't need money to go to the hospital.

904
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Give me a few hundred yuan. I'll eat.

905
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000

906

You can buy food and go to the doctor.

907
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay, I'll go to the doctor.

908
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He's obviously lying.

909
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Why did you give him the money?

910
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Are you okay?

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000

Okay.

915
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The seller's blood is the best.

916
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The seller's pulse won't lie.

917
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
To me,

918
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
he's a homeless person.

919
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
A person struggling to survive in society.

920
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But the most important thing is that he's a patient.

921
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Who are you?

922
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000

Sit down.

928
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You're a habitable con artiste.

929
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
If you don't take care of it,

930
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
it'll get worse and you won't be able to take painkillers.

931
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I know.

932
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You know but you can't do it.

933
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll help you.

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'll do it myself.

935
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay.

936
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Put your feet up.

937
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:15,080
This is a kind of

938
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You really want to buy this house?

939
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes.

940
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You don't do the old building business?

941
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Of course I do.

942
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But this place is really old.

943
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The decoration will be expensive.

944
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I really want to buy this house.

945
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Okay.

946
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Your boss is really crazy.

947
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
He gave me such a difficult task.

948
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Aren't you taking the guests to see Mr. Zheng's house?

949
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yes, but do you know that Zheng's family

950
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
already mortgaged the house to the financial company

951
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and delayed the registration?

952
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Tell me, how embarrassing I am.

953
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Like this.

954
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What is this?

955
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is a building that was sold for money.

956
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Someone bought it.

957
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That customer is Lin Wei Min.

958
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So familiar.

959
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Lin Wei Min.

960
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He is the owner of the drugstore in Mai Mai Tong.

961
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
For a middle-aged man, he is a bit strange.

962
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But he is a bit weird.

963
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It doesn't matter if he is weird.

964
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now, the economy is in the trend.

965
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
He sells drugs.

966
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's exactly this piece.

967
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Then what do you think he bought such an old building for?

968
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Wait for the purchase.

969
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If the whole street is rebuilt by someone,

970
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
his business will be good.

971
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If it's good,

972
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
then he must want to buy this building.

973
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yes, it's not going to work.

974
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Then your performance this month will be down.

975
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Don't be seen by Situ.

976
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Don't eat shit.

977
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Let's just go together.

978
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Go together again?

979
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No.

980
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
No.

981
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Last time you helped me.

982
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
This time let me help you.

983
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Take the subway while it's hot.

984
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Don't be seen by other economy.

985
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Hurry up.

986
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Go.

987
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Okay.

988
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yes, Mr. Lin.

989
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I want to talk to you about the 581st street in Yuan Zhou Street.

990
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Do you have time later?

991
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

992
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'll be back in a minute.

993
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Okay.

994
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The pain in the shoulder joint reflects the blood pressure in the neck.

995
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It will affect your spirit and sleep quality.

996
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Remember to sit straight.

997
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Don't always lower your head.

998
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Do a few times of additional brain exercise.

999
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Stretching the neck helps the blood circulation in the brain.

1000
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It can also improve headache.

1001
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm sorry.

1002
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm sorry.

1003
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm sorry.

1004
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm sorry.

1005
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm sorry.

1006
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sorry.

1007
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm sorry.

1008
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm sorry.

1009
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm sorry.

1010
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm sorry.

1011
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm sorry.

1012
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'm sorry.

1013
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm sorry.

1014
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm sorry.
