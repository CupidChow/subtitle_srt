1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Nanen knows a drug dealer who said she can take Mai Maitong to Southeast Asia.

2
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm waiting for her at the cafe where you can buy her medicine.

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,600
Do you want to come with me?

4
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,200
Actually, it's the same for you to talk for me.

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm sure I can leave Mai Maitong to you.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
With her, you can cure Luo Yingchen.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,200
If you don't give her any punishment,

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
she will always think that she is a top talent.

9
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
What's wrong?

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm so dizzy. I'm so angry.

11
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,400
You're just dizzy, right?

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll go buy you some medicine.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Sit here and wait for me. I'll be back soon.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,400
How are you, Rachel?

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
A'Ming, I'm so dizzy.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Are you okay? How are you?

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,600
A'Ming, can you come pick me up?

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Rachel. Rachel!

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Rachel!

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
Rachel!

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm worried that girl might get into trouble.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
If something happens, your hotel will be responsible for it.

23
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Please hide from me, A'Ming.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
No way.

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
πολύ

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,800
It's such a drinking habit.

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
If you don't believe me,

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,800
I can promise to get with my mother.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
In addition to being a top idol,

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
when I feel exhausted to beisi,

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,500
thearetahui also gets away from me

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,200
so I don't treat her like a藍001 which pop quiz at dad's house.

33
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,680
Because he killed Evening Karst with his own hands.

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Jin謹周

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:33,800
WOW

36
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
What did you say?

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
Qi Yuqiu

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,840
What are you doing

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,080
Stop

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:44,760
You

41
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,600
You

42
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,600
Why?

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,240
ierungs

44
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,020
Rui Chen, how are you?

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Don't take it serious.

46
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,620
Your father isn't in the runtime.

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,260
It's dis Henan III,

48
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,000
as well as there's another one remaining.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,720
There's another one?

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,480
I don't remember.

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,240
Didn't you say so?

52
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,160
It's been much longer than you said.

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,520
There're doku somehow.

54
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,820
Er,

55
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,440
I made the earthquake.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
There're six Ludwig and five Keshe to the Cremthemen.

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,040
I was just 별로 afraid

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,320
and rural��gas and a crazy girl in that village.

59
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,480
Rui Chen.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
Just a guy from Ateast City.

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,200
Producer

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Do you know where A Ming is?

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,840
No infinite

64
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
How about A Zu?

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't know

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,160
He goes missing

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,820
Thank you

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm back. Where have you been?

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
I couldn't find you after I bought the medicine.

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I couldn't reach you on the phone. I was so worried.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Why are you with A-Ming?

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm still a little dizzy. I want to go upstairs to rest.

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll go with you.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
No need.

75
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,920
A-Ming will go with me.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Zhixiu, I'll give you a prescription later.

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Help me take the medicine.

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Okay.

79
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Surgery

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Ling Wei Ming beat you so badly?

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
What she did to me today

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I'll give it back to her ten times after that.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,920
You said you could do it.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,920
I thought today you could make Luo Yingcheng cry so much.

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
But he's fine

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
I don't understand

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I don't understand why he's always so lucky

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
I don't understand why Lin Weimin is always with him

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
What's wrong?

90
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Lin Weimin is here

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
He's in Tang now

92
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
What?

93
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
He's a hero

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Look at yourself

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
What do you think?

96
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
You're going to let it go?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Of course not

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
To deal with those bastards

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I must get rid of their clinic

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Destroy their pulse

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I want them to be defeated

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
How is it?

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Are you still feeling dizzy?

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
You have heat and evil poison in your body

105
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
This detoxifying soup

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
can help you to get rid of the fire,

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
cool down and detoxify

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Drink it while it's hot before you go to sleep

109
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
It's so bitter

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
It's not bitter, it's not funny

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Your blood vessels are blocked by the gallbladder

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
You can't hear or feel at ease

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,920
It causes you to feel guilty, weak and dizzy

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Your condition is like being disturbed by drugs

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Do you remember when you were going to sleep?

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Nan asked me to go to the pharmacy to get some medicine

117
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
I felt dizzy while waiting

118
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
She said she would buy me some medicine

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Then Deng Shikeng showed up

120
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
The whole afternoon

121
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I only drank the orange juice that Nan gave me

122
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Do you think she did it?

123
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm not sure

124
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I only know that you are here

125
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Otherwise

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I wouldn't dare to think about it

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't be afraid, it's okay

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't think too much, go to sleep

129
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
But when I close my eyes, I think about it

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Don't be afraid, I'll help you to press the acupoint

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Come to my side

132
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I'm sorry

133
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm sorry

134
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm sorry

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm sorry

136
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm sorry

137
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm sorry

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm sorry

139
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm sorry

140
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
I'm sorry

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm sorry

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm sorry

143
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm sorry

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm sorry

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm sorry

146
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
I'm sorry

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm sorry

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm sorry

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm sorry

150
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm sorry

151
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm sorry

152
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm sorry

153
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm sorry

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm sorry

155
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I'm sorry

156
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm sorry

157
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
I'm sorry

158
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm sorry

159
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
I'm sorry

160
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm sorry

161
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm sorry

162
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm sorry

163
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm sorry

164
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm sorry

165
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm sorry

166
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm sorry

167
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
sorry

168
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
I'm sorry

169
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm so sorry

170
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Sorry

171
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
I pressed your acupoint so badly

172
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Appired

173
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
I'll be OK

174
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm sorry

175
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
I'm sorry

176
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm sorry

177
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm sorry

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm sorry

179
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I'm sorry

180
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I'm sorry

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Thank you.

182
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Look at the ball first.

183
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
You're so lucky.

184
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Hey, you!

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Stop it! I can't find you!

186
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Your son is in the hospital now.

187
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
You're still in the mood to gamble and gamble.

188
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
How can you be a father?

189
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
My son, mind your own business!

190
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I gave you money to go to the hospital.

191
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I'm not going to gamble for you.

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
And why did you put me online to frame me?

193
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
You're hurting my brother.

194
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Who else do you have to pay for it?

195
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I don't say what can be done?

196
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Say it or not?

197
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
You hit me. I'll call the police. You're dead.

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm going to hit you even if I'm dead.

199
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm going to run away. Calm down.

200
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Be good. Calm down.

201
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Don't stop me.

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
You're a doctor.

203
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Do you want to be photographed and hit people again?

204
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
If you hit people,

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
the clinic and Brother Ming will be in trouble.

206
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You're a man.

207
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
You're a man.

208
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
You're a man.

209
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Mrs. Li, how is Qian?

210
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Are you feeling better?

211
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
He's awake. Thank you.

212
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Are you hungry?

213
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I had a few sips of porridge.

214
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving.

215
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I want to ask you one more thing.

216
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Did something happen to him before he went crazy?

217
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Did something happen to him before he went crazy?

218
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I don't know.

219
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
What about yourself?

220
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
How did you get hurt?

221
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
I got hurt myself. Don't worry about it.

222
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Mrs. Li, don't hold it in.

223
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
You can ask someone to help you.

224
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
It's none of your business. Why do you care?

225
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Mrs. Li, eat something first.

226
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
You've been looking so pale lately.

227
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Did you sleep well?

228
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I didn't sleep well. I didn't have an appetite.

229
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
You must be worried about Ming.

230
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Ming finally became a doctor.

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Now he's being tainted.

232
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
As a mother, I trust my son.

233
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm thinking about how to help him.

234
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Ming is capable.

235
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
With your support, he can definitely pass the exam.

236
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Sister, you're drinking tea here.

237
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Yes. What a coincidence.

238
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You're so smart.

239
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
You have a son and a mother.

240
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
You can even eat.

241
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
You must keep your mouth shut.

242
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
You must be careful.

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
What am I afraid of?

244
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm not the one who's causing trouble for the kids.

245
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Feng, don't make a conclusion so quickly.

246
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Ming won't do anything to the patients.

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
It's not Ming's fault if he finds out.

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Don't argue here.

249
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
This is a public place.

250
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Many people are watching.

251
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
What are you afraid of? It's not my fault.

252
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Enough, Feng.

253
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Everyone has his own problems.

254
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
The wind and water are in turn.

255
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Maybe one day you'll have trouble.

256
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
You need our help.

257
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
You're so shameless.

258
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I've never seen anyone who's already in trouble.

259
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
You're so arrogant that you want to help me.

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Take care of yourself, auntie.

261
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Stop it. Brother's car is waiting for us.

262
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Come on, let's go.

263
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Your good nephew, Lin Weiming,

264
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,920
is fighting against your dead brother-in-law's medical school.

265
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
He's making trouble.

266
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
He's lying in the hospital.

267
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,920
What if something happens?

268
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
What if he drags the hospital down?

269
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
The medical school is my cousin's.

270
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
The products are sold and sold.

271
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
We'll definitely get rid of it if something happens.

272
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm worried about something else.

273
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm worried that my cousin wants to break into our company.

274
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Why are you here all of a sudden?

276
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Why did you take me to the lawyer's office on Monday?

277
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I don't know.

278
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
What are you pretending?

279
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I saw you taking me to the lawyer's office.

280
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I was introducing a friend to him.

281
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
You're so brave.

282
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
If we didn't lend you money,

283
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
you wouldn't have lived in such a big house.

284
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
We thought you were our own.

285
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
You were just playing tricks behind our back.

286
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
You think my husband and son are dead?

287
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
No, no.

288
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Don't do this.

289
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I didn't.

290
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Look at you.

291
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
You're lying to us.

292
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Why did you learn from others?

293
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Tell me clearly.

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Why did I take you to the lawyer's office?

295
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Enough. Stop it.

296
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
What are you doing?

297
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Honey, honey, don't do this.

298
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Let's talk it over.

299
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Xia, Xia.

300
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
We didn't mean to make it hard on you.

301
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
We just saw you running to the lawyer.

302
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
We were a little worried.

303
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Actually, you're not in good health.

304
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
We want to find a lawyer to help you.

305
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,920
Actually, the medicine we sell has always been praised by everyone.

306
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Now the news is just a few words.

307
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Is it necessary to ask for a refund?

308
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
There is no principle at all.

309
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,920
The worst thing about doing business is negative news.

310
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
This is how the world is.

311
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Steal and push.

312
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Don't say it. Hurry up.

313
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
There are four more.

314
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I want to drive.

315
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Drive to see the road.

316
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I saw it. I didn't hit it.

317
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
Your face is white.

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
How about I drive?

319
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,920
I have prepared the Chinese medicine.

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I also cooked some food for you.

321
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
I'll give you some drinks.

322
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
It's good for your health.

323
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Remember to drink.

324
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Come, let me help you.

325
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,920
I really don't understand you.

326
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Every time it's like this, it's always so angry.

327
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
You are now wronged.

328
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
The clinic can't open.

329
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
The medicine oil is all returned to others.

330
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Why don't you seem to be in your heart at all?

331
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
There are some things that are anxious and useless.

332
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Anyway, I believe that the正气存内,邪不可干.

333
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Anyway, in the future, you will be the judge of the trade.

334
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
Your health is judged by me.

335
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
You are the judge.

336
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Rachel, you are here.

337
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Aunt.

338
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Come, come, come.

339
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Just right.

340
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I made soup and drank it together.

341
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Okay.

342
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Today's is the stewed chicken with chicken.

343
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I treat your child very well.

344
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Right, A Min?

345
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Yes.

346
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
It's good for your health.

347
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
It's suitable for you to drink.

348
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you.

349
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Drink.

350
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Thank you, aunt.

351
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
You're welcome.

352
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Rachel.

353
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Rachel.

354
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Why don't we have more time to make an appointment?

355
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Then you call your family.

356
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,920
The two families should contact the relationship as soon as possible.

357
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Mom.

358
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
You say this will scare her.

359
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
My A Min is slow and hot.

360
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
He doesn't know how to express himself and is passive.

361
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Don't blame him.

362
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Mom.

363
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
It's delicious, aunt.

364
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Thank you.

365
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
You're welcome.

366
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm going to work.

367
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Bye.

368
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Bye.

369
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Goodbye.

370
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Rachel is beautiful, capable and polite.

371
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
You have good taste.

372
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
She is a good girl.

373
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,920
If you are interested in her, you should express yourself.

374
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Do you want a girl to pursue you?

375
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Okay, mom.

376
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
You must do it.

377
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm waiting for my wife to check.

378
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You don't care about such a good girl.

379
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Be careful not to be taken away by others.

380
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Mom, don't worry.

381
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
The one who worries about the poor will be angry.

382
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Get in the car.

383
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I can't stand you.

384
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Only Rachel can stand you.

385
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay, I'm going home.

386
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I won't talk to you.

387
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm going home.

388
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Call me when you get home.

389
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Okay.

390
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Hello, are you Mr. Lin Weimin?

391
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
I am.

392
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
What's up?

393
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Hello, I'm a social worker at the women's shelter.

394
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm in charge of supporting women who are victims of domestic violence.

395
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Mrs. Li, why are you so hurt?

396
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,920
My husband hit me last night.

397
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Fortunately, the neighbor next door helped me call the police.

398
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Otherwise, I might die.

399
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
You can't endure it anymore.

400
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I know.

401
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Actually, for my son,

402
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,920
for the family, I can do everything.

403
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I can bear it.

404
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,920
But the more I endure, the more he goes too far.

405
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Don't blame yourself.

406
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
You're not the one who's wrong.

407
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
He's the one who's wrong.

408
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
I just want to know if the heaven is in the hospital.

409
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Is it related to him?

410
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes, he's the one who's in the hospital with Qianqian.

411
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I see.

412
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
You wronged the doctor.

413
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Thank you, boss.

414
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Are you crazy?

415
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Qianqian can take the pen.

416
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
It's all thanks to Dr. Lin for helping us.

417
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Now you're going to take money from others to wrong him.

418
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
At least 200,000.

419
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I won't take it.

420
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Anyway, you cooperate with me.

421
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
You want me to play with you?

422
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
You're so ungrateful.

423
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
How can we see our son grow up?

424
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
You're so stupid.

425
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Don't hit him.

426
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
Go away.

427
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Don't hit him.

428
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
You're so ungrateful.

429
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Ungrateful.

430
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Ungrateful.

431
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Ungrateful.

432
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I told him that Li was wrong.

433
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
But he's so ungrateful.

434
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
He beat his wife badly.

435
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
And made his son go to the hospital.

436
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
He's a bastard.

437
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Luckily, Mrs. Li finally saw his husband's true face.

438
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
You should make it clear.

439
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Otherwise, the hospital can't make it clear.

440
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Generally, the victim will think that

441
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
the other party will change.

442
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Until the last moment,

443
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
the one who was hurt is himself and his son.

444
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,920
That bastard should be arrested.

445
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
He was cheated tens of thousands of dollars.

446
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
And then he came to the hospital.

447
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
You're so shameless.

448
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
You're so good at being tricked.

449
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
You almost got yourself involved with the prostitution.

450
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I want to solve it quickly.

451
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
I want to solve it quickly.

452
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Who do you think gave the bastard 200,000?

453
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Was it the gang who came to the hospital to make trouble?

454
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Do we need to pay for the gang's trouble?

455
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Just throw the game and play it.

456
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I just think that one person will make trouble.

457
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
That loser.

458
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
A'Ming, do you think it was the bastard Deng Shikeng?

459
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
No matter who did it,

460
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Mrs. Li is enough to testify.

461
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
After the clinic opens,

462
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
I will follow Qian's illness.

463
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
And then try my best to help them get through this difficulty.

464
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
That's all?

465
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Now we're all in trouble because of them.

466
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Just forget it.

467
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
What can we do without evidence?

468
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
He did so many things

469
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
just to force me to close the clinic.

470
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I have to keep opening it.

471
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Keep treating people.

472
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Don't let him succeed.

473
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,920
A man suspected of attacking his wife

474
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
and mistreated his seven-year-old son with brain anesthesia.

475
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Yesterday, he was arrested for assaulting.

476
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
The man who was accused of escaping

477
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
once claimed that

478
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,920
his son was unconscious after being treated by Chinese medicine.

479
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
He only revealed another version of the case

480
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
after his wife reported the case.

481
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Son, something happened.

482
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
What's wrong?

483
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
11424,

484
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
they just announced a stop.

485
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,040
Good evening,

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,920
Jinzhi,

487
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Ming is here.

488
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
You don't mind, do you?

489
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
So RIght.

490
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,080
A flight- Eyeglass

491
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
You have to have a chat.

492
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Um.

493
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll cook it for you.

494
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,720
Okay.

495
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,120
Thank you, Mrs. Ju.

496
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,720
You're welcome.

497
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Thank you, Grandma.

498
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay.

499
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Please.

500
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,520
Okay.

501
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
Your painting is so beautiful.

502
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Thank you.

503
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,120
Jia Jun told me about you.

504
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,720
He suddenly got a cold when he was painting a few days ago.

505
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
I thought he was too tired.

506
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,120
But after we saw the doctor,

507
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,320
the doctor said that the angle of his spine

508
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,520
is almost forty degrees.

509
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
He has a concussion.

510
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
That's why he sometimes has trouble breathing.

511
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,720
Then the doctor suggested that he go for a suture fusion operation.

512
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,720
But he refused to go.

513
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,320
Why did he refuse?

514
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,720
In fact, he had done a similar operation in middle school.

515
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
It saved his life.

516
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,920
But the operation hurt his nerves.

517
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
He couldn't walk and had to sit on a wheelchair.

518
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
He said he was afraid of doing a similar operation.

519
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
It's very risky.

520
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
He might not be able to paint in the future.

521
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,720
It's difficult to make a big cost.

522
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,320
It's normal that you don't want money and effort to sell.

523
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Cousin,

524
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
I saw you have used some methods

525
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
to help Xiao Qian with her spine.

526
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
Could we use the same method

527
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,520
to help her blood pressure?

528
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,320
Yes.

529
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,120
Jia Jun is easy to be anxious.

530
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
I could only do it because I stayed up night

531
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,120
and get a cold so I couldn't breathe.

532
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,520
After my mother recovered from it,

533
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,920
it wasn't that serious.

534
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
How can he be so serious?

535
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Pneumonia is also a warning signal

536
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Maybe it's a weak lung

537
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Or a poor circulation

538
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Why don't you go to my clinic and let me see

539
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Find it out and deal with it earlier

540
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Ok, I'll get the painting and then I'll go to you

541
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Dumplings are ready, come and eat

542
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Wow, it smells good

543
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Yes, mushroom chicken

544
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
It's a new product

545
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
Wow, I can't wait

546
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Thank you

547
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
What is this? So big

548
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
This

549
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
I'll know later

550
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
This is called three-dimensional

551
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Pneumonia

552
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:11,260
Actually, I was inspired when I was in the

553
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
It's a multi-angle, multi-direction

554
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Especially for the spine

555
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Bones are wrong

556
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
And muscle stiffening

557
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
So compared to the traditional pull machine

558
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
It can be said to be more comprehensive

559
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
It's a bit like a stretcher for us to do exercise

560
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
How can this be a medical level

561
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,920
And he's especially for some long-term congenital brain disease patients

562
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
And those who have been sitting in wheelchairs for a long time

563
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Body weak patients

564
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,920
And the old-fashioned spine patients

565
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Can help them do deep recovery

566
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:53,040
It sounds like it's very suitable for

567
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,920
It's so late, you can play first

568
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
I have to go back to the company, I have an appointment with a distributor

569
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Rachel

570
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
You have time tomorrow night

571
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I want to invite you to dinner

572
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
OK, you book a seat

573
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Tell me when and where

574
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
I'll send it to you when I'm done

575
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
OK, see you tomorrow

576
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Rachel

577
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I have something to ask you, come with me

578
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Rachel, why are we going so far

579
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Why are you still in the clinic

580
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
I read the news that Mr. Li was arrested

581
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
It just proves that it has nothing to do with A Min

582
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
So I took a bottle of champagne to celebrate with you

583
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Do you really want to open the clinic

584
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Or are you just acting

585
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Rachel, what are you talking about

586
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
I don't understand what you mean

587
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
You told me that there was a medicine oil supplier

588
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Can help the pulse

589
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Invite me to the hotel

590
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Then I drank the orange juice you ordered for me

591
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I was dizzy

592
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Did you help Deng Shikeng to drug

593
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Do you know you are now

594
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Making a very serious accusation

595
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
What evidence do you have

596
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,920
If it wasn't for A Min, I would have been raped by Deng Shikeng

597
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
No matter how much you hate me

598
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
How can you do this

599
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Are you crazy

600
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Even if I'm crazy

601
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
You forced me to do it

602
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,920
So you knew about the drug

603
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,920
The fact that someone was framed

604
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
You even used A Zu to make a fool of yourself

605
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Do you have a conscience

606
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
He likes you so much

607
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
You're crazy

608
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
You have no right to talk about me

609
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm sorry

610
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Mrs Li

611
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Are you a friend of Doctor Ling

612
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Yes, my name is A Zu

613
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
I heard from Doctor Ling that Qian Zai is much better

614
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
So I bought fruit orchids to come and see him

615
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Thank you

616
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
It's really thoughtful

617
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I came to see Qianqian

618
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
You're welcome

619
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Qian Zai, you are great

620
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
You can recover very quickly

621
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Go home very quickly

622
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Mrs Li

623
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Actually, I came today

624
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
In addition to seeing Qian Zai

625
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I have one more thing to ask you

626
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Go

627
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
What's wrong

628
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
What are you doing

629
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Call Miss Xie

630
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
How to see her now

631
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Go back and rest

632
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
No

633
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
She is going to Shanghai tonight

634
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I can't talk this time

635
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
Don't know when to wait

636
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,600
I stayed up two nights to get that tea.

637
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Don't let my hard work go to waste.

638
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm fine. Let's go.

639
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,680
You stayed up all night again?

640
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,720
The doctor already told you to rest if you're not feeling well.

641
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,720
My cousin wants you to go to the clinic, but you won't go.

642
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,440
No, listen to me.

643
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,760
My cousin is right. This is gastrointestinal disease.

644
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,520
It means that you need to treat it well if you have symptoms.

645
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,000
What if it gets worse and you can't move?

646
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,720
Oh, are you cursing me?

647
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
I'm not cursing you.

648
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
I don't want to talk to you. You don't have to accompany me.

649
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,480
I'll go do the job myself.

650
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,480
Hey!

651
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,320
Tell me. Are you really not going to accompany me?

652
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,520
I'm not.

653
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,240
I'm just afraid that you'll be mad at me.

654
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,720
I'm mad. Who told you to be so loud?

655
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
I'm not.

656
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,400
My cousin knows about it. My mom doesn't.

657
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,480
I know. Are you concerned about me?

658
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,080
Let's go.

659
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,120
My cousin is so beautiful.

660
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,920
That's right. She's really beautiful.

661
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,520
You rarely wear like this.

662
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,720
That's right. You rarely wear like this.

663
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,320
I asked someone out for dinner, but they're not at home.

664
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,520
My cousin is a good match.

665
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,720
Do you know what a good match is?

666
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,120
In Korean dramas, the leading actresses are all like this.

667
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,520
Okay. We've been waiting for so long.

668
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,120
We've finally waited until today.

669
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,120
Wait a minute. Daughter, are you wearing too monotonously?

670
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,320
It's just a meal. Don't exaggerate it.

671
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,720
Also, your makeup is too light.

672
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,320
Make it thicker.

673
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,720
No need.

674
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,920
She likes you. She likes you no matter what.

675
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,120
Little Sister, just be yourself.

676
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,920
Little Sister, fighting!

677
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,320
I'll go eat then.

678
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,720
Hello?

679
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Mr. Wang?

680
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,120
Yes.

681
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,920
We're in the basement now.

682
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,720
We'll be there in about five minutes.

683
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Hello, Mr. Wang?

684
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,520
Yes.

685
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,720
Jia Jun, Jia Jun.

686
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,920
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.

687
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,720
Yes. I'll call you again. I'm sorry.

688
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,520
Hello?

689
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Si Jin.

690
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,720
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,920
Hello?

692
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,120
Si Jin, I'm sorry. I'm going to the emergency room. Thank you.

693
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,720
Hey, what did you say?

694
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Give me your phone. I'll be fine in a bit.

695
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
You're so stupid. You're still saying you're fine?

696
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,520
Work is more important than health.

697
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,720
I'm going to the hospital now.

698
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm not being accused of having surgery.

699
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm not going.

700
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
How about this? I've thought of something.

701
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,320
I'll take you to my cousin, okay?

702
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,520
Anyway, I'm going to see Miss Xie first.

703
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,920
She's leaving soon.

704
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Ji Ji, I also hope you can go.

705
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,720
But how long can you last?

706
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,520
Do you hope that you won't be able to do anything in the future?

707
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,520
Si Jin, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

708
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,920
We're going to Shen Shui Bu Yuan Zhou Street, Wei Ming Hospital. Thank you.

709
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,120
He's dressed so well.

710
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,520
It seems that he has a breakthrough with Rachel.

711
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,520
What? The restaurant's requirements are to dress more formally.

712
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
What does it have to do with the restaurant?

713
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,120
You're so handsome.

714
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,720
Rachel definitely won't be able to escape.

715
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,520
I'm only asking because your old man is always with you.

716
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,720
You've already learned how to talk back.

717
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,320
What are you saying? It's almost time.

718
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,520
Okay, no need to be angry.

719
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Anyway, I'm full of confidence.

720
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm ready to set off.

721
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,320
You guys can go and play by yourselves.

722
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,920
Don't worry.

723
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
You have to hurry up. Don't be late for your first date.

724
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,120
It's not good.

725
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,920
Did you spray perfume?

726
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
You're still using this one.

727
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,120
How many times have I told you to change it?

728
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,720
I'm getting off the car. I'm going up now.

729
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,120
It's so early. I'm just about to leave.

730
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,120
You're late for the date.

731
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
You'll be done if you're late.

732
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Sir, sir, I'll be there in 15 minutes.

733
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,720
Jiaxun, what's wrong?

734
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
We're here to see you.

735
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
My sister suddenly feels unwell and can't breathe.

736
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,920
Can you help her?

737
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,320
Sure, go in first.

738
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,920
Okay, thank you, driver. I'll do it.

739
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,920
Thank you.

740
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm reading the menu.

741
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,720
I'm so tired.

742
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,720
Okay, now, like me,

743
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,520
you have to hold your fist.

744
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,920
The side bends will actually prevent your pulse

745
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,320
and the blood circulation of the pancreas.

746
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,520
It will make you difficult to breathe and muscle fatigue.

747
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,920
I'll use acupuncture to help you.

748
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,920
You're way too late. You're not here yet.

749
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,920
Where are you now?

750
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
After the acupuncture,

751
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:38,320
I'll use a three-way

752
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,720
acupuncture.

753
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,320
What's wrong with you?

754
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm in the hospital.

755
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
I want to see you.

756
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,720
I'll go to the hospital.

757
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,920
Okay, I'll go.

758
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,120
Okay, I'll go.

759
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,520
I'll go.

760
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,920
I'll go.

761
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,520
Okay, I'll go.

762
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
I'll go.

763
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,720
I'll go.

764
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
I'll go.

765
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,120
I'll go.

766
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,320
I'll go.

767
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I'll go.

768
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,720
By the way, Cousin, I want to ask,

769
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,120
is Ji Ji only going to come to you

770
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
without an operation?

771
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,920
I need to see her medical report

772
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,120
and X-ray first,

773
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,320
then I can answer you.

774
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,920
Okay.

775
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,520
I'll show you next time.

776
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,320
Cousin,

777
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,520
you're back so soon.

778
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
Did you eat anything?

779
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
What did you eat?

780
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,320
Oh no, I don't remember.

781
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
I've called 18 times.

782
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,520
What are you doing?

783
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,720
She waited for more than two hours.

784
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Call her.

785
00:36:38,220 --> 00:37:04,440
Then just receive what you've

786
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,040
Haiclick

787
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,280
Qianna

788
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,160
this

789
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,120
What happened

790
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Dear

791
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
Senior Li

792
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,760
What's so important

793
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,080
You have big problems

794
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,000
Nothing

795
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,000
Don't worry

796
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,280
I will sing

797
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,800
Hello

798
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,840
Senior Li

799
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,240
Your father sent worked on

800
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
abilities

801
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,520
I understand

802
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,200
Really

803
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,400
It must be Deng Shikeng.

804
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,920
It's not strange.

805
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,760
Deng Shikeng has always been against A Min.

806
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,720
It's such a big deal.

807
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,440
It's because I listened to you.

808
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
I have to use money to stop Mr. Li.

809
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,400
It's me and you are too stupid.

810
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,280
It's okay now.

811
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,840
If you're not stupid,

812
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,200
you want me to do that on purpose.

813
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,760
I don't understand what you mean.

814
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,560
I gave your photo to Mrs. Li.

815
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,760
Mrs. Li showed it to Mr. Li in the chicken-stall room.

816
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
Mr. Li said you gave him 200,000.

817
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,840
Since you know everything,

818
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,000
what do you want me to say?

819
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,040
You want me to apologize?

820
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,680
I don't understand.

821
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,320
You know Deng Shikeng is a scumbag.

822
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,000
Why do you still want to help him

823
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,200
to hurt my brother and Rachel?

824
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,120
I know Deng Shikeng is a scumbag.

825
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,720
But I'm not a good person.

826
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,520
I only know Luo Yingcheng has it.

827
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,400
If I don't have it,

828
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,880
I won't let him live well.

829
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,920
I just take money to do things.

830
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,640
What's the problem?

831
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,680
I trust you.

832
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
I help you.

833
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
How can you treat me like this?

834
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,640
You don't like me.

835
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,440
But I think

836
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,000
I can still treat you as a friend.

837
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
But what do you treat me as now?

838
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,640
Condom.

839
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
Throw it away after use.

840
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,920
Yes.

841
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,440
I've been using you all the time.

842
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,280
Do you think I owe you?

843
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,720
OK.

844
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,200
You've always wanted this.

845
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
I'll return it to you.

846
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,000
Come and get it.

847
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,160
Don't you always want it?

848
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,400
I give it to you now.

849
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
I'll return it to you.

850
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll call you here to get it.

851
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,360
Do you hear me?

852
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,400
A'zu.

853
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,600
A'zu.

854
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,960
A'zu, don't scare me.

855
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,880
A'zu.

856
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Rachel.

857
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm sorry.

858
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,680
I was going out.

859
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,760
But Jia Jun brought Jingzhi here.

860
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,880
Jingzhi is very sick.

861
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,120
I have to deal with it immediately.

862
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,840
I'll forget everything when I'm busy.

863
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,960
I understand that you think the patient is the best.

864
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
But I've been waiting for you for three hours.

865
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,880
I have the right to be angry.

866
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,520
I'm very tired now.

867
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,600
I want to go home now.

868
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,400
No.

869
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,680
I made a mistake.

870
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,920
You should be angry.

871
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,200
But I have something to tell you tonight.

872
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,320
Can you listen to me first?

873
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,120
No.

874
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,040
Even if you're angry again,

875
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,480
even if it's not the best time now,

876
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
I don't want to miss it.

877
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I don't want to wait.

878
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,820
All right.

879
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
And do wait series on our future.

880
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,960
I'll go now.

881
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,240
See you.

882
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,040
Give aqui a

883
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,120
warm hug

884
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,440
Cool.

885
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,960
I have such a buddy.

886
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
I'm sorry.

888
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm sorry.

889
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm sorry.

890
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm sorry.

891
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
I'm sorry.

892
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
I'm sorry.

893
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
I'm sorry.

894
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm sorry.

895
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm sorry.

896
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I'm sorry.

897
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
I'm sorry.

898
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm sorry.

899
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
I'm sorry.

900
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I'm sorry.

901
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm sorry.

902
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I'm sorry.

903
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960
I'm sorry.

904
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
I'm sorry.

905
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
I'm sorry.

906
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
I'm sorry.

908
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
I'm sorry.

910
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

916
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm sorry.

917
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I'm sorry.

918
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm sorry.

919
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,900
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,980
I'm sorry.

921
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,140
I'm sorry.

923
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,960
I was wrong.

924
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,680
Don't show your regret.

925
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,920
I'm sorry.

926
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm sorry.
