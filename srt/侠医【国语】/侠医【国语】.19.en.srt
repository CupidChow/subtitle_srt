1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wang Yanai.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Does Rui Chuang have a autism?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She wears a pair of shoes every day.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you weren't so cowardly,

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would have solved her just now.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you crazy?

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you really going to kill her?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When I close my eyes,

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I remember how you pushed that stairs that day.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mr. Deng.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
According to the record,

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
from 2 a.m. to 2.45 p.m.,

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you have been in the private ward

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
on the third floor of Cihan Hospital,

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
right?

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Did my son and I go to see my sister?

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You and your son, Mr. Deng Shikeng,

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
did you have a fight in your room?

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My aunt's son, Lin Weiming,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
wants to use his mother's custody rights

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
to manipulate aunt's shares in the company.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know,

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
my cousin and I are business rivals.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I suggest my dad

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to steal aunt's custody rights from my cousin.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But the old people often say

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the most important thing for a family is to be respected.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That day, I went to see my mother

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
with Jingzhi and Jiajun

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and with my mother with my mother's card.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I saw someone arguing.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It was two men.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Someone said

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
you mentioned your son

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
pushing Mrs. Deng Shuhuan down the stairs.

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is that true?

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't say that.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's definitely not true.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Push down the stairs?

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who did this on purpose?

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That day,

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
there was a woman standing there in a strange way.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Was it her?

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Miss Luo, can you make it clear

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
who those two men are?

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why did they argue

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and involve Deng Shuhuan?

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I won't answer that question.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I won't answer.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sorry, my sister has autism.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
She expresses differently from others.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She wants to see Deng Litu and Deng Shikeng

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
in the room.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Were you there that day?

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I wasn't.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want to ask you.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
On the 12th of this month,

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the day when Deng Shuhuan was found

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and fainted in the park,

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
did you see her?

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That day?

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But my dad asked my aunt

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
to talk about business operations.

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't follow her.

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's wrong?

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I did go to my sister to find her.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But she said she wasn't there.

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I left.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I haven't seen her.

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're accused of serious injury.

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't find the surveillance video.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Only the testimony of the witness.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We need to ensure

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the rights of all the victims.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Our investigation

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
must be conducted according to the law.

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Lin Weiming

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
has taken a document

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
that's not legally valid

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to interfere with our operation.

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you think it's possible

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that she's trying to blackmail

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
her girlfriend's sister

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and lie to us

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
so that we can't get

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the right to protect her?

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know,

121
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
a autistic girl

122
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
won't lie to others.

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm afraid she'll be cheated.

124
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sister, have something to eat.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sister,

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
do you think the police don't believe me?

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Am I a bad fighter?

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, sister.

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You've done a good job.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
They just want to know more details

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and help us find the truth as soon as possible.

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The police said

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
they want me to see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

134
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What will they ask?

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll tell the police

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
not to see a psychiatrist tomorrow.

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Really?

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really not to see a psychiatrist?

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ami,

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm a little nervous today,

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so I didn't do very well.

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why don't you let her rest for a few more days

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and see if she can make another report?

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No need.

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't want Yingying

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to be under the pressure

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
of being questioned and being questioned in the court.

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Besides,

149
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
she only heard the teacher pushing her down the stairs.

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
She has no evidence.

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's impossible to sue her.

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can.

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I really want to help you.

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't let those two bad guys go.

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't.

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you.

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know you want to help,

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but your health is a priority for me.

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Besides,

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I believe in God.

161
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Even without your testimony,

162
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
those bad guys can't escape.

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ami,

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
are you sure you want to do this?

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sister,

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
let's wait for the nanny to wake up

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and let her tell us what happened.

168
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We can't let the bad guys escape.

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't ask.

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It must be Ami who framed you with that girl.

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I know.

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
She wants you to go to her mother's grave.

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She's more vicious than a snake.

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you staring at your son?

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What did you tell the police?

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What?

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The police asked me

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if I went to see her on the day of my sister's accident.

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You said it, right?

180
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did the nanny tell the truth?

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She even knew I went to see Tan Gongshi.

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Who else would it be if it wasn't you?

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You want them to suspect me?

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What are you looking at?

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're fine now.

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you so scared?

187
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're fine now

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
because of my sister's conscience.

190
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't tell the police.

191
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why did you push my sister down the stairs?

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Son,

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
you did it.

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, mom.

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She forced me to do it.

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That day,

197
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
my aunt didn't even want to help us pay off the debt.

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
She threatened us

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and said she would give her shares to my cousin.

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was just careless.

201
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I didn't mean to do it.

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I regret it.

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you regret it?

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The police haven't sued you yet.

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Leave now.

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How?

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If I leave,

208
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll tell everyone that I have a guilty conscience.

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's fine if we sell the factory.

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You want to sell the factory before you leave?

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please help persuade my son.

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We can't be lucky anymore.

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I just want to help us.

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's why I did it.

215
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You want me to run away.

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you want me to be a fugitive forever

217
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and escape for the crime?

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How can you say that?

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're both so stubborn.

220
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't control you.

221
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing?

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Stop it.

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm here to see my sister.

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're so kind.

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are you afraid that your aunt will wake up

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and report your bad deeds?

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So you hurt her without any fear?

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How can you think that?

229
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She's my sister.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
How can I hurt my own sister?

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What bad things have you done?

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know it very well.

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
My sister won't lie.

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're so arrogant.

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Fine.

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can think whatever you want.

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll only love you here.

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Uncle.

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you really have a conscience,

241
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
tell us the truth.

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You chose to lie to us.

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you think you can help Shi Kang?

244
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The more you cover for him,

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
he'll become more and more heartbroken.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're my sister.

247
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I hope you can be safe and sound.

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Please take good care of her.

249
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Actually, your team members

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
were satisfied with the pharmaceutical factory.

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And now the price

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
is one percent lower than the market price.

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a great opportunity.

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Young Master Kang.

255
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't say that your pharmaceutical factory is bad.

256
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's just that I'm worried that

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
they'll take away the money.

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You don't have to worry about Lin Weiming.

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We have a rule.

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My dad is the only one

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
who can run the shareholder rights.

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No one can stop our business.

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Really?

264
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But I know that your cousin

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
has found a lawyer to take action.

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The court can't give the shares of my aunt

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to competitors who are competing with us.

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But if you're really worried

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that you can pay some deposit first,

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
when the result of the trial comes out,

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
then...

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Who?

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When will you buy it?

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It depends on my mood.

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Where's the beauty

276
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
who sold with you before?

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She didn't come today.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you familiar with her?

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You mean Natalie?

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Of course.

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We're all smart.

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You should know what I'm talking about.

283
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I like to cooperate with people who are sincere.

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When it comes to business,

285
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm happy.

286
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If I'm in a good mood,

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm a good talker.

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.

289
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll arrange it for you.

290
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Good. Smart.

291
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's the matter with you?

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm here to see you.

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm here to see you.

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You asked me out again.

295
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What's the matter?

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're so free.

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I saw my sister's phone call.

298
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I saw your call log with her.

299
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I asked her if you were so familiar with her.

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm familiar with her.

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Do I need your approval to be her friend?

302
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're her friend?

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Or you want her to be a fool?

304
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're so eager to win her trust.

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're so straightforward.

306
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What do you want to say?

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Be straightforward.

308
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
My sister wanted to avoid the pit of the Deng's stone pit.

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Then she got your call.

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Deng's stone pit went to her.

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then she got your call.

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Isn't it a coincidence?

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait.

314
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Deng's stone pit just asked me

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
if you had a sister who liked to wear shiny shoes.

316
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My sister saw something she shouldn't have seen in the hospital.

317
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Deng's stone pit was afraid that bad things would be exposed.

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So he went crazy to find my sister.

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If it weren't for me and A-Ming

320
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
not finding my sister sooner,

321
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
if Deng's stone pit took her away,

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
how could you return a sister to me?

323
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Whether you believe it or not,

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I really don't know what Deng's stone pit was looking for your sister for.

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't even know that she wanted to hurt Yingying.

326
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's possible that your aunt was pushed down the stairs

327
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
because she was against selling the factory.

328
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Now she's unconscious and doesn't know if she can wake up in the hospital.

329
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That person dares to do anything to achieve her goal.

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you still have a little conscience,

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
please don't continue to help her.

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I admitted that I helped her find a buyer and buy a factory.

333
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I did it to help you.

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But in the end, I told her the truth and helped you.

335
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But I didn't expect that she would push my aunt down the stairs.

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't expect that she would hurt Yingying.

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay.

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're saying that you don't know anything?

339
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then please,

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
next time when Deng's stone pit looks for you,

341
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
think about it.

342
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
She's crazy and can do anything.

343
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Please think about it.

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay.

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Receiving the Hurricane

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Auntie,vet you took two days of acupuncture.

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Your face is getting better.

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Four.

349
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Fortunately, Dr Zhong received a request from us regarding treatment work.

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
To make your bueno-good treatment for your aunt,

351
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
Can you now realease the Holy Relic of Consultant Zhongxi?

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hello?

353
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Uncle applied for my mother's custody.

354
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,840
There's a hearing next week.

355
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,240
He and I are going to attend.

356
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,960
We need to explain to the judge

357
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,520
the reason for the custody.

358
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,600
He's crazy.

359
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,520
He doesn't have the right to

360
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,240
steal the custody of his mother with your son.

361
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,080
I think they don't plan to rob.

362
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,480
They just want to use legal procedures to buy time

363
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,920
to sell the assets under Ren Yuan Ming.

364
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
I told you, brother.

365
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,800
Why did you let Rachel's sister withdraw the charge?

366
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
She's been bullied.

367
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,800
I've asked the lawyer.

368
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,320
Even if Ying Ying really heard

369
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,920
that Shikeng pushed his mother down the stairs,

370
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,360
it would only be a rumour.

371
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,080
The court won't accept it.

372
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
What do you mean?

373
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,680
The law can't handle them.

374
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,120
Is there any justice?

375
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,200
The court won't accept it.

376
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
Is there any justice?

377
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,600
The court won't accept it.

378
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Is there any justice?

379
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
The court won't accept it.

380
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200

The court won't accept it.

382
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Is there any justice?

383
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
The court won't accept it.

384
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Is there any justice?

385
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
The court won't accept it.

386
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Is there any justice?

387
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
The court won't accept it.

388
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Is there any justice?

389
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
The court won't accept it.

390
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
The court won't accept it.

391
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Is there any justice?

392
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
The court won't accept it.

393
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Is there any justice?

394
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The court won't accept it.

395
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Is there any justice?

396
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
The court won't accept it.

397
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Is there any justice?

398
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
The court won't accept it.

399
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Is there any justice?

400
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
The court won't accept it.

401
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Is there any justice?

402
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
The court won't accept it.

403
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Is there any justice?

404
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,680
«Slowly»

405
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,320
where?

406
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,280
Nós Ta тебя Wid밤

407
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,200
S disguised as a Vice President,

408
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,840
Yehhh...

409
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,480
President Shi!

410
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,140
It's that fast radiation attack man.

411
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,640
Who's giving him this torture?

412
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Not the whole shaking room.

413
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,860
The entire tips room

414
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
No need, drink it yourself.

415
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
To be honest,

416
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
if that Uncle Bo is in trouble,

417
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
I have some clients with money.

418
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
I'll send you the information.

419
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Don't be so anxious.

420
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Uncle Bo didn't say he wouldn't buy it.

421
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
He added a condition.

422
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
What condition?

423
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,860
He said you have to sleep with him for a night

424
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,860
before he's willing to buy my factory.

425
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,860
You're the best at making fun of the old man.

426
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
You're sick. I won't do it.

427
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
You've done it before.

428
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
How about this?

429
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
Give me double the money.

430
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
I'll give you a head.

431
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
I'll say it for the last time.

432
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
I won't do it.

433
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,860
What are you doing? Let go.

434
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
It's so hard to ask you to be with a rich man.

435
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
You've already been with my dad.

436
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
You're so arrogant.

437
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Don't pretend to be arrogant.

438
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
You're a bedside maid.

439
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
You bastard.

440
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
You bastard.

441
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
That's enough.

442
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm sorry.

443
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
You bastard.

444
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

445
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Stop fighting.

446
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
That's enough.

447
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
She forced you to sleep with her client.

448
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
You let her go.

449
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
You crazy dog.

450
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
I'll sue you for trespassing.

451
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
You can go to jail.

452
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Don't be so anxious.

453
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Come on.

454
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
I'll solve the problem for you.

455
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Let's go.

456
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Why are you still helping her?

457
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Let's go.

458
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
Let's go.

459
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
Here he comes.

460
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,860
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

461
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
You asked me to beat him to death.

462
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
You beat him to death.

463
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
Don't you have to be responsible?

464
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
I don't want you to go to jail.

465
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,860
The teacher was pushed down the stairs by that loser.

466
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
He did so many bad things.

467
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
If God doesn't punish him,

468
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
I'll punish him.

469
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
I know.

470
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
But why don't you learn to be smart?

471
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
He hit his head with a smoke bomb last time.

472
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
You've been hit by him once.

473
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
This time it's like this again.

474
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
You're so stupid.

475
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,860
I'll go to jail.

476
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,860
I just want him to tell me

477
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
what bad things he's done.

478
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Then we'll have evidence.

479
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
So you were following me just now.

480
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,860
But do you think you can help your brother?

481
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
It's better than nothing.

482
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,860
I said I'd just forget it.

483
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
I'm different from you.

484
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm different from you.

485
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
I use my brain.

486
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
He treated me like that.

487
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
I won't let him go.

488
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
But that's good.

489
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
I'm sober now.

490
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Don't worry.

491
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
I'm sober now.

492
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
I won't help him anymore.

493
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I'm relieved to hear that.

494
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I'm relieved to die.

495
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Why did you say that?

496
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,860
I asked you many times.

497
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
You didn't tell me what the disease was.

498
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,860
Is there something wrong?

499
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Just a metaphor.

500
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Why are you so nervous?

501
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
How can I not be nervous?

502
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,860
Isn't this the first time you said that?

503
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,860
Don't hide it from me, Liang Yanzu.

504
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Tell me, okay?

505
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
I...

506
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
I have a brain injury.

507
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I don't have much time left.

508
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
I want to use this time

509
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,860
to do something for my brother and you.

510
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
So I'll be more valuable.

511
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Brother, I didn't expect you to come.

512
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,860
You pretend not to care.

513
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,860
But you still care about your aunt's shares.

514
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
I gave in and left the company

515
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
because my dad and I thought

516
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
we could trust you to get the job.

517
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Now,

518
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
after I enter the court,

519
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,860
I won't care about anything else.

520
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,860
I'll get the job back no matter what.

521
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
You're so stupid.

522
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
You sold your aunt and came to steal her custody.

523
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,860
I've never seen a shameless person like you.

524
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Watch your mouth.

525
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Hello?

526
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
The police said I was innocent.

527
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Thank you. I'll go now.

528
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Today's phone call can be cancelled.

529
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,860
My mom woke up when the hospital called.

530
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Mom.

531
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Doctor, how is my mom?

532
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Ms. De is stable for the time being.

533
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Her brain function is normal.

534
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
Her brain function is normal.

535
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
We'll keep an eye on her.

536
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
Thank you, doctor.

537
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Mom, how are you?

538
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm fine.

539
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
I'm fine.

540
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,860
I'm fine.

541
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
I'm fine.

542
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm fine.

543
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm fine.

544
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,860
I'm so tired.

545
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,860
It's like I had a long dream.

546
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,860
How long have I been unconscious?

547
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,860
You've been unconscious for a whole week.

548
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,860
It's good that you're safe.

549
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,860
Aunt,

550
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,860
these paper cranes are my sister and aunt's new clothes.

551
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,860
A Min asked the doctor here for help.

552
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,860
I've been helping you for a long time.

553
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Now that you're awake,

554
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
you've done a lot for us.

555
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,860
I'm so disappointed that you're all so good to me.

556
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,860
I'm so disappointed that you're all so good to me.

557
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,860
I'm just saying.

558
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
Now that you're awake,

559
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
I can't deny it.

560
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm unconscious?

561
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
Is it related to Ah Keng?

562
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,860
What happened?

563
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,860
I...

564
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,860
I don't remember anything.

565
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Mom, you really don't remember anything?

566
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Deng Shikeng pushed you down the stairs

567
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,860
and made you unconscious and go to the hospital.

568
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Ah Keng pushed me down the stairs?

569
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Why can't I remember anything?

570
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
You don't remember anything?

571
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
Deng Shikeng is fine, right?

572
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,860
The most important thing is that I'm awake.

573
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Mom, you just woke up.

574
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,860
You need to rest. It's okay.

575
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Hello, Sister.

576
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Ah Tu, I'm awake.

577
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I know.

578
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Ming told me this morning.

579
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,860
I'm relieved that you're fine.

580
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,860
I heard from Ah Ming that

581
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,860
Ah Keng pushed me down the stairs

582
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,860
and made me unconscious.

583
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
But I don't remember anything.

584
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,860
I don't remember anything.

585
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,860
But I don't remember anything.

586
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Is it true?

587
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
You...

588
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
You really don't remember?

589
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Yes.

590
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,860
I just knew that I was awake and was in the hospital.

591
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,860
The doctor said it was a trauma or amnesia.

592
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Ah Tu, what happened?

593
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Sister, I promise you.

594
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,860
I won't do Ren Yuan's business anymore.

595
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,860
If there's anything, I'll leave it to Ah Ming.

596
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Don't ask me, okay?

597
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,860
It's not that I won't ask you.

598
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,860
It's just that it never happened.

599
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,860
I really hope to hear you explain it to me.

600
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
We're a family.

601
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
Would I hurt you?

602
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Would I make things difficult for you and Ah Keng?

603
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
So you won't say anything?

604
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Are you planning to not see me again?

605
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
I'll bring Henry to explain it to you.

606
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Who are you calling?

607
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Your auntie, Da Lan.

608
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Hey!

609
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,860
What did she say to you?

610
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,860
She told me to turn myself in.

611
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,860
Go to the hospital with me and apologize to my sister.

612
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Apologize for what?

613
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Will she let us off?

614
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
My sister told me that

615
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,860
after she woke up, she didn't remember why she went down the stairs.

616
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,860
So if we go to the bathroom to investigate this mistake,

617
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
she'll definitely think that we're a family

618
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
and won't see you as her son.

619
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,860
It's good that she doesn't remember.

620
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Why do you have to go to the bathroom to remind her?

621
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Are you crazy?

622
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
What if she's short-lived?

623
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
What if she suddenly remembered

624
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
why you forced her to sign the agreement

625
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
and pushed her down the stairs?

626
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
Then things wouldn't be that easy.

627
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
Even if my auntie let us off,

628
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
Ling Wei Ming wouldn't do it.

629
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
You just want to help yourself.

630
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,860
Do you want me to be your brother?

631
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,860
Have you ever thought about me?

632
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,860
Do you want me to go to jail?

633
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
I want you to apologize.

634
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
I'm helping you and your son.

635
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Don't say that I'm pushing you to death.

636
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
What are you apologizing for?

637
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,860
You want your son to be a bad person?

638
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,860
It's all your fault.

639
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,860
You've spoiled your son so much.

640
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,860
You almost killed your auntie.

641
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
She didn't even apologize.

642
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
She's better than you.

643
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
She only knows how to scold her son.

644
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
I'll stop you.

645
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Dad, how about this?

646
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,860
You said that your auntie was so generous.

647
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
You go and tell her.

648
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,860
You said that you pushed her down the stairs.

649
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,860
She doesn't remember anyway.

650
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,860
Let's see if she'll forgive you.

651
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
See if she'll forgive you.

652
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,860
So you've got a plan.

653
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
You've got a plan.

654
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,860
If something goes wrong,

655
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
you'll make me the scapegoat.

656
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
You didn't treat me as your dad.

657
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
I've done so many things for you.

658
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,860
Can't you help me?

659
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,860
You can't even say that.

660
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,860
If you're not my son,

661
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
how can you be the general manager?

662
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
You bought a house with 30 million

663
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
just to make that woman go to bed.

664
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,860
You really made her go to the company.

665
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
If I hadn't solved this for you,

666
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
you would have been in jail.

667
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
You're in big trouble.

668
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,860
Is she telling the truth?

669
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,860
No wonder you bought that house.

670
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,860
You even pushed me out.

671
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
You even made me a bad person

672
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
to coax your sister.

673
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
So you're trying to have fun

674
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
with the real estate agent.

675
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
It's okay.

676
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Forget it.

677
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860
I think dad knows his mistake.

678
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
If he's willing to tell aunt

679
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,860
that he pushed aunt down the stairs,

680
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
please forgive him.

681
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Okay.

682
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
Tell your sister that you did it.

683
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Or I'll divorce you.

684
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Are you crazy?

685
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
Because I want to marry you.

686
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
Or I'll see your family is rich.

687
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
I won't see you as a bitch.

688
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
Go to the mirror.

689
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
If I don't go out to have fun,

690
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I'll be in a bad mood.

691
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Do you hear me?

692
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
I'll be in a bad mood.

693
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Mom.

694
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
Mom.

695
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Mom.

696
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Dad.

697
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,860
Are you crazy?

698
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
I'm not.

699
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
You forced your mom to call dad to take the blame.

700
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,860
You caused all these.

701
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
I will report to the police station after this

702
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,220
See how long you can be arrogant

703
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
Mom, you just woke up

704
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Your skin is weak

705
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
I made some porridge for you

706
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
And lotus seed egg tea for you

707
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
As a night snack

708
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,860
A Min

709
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
I called A Tu

710
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,860
He said he would bring A Keng here

711
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
To tell me the truth

712
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
What else can they say

713
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
You woke up and you were afraid of the police

714
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
So you came to save you

715
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Madam, don't be soft

716
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
I think A Tu is really guilty

717
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
If they are willing to

718
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Admit their mistakes

719
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Then forget it

720
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
They are family

721
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Madam, I didn't mean you

722
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
But you should remember

723
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
The loser pushed you down the stairs

724
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
And you almost died

725
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Did I call A Tu

726
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,860
To call the police to arrest my son

727
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,860
After all, he is my brother

728
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
I really can't bear it

729
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,860
Mom, maybe uncle is really guilty

730
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,860
But as for A Keng

731
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,860
I don't believe it

732
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Anyway

733
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
We will talk about it when they come

734
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
What time did you say they would come

735
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
He said he would come soon

736
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Why hasn't he arrived yet

737
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Dad

738
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Dad

739
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Mom

740
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
Mom

741
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
Dad

742
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
The number you have dialed

743
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Is not available at the moment

744
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Please call again later

745
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
Uncle didn't answer the phone

746
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,860
I guessed they didn't come to admit their mistakes

747
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
They must be stalling for time

748
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,860
And they are going to run away

749
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,860
Hurry up

750
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Hello, what is it

751
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Henry, I have found the buyer for you

752
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
He is very refreshing

753
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
I will pay ten million

754
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
He will agree immediately

755
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
10 million?

756
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,100
Is she really that easy?

757
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,180
Yes.

758
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,300
She almost wants to pay the deposit right now.

759
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Sign the temporary contract tonight.

760
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,100
You can pay the deposit tomorrow.

761
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,580
Tonight?

762
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,900
It's so late. Can you get it done?

763
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,820
I've prepared the documents.

764
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,900
See if you're free.

765
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,540
How much is the deposit?

766
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,260
It's a quarter of the price.

767
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,500
Okay.

768
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,220
I'll be there right now.

769
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,980
See you at the same place.

770
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,060
Look at this customer.

771
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,420
He's so easy to talk to.

772
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,060
He's not like that guy who's so active and has so many conditions.

773
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
He's a bit of a troublemaker.

774
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,220
Sign it tomorrow.

775
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,540
Sign it right now.

776
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
Don't worry.

777
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,020
I'm anxious just like you are.

778
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,420
If you hadn't told me to give me so much money,

779
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,780
I wouldn't have been so active.

780
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,180
I owe you money.

781
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,900
Also, I won't take the cheque this time.

782
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,180
You want the other party to deposit the money in my account.

783
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,380
Mr. Deng.

784
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:50,060
This account number isn't from the local bank.

785
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,780
It's an overseas account. What's wrong?

786
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,140
You're so funny.

787
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,260
Selling drugs is like washing money.

788
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,700
Don't talk nonsense when you've received the deposit.

789
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,540
Okay.

790
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,860
I'll ask the customer first.

791
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,740
Didn't you say the customer is easy to talk to?

792
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,500
You have to ask if he's easy to talk to.

793
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
You have to ask if he's easy to talk to.

794
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,100
This is the company's rule.

795
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,220
Otherwise, I'll be fired and you'll raise me.

796
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Enough.

797
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,700
Hurry up.

798
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,500
Okay.

799
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,380
You called me before

800
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,220
to ask where Luo Yingchen is.

801
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,260
What are you doing?

802
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,220
Why do you ask this?

803
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,620
Luo Yingchen said he found the call record.

804
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,820
He said you wanted to deal with his sister.

805
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,580
I don't know what happened.

806
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,740
But I helped you carry a black pot.

807
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,060
Now you should explain to me.

808
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,860
Luo Yingchen said

809
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,380
his sister heard something she shouldn't have.

810
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,420
What did she hear?

811
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,500
You didn't say that to my sister.

812
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,340
itt it easy to lose your friends

813
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,020
or text your sister?

814
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,940
You said your sister would draw you to sell the property.

815
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,860
Now you speak itmeden?

816
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,260
You ran away from here just because it's your sister.

817
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,900
I didn't say I ran away from here.

818
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,540
Then you killed your sister.

819
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,700
When can you reply?

820
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,140
Hurry up.

821
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,420
Okay.

822
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,620
It doesn't look like no one.

823
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,140
They must be hiding from us.

824
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,860
So bright.

825
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,180
How are you?

826
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,260
Uncle.

827
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,380
Uncle.

828
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,260
Drive the ambulance.

829
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,220
Uncle.

830
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,340
Uncle.

831
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,420
Hello, Wei.

832
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,540
What?

833
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,740
No boat?

834
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,180
The faster the better.

835
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,140
What's wrong?

836
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,620
Why are you in a hurry?

837
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,340
Are you really going to run away?

838
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,860
It's none of your business.

839
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,540
Do what you should do.

840
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,740
Ming, what's wrong?

841
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,940
Wei.

842
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,780
I went to uncle's house with A'zu.

843
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,540
Uncle was stabbed.

844
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,580
He's bleeding.

845
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,780
His aunt fainted.

846
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,540
They were taken to the hospital.

847
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,140
How did he get hurt?

848
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,260
I don't know.

849
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,700
But we've called the police.

850
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,380
The police are looking for Shi Keng.

851
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,180
No wonder he's running away.

852
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,700
Why?

853
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,380
I won't tell you now.

854
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,660
I'll explain later.

855
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,460
Rachel.

856
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,180
Don't ask.

857
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,140
Leave now.

858
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,100
Ming called me.

859
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,700
He said Deng Litu was stabbed.

860
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,620
The police suspect it's Shi Keng.

861
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,780
I know you're busy.

862
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,300
I have news for you.

863
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,940
I'll give you a break today.

864
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Didn't they tell you there were a lot of ride-hours?

865
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,980
You can go out first.

866
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,140
Hi.

867
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,860

868
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,100
Hello, aye?

869
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,540
Many students has met me.

870
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm Li Yuzheng.

871
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
You're my psychiatrist.

872
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,940
I'll let you pay.

873
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,060
What's the point?

874
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,420
What?

875
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,580
There areота students pay for the traditional ליתu with the money at the age of two.

876
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,260
It doesn't matter for the college.

877
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,980
ten relaxed

878
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Let go of me.

879
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
You even recorded it.

880
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
You bitch.

881
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
Let go of me.

882
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Let go of me.

883
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
You didn't even let your father go.

884
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,980
You are not human at all.

885
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
If the police are looking for you,

886
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,980
you can't escape.

887
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,980
It's not my fault.

888
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
It's you people

889
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
who made me like this.

890
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
You go to die.

891
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,980
You bitch.

892
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
Come on.

893
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Come on.

894
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Hurry up.

895
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
Let's go.

896
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Don't let them go.

897
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
Get in the car.

898
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Go.

899
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Deng Shikeng is really crazy.

900
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,980
He even wanted to kill his father.

901
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,980
It's a pity that he didn't protect Lu Yinbi.

902
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,980
He ruined it.

903
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
It's a pity.

904
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
It's okay.

905
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
The most important thing is that you are fine.

906
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
He didn't chase after him.

907
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I think so.

908
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
A'min.

909
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Rui Cheng.

910
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Why did you call me just now?

911
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
Where are you now?

912
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
I'm with my father now.

913
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Deng Shikeng has just admitted it himself.

914
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,980
It's him.

915
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,980
He admitted that he stabbed his father.

916
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Let's go.

917
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
The fat in your thigh

918
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
is often caused by stress.

919
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,980
The hormones are lost.

920
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
This affects the digestive function of the stomach.

921
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,980
The mouth opens and closes.

922
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,980
The weight of the food must be balanced.

923
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,980
In addition to the food that can be used to cool down and fry,

924
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,980
we should eat fruits that contain plant-based enzyme.

925
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,980
And food can improve digestive function.

926
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,980
Naturally, we can improve the problem of obesity.

927
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,980
The weight of the food must be balanced.

928
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,980
In addition to the food that can be used to cool down and fry,

929
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,980
we should eat fruits that contain plant-based enzyme.

930
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,980
And food can improve digestive function.

931
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,980
