1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Dr. Lin.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're too narrow-minded.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I haven't finished my work yet.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to stay here.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you still keep working,

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I won't know how to deal with you.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm all right if you stay here.

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you see Dr. Lin,

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll let you back.

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,200
I am indeed a registered Chinese doctor.

57
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
And I am still a newbie.

58
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
But don't just think about the clinic.

59
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Because you are always the boss of Mai Mai Tong.

60
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,600
After your sister finished reading, you won't go back with her.

61
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Instead, you will stay and complain that I am not working.

62
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,000
I dare not. It's because I am not self-disciplined.

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I took over all of Helen's work.

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
All of the marketing, sales, PR, logistics,

65
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
I am doing all of them by myself.

66
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,200
I am afraid that I will make any mistakes.

67
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,200
They told me that you are very fast.

68
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,800
It's not hard to take over.

69
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,400
They all praise you.

70
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I am just being stubborn.

71
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,600
You have time to come back and host the big show.

72
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,200
What Mai Mai Tong said is all your effort.

73
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
I am wearing the white crown because of you.

74
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,800
So I am very assured to hand over Mai Mai Tong to you.

75
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Hand over to me?

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,800
Right now, I have something more important to do.

77
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
I am sorry.

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I am sorry.

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
I am sorry.

80
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I am sorry.

81
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
I am sorry.

82
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
I am sorry.

83
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I am sorry.

84
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
I am sorry.

85
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
I am sorry.

86
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I am sorry.

87
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I am sorry.

88
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
I am sorry.

89
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I am sorry.

90
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I am sorry.

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Good morning, Dr. Lin.

92
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Good morning.

93
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
This is Mr. Wang.

94
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
This is my first time here.

95
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
I have already put the information in the computer.

96
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Is this quality good?

97
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It looks like it's a liver failure and a kidney failure.

98
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
If you take it slowly, the situation will get better.

99
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Doctor, I want to lose weight.

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Losing weight will definitely make you healthier.

101
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
If you take heavy medicine, it will help you to get rid of the phlegm.

102
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
But if you don't control your diet, it will not work.

103
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I have some physiological problems.

104
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
My girlfriend is not very satisfied with me.

105
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
You can't tolerate the phlegm.

106
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
So you have to add some acupuncture.

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
It can help you to get rid of the phlegm.

108
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
The list of the medicine stores has been arranged according to the route.

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
It's okay.

110
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
We can just follow the route.

111
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Because Helen quit her job, you have to take over the job.

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I understand.

113
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
But it's not necessary to run around the Hong Kong and Jiuxin.

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You are very brave.

115
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Now we are just looking for the medicine stores that paid the commission.

116
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Actually, you are the executive director of the Ministry of Industry.

117
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
You have subordinates.

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
You can let them do it.

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
The most important thing is that I am a sales manager.

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I don't need to look for a store.

121
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Why do you ask me to come out?

122
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
You have to open a good head.

123
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Today is our new product.

124
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
The first day of the holiday.

125
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Of course we have to go there in person.

126
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
We have to see if the store is doing as instructed.

127
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Do you know how the product is arranged?

128
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
It will affect the sales effect.

129
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
You are like a boss.

130
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
What? Say it again.

131
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I said, no one will wear high heels when looking for a store.

132
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Then drive now.

133
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You drive well.

134
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Full speed ahead.

135
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
There are many stores.

136
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I am sorry.

137
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I am sorry.

138
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I am sorry.

139
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I am sorry.

140
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I am sorry.

141
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I am sorry.

142
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I am sorry.

143
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I am sorry.

144
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I am sorry.

145
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I am sorry.

146
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I am sorry.

147
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I am sorry.

148
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I am sorry.

149
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I am sorry.

150
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I am sorry.

151
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I am sorry.

152
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I am sorry.

153
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I am sorry.

154
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I am sorry.

155
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I am sorry.

156
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
I am sorry.

157
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
I am sorry.

158
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I am sorry.

159
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I am sorry.

160
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I am sorry.

161
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I am sorry.

162
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I am sorry.

163
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
I am sorry.

164
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I am sorry.

165
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I am sorry.

166
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I was wrong.

167
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I was wrong.

168
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I realize it.

169
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I get it.

170
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I realize it.

171
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I have learned it.

172
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
I have learned it.

173
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
What we have now is

174
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,200
general things.

175
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
We are notublic goods.

176
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,720
Who do we do

177
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,200
What we have now is

178
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
We are not public goods.

179
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,000
If we don't stop

180
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Then, might be

181
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
it's very important to keep it safe

182
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
out of danger

183
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,880
Come here.

184
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
Miss Chen woke up early this morning.

185
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
She's conscious.

186
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,440
Her brain is normal.

187
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
But she has a stroke.

188
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
She's talking slowly.

189
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
But her recovery index is good.

190
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,560
It's not a big problem to cooperate with the rehabilitation.

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Thank you, doctor.

192
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
Grandma, what do you think?

193
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
I just feel hungry.

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,440
No matter how long we've been lying down.

195
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,880
I know you're the most greedy.

196
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,200
So I made dumplings myself.

197
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,080
Wait a minute.

198
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,520
Those dumplings were still in the pot.

199
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
I think they're all broken.

200
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm such a waste.

201
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
I wanted to make dumplings myself.

202
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
And send them to you.

203
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Silly girl.

204
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,840
It'll be fine if you make more.

205
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,680
The doctor also said that

206
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,520
I can't eat solid food.

207
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,000
I need to eat something with fluid.

208
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,080
Okay.

209
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
I'll prepare some fluid for you.

210
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,280
You're the most important thing.

211
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,200
Look at you.

212
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,960
Recently,

213
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
you've been in a bad mood.

214
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
You must be tired every day

215
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,800
to visit your grandma.

216
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,920
No, I'm not.

217
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,640
Not at all.

218
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,240
The most important thing is that you're fine.

219
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Silly girl.

220
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Webster Un efter

221
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,400
Snow Prior.

222
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Did you get the floor heute?

223
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,840
Why are you here?

224
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
You She Night.

225
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
Right, you are...

226
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,040
She Night's manager, Miss Luo.

227
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Miss Luo, may I ask you a question?

228
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Boss, we just got our new products on the shelves.

229
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
You should at least put them in this position.

230
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
And why didn't you post our posters?

231
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,040
How can you put our products together with other brands?

232
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm sorry, I forgot.

233
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Now it's done.

234
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
It's the most basic.

235
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
You treat our goods like this.

236
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Why do we give you a real-time discount?

237
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Let's go, next one.

238
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,040
A'zuo, who is Miss Luo?

239
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
She's like a boss' wife.

240
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
She's better than a boss.

241
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Who is like you?

242
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
What should we do?

243
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
We can't just keep an eye on her.

244
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
We've made so many mistakes.

245
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes, we've made so many mistakes.

246
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Every store is like this.

247
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Let's go eat first.

248
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Of course we can't.

249
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
We have many stores to search.

250
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Today is very important.

251
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
I have a bread in my car.

252
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll share half of it with you later.

253
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Half?

254
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
It's a little bit harsh.

255
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
It hurts. Wait a minute.

256
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
What's wrong?

257
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
It hurts.

258
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Right?

259
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
How can you wear high heels in a store?

260
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Look, you're hurting yourself now.

261
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm not wearing high heels.

262
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,040
How can I scare them?

263
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Here.

264
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Where's the delivery?

265
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Why is it blocked?

266
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Boss, our Dian Dian Ning and Jian Jian Ning are new.

267
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
But you don't have to cover our delivery.

268
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm sorry, it's a little messy.

269
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
I'll clean it up.

270
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
All three should be arranged neatly.

271
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Okay.

272
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
The delivery this time is in a good place.

273
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Of course.

274
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
We mainly push this batch of goods.

275
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
We'll put it here this month.

276
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
It's quite free.

277
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
And we'll have some discounts every week.

278
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
You can sell more if the goods are better.

279
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
We have money to make, right?

280
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Of course.

281
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
You did a good job, boss.

282
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Great.

283
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Go home and sleep after work.

284
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
No.

285
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Why not?

286
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
We have to report to your boss at the clinic.

287
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Let's go.

288
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Hey.

289
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Hey.

290
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Zhi Xiong, where's A Min?

291
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Is he still in the clinic?

292
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
He's done.

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
He's cleaning up upstairs.

294
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Okay.

295
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Hey, bring me a ladder.

296
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Okay.

297
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Hey, what do you want?

298
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Don't make so many troubles.

299
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Take a break.

300
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Take it.

301
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Hey, stop it.

302
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Let him do it.

303
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Yes.

304
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Can you teach me?

305
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
No.

306
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
You're so shameless.

307
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Look how ugly it is.

308
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:34,840
Hey, bring me some

309
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Hey, don't bend your legs.

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
You'll sprain your ankle later.

311
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Boss, how do you know Rachel can bend her ankle?

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Bend your ankle again?

313
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Come down now.

314
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Or I'll be in trouble.

315
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Okay.

316
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Go to the second floor and take a rest.

317
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll go up to you after I'm done.

318
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Remember, we have to practice archery later.

319
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Okay, I'll get you something good.

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Make sure you put the goods in a good position.

321
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Don't make a mess.

322
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Okay, I know.

323
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Let's go.

324
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Okay.

325
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Brother Zhi, you're really good.

326
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
You're so fast and good at doing things.

327
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
It's good that you helped me in the clinic.

328
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
If I were alone, I couldn't handle it.

329
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Brother, didn't I say I'd stay in the clinic to help you?

330
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
You said you didn't need to.

331
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
You're the director.

332
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
How could you walk away?

333
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
You're the boss.

334
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
How could the director not be able to walk away?

335
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Okay, the clinic can handle it.

336
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
With Brother Zhi, anything is fine.

337
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
He doesn't invite those people to come.

338
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
I can do anything.

339
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Hey.

340
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Hey.

341
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Hey.

342
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Hey.

343
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
I'm going to get my hair cut.

344
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Ignore him.

345
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Did you get a shot?

346
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
You've been busy all day today.

347
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
You're tired.

348
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Don't practice archery.

349
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Sleep a little longer.

350
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
I'll send you back after you wake up.

351
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
By the way, do your feet still hurt?

352
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Let me see.

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
It's much better.

354
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
It's not that swollen.

355
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,040
By the way, I bought you a pair of sneakers.

356
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
This has a protective function.

357
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
It can support your whole body.

358
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
It will help you walk.

359
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
You bought it for me?

360
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
You're working so hard.

361
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Of course you should reward me.

362
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
How do you know my size?

363
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I often help you to rub your feet.

364
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
How could I not know?

365
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Do you feel comfortable walking?

366
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Okay.

367
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
How do you feel?

368
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Very comfortable.

369
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
But I'm worried that

370
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
you don't think high heels are as good as them.

371
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I don't wear high heels.

372
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
I look good without high heels.

373
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Of course.

374
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm kidding. I'm not that narcissistic.

375
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

376
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
By the way,

377
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
after I helped Yingying to get rid of the alcohol,

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
did she feel better?

379
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
She's much better now.

380
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
She slept well.

381
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,040
The day you helped her to get rid of the alcohol,

382
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
she had a dream.

383
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
She came to my room and told me

384
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
she dreamed that we were bullied by the kids when we were young.

385
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Then she transformed into Dumpling Princess to protect me.

386
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,040
I think she's been blaming herself for all these years.

387
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
She even asked me if my feet hurt.

388
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
You're very good to her.

389
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
You've done a lot for her.

390
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Yingying knows that.

391
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Then we and Yingying

392
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
will work hard together.

393
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
We'll get better slowly.

394
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Thank you.

395
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
You came to save her?

396
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
You're close friends.

397
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Are you helping her to get the result?

398
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
She said she wanted to see the house again.

399
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
There should be hope.

400
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
We can work together.

401
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Why are you washing clothes here?

402
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Why are you washing clothes here?

403
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
I was washing clothes on the rooftop.

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
But I'm cooking and watching the fire.

405
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
So I'm washing clothes here.

406
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
No need to cook.

407
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Let's have hot pot.

408
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
I cooked for you four.

409
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
I'm not used to your hometown dishes.

410
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
You can eat it yourself.

411
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
No.

412
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Today we cook a whole meal.

413
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
It's not sour, not spicy, and light.

414
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
What whole meal?

415
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
We don't eat a whole meal when we eat hot pot.

416
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
And Hong Kong people love to eat hot pot.

417
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
The most important thing is that

418
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I and my brother eat a whole hot pot once a week.

419
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
This is our romance. Don't mess it up.

420
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Look.

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I'll go to the rooftop to wash clothes.

422
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Wait.

423
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Why are my underwear here?

424
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Why?

425
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
You should clean your underwear.

426
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
And you only wear one pant every day.

427
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
You can't wash it with a washing machine.

428
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm afraid you'll get a shower without underwear.

429
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,040
No one can touch my underwear.

430
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
You can't touch it either.

431
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
What are you arguing about?

432
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Brother Ming.

433
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
He washed my underwear.

434
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
And he washed it with his hands.

435
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Brother, you can't be so generous.

436
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
So generous?

437
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Here comes the whole meal.

438
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I told you we don't eat a whole meal when we eat hot pot.

439
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Not bad.

440
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
You're so lucky today.

441
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
Give it to me.

442
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
Okay.

443
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
You can like it.

444
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I can do it every day.

445
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Why are you all here?

446
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Why are you here suddenly?

447
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Are you looking for me?

448
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
No.

449
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I wet my medicine powder before.

450
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,040
I want to re-paint it.

451
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Go down and paint the medicine powder.

452
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Thank you, Brother Zhi.

453
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
It's okay.

454
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
You're hungry.

455
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
You haven't eaten yet, right?

456
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Let's eat together.

457
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Okay.

458
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Thank you.

459
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I'll give you a piece of lamb.

460
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
I don't eat lamb.

461
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Thank you.

462
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Come on.

463
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Have some beef.

464
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Thank you.

465
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
The shrimp is cooked.

466
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Ming, have some shrimp.

467
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Rui Chu, have some shrimp.

468
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Thank you.

469
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Thank you.

470
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Thank you.

471
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Thank you.

472
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Thank you.

473
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Thank you.

474
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Do you want some corn?

475
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I'll give you another piece.

476
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
No.

477
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
I just want this piece.

478
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Women grab things,

479
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
men don't interrupt.

480
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I want some corn.

481
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
A-Ming, eat some corn. Be careful, it's hot.

482
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,840
What are you doing out here so late at night?

483
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,440
I'm planning to wipe down the dried white pepper with soy sauce.

484
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
It will dry up when it falls off.

485
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
It will prevent insects and insects from attacking.

486
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,240
Hurry and go back. Don't disturb me with drinking.

487
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,440
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

488
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
Because of that?

489
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
What does it have to do with you?

490
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,640
Speaking of single love, I also have some experience.

491
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
When I was picking up the crops, I was only in love with a village girl.

492
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,240
But because I was poor, her mother helped her choose a village chief's son.

493
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,240
She's not saying that you're poor. She's saying that you have no hair.

494
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Fine.

495
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
I screwed this up.

496
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,840
Yan足啊.

497
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,040
The person who killed her mother is me, nominal.

498
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
I am from Ke'ai City.

499
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Not my mother.

500
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I just focused your love on her.

501
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,840
Didn't she kill your mother?

502
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Until receiving all the disability insurance jobs,

503
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,020
Take one.

504
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,160
It's on your personal choice.

505
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Don't last too long!

506
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
I know how hard it is.

507
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
This time, I'll definitely get it out with you.

508
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm sorry.

509
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,100
Brother, since I've taken you in, I know that today will be the day.

510
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,300
Since Zhi Xiong has left, who else will help you wash your underwear?

511
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm warning you, don't wash my underwear anymore.

512
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,500
Then, let me tell you, I'll take this one and wash it.

513
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
You wash it, I'll beat you to death.

514
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,400
Okay, enough. Stop fighting.

515
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,100
Here, cheers.

516
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,500
Cheers.

517
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,100
Here.

518
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,000
According to the medicine shop's report,

519
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the new products sold are very good.

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
Not only are they new customers,

521
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,000
after one month of launch, their sales have increased by 50%.

522
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The new products, Jian Jian Ning, are also very good.

523
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The 580 magical medicine sticker that Ma Yi Xiang posted online is Jian Jian Ning.

524
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Many sports companies recommend it.

525
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
People who know how to exercise will also buy it.

526
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Have you two said it already?

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
I invited you here not to let you be opponents of the Lala team

528
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
and told you how good their business is.

529
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,000
I want to beat them down. Do you have any plan?

530
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
I understand. Give us some time.

531
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,100
We still need time? I want it tonight.

532
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Get out and think about it.

533
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,800
Okay.

534
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,700
Mr. Deng.

535
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,100
Son, that 11424, it seems like it ate the medicine and kept on falling.

536
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,500
Do we need to hide it?

537
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,900
The Zhuang family are all my friends.

538
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,200
You are so arrogant.

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
You are so timid. Don't buy the stock.

540
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,500
No.

541
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,700
We have already fallen two support lines.

542
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,300
We have put hundreds of words in it.

543
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,000
It's not just a loss. We are not even left with a single one.

544
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Anyway, the stock matter is up to me to handle. Don't worry.

545
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Think of a way to deal with the sales.

546
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Then, you said that we need to have a market to keep the balance.

547
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
The money outside is money.

548
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,800
Actually, they didn't bite us and we didn't put it in.

549
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,000
Why should we chase them?

550
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,600
Are you really naive or are you being a fake?

551
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,100
We originally had one medicine per person.

552
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,300
If we had three of them, it would be one against three.

553
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,100
It's to steal our business.

554
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,500
Once they sell it to a certain size, we can close the deal.

555
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,700
Ren Jue is an old brand.

556
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,500
Nothing will happen.

557
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,900
Anyway, now that he bullied Shang Man, I can't help but fight back.

558
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,500
The most important thing is to use a very good method.

559
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,300
Xiao Mei, what's wrong? What did you say? Did you say something wrong?

560
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Look. Green shouldn't be this kind of green.

561
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
But he said that he asked his boss.

562
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,000
This is just a normal color difference.

563
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,900
Let me talk to him.

564
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,800
Teacher, this is Cine Green. We want Summer Green.

565
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
You guys are so professional that you're asking your boss to close the deal?

566
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,600
Boss, yes.

567
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Let me talk to him.

568
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
As a boss, you don't think that this is a color difference, right?

569
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,900
Do you want us to not hire you to print it in the future?

570
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,700
I'll thank you for sending the right green in two hours.

571
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,600
That's it.

572
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Sorry. I'll help you close the deal.

573
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,900
Thank you.

574
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,600
You really can't be so cruel.

575
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,700
How can the main color of our new product be wrong?

576
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,500
Mi Gao, bring me a ladder.

577
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,600
Thank you.

578
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,900
Be careful.

579
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,500
Thank you, Mi.

580
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,900
Oh, right. Do you have time later?

581
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,100
How about going to eat?

582
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
You can't leave yet.

583
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Be careful with the hot water.

584
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Here.

585
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,300
This is a warm bath bath.

586
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
It's a warm bath bath that helps you to cool down.

587
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Here.

588
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Soak it first.

589
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,900
Okay.

590
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,300
I'll go and get it.

591
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Okay.

592
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
I'll go and get it.

593
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Okay.

594
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,900
I'll go and get it.

595
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Okay.

596
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,600
Soak it first.

597
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Why are you getting it? Didn't A Zu bring it?

598
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
A Zu is going to pack up the products.

599
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,600
He's super busy.

600
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll go back and check it later.

601
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,900
You don't look well.

602
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,400
Did you sleep well yesterday?

603
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
It's normal. I'm too busy.

604
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Here. Come here.

605
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,700
It's cheap and salty.

606
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,300
It's 10 yuan per kilo.

607
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,600
It's dry and weak.

608
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,700
It's low in blood and low in energy.

609
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,000
If you keep working like this,

610
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,300
you won't be able to hold on.

611
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,800
Miss Shen.

612
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes.

613
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,600
You just started to soak it.

614
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,300
You can't get up yet.

615
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Don't do anything immediately.

616
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Go home and wash a hot bath.

617
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
The boss ordered it.

618
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay.

619
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
You guys clean up these.

620
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,500
Okay. Don't worry.

621
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
Bye.

622
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Zhixiong.

623
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,900
Yes.

624
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,700
I'll go out for a while.

625
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,900
I'll leave this to you.

626
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,800
Okay.

627
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
A Min.

628
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
I haven't finished soaking it yet.

629
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,100
You're leaving?

630
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes. You can leave after soaking it.

631
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
I'll soak it.

632
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,800
You look really good in these shoes.

633
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,900
Oh, right. Do you feel comfortable walking in these?

634
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
Do you think it's narrow?

635
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,700
It's comfortable. It's just right.

636
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,100
When I'm arranging the venue,

637
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm not afraid of climbing up and down.

638
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,100
Climbing up and down?

639
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Be careful not to twist your feet.

640
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,900
I know.

641
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
Seeing you look good in these,

642
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,900
I feel at ease.

643
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
I plan to buy another pair for myself.

644
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm not afraid of it.

645
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,100
I'm afraid that you'll be afraid of it.

646
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
I plan to buy another pair for myself.

647
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
This way, I can wear the same one as you.

648
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,600
Okay.

649
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm here.

650
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,900
Thank you for taking me home.

651
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,100
Okay then. Go home and rest early.

652
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Good night.

653
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,600
Good night.

654
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,500
Good night.

655
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,100
Good night.

656
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,900
Good night.

657
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,700
Good night.

658
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,800
Rachel.

659
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,900
What were you going to do?

660
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,500
You don't have to be so ugly every time you see me.

661
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,900
I have something to talk to you.

662
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
It's hard not to see your ugly face.

663
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
I have nothing to say to you.

664
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,300
Three million.

665
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,100
This is a 3 million dollar cheque.

666
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,100
I want you to help me as much as you want.

667
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I see that you've been doing well in the vending machines for the past half year.

668
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Come help me. This 3 million dollar is yours.

669
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
You really like to open cheques.

670
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Sorry, I'm not interested at all.

671
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
5 million dollar.

672
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
If you want, I can write it to you immediately.

673
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,100
This money, you can't earn it even if you work in the vending machines for the rest of your life.

674
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Even if you give me more money, I won't help you.

675
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I'll write your money dirty.

676
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Sister.

677
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Sister.

678
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Little sister, this is for you.

679
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
It's a card book.

680
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,100
I bought it for a long time. I broke it before. I'm sorry.

681
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,100
It's okay. I don't remember it anymore. Don't remember it.

682
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,100
No. You must remember what happened to little sister.

683
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Good night. Go to bed early.

684
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Good night.

685
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Good night.

686
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,100
The hand raised above the head, 3 fingers put in the room, and draw a small circle.

687
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
It's okay.

688
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Try the other side.

689
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
It won't be the same.

690
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
It's okay.

691
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
You can't see it.

692
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
I can't see it.

693
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
What do you mean?

694
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
It can't be.

695
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Rui Chou, check it again.

696
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Those arrows are all made of plastic.

697
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Otherwise, the square won't let us shoot arrows.

698
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Rui Chou.

699
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
What's wrong?

700
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
It's okay.

701
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Are you really okay?

702
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
I...

703
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I'm fine.

704
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm fine.

705
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
You can tell me anything.

706
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I...

707
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Are you okay? Why do you look so pale?

708
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Your hands are so cold and your forehead is so hot. Come in and sit down.

709
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,100
I don't know. It's cold and hot.

710
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,100
You were fine yesterday. Why did you become like this after a night?

711
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I don't know.

712
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm sorry, Rui Chou.

713
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,100
I need you to help me move the stuff to the square.

714
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,100
I'm afraid that it will faint at any time.

715
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
I'll go there after I give it to it.

716
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
You have to be careful.

717
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
I will.

718
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
Hello.

719
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Hello.

720
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Come and have a look.

721
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,100
In addition to our yellow brand products,

722
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,100
we also want to introduce two new products to you.

723
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
They are our Dian Dian Ning and Jian Jian Ning.

724
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Come and have a try.

725
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
The main ingredients are red flowers.

726
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,100
All our products are for the pain in different parts of the body.

727
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
We can press wherever it hurts.

728
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Jian Jian Ning is especially effective in muscle pain.

729
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,100
We sell it and introduce the new product Dian Dian Ning.

730
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
You can have a try.

731
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
There will be a archery performance later.

732
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,100
If you shoot the right position, you will get our talisman.

733
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
In addition to the medicinal oil,

734
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
we also introduce the medicinal stickers.

735
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Try it with some test-tools.

736
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
It contains red flowers and blood.

737
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
It's so good.

738
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
This Dian Dian Ning also has a 5-ml package.

739
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
It's suitable for ladies to put in the bag.

740
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
You can also take it out at any time to feel pain in your fingers.

741
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Hey, don't do archery if you don't come.

742
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
No.

743
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
No.

744
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
You just said we should shoot arrows.

745
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Of course we should do it.

746
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
You just learned archery for a few months.

747
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
You don't even know if you can shoot it.

748
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
It's dangerous.

749
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Then your brother gave me this.

750
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Of course I have to hold on.

751
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
I must do it.

752
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
You want to shoot it, don't shoot it.

753
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Enough.

754
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
I'll go downstairs and make some medicine for you.

755
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,100
You can get rid of the cold after drinking it.

756
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Thank you, A Min.

757
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I'm sorry.

758
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,100
For me, you can't go to the activity site.

759
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
It's okay.

760
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Take care of your body first.

761
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Wait for me.

762
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Okay.

763
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Wow.

764
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
So happy.

765
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,700
There are three products from Manmaitong that can be used for different purposes.

766
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,820
Let's welcome our representative, Miss Luo Yingchen, to show us how to shoot arrows.

767
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,780
It's a chance to get rid of the pain.

768
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,180
Okay, the first arrow.

769
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,100
Miss Luo, you have the posture and strength.

770
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
That's great!

771
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Stop.

772
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,780
Aim for the pain and the sharp pain.

773
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,420
Clear and penetrating.

774
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,860
The second arrow.

775
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,740
Okay, let's give it another round of applause.

776
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,540
Miss Luo.

777
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,940
That's great!

778
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,860
Manmaitong, the special medicine for back pain.

779
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,740
It improves muscle tension.

780
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,140
Okay, the last arrow.

781
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
The third arrow.

782
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
Support her.

783
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,740
Can she hit three points in a row?

784
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,540
I'm so nervous.

785
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,340
Fighting!

786
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,780
Left Wanderer

787
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,860
The arrow sword will help Notice the Red Flower types.

788
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,140
It'sleeping and blood churning by fish.

789
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,940
It has ainylative effect on pain and from old realms.

790
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,300
Thank you, Miss Luo.

791
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,580
Thank you, everyone.

792
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,820
Hello, Ruizhuo.

793
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,220
No, do you want me to open it or leave it to the quick-dryer?

794
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,420
Hey!

795
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,620
Here, drink it while it's hot.

796
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
Thank you, A-Ming.

797
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,320
I'll drink it.

798
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,620
A-Su, how was the event?

799
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,920
After Rachel got the shot, she fainted.

800
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,020
Which hospital did she go to?

801
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,420
Dehe Li Memorial Hospital.

802
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,320
I will go there right now.

803
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Ming, don't go.

804
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,720
Stay with me.

805
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,320
I'm begging you.

806
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,820
No. Sorry.

807
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,320
I have to go see Rachel.

808
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
You're awake.

809
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm in the hospital.

810
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,720
You're in the hospital. You fainted.

811
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,520
Does your head still hurt? Do you want to drink some water?

812
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Did I get cancer?

813
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,720
Why do you think so?

814
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,120
When I was in a daze, I heard the nurses saying that they were going to use something to make a mark.

815
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,820
And my chest started to hurt last night.

816
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,320
I felt a hard block.

817
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,720
Calm down.

818
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,320
What you need most now is rest.

819
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,520
Don't scare yourself.

820
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,720
There are hard blocks in your body, but there are many reasons.

821
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,920
After the doctor does a detailed check-up...

822
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,520
But my family has a genetic history.

823
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
My grandmother and aunt were all sick when they were in their fifties. They died before they were sixty.

824
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,120
What if I also have one?

825
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,020
I understand that you're worried.

826
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,320
But listen to me.

827
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:24,720
From what I know, the genetic history of the family is only 10% to 15% of all cancer cases.

828
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm so unlucky. I'm sure I'll get hit.

829
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,320
If you really get it, then you'll be treated.

830
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,220
If you're scared, you'll be down. If you're scared, you'll be up. If you're scared, you'll be up.

831
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,820
Before the diagnosis, the more you're scared, the worse you'll be.

832
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,620
You even use the emperor's inner energy to comfort people.

833
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,220
You can just smile.

834
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Just remember, sickness is not the end of the world.

835
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,020
No matter what happens, I'll face it with you.

836
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,220
A Min.

837
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,420
How are you? I came to see you as soon as I finished my work. Are you feeling better?

838
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,820
Where's Rui Cheng?

839
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
He's in the hospital.

840
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,120
He fainted after the activity.

841
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Big Brother is in the hospital with him.

842
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,720
I know.

843
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,120
After your big brother received the call, he didn't care about anything.

844
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,720
Including me.

845
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,320
Even if I'm sick, he didn't care about me.

846
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,920
Don't think too much. I'll take you home first.

847
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,320
No need for you to take me home. I can walk on my own.

848
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
Hey, hey, hey.

849
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,520
Look at you. You can't even stand still. Let me take you home.

850
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,720
I already said no need. Do you understand? I'll treat you like a driver.

851
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,120
Wake up.

852
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,920
You can also see that my big brother chose Rachel and not you. He doesn't even care about you.

853
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,320
You're only making yourself unhappy. No matter what you do, he won't choose you.

854
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,720
Liang Yanzu, listen well.

855
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Whether A Min likes me or not is my business. It has nothing to do with you.

856
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,720
You don't have the right to lecture me.

857
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,920
What can't I compare to him?

858
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,720
I definitely won't lose to him.

859
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,520
Why did you hit me?

860
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,320
Just your look, you've made A Min dizzy.

861
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,920
I feel so sick when I see you.

862
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
What did you say?

863
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,720
You're lucky. If you can't do real estate, you'll just make A Min earn money.

864
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,520
Now you're even working for Mai Mai Tong. Your original goal is to be the boss's wife.

865
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
I don't have that many means.

866
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm just doing my job. I'm not trying to approach him like you.

867
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,320
Save it. Who would believe you?

868
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,120
Why are you always between me and him and keep bothering me?

869
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,720
Do you know what he was doing just now? He left me to look for you.

870
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
You're still pretending?

871
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I can't control myself. I never wanted to fight with you.

872
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,320
He and I are boss and subordinate. We've never crossed paths.

873
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,720
I hate people like you the most.

874
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,120
Why can you have everything if you didn't do anything wrong?

875
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Why did I do everything and he didn't do anything?

876
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,120
Please get out of here. Don't be crazy here. I want to rest.

877
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,720
Rest? You want to be beautiful? Don't pretend to be beautiful.

878
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Nian! Stop it! How can you do this?

879
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,320
Get out of here. I have something to tell you.

880
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,320
Enough!

881
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Did you leave me because of Ray Cheng?

882
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,120
Nian, I've always treated you as a patient.

883
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,320
I have no qualms about it.

884
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,520
Ray Cheng needs to rest now. Don't bother him anymore.

885
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,320
But you were treating me just now.

886
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,520
He's a patient. I'm a patient too.

887
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Why are you so different from him?

888
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,120
You can't answer me, right?

889
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,720
Do you know that this makes me feel very bad?

890
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Sorry, Nian. I didn't mean to hurt you.

891
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,720
What I did to you was just to help you. I didn't mean anything else.

892
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,320
I like Ray Cheng, but it has nothing to do with him.

893
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,720
I hope you won't blame him.

894
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,720
So, from the beginning to the end,

895
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,520
I was the one who made the most of it.

896
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm that crazy woman.

897
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,720
I never thought that way.

898
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Okay, I understand.

899
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,720
But Lin Weiming, if you don't choose me,

900
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,920
you will definitely regret it.

901
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,720
Stop it!

902
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,400
gün tie

903
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,720
I have always treated you as a patient.

904
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,120
I'm doing what you did.

905
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,920
It was just for your own good, but I didn't mean anything else.

906
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
I'm sorry.

908
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm sorry.

910
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
I'm sorry.

913
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm sorry.

914
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,920
I'm sorry.

915
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm sorry.

916
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
