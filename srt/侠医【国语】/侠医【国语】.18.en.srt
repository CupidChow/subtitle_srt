1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But you still have a factory in Ren Yuan, right?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But the valuation is also ten million.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This so-called clinic is selling drug oil.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Aunt, you stand here

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is to help the opponent to promote

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and damage the interests of our company.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will definitely go to court

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to remove your shareholder identity.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm always your aunt.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What do you mean?

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sister.

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sister.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sister.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sister.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The number you have dialed is not available for the moment.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Aunt.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Aunt.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Aunt.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Wake up.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Rachel.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A'min.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did my mother go in for an operation?

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, she has been in for ten minutes.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The doctor said that when the aunt fell down the stairs,

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
she hit her back brain and had a brain bleeding.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So she had to wait for you to start the operation.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Will the operation be more stable after the operation?

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The doctor said the situation was not optimistic.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you so afraid?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There were no people in the park at that time,

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and there was no surveillance.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you guilty?

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm afraid for you.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you crazy?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If he dies,

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you are the son of a murderer.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I can't stand my father

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
acting like a dog in front of others.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm helping you.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now I broke into the goods,

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
almost killed

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and it's all on me.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hello, A'cha.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's wrong?

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Second Brother,

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
sister had an accident.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She rolled down the stairs in the park

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and was sent to the hospital.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She is still in a coma.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The situation is very dangerous.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How is it?

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She is going to die, but she hasn't woken up yet, right?

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Go to the hospital and keep an eye on her.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
How can I go?

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My hand is still shaking.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They will know I have a problem when they see me.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you afraid of?

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We are afraid that she will wake up

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and say we pushed her.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If we don't go to the hospital,

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
how can we know if she is going to die?

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I really don't know how to face them.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't care about this.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I tell you,

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
although I pushed her,

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
but you didn't save her,

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I will drag you into the water.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mi.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Uncle, aunt.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mi,

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
how is my sister now?

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She just had a surgery.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She hasn't passed the danger zone yet.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Doctor.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Doctor,

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
when will my sister wake up?

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The patient's medical index is temporarily stable.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But the level of consciousness is still in a coma.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We have to keep an eye on it.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That means she will become a plant person.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
At this stage,

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
we have to observe the patient's consciousness

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and self-reaction.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We don't rule out any possibility.

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you, doctor.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mi,

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I told you not to focus on your work.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My sister is old now.

122
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You should spend more time with her.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't worry about my mom and me.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can leave after you finish reading.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do you want to invite two workers to accompany my sister?

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Henry knows a friend who is a nurse.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't mention this guy again, okay?

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was so angry with my sister that day.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was so angry with my sister.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now you mention her name,

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm afraid she will hear it.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Uncle,

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
don't explain it.

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What my mom needs now is a quiet rest.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So please.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's go.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Dad, let's go.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why do you look like this?

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Aunt is still awake.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It proves that we are still lucky.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
God wants to help us.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why do you say this now?

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your aunt is still lying in the hospital.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We don't know if she wakes up or not.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are cold-blooded.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Where is your conscience?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop pretending.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't you think so?

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can't run away when aunt wakes up.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I just say what you don't dare to say.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But at least I have a shame.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't want you to be here after you hurt someone.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You promise you will pay the money today?

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Aunt is here to do business.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If we sell the factory, we will pay the money.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What about Anping?

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You know she doesn't exist.

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You were not here that day.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Didn't you hear?

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Aunt said she would go back to ask her cousin to sign the equity transfer.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But she hasn't signed it yet.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She has no shares.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What can she do to us?

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hello.

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ok.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Tell them to arrange it.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's it.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
She told me someone bought our factory.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The price is good.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We can make a deal soon.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Think about it.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is aunt in a good mood?

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We will win this time.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Have breakfast.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Azu, what's wrong with you?

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You are spitting blood.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't have spitting blood.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The bosses of the factory can't drink.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm so sick.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They can drink.

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You are not drunk.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong with you recently?

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong with your body?

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let Anping check you.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't worry.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Brother has many troubles.

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
His body is seriously injured and in a coma.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't worry too much.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You think you can hide it from Anping?

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When something really happens to you, will he be at ease?

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Look at you now.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You are so cold and pale.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know how my body is.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I said it's okay.

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't worry too much.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Your brain is deteriorating very fast.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you don't have surgery, I'm afraid you can't last one year.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The risk of surgery is higher than last time.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you don't handle it, you will have a brain cancer.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You may be paralyzed or even die.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will go to the hospital.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't worry.

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Shen Qiting.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are seducing my husband.

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why do you hit her?

210
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're shameless!

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then are you shameless?

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't control your husband coming to me.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What did you say?

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Stop it!

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Go back and control your husband.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't bother me anymore.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm also getting married.

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We're getting married tonight.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you keep doing this,

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll call the police and make things worse.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What have you done?

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know it all.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm telling you.

224
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you seduce my husband again,

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it won't be that easy.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Look,

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
now that his wife is here,

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
don't get so close to her husband.

229
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Si Tu sent me a message,

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but I didn't reply.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know what he said,

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and his wife misunderstood.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Enough.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You don't have to explain it to me.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I can't help you many times.

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then...

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You came to me on purpose?

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I just had a late-night snack with my friend

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and passed by here.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm leaving.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Bye.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A'zu.

244
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You...

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
haven't told me

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
why you took the medicine.

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's nothing.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Good night.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can go now.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll go with you.

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
See you.

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your mother's condition

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
has stabilized temporarily.

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've checked with the Chinese medicine doctor.

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I wonder if it's possible

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
for Chinese and Western medicine to cooperate

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and treat my mother together.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've read some research reports

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
from the mainland.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Under regular treatment of Western medicine,

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
are served.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The effect is better than Chinese medicine.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The Chinese medicine can help

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to reduce the damage of the patient's brain,

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and can promote the recovery of consciousness

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and the function of the nerves.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Are you the Chinese medicine doctor

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
of the Chinese medicine clinic?

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm a private officer.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't deny the Chinese medicine's effectiveness.

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But the patient is in the hospital now.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The medical department is responsible for his medical responsibility.

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The Chinese medicine treatment in the hospital

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
must be handled by the medical department

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and the qualified personnel.

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not questioning your medical skills.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a medical responsibility.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I understand.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I've prepared a treatment plan.

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or can you give it to the Chinese medicine doctor

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and let him refer to my content

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to treat my mother?

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll try to help you ask.

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But as far as I know,

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Chinese and Western medicine cooperation service

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
has a specific patient

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
with severe pain and cancer.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The brain injury is not a specific patient.

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not appropriate.

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't want to challenge the system.

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Since it's not appropriate,

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
can you help me to fight for it

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and let me have a chance to help?

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That person is my mother.

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A needle is a medicine.

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It can help her a lot.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Just give me a chance.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
As a son,

301
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
help me to help my mother, okay?

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll go.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Brother.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What did the doctor say?

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The doctor promised to help me to fight for it.

306
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't worry.

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Your mother will be fine.

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She'll be fine.

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ming, something bad happened.

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Aken took people to see the factory

311
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and said I sold the factory.

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Are you crazy?

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come out.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You took people to see the factory.

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You want to sell the factory?

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's you.

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You sold the company's secret and want to be fired.

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't want to help you

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to work for a man who has no conscience.

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's not you who fired me.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't do it.

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Even if you fired auntie,

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
My mother won't agree to sell the factory.

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
She's still in the hospital.

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know when she'll wake up.

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What right do you have to say that?

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I handed the factory to uncle.

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because I believe you

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
will manage the factory well.

331
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But you

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
took the money and suppressed the company's business.

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Now you want to sell the factory.

334
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I tell you.

335
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I won't let you do that.

336
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You gave up the mission first.

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You should leave the old guys to me.

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't have the right to speak.

339
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ken, he's your aunt.

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
How can you say that?

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm telling the truth.

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
A-Ming, what should we do?

343
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't worry.

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll keep the mission this time.

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I won't give up.

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Didn't you make it clear before?

347
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you doing again?

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I know you're the manager

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of the factory.

350
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Can you tell me

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the time and place of your deal?

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why should I tell you?

353
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You just want money.

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can give it to you.

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Money?

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How much can you give me?

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And even if I know,

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
will I tell you?

359
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Put down the grudge between you and me first.

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You can help A-Ming.

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Now his mother is still in the hospital.

362
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
His father's life's hard work

363
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
is to make a deal.

364
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You let A-Ming keep him.

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Keep the factory

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is to help you.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Who will help me?

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What do I get?

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Ling Wei Min only cares about you.

370
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you think he will thank me?

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll thank you.

372
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I used to

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
treat you as my good sister.

374
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I know you'll take my order.

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I can still go with you.

376
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll share the money with you.

377
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What's the problem?

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll go with you.

379
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't have anything to do with you.

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But do you take me as your friend?

381
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You helped Deng Shikeng to drug me.

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I thought I would hate you forever.

383
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But after knowing you for so long,

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I know what kind of person you are.

385
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know you can't figure it out.

386
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's why you did this.

387
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're not a heartless person.

388
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Don't be used by Deng Shikeng anymore.

389
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay?

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll help you.

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Rachel.

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Forget it.

393
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If she doesn't want to help,

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
don't force her.

395
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Say something to her.

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't beg her anymore.

397
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go.

398
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can help you.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Maybe I can help you.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you want?

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I want to help you.

402
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How about this?

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You kiss me in front of her.

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If I have the feeling,

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll help you.

406
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I won't do that.

407
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Can you be rational?

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Everything Shikeng did

409
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
was for me.

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't want to hurt anyone.

411
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Including you.

412
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I knew it.

414
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Since Deng Shikeng is planning to sell the factory

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and pay the debt,

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
he won't listen to you so easily.

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No matter what,

418
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll stop him no matter what.

419
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You didn't do that just now.

420
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's not bad.

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You don't have to

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
refuse him so quickly.

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you can keep the factory,

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll be blinded by the ghost.

425
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know how to face him.

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
In fact, I've only treated him

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
as a patient since the beginning.

428
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then,

429
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
who did you treat me as?

430
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You?

431
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're a person who has a lot of illness

432
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and can't take care of yourself.

433
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But now,

434
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can take care of you.

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Right.

436
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He sent me the time and place

437
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
of the transaction.

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why did he change his attitude all of a sudden?

439
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Is he trying to help us

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
with his conscience?

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No matter what,

442
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
this is the only clue.

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let's go and see if there's anything bad.

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's go.

445
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll treat you as if I've returned you a favor.

446
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay?

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you.

448
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I won't bother you anymore. I'm leaving.

449
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A'zuo.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's your illness?

451
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It has nothing to do with you.

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You should treat yourself

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
if you're sick.

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You only think about Lin Weimin every day.

455
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you think it's great?

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm not as great as you.

457
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm not as great as you.

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You do everything for yourself.

459
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I can't do anything

460
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to make up for my conscience.

461
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Right.

462
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm selfish.

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I like money very much.

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I do everything for myself.

465
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I think about myself.

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But I'm not wrong.

467
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're helping Lin Weimin every day.

468
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What did he give you?

469
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
A house?

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Or he asked you to be the factory manager?

471
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're just a dog.

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He thinks I'm a dog.

473
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He thinks I can do anything.

474
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But I know there are many things

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
more important than money

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
when I escape from death.

477
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Look.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I had an operation when I was a kid.

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
My brother helped me.

480
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
As long as I can help him,

481
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I can do anything.

482
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can die.

483
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Mr. Deng, I'll leave you to your work.

484
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'll go back to work.

485
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll go back to work.

486
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll go back to work.

487
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'll go back to work.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll go back to work.

489
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
According to market valuation,

490
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Mr. Deng's market price is 10 million.

491
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Uncle Bo.

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you have any problem with the price?

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Girl.

494
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
In fact, money isn't important.

495
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We need a safe

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and low-risk exit.

497
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Don't worry.

498
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
It's not about the ten million yuan, the meat

499
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
are only playing Navad broo tror

500
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,380
I say

501
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,060
Are you brand new?

502
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,540
The stock

503
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,840
All the money

504
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,700
Will not resolve, not at all

505
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,300
Mr. bund begging for a new premium

506
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,320
What?

507
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,400
All the money

508
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,460
Gave me this

509
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,640
Then you say

510
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
One hundred and one hundred 같이

511
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:11,860
How is this good?

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,080
A high- All day

513
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,220
How will I keep to accommodation?

514
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,300
It is very good

515
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,740
The founder of Maitong is our competitor.

516
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,140
Yes, his mother has shares.

517
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,140
But she is in a coma.

518
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,220
She has no ability to make any sense.

519
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,060
You are the one who is in danger.

520
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,140
You sell the pharmaceutical factory here while my mother is in a coma.

521
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,100
Fortunately, my mother signed the transfer of shares.

522
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,700
She transferred all the shares to me.

523
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,340
Enough.

524
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,500
One said she wanted to sell,

525
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,580
the other said she didn't sell.

526
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,180
Who is in charge?

527
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
Uncle Bo, how about this?

528
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll go out with you for a cup of coffee.

529
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,340
Let them talk.

530
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,900
You were pretending to be a high-ranking official.

531
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,460
You said that you had nothing to do with the appointment.

532
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,820
Your mother was lying in the hospital.

533
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,180
She came to steal the shares right away.

534
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,540
She thought she was a major shareholder.

535
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:09,480
She was acting like a

536
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,500
Who was the witness that day?

537
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,500
It was me.

538
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
I went to the history department with my sister.

539
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,220
Why is there only Deng Shuhuan's signature

540
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,100
on the transfer?

541
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
The signature of Deng Shuhuan

542
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,900
is not the signature of the victim.

543
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,500
The day of the signature

544
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,780
was the day of the accident.

545
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,060
She was still in a coma.

546
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,940
The contract

547
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,020
was to be signed by both parties.

548
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,420
Even if Ms. Deng had a transfer of shares,

549
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,420
but because she is in a coma now,

550
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,660
we can't know

551
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,100
if her wish has changed.

552
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,300
So I can't see

553
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,900
any legal effect of this document.

554
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,220
But she wanted to scare me with a piece of paper

555
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,740
and read more books.

556
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,020
Even if this transfer is invalid,

557
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,340
the company that has agreed to sell the factory

558
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,460
will have to write a name

559
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,660
and all the major decisions

560
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
will be agreed by all shareholders.

561
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,020
If your mother-in-law doesn't agree,

562
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,500
don't expect to sell the factory.

563
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,340
There is also a condition on the contract

564
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,940
that there is no ability to act.

565
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,780
That is to say,

566
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,700
when the shareholders lose their ability to act,

567
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,940
their voting rights will be divided

568
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,980
by the share share to other shareholders.

569
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,140
That is to say,

570
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,340
my father and I

571
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,420
have the right to make any decision

572
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,060
for my aunt.

573
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,260
Sorry.

574
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,020
The End

575
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,820
They are anxious to sell the factory.

576
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
It must be related to the drug debt

577
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,060
that was put aside by Shikeng.

578
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,300
I have received many calls

579
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,340
from the drug debt

580
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,900
that they were owed in Rengyuan.

581
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,100
I really don't know how much they owe.

582
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,980
The only one who can stop them now

583
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,980
is my sister.

584
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,540
I hope she can wake up soon.

585
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
When her mother wakes up,

586
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,220
Rengyuan has been

587
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,580
beaten by that pair of father and son.

588
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,540
Although aunt is in a coma now,

589
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
there is no reason that the law

590
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,860
can't guarantee her shareholder interests.

591
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,020
She is your only son.

592
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,060
Is there any way

593
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,820
to have you

594
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,140
temporarily stand up for her

595
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,620
and exercise your shareholder rights?

596
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,340
How about I ask my lawyer friend?

597
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,780
Thank you, aunt.

598
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,340
How about we all come up for dinner first?

599
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,220
Let's think about it after we are full, okay?

600
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,100
Let's have dinner.

601
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,780
Dr. Lin.

602
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,300
Hey.

603
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,380
Why are you all here?

604
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,140
My sister said that your mother

605
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,780
was in a coma in the hospital.

606
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,180
I asked everyone to fold paper cranes together

607
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,220
and pray for her.

608
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,020
It turns out that you were in the house

609
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,180
for a day yesterday and you were folding paper cranes.

610
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,260
Not only that.

611
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,580
She also asked me to call Dr. Lin

612
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,900
on the fly-tree dumplings

613
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,340
the patients you helped

614
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,260
and their families to pray together.

615
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,060
In the end, many people really want to meet.

616
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,220
They said that folding a thousand paper cranes

617
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,660
can make a wish.

618
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,660
There are exactly a thousand here.

619
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,460
Everyone folds it together.

620
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,060
Everyone's wish is that

621
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,620
your mother can wake up soon

622
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,020
and live a long life.

623
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,060
Thank you.

624
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,060
After folding a thousand paper cranes,

625
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,300
she is really tired.

626
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,420
No way.

627
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,060
There are many people.

628
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,340
It's not difficult for us to have so many people.

629
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,660
Besides,

630
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,660
Mrs. Lin is an old friend of mine for decades.

631
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,260
I hope she can be safe and sound this time.

632
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,020
Cousin.

633
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,580
There is a blessing card here.

634
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,060
Everyone has written blessings

635
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,020
and signed the name.

636
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,820
After you write it,

637
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,500
we plan to take it to the hospital to give it to my aunt.

638
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
And the blessing of the fly-tree dumplings,

639
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,020
my blessing,

640
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,420
everyone's blessing.

641
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,220
Your mother must be fine.

642
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,340
No matter what,

643
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,940
we will support you.

644
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,780
The most important thing is to hold on.

645
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,780
Come on, cousin.

646
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,260
Okay.

647
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,820
Let's write blessings together

648
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,860
and give it to Mrs. Lin.

649
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:46,940
Mother.

650
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,140
Thank you.

651
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,980
I will be fine

652
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,940
with your blessing.

653
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,260
Thank you.

654
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,660
To close the door,

655
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,180
I am going to open the door for you.

656
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,060
Father is really impressive.

657
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,300
Father Yongqi, you motherboard

658
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,180
Chart orchestral

659
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,700
Yuan Long

660
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,940
abstractock

661
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:31,300
and

662
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,140
Eudogenous

663
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,820
Did you know

664
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,740
Yuan Long

665
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,300
was the son of IRA

666
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,460
It's said that

667
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,060
Yuan Long was Min monitor

668
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,060
They're planning to sell the factory and pay for it.

669
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,060
I want to ask if we can stop them legally.

670
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Mr. Ling is Mrs. Ling's relative.

671
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,060
He has the right to apply for custody.

672
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:03,060
He can use his agency to exercise Mrs. Ling's right to be the member of the board of directors.

673
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,060
How long will it take for the court to approve the custody?

674
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,060
I'm afraid I'll save their father and son and think of other reasons to fight for the board of directors.

675
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,060
It depends on whether you apply for custody or not.

676
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Who can object?

677
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Is it his uncle's family?

678
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Mr. Ling's uncle is Mrs. Ling's relative.

679
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,060
They have the right to apply for Mrs. Ling's custody.

680
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Mr. Ling's agency is competing with Ren Yuan You You.

681
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Mr. Ling's uncle and his family may use this to fight against each other.

682
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,060
It will increase the conflict between the two companies.

683
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,060
This proves that Mr. Ling is not suitable to apply for Mrs. Ling's custody.

684
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I've dealt with this kind of case before.

685
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,060
It's embarrassing to see two families killing each other.

686
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,060
Amina, your cousin knows you want custody.

687
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
He will attack you.

688
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,060
But it doesn't matter. I'll keep an eye on the sale and sale.

689
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Your father's factory can't be lost to them.

690
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Mr. Ling's father is a good man.

691
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,060
I can't be afraid of being destroyed for my parents' efforts.

692
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,060
Hang the paper crane on Mrs. Ling's bed.

693
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:32,060
When she wakes up, she'll be happy to see the paper crane with her.

694
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,060
We have to hang thousands of paper cranes for a long time.

695
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Don't worry. I've got the tools.

696
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,060
And we have three hands. We can handle it soon.

697
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Excuse me. Are you the fan of the flying dumplings?

698
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Yes.

699
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Really? My daughter likes you very much.

700
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,060
She's like you. She's sitting on a wheelchair.

701
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,060
When she saw your painting, your energy encouraged her.

702
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,060
She's getting up. Thank you so much.

703
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,060
You're welcome. I have to thank your daughter's support.

704
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Is it convenient for her to see you upstairs?

705
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
I want to encourage her.

706
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Now...

707
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Go. She'll be happy to see you.

708
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,060
Don't worry. We have time. I'll go with you.

709
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
Okay. I'll go with you.

710
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,060
Yingying, you go first. We'll go to you later.

711
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
No problem. I'll take care of it.

712
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Thank you. This way.

713
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Okay.

714
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,060
Aunt, look. What is my dad doing for you?

715
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
He's washing your hands.

716
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,060
You have to wake up quickly.

717
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Can you stop looking at your face?

718
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
She's your sister.

719
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,060
Relax. You have to wash your hands and feet after that.

720
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,060
I told you to relax. I didn't ask you to smile.

721
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,060
How could you smile when your sister is lying on the bed?

722
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,060
You should think about it.

723
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Can we stop doing this?

724
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
I won't do it.

725
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
You're her brother.

726
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Only you can apply for custody.

727
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,060
The lawyer told us that the court values the most

728
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,060
and cares about our aunt the most.

729
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Let the judge give you the right to custody.

730
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
We need to take care of our aunt.

731
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Let the judge feel our emotional connection.

732
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
This way, we can get the people.

733
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Do you think it's useful for us to do this?

734
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,060
While you're still awake,

735
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,060
let's sell the shares to the people and take some money.

736
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Are you crazy?

737
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,060
We're one step away from passing this.

738
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,060
You said the surface of the door, right?

739
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Then you should act better.

740
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
Wipe her hands and feet every day.

741
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Just take you as your brother.

742
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,060
I'm not as good as you.

743
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,060
I can't take care of myself.

744
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,060
Do you know that

745
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,060
I can't sleep well these days?

746
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
When I close my eyes,

747
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,060
I remember how you pushed your sister down the stairs.

748
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,060
I really can't imagine.

749
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,060
If I really wake up, how can I face her?

750
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
She's so old.

751
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,060
She can wake up.

752
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,060
Look at her.

753
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
She's half dead.

754
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
She should be soon.

755
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
What did you say?

756
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
You're still yelling at me?

757
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Are you crazy?

758
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
What did you hear?

759
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Help!

760
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
Hello?

761
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
Does Rachel have a autism?

762
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,060
She wears a glowing shoe every day.

763
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
It's cold!

764
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
Don't come to me.

765
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Don't come to me.

766
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
Don't follow me.

767
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
Natalie.

768
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Yingying, why are you crying?

769
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
What happened?

770
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
I'm sorry.

771
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I'm sorry.

772
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm sorry.

773
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Don't cry.

774
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
What happened?

775
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,060
I...

776
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,060
I went to the hospital.

777
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,060
I saw two bad people.

778
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,060
I'm so scared.

779
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm hiding now.

780
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
What bad people?

781
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
Why are you hiding?

782
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
I...

783
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,060
I heard them talking.

784
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Then he found me.

785
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
I ran.

786
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
He was chasing me.

787
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
Where are you now?

788
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Here.

789
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Where?

790
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,060
C...Cihan Hospital.

791
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,060
Cihan Hospital.

792
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
I don't know where it is.

793
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
It's okay.

794
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Tell me what's nearby.

795
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,060
There are some white square boxes.

796
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
Don't go away.

797
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,060
I'll find someone to help you.

798
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Okay.

799
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
I'll go back now.

800
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Good bye.

801
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Why are there paper boxes all over the place?

802
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Didn't Yingying take the thing?

803
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
What happened?

804
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,060
Yingying.

805
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Where did she go?

806
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
Yingying.

807
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,060
Sister, sister, sister.

808
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
It's gone.

809
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
Dad is gone.

810
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
He didn't answer my call.

811
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,060
No, dad is gone.

812
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Natalie will find me.

813
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,060
Wait here.

814
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
Wait here.

815
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,060
Doctor Ling, Ying Ying is missing in the hospital.

816
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
No one answered her call.

817
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,060
Jia Jun and I are looking for her.

818
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
How is it?

819
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
She doesn't answer the phone now.

820
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
But she can't get through the phone.

821
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Maybe her phone is out of battery.

822
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,060
Ying Ying is different from before.

823
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
She will go out by herself.

824
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,060
She is much more stable than before.

825
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,060
I think she can be.

826
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,060
Don't worry.

827
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,060
But she hasn't been like this for a long time.

828
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
She is more worried about her son.

829
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
What happened?

830
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
It's okay.

831
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Don't worry.

832
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
Let's go in and have a look.

833
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Jia Jun, Jingzhi.

834
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm sorry.

835
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Xiaomei, Ren Weiming.

836
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
Sis.

837
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
What's wrong?

838
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
Don't be afraid. Why are you crying?

839
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
Don't be afraid. We are here.

840
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Don't be afraid.

841
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
Why are you standing here?

842
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
How far is the road to Xianyong?

843
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
You are so afraid of being found.

844
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Why did you stop me just now?

845
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Are you sick?

846
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Don't chase.

847
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Go. Go. Go.

848
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Go.

849
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
If you hit her,

850
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
she will be killed.

851
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
I don't want you to make a mistake.

852
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Or,

853
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
you talked to her about the factory.

854
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Sis fell down the stairs by accident.

855
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
You can't even pull her down.

856
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
How about this?

857
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Go to the police station to prepare for the case.

858
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Tell them it's an accident.

859
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Go to the police station by yourself.

860
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
You were there.

861
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,060
You said you didn't pull her down.

862
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,060
But you pushed her down.

863
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,060
Why should I help you?

864
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
What?

865
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
You dare not to be carried, but you want me to turn myself in?

866
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,060
If you weren't so coward,

867
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,060
I would have solved her just now.

868
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
Do I have to be afraid with you?

869
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
You are not.

870
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Are you sick?

871
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
You really want to kill her?

872
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
What can I do if I don't?

873
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Go to jail.

874
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
No.

875
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
How can you say she is my sister?

876
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,060
If we admit our mistakes to her,

877
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
I think she will forgive us.

878
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
Even if she let us go,

879
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
her son won't.

880
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
What can we do?

881
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
What can we do?

882
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
What can we do?

883
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
What can we do?

884
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
We act on the spot now.

885
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,060
Natalie said Rachel has autism.

886
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
She doesn't talk normally.

887
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Maybe they think she is talking nonsense.

888
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
What's wrong, sister?

889
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Here.

890
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
This tea can calm your nerves.

891
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
Drink it.

892
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
It will be better.

893
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Jingzhi and Jiajun can't find you.

894
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
They are worried about you.

895
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
You are in the ward.

896
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
Why did you go downstairs?

897
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Did you meet something?

898
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Today, I had a fight with Jingzhi and Jiajun.

899
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,060
Jiajun sent the paper and the card

900
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,060
to aunt Lin.

901
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I went to the door of the ward.

902
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I dropped some paper and card at the door.

903
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
When I picked it up,

904
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I heard two men arguing in the room.

905
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,060
They were very loud, fierce and scared.

906
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
What did they say?

907
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
Do you remember?

908
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Just wipe his hands and feet every day.

909
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Just be your 24-year-old brother.

910
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm not as good as you.

911
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I really can't imagine

912
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
how I will face him if he wakes up.

913
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
He is so young.

914
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
He can't wake up.

915
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,060
He even said that to sell the factory.

916
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
He even said that to sell the factory.

917
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Are these two men

918
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,060
older and darker skinned?

919
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,060
And one is younger and fair skinned.

920
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Both of them wear glasses, right?

921
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Yes.

922
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,060
How do you know they are so scary?

923
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
How are they scary?

924
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
Jingzhi called.

925
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,060
My phone is ringing.

926
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
They saw me.

927
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
Then they chased me.

928
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,060
I'm really scared that they are so scary and so loud.

929
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
They chased me.

930
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
Are they the two men?

931
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,060
Look.

932
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Yes.

933
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
Yes.

934
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,060
Is there any humanity?

935
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
They don't want aunt to wake up.

936
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Why did they chase you?

937
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
And you said they had a fight.

938
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
But what you said just now

939
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,060
is not a fight.

940
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
What else did they say?

941
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,060
I didn't sleep well these days.

942
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,060
When I closed my eyes,

943
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,060
I remembered how you pushed the stairs that day.

944
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
If you have the habit of snoring,

945
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,060
you should pay attention to it.

946
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
Snoring is not because you sleep well.

947
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,060
It may be because your brain is short of oxygen.

948
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,060
You can massage the muscles

949
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
and relax the neck

950
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
with the oil that contains mint.

951
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
If you don't care about it,

952
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
you may become insomnia.

953
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
I'm sorry.

954
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,060
I'm sorry.

955
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,060
I'm sorry.

956
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
I'm sorry.

957
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060
I'm sorry.

958
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,060
I'm sorry.

959
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
I'm sorry.

960
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,060
I'm sorry.

961
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,060
I'm sorry.

962
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,060
I'm sorry.

963
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm sorry.

964
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,060
I'm sorry.

965
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
I'm sorry.

966
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
I'm sorry.
