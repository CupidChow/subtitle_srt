1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You know Deng Shikang is a scumbag.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why do you still help him to hurt my brother and Rachel?

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I help you.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How can you treat me like this?

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've been using you.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you think I owe you?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You want it so much, right?

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Come on.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I told you to come.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You dare not.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A'zu.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A'zu, don't scare me.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A'zu, wake up.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A'zu.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Liang Yanzu, wake up.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A'zu.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A'zu.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's wrong with you?

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How could this happen?

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You...

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You have nosebleed and fainted.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you okay?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm fine.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm fine.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't push yourself.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm fine.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're so stubborn.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm fine. I'll go by myself.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A'zu.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A'zu.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Your spine is almost forty degrees.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not a good мояoka.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Shut your mouth.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:51,660
Honestly, I don't like talking about my

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,100
operation withClint ini.

67
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,520
You go to poo at your American and American

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,500
level and brothers chinas.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
I will be very optimistic.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,200
Why don't we try acupuncture,

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,700
push-ups, and pull-ups?

72
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,400
We will continue to work on strengthening your muscles.

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Try to achieve left-right balance.

74
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
We will try to avoid surgery as our goal.

75
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
Okay, I will try my best.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I will help you with the breathing.

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,800
Acupuncture stimulates the nerves.

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,300
It allows the blood to flow through the veins.

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,600
It is good for the liver and kidney.

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,400
The muscles are strong.

81
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Push-ups are not just for pressing.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,500
It is to relax the muscles of the spine.

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,600
It helps the joints to be in balance.

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,800
This is a pull-up machine.

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
It simulates the human body.

86
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,300
The spine naturally stretches.

87
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,200
It allows you to relax your spine.

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Be careful.

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,000
How is it, Jingzhi?

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
How do you feel after the acupuncture?

91
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,700
I think after a few treatments,

92
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,900
I feel better when I am breathing.

93
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,300
Also,

94
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,000
my back is not that stiff.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,900
It is probably not your psychological effect.

96
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,500
Of course not.

97
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,200
It is your credit, Doctor Ling.

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,100
No, it is the credit of the Chinese medicine.

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,200
You are cured. You can eat roasted duck.

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
It smells so good.

101
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,900
Who told you to keep your mouth shut?

102
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,600
You should eat chicken.

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
But you don't even give me the skin.

104
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
It is too bland.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,300
I will treat you to a piece.

106
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,400
If you don't have the skin,

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
just one piece.

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,000
Right?

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800
It is all because I asked you to be more proactive.

110
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,700
It is not good to eat roasted duck together now.

111
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Uncle, I will get you a cup of tea.

112
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,000
You don't have to be so polite.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,100
I am disturbing your date.

114
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
There is no such thing. Mom, it is just a time-out.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,900
By the way, Mom, what are you looking for me for?

116
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,700
Oh, right.

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,100
This is the transfer of the shares.

118
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,000
I plan to transfer all the shares of my company to you.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
Please sign it.

120
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,900
Mom, why did you suddenly transfer the shares to me?

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,700
I want to focus on the transfer of the shares to the clinic.

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,800
And I really don't want to have any more conflicts with Uncle and the others.

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Since I can walk and move,

124
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,800
I want to hand it over to you personally.

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
This way, I can be at ease.

126
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,100
Auntie, do you have any problems with your body?

127
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,000
Huh?

128
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
No, no.

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,700
Mom, tell me the truth.

130
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Do you have something to hide from me?

131
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Sister, I am sorry.

132
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,400
What is it? Don't scare me.

133
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,100
That day, when we went to the Law Firm,

134
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,900
A'Keng saw us.

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Later, Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law came to my house and kept asking.

136
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,700
I had no choice but to tell them.

137
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,300
I know that it has nothing to do with you.

138
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,400
It is only because I have caused you trouble.

139
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
Don't say that.

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,000
I suspect that they are currently thinking of a way

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,600
to get you the position of chairman.

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
You must be careful.

143
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Don't let them have any chance to take advantage of it.

144
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Arrange it early and plan ahead.

145
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,000
How should I say it? It is your father's hard work.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
He wants to find you to keep an eye on it.

147
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,800
But I really can't find the time to take care of the matters of the task.

148
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Then, this way.

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
I will leave this document with you for now.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,900
You think about it carefully.

151
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,800
I won't rush you.

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
I hope that you are willing to do it.

153
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,600
Are you still thinking about transferring the shares?

154
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know how to answer that.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Are you really that resistant?

156
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
No. Since the Law Firm was established,

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,700
I really want to be a Chinese doctor who is focused on treating patients

158
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,200
and can help them.

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,400
I can see that you are spending more time in the clinic than in the grocery store.

160
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,800
It is thanks to you that I am able to manage the company.

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,200
I really don't know how to give my heart to Ren Yuan.

162
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,600
But thinking about those evil snakes and gods,

163
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
I also understand why you don't want to touch them.

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,700
But Auntie is so persistent.

165
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,800
If you refuse, you must be a little more sincere.

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
You are really very good at talking.

167
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
But I will leave it to you to think about it.

168
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Okay. I can do it.

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Are you my support?

170
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,200
You are so tired. Why don't you rest?

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are you doing here?

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You dropped it.

173
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,200
Thank you.

174
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,000
A'zuo, are you actually sick?

175
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
It's just a headache, so I am taking painkillers.

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,800
How could it be just a headache? It's so simple.

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
There are some ingredients in it. I already checked.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
Are you sick?

179
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,600
It's a very severe headache, so I am taking this.

180
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't lie to me. You can tell me.

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You can tell me.

182
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,200
It's just painkillers. Don't think too much about it.

183
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Don't tell my big brother about the medicine. Promise me.

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Big Brother!

185
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,600
Why are you here?

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,200
I just took my guests to see the room. I happened to pass by.

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You go in with Rachel first. Don't let the room have work.

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Go, go, go.

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,200
President Liang, I really came to care about you.

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,600
Are you really going to ignore me?

191
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,400
Just now, I thought you returned it to me.

192
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
From now on, we won't owe each other anything.

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Nurse, I want to make an appointment to see a doctor tomorrow.

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, no problem.

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,600
When will our clinic invite another person?

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You can come tomorrow at the right time.

197
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
Thank you.

198
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Sister, you are just like a nurse.

199
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you alone?

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,400
Mom went to the market to buy groceries and told me to wait here.

201
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
That bear was changing the light bulb on the second floor.

202
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
She told me to watch the store.

203
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
You don't have any sense of responsibility.

204
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
There is only one person in the entire clinic.

205
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,200
It's not enough.

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Should we invite another person?

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
It's not easy to invite someone now.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Ling Wei Min, I've already helped you organize the goods.

209
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,400
Thank you, Ying Yi. You are really a good helper.

210
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Sister, you are so great.

211
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
That's right. We are inviting people.

212
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
How about inviting Ying Yi?

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Ying Yi, if I invite you to help, is that okay?

214
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
Invite me to work?

215
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
That's right. I will pay you.

216
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,200
Sister, can I really go to work?

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
Of course, you can.

218
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
You are better than that bear.

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
You should sit in his seat.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,600
Then I can earn money to buy things for my parents and sister.

221
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
You guys have been taking care of me for so long.

222
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I can earn money to buy things for you guys.

223
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Take care of you guys.

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,700
Wait for me, OK?

225
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Why aren't you signing for the attempt to kill me?

226
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
That's right, it's not enough.

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Stop Wolfing Station' money, stop it.

228
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,600
That's understand?

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,800
One,flap Day Few

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,760
We can use the company's money to make the

231
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm sure we can find a way to squeeze out this money

232
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,200
We need at least eight million to turn over

233
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:58,840
Did you help me order blood pressure

234
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,920
Is it good

235
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,440
Mrs. Huang gave it to me

236
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Help me open the cheque

237
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
What to open

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,840
You hurry up and return it to Mrs. Huang

239
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,280
We don't have money to help you return it to her

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,560
Now your baby son

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,720
The wrong news is going to the stock market

242
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Every month, the interest is only six micro-dollars

243
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Still spend money

244
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,880
Sorry mom

245
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,920
I just want to fight

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,600
Buy the shares back from my aunt

247
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Let Ren Yuan really belong to our Deng family

248
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,000
If we don't even have Ren Yuan

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,240
Our family will have nothing left

250
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,720
But it doesn't matter

251
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,160
Our Ren Yuan is such a big company

252
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
I don't believe there is no place

253
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,240
Can let us squeeze out the money

254
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I don't believe we can't get through this

255
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,720
57, 58, 59

256
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Go to work at the hall

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,680
The hospital is registered

258
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
Depart on time

259
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,320
Sister, have you brought the bento and water bottle

260
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Yes

261
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,680
Fried western-style bento

262
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,840
Crispy and delicious

263
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,760
Sister, you remember to listen to the doctor's words in the hospital

264
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
If you don't understand

265
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,400
Remember to ask others, do you know

266
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,160
If you don't understand, ask others

267
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Depart

268
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,000
Sister, how about let dad send you to the hospital

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,960
No, I'm going to work, not school

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,040
Adults go to work by themselves

271
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,520
No need for someone to send

272
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,280
Sister has grown up

273
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Dad, mom believes you

274
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,680
Bye

275
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Bye, take care

276
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,640
Bye, daughter

277
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,240
Be careful on the road

278
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,760
Dad, why are you following me

279
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,360
This is not right

280
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
I'm really worried

281
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
Do you remember where that little eight is

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,600
Just at the intersection ahead

283
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,320
How about this, you take me there

284
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,800
Ok, just this time

285
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,120
Ok, just this time

286
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:51,000
We're going to get in the car, or there's no room

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,040
No way

288
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll go with you, just a ride

289
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't do it yourself

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,480
Ok, be careful

291
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
Remember to call me when you get to the hospital

292
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,280
I know, call

293
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
Bye, dad

294
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,480
Bye

295
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Yan Yin, Yan Yin, here

296
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
Hello

297
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Do you remember me

298
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,360
Yes, I remember, my little sister's friend, Natalie

299
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,040
Yes, I'm Natalie

300
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,360
Oh, I just saw you, I suddenly remembered

301
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,400
Don't you like this pair of shinning shoes

302
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,360
Look

303
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes, it's beautiful, shiny

304
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,760
How do you know

305
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,640
Because I went to buy it with your sister that day

306
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,240
But there was no goods that day

307
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,320
But she's refueling now

308
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,960
Because I actually know the shop's staff

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
She can help me keep the goods

310
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,320
How much do you wear, I'll keep it for you

311
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Thirty-eight

312
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,680
But it's my first day at work today

313
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,760
I don't have money for you yet

314
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,800
It's okay, I'll pay for you first

315
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,480
You pay me after you get paid

316
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,160
You're a good person

317
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,520
Right, Yan Yin

318
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,720
But you have to remember

319
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,520
Don't tell your sister

320
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
You know she's so nice to you

321
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,000
Tell her, she'll pay you

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,920
You can't use the money you make

323
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
To buy it for yourself

324
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
No

325
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
No

326
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,720
How's it going, Aiden

327
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,040
How much can we take

328
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,560
After you called me that day

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,080
I asked my colleagues to do it right away

330
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,680
But I found your house

331
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,280
Has been mortgaged to the financial company

332
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,640
Our bank can't do the second case

333
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,720
I just need a few million

334
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
I can't even do this

335
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Our staff is old and good

336
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,160
They make money every year

337
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
You're afraid we can't pay you back

338
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,080
Sorry, I don't mean to help you

339
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,160
But does the bank have the rules of the bank

340
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm straight

341
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
You've made so much money

342
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,480
If I give you more

343
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,000
It's hard to explain to the bank

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
I think you must have other ways

345
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,240
Please

346
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Dad, let's go

347
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Henry, I'll tell you the truth

348
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,200
Your house

349
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Is really hard to get money

350
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,240
But you have a factory

351
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,840
You saved the shop

352
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
But you have 10 million

353
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,280
57, 58, 59

354
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Off work

355
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,640
Sorry, the clinic is closed

356
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,040
I have to see the doctor tomorrow

357
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,800
I can help you register

358
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm not here to see the doctor

359
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm here to find someone

360
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,920
Find someone

361
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
Who are you looking for

362
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,080
I'm Dr. Lin's mother

363
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,240
I brought her soup

364
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,440
Lin Wei Min's mother

365
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,840
She left for the food delivery

366
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,040
I didn't expect to call her first

367
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,280
You're the new nurse

368
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,920
Yes, I'm working today

369
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,440
My name is Luo Ying Ying

370
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Luo Ying Ying

371
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,800
Rachel's name is Luo Ying Chen

372
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
Then you are

373
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
She's my sister

374
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
I'm sister

375
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I brought it all

376
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,640
This is apple, pear, pear

377
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,080
Peanuts

378
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,280
The people in the north and south cook lean meat soup

379
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,640
I think everyone is suitable to drink

380
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Don't waste it

381
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
No soup

382
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,200
How could this be

383
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,040
You have no memory

384
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,840
You should let Lin Wei Min drink

385
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,600
Not me

386
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,840
My maid has a bad memory

387
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,400
She forgot to pour the soup in

388
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,160
Wait for me to talk to her

389
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,800
I know how to go back

390
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,840
A Min

391
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,280
What's wrong, you won a big prize

392
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,240
Really won a prize

393
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,080
Just received the notice from the medical industry

394
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,480
We won the jealousy sales prize

395
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
And our sales this week

396
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,040
25.8% higher than last year

397
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,440
Our sales is higher than last year

398
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,400
What a coincidence

399
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I'll kill the father and son next time

400
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,440
Of course

401
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't make trouble every day

402
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
I often say that it's not our turn

403
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
The most important thing is that we

404
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Do well

405
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
I finally understand

406
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
Actually, your boyfriend

407
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,080
It's all those words

408
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,680
Aren't you bored

409
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,000
This is called stability and security

410
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You don't understand

411
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
Brother, let's talk about business

412
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,840
I like to listen to business

413
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,440
Just say it

414
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,440
Actually, we have all made progress

415
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Have you ever thought about listed

416
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,920
I want to knock on that wheel before I die

417
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Is it handsome

418
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,200
I didn't think about this

419
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,640
But i really thought

420
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Selling some profit

421
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,440
To set up a grassroots medical fund

422
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,320
To help children like Qian Zai

423
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,840
In fact, you charge so cheap

424
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,760
What's the difference with being a medical worker

425
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,280
For example, you say

426
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Medical treatment or listed

427
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm Ami

428
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,280
I'm glad to see you support him so much

429
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
You go home and have a light dinner

430
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,520
Hey, it's not that I can't say enough

431
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,920
I gave the fitting clothes to the neighbors of Shanshui

432
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,640
Hey, are you going to the award ceremony on Friday?

433
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,920
I want to see a few patients

434
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm afraid I can't go

435
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
You can go for me, it's the same

436
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,120
Okay, why don't we go to the palace tonight

437
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
it is good

438
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Go

439
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,560
Zuo, what's wrong

440
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,280
I'm fine

441
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,760
Are you dizzy

442
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,240
No

443
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,800
You're wrong

444
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,280
No

445
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,400
Where else is uncomfortable

446
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,280
Where is comfortable

447
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,320
Come on, stand up first

448
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,960
Don't move

449
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,760
Let me help you take the pulse

450
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,280
No, I watched the ball too late last night

451
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,720
I'm too tired, it's okay

452
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,440
Really

453
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm really fine

454
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,520
I'll get it done now

455
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,240
Go back and sleep for a while

456
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,760
I'll go watch the ball again

457
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,400
Are you really okay

458
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,200
It's okay

459
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,640
You go celebrate

460
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,520
Have fun

461
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,560
Eat happily

462
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:37,960
Don't worry about me

463
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,080
Then be careful

464
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,240
Okay, I'll sleep first after watching the ball today

465
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,680
You don't have to come back too early

466
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,360
I know you don't want to do the operation

467
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,880
But if you don't deal with it

468
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,520
A lot of nervous system diseases will appear slowly

469
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Including your headache will be increased

470
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,120
Eyebrows and hands shivering

471
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,440
Even affect your memory and consciousness

472
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,320
Eating painkillers can only temporarily not hurt

473
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,000
If you insist on not doing the operation

474
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,360
I can't force you

475
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,720
But if you drag it down again

476
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,760
Will appear

477
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,040
I'm sorry

478
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm sorry

479
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
I'm sorry

480
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,240
I'm sorry

481
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm sorry

482
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,640
I'm sorry

483
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,800
There will be serious symptoms

484
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,440
Such as diarrhea or diarrhea

485
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,360
The tumor will suppress your nerves

486
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,120
That might be too late

487
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,640
The End

488
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,040
Miss Luo

489
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,320
Congratulations

490
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,360
Thank you

491
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,960
Maymaitong won this award

492
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,400
All because of your support

493
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,440
I didn't expect Maymaitong

494
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
She won the award within six months.

495
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,840
It's all thanks to Miss Luo.

496
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
When the new product was on sale,

497
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
she came to my shop every day

498
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,040
and said the goods were here and there.

499
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,440
She kept an eye on them.

500
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,840
The sales of the three types of oil

501
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,640
are not inferior to the one of the staff.

502
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,840
It's a complete defeat of their monopoly.

503
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Of course.

504
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
It's easy to sell the same three types of oil.

505
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I want to make more orders with you.

506
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes.

507
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
Once I put them on sale, the goods will be sold out.

508
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Customers often ask me when I will stock up.

509
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
We will increase the production.

510
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,440
We will leave it to the three of you.

511
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
You said it.

512
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,040
No problem.

513
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,840
Miss Luo, we are leaving.

514
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,440
Thank you. Bye.

515
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Miss Luo, we are leaving.

516
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,840
Bye.

517
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,640
We have made a deal.

518
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
Don't forget to put them on sale.

519
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
I will leave it to you.

520
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,840
Okay.

521
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Thank you for your support.

522
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,440
Bye.

523
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,440
Rachel, congratulations.

524
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,440
You have made the sales successful.

525
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,240
I warn you.

526
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,440
Don't get close to Rachel.

527
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,640
It's a big court.

528
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,640
What can I do to you?

529
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
Don't give me another chance.

530
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
I will punch you more.

531
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,240
Rachel is my girlfriend.

532
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
If you dare to do something bad to her,

533
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,040
I will not let you go.

534
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,040
Nothing?

535
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,040
Nothing.

536
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,840
Don't you want to see it?

537
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,640
I will come to pick you up as soon as I see it.

538
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,040
You were so manly just now.

539
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Really?

540
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,840
If you do something bad to my girlfriend again,

541
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,040
I will punch you again.

542
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
You are right.

543
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
I am aunt.

544
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Aunt, what's wrong?

545
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Ming, I am in the hospital.

546
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
I am accompanying my sister to see the doctor.

547
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
You'd better come here.

548
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
I will come here now.

549
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,440
Miss De, I saw your brain scan.

550
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,640
I saw that you have a tear, starch, protein, and dust.

551
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
Usually, you will have such a index of dementia.

552
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Dementia is the old age eating the egg?

553
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,440
I really have an old age eating the egg.

554
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,640
We have done a cognitive assessment with you before.

555
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
Is it CD2?

556
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Yes.

557
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Miss De's CD2 score is 0.5.

558
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
Mom, it's okay.

559
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,440
It's just a mild cognitive disorder.

560
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,040
It's not a physical disorder.

561
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,040
It's okay.

562
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,240
Sir, you know a lot.

563
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,040
I am a registered Chinese medicine doctor.

564
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,040
Miss De's short-term memory is relatively poor now.

565
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
But other functions are not affected.

566
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,040
It's not much of an impact on daily life.

567
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
What can we do?

568
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
Family members should help her.

569
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,640
Especially in memory.

570
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
Teach her to use her phone to give her a hint.

571
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,640
Make a schedule.

572
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Remind her.

573
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,240
These can help her.

574
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Thank you, doctor.

575
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
We will take good care of her.

576
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,040
Gouqi chrysanthemum tea.

577
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,640
It's light and dry.

578
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
So good.

579
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,440
I have had a lot of contact with you.

580
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,640
By the way,

581
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,240
you have read so many medical books.

582
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
You still don't have any clue?

583
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Because patients

584
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
won't get sick based on medical books.

585
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,240
It's based on personal body system,

586
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
diagnosis, and diagnosis.

587
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
There are many mixed situations.

588
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,240
And that person is my mom.

589
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,440
I know that family members are the most difficult to treat.

590
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Loss of consciousness,

591
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,840
sex,

592
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
and natural

593
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,240
If you can catch the disease

594
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,440
and then treat it with a medical book,

595
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,440
you can get some effect.

596
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't understand.

597
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
But I know that

598
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
you can do something.

599
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,840
You can help your aunt.

600
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,040
You know what she wants you to do most.

601
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
But...

602
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,640
We just got together.

603
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
Isn't it too soon?

604
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,040
No, it's okay.

605
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,440
Actually, I'm okay.

606
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,640
Just get divorced.

607
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I'm with you.

608
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
It's a big topic of marriage.

609
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,640
I'm okay.

610
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,040
No, I didn't mean that.

611
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,040
I mean the transfer of shares.

612
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
Uncle.

613
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
That's it.

614
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
Now that I think about it,

615
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
I think aunt

616
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,840
must have noticed her illness.

617
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,240
So she wants to transfer the shares to you.

618
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,440
So you should think about it.

619
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,240
I will think about it.

620
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
I will think about it seriously.

621
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,840
Okay.

622
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,040
As for what you just said,

623
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I will think about it seriously.

624
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
Then take a shower and sleep.

625
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
I know you are tired today.

626
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,440
But I want to talk to you for a while.

627
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,040
I want to talk to you too.

628
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,240
But I think you need to rest.

629
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay.

630
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Okay, good night.

631
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
I will pay you back.

632
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
I don't believe you.

633
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,040
But you can't even pay me back.

634
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,040
How can I believe you?

635
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
I will pay you back.

636
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
I will pay you back this time.

637
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,240
If you don't pay me back,

638
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,840
I will go to the hospital

639
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
and pay you back.

640
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
I will pay you back this time.

641
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,840
Young master, why are you so angry?

642
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,640
You are being charged on the street.

643
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,640
Chao, you are wrong.

644
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
You are so mean.

645
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Look, your glasses are broken.

646
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,440
I am not so mean.

647
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,640
Because it's your classmate.

648
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
You are not so mean.

649
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
You framed me.

650
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Why did you frame me

651
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,640
when we have been classmates for so many years?

652
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
You remember us for so many years.

653
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,240
You have been classmates for so many years.

654
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,440
You brought me a green hat.

655
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Beat him.

656
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,040
It's a pit.

657
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,440
Stop, why did you beat him?

658
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,040
Pay the debt.

659
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,640
If he doesn't remember to pay the debt,

660
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I will remind him.

661
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,640
If you don't stop, I will call the police.

662
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,240
Call the police?

663
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,040
Three days, death sentence.

664
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040
Go.

665
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,040
Are you okay?

666
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,040
None of your business.

667
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
I will send you to the hospital.

668
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,440
Go away.

669
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,440
Don't pretend to be a man.

670
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,840
Why did you owe money to be beaten?

671
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,640
How much did you owe this time?

672
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,440
Are you happy?

673
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,240
I am so embarrassed.

674
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,240
You don't need to do my business.

675
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I want to do your business.

676
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,040
You didn't pay the debt.

677
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
You are annoying me.

678
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,040
Every time,

679
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
I use company money to pay your debt.

680
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
You only care about your company.

681
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,040
Don't pretend to be a great man.

682
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,040
So beautiful.

683
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Thank you, Natalie.

684
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
You are welcome.

685
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,440
Try it.

686
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,440
Finally, I have a shoe.

687
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,440
How is it?

688
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,040
Beautiful.

689
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,040
I am going to work.

690
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I will pay the debt to you.

691
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
You won't forget it.

692
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,440
Of course I know you won't forget it.

693
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Here.

694
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,840
By the way,

695
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
if you go back,

696
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,040
they will ask about your shoe.

697
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
How will you answer them?

698
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,040
Yes.

699
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
How will you answer them?

700
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
You just say that

701
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,440
you met a patient in the hospital.

702
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
You became good friends with him.

703
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,440
He gave you this.

704
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
No.

705
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
You can't lie.

706
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,040
I didn't lie.

707
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Have you forgotten?

708
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,440
The first time I met you

709
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
was in the hospital.

710
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
I am also a patient of Lin Weiming.

711
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,440
I didn't lie.

712
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Yes.

713
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
You are great.

714
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,440
I am leaving.

715
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,240
Don't be late.

716
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,040
I am going to work.

717
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,040
Let's go.

718
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Bye, Natalie.

719
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,640
Bye.

720
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
Be careful.

721
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,240
What do you want to do?

722
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,240
Why do you approach Ying Ying?

723
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
She is simple.

724
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,840
Don't mess with her.

725
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,440
What's wrong?

726
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,440
Are you afraid that I will eat her?

727
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,640
I know who you are.

728
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,040
You can use me.

729
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
Don't help that beast anymore.

730
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,240
Okay?

731
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
You are funny.

732
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,240
Take care of yourself first.

733
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
You are sick but you are so stubborn.

734
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,640
You want to be a good person.

735
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,840
No one will appreciate you.

736
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,240
They will only think you are stupid.

737
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
You think I am stupid

738
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,840
but I know you care about me.

739
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
This proves that you are not bad.

740
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,440
Don't help that loser anymore.

741
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,040
You are going to be with him.

742
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
You said you don't owe each other.

743
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Why do you care about me?

744
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
Because I like you.

745
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
I don't want to see you

746
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
and I can't go back.

747
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,440
Deng Shikang is a bitch.

748
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
You are a good person.

749
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,040
But I think being a bitch

750
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,240
is better than being a good person.

751
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,440
You have made so much.

752
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,240
What did you get?

753
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,040
Nothing.

754
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,440
I am just an orphan.

755
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,040
Now you take care of me like your own brother.

756
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,440
You even let me be the factory manager.

757
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,640
What do you mean you didn't get anything?

758
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,840
I have already got a lot.

759
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,240
I hate you for this.

760
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
You are willing to give up your life.

761
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,640
But I am different from you.

762
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,040
You think you are always worse than Lin Weiming.

763
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
But I don't think I am inferior to Luo Yingchen.

764
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,440
This is the difference between you and me.

765
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,440
Mom, do you feel uncomfortable?

766
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,640
No.

767
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Now you help me to drink.

768
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,640
It seems that I suddenly remember the past.

769
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,440
When your father was still alive,

770
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,440
I had a headache.

771
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
I was so worried.

772
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
I was so worried.

773
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,240
I was so worried.

774
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,440
I was so worried.

775
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
I was so worried.

776
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
I was so worried.

777
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,040
I was so worried.

778
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
I was so worried.

779
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,240
I had a headache.

780
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,440
He helped me to cure it.

781
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
I got this disease.

782
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,040
The closer I get, the more I don't remember.

783
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,240
The farther I get,

784
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,440
the more I remember.

785
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
Don't worry.

786
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,440
I will try my best to keep

787
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,040
the most precious memory for you.

788
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,840
Go.

789
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Don't be so smelly.

790
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,840
I am beaten like this.

791
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,240
What else do you want me to do?

792
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,640
Later in front of your aunt,

793
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,040
you just have to stand still.

794
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,440
You don't need to talk.

795
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Let me talk.

796
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,840
She is easy to be soft.

797
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
She is a son who will not die if she bowed down.

798
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,840
I don't want to bow down in front of Lin Weiming.

799
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,040
If you want to kneel down later, you kneel down yourself.

800
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,240
You can't.

801
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,240
At this time, you are still wriggling.

802
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
You can't.

803
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,640
You are still wriggling.

804
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
You want to be beaten again.

805
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,040
I have no dignity.

806
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,640
Can dignity be eaten as food?

807
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,440
Son, what is the most important now?

808
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,640
The most important thing is that your aunt

809
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,440
is willing to help us pass this level.

810
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Let's go, okay?

811
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,240
Go.

812
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,240
Okay, almost done.

813
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,440
A'min.

814
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,440
You are here.

815
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,040
Aunt.

816
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Richo, why are you here too?

817
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,240
Mom, I asked her to come to pick you up

818
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
and send you home.

819
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,440
Don't bother her.

820
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,240
I'm afraid I don't know how to go home.

821
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,840
Just call me

822
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
and ask Dolly to come downstairs.

823
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,040
That's enough.

824
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,040
Or you can ask me to send you home.

825
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
No.

826
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
I will tell Dolly later

827
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,840
about aunt's time for the check-up

828
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,640
and the medicine.

829
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,840
If there is anything to say,

830
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,040
I will tell you.

831
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,240
Yes.

832
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,040
If I tell Dolly,

833
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,840
I will also say nonsense.

834
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,440
Anyway,

835
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
Richo will be her own person sooner or later.

836
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,040
How about I

837
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,240
tell you about bank accounts,

838
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,840
bank account password,

839
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,240
and so on?

840
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm afraid I won't remember it later.

841
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,640
Aunt, I can help you remember it.

842
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,240
If you don't tell me,

843
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,640
it means you don't treat me as your own person.

844
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,840
You are still young.

845
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,440
You are still young to eat this kind of vinegar here.

846
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm not allowed to tell you that I'm young.

847
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
Sister.

848
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,640
Keng.

849
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Why are you so hurt?

850
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,440
I'm so bad.

851
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm so bad.

852
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,240
Sister.

853
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,440
Actually,

854
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,240
we have something to talk to you.

855
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
But there are too many people here.

856
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
How about we talk somewhere else?

857
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
Uncle, tell me the truth.

858
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,440
How much do you owe?

859
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
Owe money?

860
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
A'min, what else do you know?

861
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,440
Mom,

862
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,240
I saw Shikeng on the street that day.

863
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,840
What money?

864
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,640
We are not talking about money today.

865
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,440
I...

866
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,040
We are talking about shareholder rights.

867
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,640
Aunt Gu,

868
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,640
as the biggest shareholder and board member of our company,

869
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,240
you know that Mai Maitong

870
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,440
is our competitor.

871
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
You not only want to get her share,

872
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
but also go to see a doctor in her clinic.

873
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,040
What is the conflict of interests?

874
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,240
You fool.

875
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,840
She is a mother and son.

876
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,640
Do you want her to cut off the connection?

877
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,840
Hold on.

878
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,040
What's wrong with you?

879
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Sorry, sister.

880
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,240
We are leaving.

881
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,840
We are sorry.

882
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,240
We will come back another day.

883
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,040
I haven't finished yet.

884
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Look at this clinic.

885
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,240
This clinic is selling drugs.

886
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,640
It's Mai Maitong's retail store.

887
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Aunt, you are here

888
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,640
to help your opponent to promote

889
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
and to damage the interests of our company.

890
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,240
I will

891
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,840
report to the court

892
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,040
to withdraw your shareholder status.

893
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,040
Speaking of damaging the interests of the company,

894
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,440
you are experts.

895
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,240
Who used company money

896
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,640
to buy a house to buy a house for themselves?

897
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,840
You spent money on the company

898
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
and took a personal revenge.

899
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
I didn't help my mother to save her.

900
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
You are still here to report to the bad guys.

901
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,840
What about the shares that Aunt gave you?

902
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,440
It's obvious that she is helping Mai Maitong

903
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,640
to eat our members.

904
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,440
You two are not qualified to be shareholders.

905
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,240
I am your aunt.

906
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,440
What do you mean?

907
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,840
Mom, don't be angry.

908
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,440
Yes.

909
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,240
My mom wanted to give me the shares of the members.

910
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,840
I was going to refuse.

911
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
But when I saw

912
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,640
you made the members like this,

913
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I didn't want to interfere.

914
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,040
I will also interfere.

915
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
Let's meet in the board of directors.

916
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,240
You two are done

917
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
after my brother entered the board of directors.

918
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Keng was beaten.

919
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,640
He was in a bad mood.

920
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,440
That's why he talked nonsense.

921
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Don't make him angry.

922
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
I didn't talk nonsense.

923
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,840
Uncle, it's okay.

924
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
Please take him away.

925
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
This is a clinic,

926
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,440
not a place for people to make trouble.

927
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,240
Let's go.

928
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm sorry.

929
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,640
Let's go by ourselves.

930
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
After I signed my name,

931
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,240
I have more responsibilities.

932
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,840
You should have signed it long ago.

933
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,840
How could the pharmacy

934
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
be ruined by those father and son?

935
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,840
Yes.

936
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,440
I trusted my brother too much.

937
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
I gave him the shares

938
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,840
and made the company go bankrupt.

939
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
If you were here,

940
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,040
they wouldn't have been so impudent.

941
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,840
It would have saved my brother-in-law's life.

942
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,040
I understand.

943
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
If you refuse again,

944
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I will be unfilial.

945
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
Rui Chao went to pick up my mom.

946
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
When they come,

947
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,640
I will sign.

948
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,440
Aunt, I'm going to pick you up now.

949
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Rui Chao, you don't have to go upstairs to pick me up.

950
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,640
I'm in Chen Yun, a park near my house.

951
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
You can come to the park and find me directly.

952
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,240
Okay, call me when you get to the park.

953
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,040
Bye.

954
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,040
Sister.

955
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,440
Sister, good morning.

956
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,640
How do you know I'm here?

957
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,040
I bought your favorite vegetable buns.

958
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,640
I wanted to get it for you.

959
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,040
But you said you were in Chen Yun.

960
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,440
So I...

961
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,040
Come on.

962
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,040
Eat it, sister.

963
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,440
No, I've already eaten it.

964
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm sorry, sister.

965
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
Last time, A'Keng talked nonsense.

966
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,640
I've already told him.

967
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Don't be mad at him.

968
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,840
Now, except you,

969
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
no one can save us.

970
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,440
How can you owe so much money?

971
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,440
The stock is losing money.

972
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,840
I owe eight digits.

973
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,640
I'm waiting for eight million to save the money.

974
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Eight million?

975
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,440
I don't have that much money.

976
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,640
No, but...

977
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,240
You have assets.

978
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,240
How about this?

979
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,040
You can lend the money to the board of directors.

980
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
After I get the bonus,

981
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,840
I can pay it back slowly.

982
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,040
You brat.

983
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,640
You've been like this all your life.

984
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,440
Forget about the past.

985
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,240
I won't help you pay it back this time.

986
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,240
You should be careful.

987
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,240
No, sister.

988
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,040
Sister.

989
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,040
I know I was wrong.

990
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,840
I was wrong.

991
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,840
I deserve to die.

992
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,240
I... I'm useless.

993
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,240
I... I'm useless.

994
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,640
What are you doing?

995
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,240
Why are you standing up?

996
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,640
You're embarrassing me.

997
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,440
What are you doing?

998
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,240
No.

999
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,840
Son, we're begging for help.

1000
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,640
Sister, for the sake of dad,

1001
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,240
for the sake of my son,

1002
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
and for the sake of my grandson,

1003
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,240
don't you want us to be killed?

1004
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Don't you want to be the empress?

1005
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,640
Please.

1006
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,240
No, I don't want to help you.

1007
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,240
I don't have money.

1008
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,240
Fine.

1009
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,840
I'll lend you the money.

1010
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,840
Sign it.

1011
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,840
This is the agreement.

1012
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
What... what agreement?

1013
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,040
The factory.

1014
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,640
We'll have money to pay the debt

1015
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,040
if we sell the factory.

1016
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,640
You...

1017
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
You've been mistaken.

1018
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,840
You're stupid.

1019
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,640
How can we sell the factory?

1020
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,240
The factory is the foundation of Ren Yuan.

1021
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,040
Right.

1022
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,240
Sister, it's not that serious.

1023
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,840
We can rent the factory again.

1024
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,440
Or we can help him with the land.

1025
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,240
How about this?

1026
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,040
I promise you.

1027
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,440
If we pass this test,

1028
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,840
we'll let Wei Ming be the chairman.

1029
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,040
We'll leave Ren Yuan alone.

1030
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,840
Impossible.

1031
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,640
Anyway, the factory

1032
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
will not be sold.

1033
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
It's not worth it.

1034
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,240
This...

1035
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,440
Aunt,

1036
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
if you don't sign it today,

1037
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,640
don't expect to go somewhere else.

1038
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,640
Are you crazy?

1039
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Let go of me.

1040
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,840
You should apologize to aunt.

1041
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,440
What are you saying?

1042
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,440
You're a loser.

1043
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,640
Sign it now.

1044
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Sign it now.

1045
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
You've made Ren Yuan a bad person.

1046
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
I won't humiliate you anymore.

1047
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,440
I'll transfer all my shares to Ming.

1048
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,240
He'll punish you.

1049
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,840
Sister.

1050
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Sister.

1051
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Sister.

1052
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,040
The reason why the old man has no memory

1053
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,640
is not necessarily his age.

1054
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,040
The root cause is still the problem of

1055
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,240
the lack of blood in the roots and the neck.

1056
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
To promote the blood circulation,

1057
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,440
there are three ca sut pizza,

1058
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,840
allemaal,

1059
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:39,780
and

1060
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,240
top knowledge.

1061
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,640
friend
