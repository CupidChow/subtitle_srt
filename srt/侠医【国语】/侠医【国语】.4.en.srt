1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll beat you up!

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come on!

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Rachel, I'll watch her. We'll meet again another day.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's okay. We'll talk next time.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Cousin, you don't have time to send it. I'll help you.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Rachel, where are you going?

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, right. Can you send me back to the store?

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Back to the store?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You have to finish your work today.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm very busy. I have to finish it today.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, that's not true.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But it's better to take the opportunity to answer questions.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're really working hard.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Natalie, look.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The more you work, the more lazy you are.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm lucky to have you.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I completed my task this month.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I don't have to chase after you.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rachel didn't finish it, so I have to work harder.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But you have to eat to catch up with the sales.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Rachel, I've already booked a restaurant with Natalie.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's eat together.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Of course.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's better to be alone.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please sit down. Thank you.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Rachel.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The red shrimp noodles here are very famous.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll help you decide.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No need. I'll just have a salad.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going back to work later.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Rachel, don't be so sad.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's happier to eat together.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You treat my cousin the same way.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is that so?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or are you just trying to be nice?

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Or do you think I'm not a big enough client?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My business is worth 30 million.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
30 million?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
30 million and 2 million for the food service?

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Henry is Mr. Deng's son.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you're his relative.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No wonder you're all making medicinal oil.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I ordered a few bottles of wine from this restaurant.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll go pick one first.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't eat good food, so you should drink good wine.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't deal with a client like you.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why didn't you mention him?

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I took the money myself.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't want to leave it to you.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How's the business at Qi Long?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It should be done.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Really?

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But didn't the owner of the restaurant say it's worth 1 billion?

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The buyer and seller just met.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The owner agreed to 60 million.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's amazing.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm done.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You guys can continue.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going back to work.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Bye.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you can't bear to leave, don't just stand here and watch.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You should go after him

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and send him back to the company.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm interested in Rui Chao.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you unhappy?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course not.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm just a real estate agent.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do I have your list?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going back to work.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Bye.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you're not unhappy, just sit down.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You didn't let me sit next to you.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now you're keeping me.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You want to sit next to me?

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's a big mess.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You don't want me to let him sit next to you?

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't mind that he's sitting next to you.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't want to sit next to you either.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm just sitting in that seat.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I understand.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I hate it when people try to fight me.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For example, my cousin.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I helped his mom run a drugstore,

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but he bought a drugstore himself.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I'm very curious what they are doing with Rachel.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Could it be that they are putting their own people in?

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,700
That's good.

97
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,400
I think you should put your interest in Rachel on me.

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Because I know exactly what they are doing.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,300
Really, listen to me. Don't buy a seven-story building.

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,400
Is she buying a luxury house? We're buying a house.

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
I already told Miss Shen.

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,000
If you nod, she'll take you to see it. I'll go with her.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,800
No need. I've been looking for Miss Luo.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Miss Luo.

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Mr. Lin.

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes. I've found the right to the legal rights of the old lady.

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
After you've prepared the application documents,

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
you can go to the land and register for registration and re-enrollment.

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Wait for the building to be officially in the name of Grandma Ju.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,200
We'll then start the process of buying and selling.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
You've already done so many things in less than three hours.

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,200
I want to help you get this done as soon as possible.

113
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
I'm doing a temporary contract.

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Do you want to buy it in your own name or in the company's name?

115
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
If you don't want to buy a seven-story building, I'll buy a luxury house. Contact Miss Shen.

116
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Sorry, ignore her.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,200
If you don't mind the time being late, why don't we come out and face to face?

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,800
This seven-story building is already here before the war.

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
It's been almost a hundred years.

121
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Such a beautiful building, but in Hong Kong,

122
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,400
if you can demolish it, then demolish it. It's almost finished.

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
It's not even possible to rebuild it.

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,000
The legal rights now don't allow two pillars to occupy public space.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
It's not the same thing to rebuild it.

126
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,000
Before, you said that it's not to preserve an old building,

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,400
but to preserve a memory.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,800
I think you didn't say that because you wanted to coax Grandma Ju, right?

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
It's so beautiful, how can I bear to demolish it and rebuild it?

130
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,400
I've studied the emperor's inner history.

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Actually, the two pillars in the seven-story building are to preserve the old building's old politics.

132
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
The bottom of the seven-story building is open and flowy.

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,000
It's like our air-conditioning system, running in the essence.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,600
I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
The pillars can divide the space.

136
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,200
The seven-story building can cover the sun and rain.

137
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
It's practical and can enrich the city's scenery.

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,600
I didn't think that you have some research.

139
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
Actually, I've always studied the interior design.

140
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
No wonder you can understand it so easily.

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
Mr. Ling, I want to ask you.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,600
Are you planning to buy this seven-story building in the name of your personal interest or the company's?

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I haven't thought about it yet. You know what?

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,400
From a Chinese doctor's perspective, the house is the sun, the corridor is the sound.

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
It's a number that goes along with the time.

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,800
The bottom of the seven-story building is to deal with the number of poems.

147
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,400
It's exactly like what you said earlier, it's a perfect match.

148
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
But if you haven't thought about it, you have to hurry.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
After changing the policy, the cost of the printing is the same.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,400
What's mainly affected is the capital.

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Do you want to talk to the bank?

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,400
If you buy it in the name of the company,

153
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
I don't know how the bank will see this investment.

154
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
If I buy it, I won't sell it.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
Others may take it apart.

156
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
The saint doesn't treat illness as disease, but rather as disorder.

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
If you don't treat disorder as disorder, but rather as disorder.

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,200
If you buy it and don't sell it, it really isn't an investment that will make money.

159
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a three-story building.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
My responsibility is to protect it.

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Oh, right. If you know the interior design,

162
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
then what are your views on the restoration?

163
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
Actually, a lot of materials have already stopped production.

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
The craftsmanship has also been lost.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,200
We must find some masters who are specialized in restoring the Tang building.

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,400
The key point is to preserve the characteristics of the seven-story building.

167
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,000
At the same time, we must meet the needs of the modern people.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I think that Grandma Ju will have her requirements, too.

169
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,600
For example, to preserve the windows.

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Even if she doesn't ask, I will do that.

171
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,800
We should write it in the special terms.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,400
You are working and you haven't eaten anything, right?

173
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
No, I just ate a salad.

174
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,200
Eating food that is not cooked and cold will cause you to get tired.

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
I have a ginger and red dates cake.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
I just passed by those small shops to help the old neighbors do some business.

177
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Ginger can cool down in the warm.

178
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
And red dates can replenish the energy.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
But you have to chew it and swallow it.

180
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
This is how it helps to digest.

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Here.

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Thank you.

183
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Let's eat together.

184
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Aunt, did Brother tell you that he wants to buy a seven-story building?

186
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
I haven't heard him say that.

187
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
But it's also good to buy a house to keep it.

188
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
But that house is not a human house.

189
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,200
Mom!

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Ah Min, come, sit down first.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
I will go to the kitchen to see if the food is ready.

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Don't ask. It must be a small report.

193
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
No, just chat.

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Brother, are you insisting on buying that seven-story building to flirt with Miss Luo?

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I am you.

196
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
The accountant of the company.

197
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
You are so...

198
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
How is it? I know that it's not ideal. Just borrow half of it.

199
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
No matter what, just tell me.

200
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Okay. You want me to go and meet him. No problem.

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,000
But you want me to say that the house has some potential development.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry. I can't say it.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not planning to sell it. I'm planning to make a factory.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay. I'll talk to the bank again.

205
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
You can't borrow it, right? I guessed it.

206
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,200
The maximum payment period is 80 yuan.

207
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,400
If you calculate it, it's completely a negative number.

208
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
I bought it in the company's name.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
If you don't calculate it like that, we can still talk about it.

210
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
What's wrong?

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Madam, that seven-story building is too worthless.

212
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
The bank is unwilling to pay the loan.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm warning you. Don't plan to pay it once.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
The company doesn't have that much money to buy it for you.

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
What?

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Sister is here.

217
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
A'Tou.

218
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Sister, you're here.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Yes.

220
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Aunt, sit.

221
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Come, sit.

222
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
Sit here.

223
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
I have an appointment with a friend to have tea nearby.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
I just came by to take a look.

225
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
You said you wanted to take a look.

226
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Actually, I have a reason.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sister said that she wanted to take back the share of the company.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,200
It's indeed a bit sudden.

229
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,600
But I'm in a hurry to use it.

230
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Sister, is there anything urgent?

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
No. A'Ming said that she wanted to buy a house.

232
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm her mother. Of course, I have to help her.

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
Sister, after my brother-in-law left,

234
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
you never managed the company and never got the share.

235
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
You suddenly said that you wanted to take it out.

236
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,000
I want to see how much money the company has left.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
The share that Aunt didn't get

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
is recorded in the company account with the share of the shareholders.

239
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,000
You can take it at any time.

240
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Aunt, remember to calculate how much money Aunt has saved here.

241
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Give Aunt the answer as soon as possible.

242
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay, I won't disturb you.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
No, no.

244
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,800
Xia, take Sister out.

245
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Okay, okay.

246
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Ah Feng.

247
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Second Sister-in-law.

248
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Why didn't you inform me that Sister is here?

249
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,800
I have an appointment to drink tea. I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving first.

250
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,400
Let's drink together some other day.

251
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey, why is your Sister here?

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
She said that she wanted to take her share and buy a house.

253
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,800
What's wrong with that Lin Wei Ming?

254
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Last time, you told her mother that you wanted to buy a house.

255
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:47,720
She was so agitated and

256
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,600
In a hurry, I went to the house with someone.

257
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Why did Li Chen Ren show up?

258
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,120
I-I-I...

259
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,800
You told you were going to send her home.

260
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,200
Really?

261
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
Then why did you come out of the house?

262
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,600
Actually, because my mom heard about it..

263
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,000
I looked for a place to hide it.

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
I did...

265
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Give me the money!

266
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Give me the money!

267
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Are you okay?

268
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Congratulations to our sales champion, Richo!

269
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
You've paid off your debt this month.

270
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
No one can compete with you!

271
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
You've lost your best performance!

272
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Congratulations!

273
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Yes, if you're not interested in Mr. Liang,

274
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I won't waste your time.

275
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Okay, bye!

276
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Waste my time?

277
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
You've ruined my phone call!

278
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm not making a video call.

279
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I have no advantage!

280
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
So what?

281
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
You can't win your old lady's heart.

282
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
She gave you a chance.

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
But you were defeated by others.

284
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
She's angry when I mention her old lady.

285
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
She's just a brain-dead.

286
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
If not, she's mentally ill.

287
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
She and Richo only have 60 million yuan.

288
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm just a swindler!

289
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,240
You can't win your old lady's heart.

290
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
I'll take this.

291
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
What's wrong?

292
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Can you help me?

293
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

294
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm a little late.

295
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
The temporary contract is almost ready.

296
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I'll leave in half an hour to see Mr. Lin.

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
No need.

298
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I've prepared the cash for you.

299
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Aunt Dun, I'll definitely help you to make up for the shortcomings.

300
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
You're really good sisters.

301
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Let's go.

302
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
I understand.

303
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
But in fact, your bank shouldn't think so.

304
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
This chess building is not worth rebuilding.

305
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
It's worth rebuilding.

306
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,240
I won't force you this time.

307
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Thank you.

308
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Save your money.

309
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
No bank will listen to your story.

310
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Boss, the two managers of Chengfeng Real Estate are here.

311
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Mr. Lin.

312
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
It's been a long time, Miss Shen.

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Just call me Aunt.

314
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Aunt, sit.

315
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay.

316
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Mr. Lin, we brought the temporary contract today.

317
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Thank you.

318
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, I'll take it out for you to see.

319
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Sorry.

320
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I'm still looking for a bank.

321
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
I hope to do business loan.

322
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
The temporary contract is just a small part of the deposit.

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
The problem is,

324
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
after signing the contract,

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
within 14 days,

326
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
I have to give it to the big boss.

327
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Mr. Lin has such a big company.

328
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
It's okay to be a father once.

329
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
I don't do business like this.

330
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Make 60 million and spend 30 million.

331
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
This is not my style.

332
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Did you pay the price?

333
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
We've been busy for so long.

334
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You can't afford it.

335
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Ruichou.

336
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,240
I miscalculated this time.

337
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
But I didn't say I wouldn't buy it.

338
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
I just want to settle the account and sign the contract again.

339
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Miss Luo,

340
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
please tell Aunt Ju for me.

341
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Can you wait for me again?

342
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
But I don't know if Aunt Ju can wait for so long.

343
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Or I apologize to her in person

344
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
and see what she means.

345
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Okay, Mr. Lin.

346
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
But the situation is a little awkward.

347
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
Actually, we can just show up.

348
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Okay.

349
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Sorry.

350
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I've got the cheque.

351
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Take it now.

352
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Ruichou,

353
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
I have something to do.

354
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Can you do it yourself?

355
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Yes.

356
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Thank you.

357
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
Mr. Lin, I'm sorry.

358
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
I have to go now.

359
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
Thank you.

360
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
I'll send you down.

361
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Okay.

362
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Remember to find me a mansion with more than 30 million.

363
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I can't afford that building.

364
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Mr. Lin,

365
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
since we can't sign the contract today,

366
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
I'll go first.

367
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
I'll send you out.

368
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Miss Mu, are you okay?

369
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Wait for me.

370
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I'll drive the car to send you out.

371
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
A'zu, it's okay.

372
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm calling for a car.

373
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
I've already taken your car.

374
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
I don't want to take it anymore.

375
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Thank you.

376
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
It was just an accident last time.

377
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,240
That loser doesn't know how to drive.

378
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
You know that loser.

379
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
You know what kind of person he is.

380
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
You're really welcome.

381
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
My car will turn around and you'll know.

382
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
But my car is right here.

383
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I'll drive it for you.

384
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
No need.

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
A'zu.

386
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Why are you here?

387
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I'll get it for you.

388
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
This beautiful lady is your friend?

389
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Yes.

390
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
This beautiful lady is my friend.

391
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Don't keep staring at her.

392
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
She'll be shy.

393
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
Why don't you introduce her?

394
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
She's a good girl.

395
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Her name is Auntie.

396
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Auntie, I'm so happy to see you.

397
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
But my car is here.

398
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
It's nearby.

399
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
See you another day.

400
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
My car is right here.

401
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
You just saw it and you can't bear to leave it.

402
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Why are you so clingy?

403
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
You're awesome.

404
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
You're more affectionate than my A'min.

405
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
No, you're awesome too.

406
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
There's a girl up there with you.

407
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Let's go up and have a look.

408
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Okay.

409
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Sorry.

410
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
My client made you so headache.

411
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
No.

412
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
I've always had this headache problem.

413
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Then I'll help you press it.

414
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
There's a acupressure point behind the neck.

415
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
It can help you reduce your headache.

416
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Does it hurt?

417
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
It hurts.

418
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
That's right.

419
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
If it doesn't hurt, it hurts.

420
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Just press it for one minute.

421
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
That's it.

422
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
It feels so good.

423
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
You don't like the smell?

424
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Mom.

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Don't mind me.

426
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Keep pressing.

427
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
It feels much better now.

428
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Your mom didn't come to see you.

429
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
I won't bother you.

430
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Take this bottle of oil.

431
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Thank you.

432
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,240
No, I'm the one who should bother you.

433
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Miss Luo is a real estate agent.

434
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
She's in charge of handling the business of the Qilou.

435
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
You don't have to see her.

436
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
A'zu told me.

437
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
She told me who she is.

438
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

439
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
You should know what you're talking about.

440
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Miss Luo.

441
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Please tell Grandma Ju that

442
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I'll figure out the money.

443
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Okay.

444
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Don't bother.

445
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
I have money.

446
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
I can help you.

447
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
That's right.

448
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
I'm going to share the shares of Ren Yuan

449
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
and get them out to help you.

450
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
You can't refuse.

451
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I'll buy a house for my son.

452
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
It's a great deal.

453
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
No, mom.

454
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I'm going to buy it in the name of selling it.

455
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
It's the same.

456
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I'll help you.

457
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
You can do whatever you want after you buy it.

458
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay, mom.

459
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
I have a plan.

460
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Don't worry.

461
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Miss Luo, I'll see you out.

462
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Okay.

463
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Bye, aunt.

464
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
Okay, bye.

465
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
Bye.

466
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Bye.

467
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Bye.

468
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
How is it?

469
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Tonight, you're going to give me a happy hour.

470
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
And celebrate our deal.

471
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
You've made a lot of money in this business.

472
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Okay.

473
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Does it mean

474
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
we won't see each other again?

475
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
If I tell you

476
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I still want to see you.

477
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
What do you mean?

478
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm your wife.

479
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
You're so smart.

480
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
You're so charming.

481
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Didn't you say my cousin was going to spend 60 million

482
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
to buy an old-fashioned building?

483
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
How is it?

484
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
How is it going?

485
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
You should know that

486
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
the client's information

487
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
can't be revealed.

488
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
I'm just telling you.

489
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
If you buy me a glass of wine,

490
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
I might tell you right away.

491
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
How dare you tell me?

492
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,240
It depends on your performance.

493
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
The End

494
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Mr. Situ, I'm sorry.

495
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
I asked you to come here.

496
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
You asked me to meet you.

497
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
Do you want to know which building?

498
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
I want to know

499
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,240
what's the value of the building?

500
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
Let me tell you a story.

501
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
Two years ago, the landlord

502
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
planned to buy the whole place to build a hotel.

503
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
He was determined to buy the surrounding buildings.

504
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
581 was right in the middle of the building.

505
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
The buyer opened the price to 1.2 million.

506
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
The buyer insisted and refused to sell it.

507
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
In the end, the whole plan was cut off.

508
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
1.2 million is not sold.

509
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Now it's 60 million.

510
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Half price.

511
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Your cousin and the landlord have known each other for a long time.

512
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
The old neighbors have a good price.

513
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm just telling you a small piece of news.

514
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,240
There's a record of the owner's purchase two years ago.

515
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
As far as I know,

516
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Mr. Ling is not doing well in the loan.

517
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I heard you are relatives.

518
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,240
Can you help me to make this deal?

519
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Henry, what do you need?

520
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Just ask me for help.

521
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,240
You two have such a good relationship.

522
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I believe Nell will help you.

523
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I'll leave you alone. Bye.

524
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Bye.

525
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
Dad.

526
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Natalie.

527
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
You know her.

528
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Hello, Mr. Deng.

529
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Henry, come in and talk.

530
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
You're a bastard.

531
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
You're pretending to be a filial son.

532
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
You're afraid of my cow.

533
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
I have a lot of cows.

534
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I don't need to be afraid of you.

535
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Then why did you steal it?

536
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
You have a lot of choices.

537
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
You have a lot of choices.

538
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
What about me?

539
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
I only have your mother.

540
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
She's very young now.

541
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I'm going out to find Wei Jie.

542
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
What's the problem?

543
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
That cow is not Wei Jie.

544
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
It's a trouble.

545
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
She's smart.

546
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
If you go in,

547
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
There will be a lot of trouble.

548
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm helping you solve it now.

549
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Are you so great?

550
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
At least not like you.

551
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
I can control that cow.

552
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Know how to use it.

553
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Qilou business.

554
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
You said you were good at it.

555
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
You fell before you ran away.

556
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
You can't sign the contract.

557
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
You don't have a penny.

558
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
The bank doesn't give Mr. Ling money.

559
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Mr. Ling can't predict it.

560
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Why is this problem

561
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
You've never encountered it?

562
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
It's not like that.

563
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Every time you can't get a client,

564
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,240
It's all about that.

565
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
He didn't say he wouldn't buy it.

566
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
He said he'd ask me to buy it.

567
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
But wait.

568
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
The flowers are all fresh.

570
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Your performance last month.

571
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
I dragged you to this month.

572
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
I've sold you enough.

573
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
You go out.

574
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
I'm sorry.

575
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm sorry.

576
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm sorry.

577
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
I'm sorry.

578
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I'm sorry.

579
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm sorry.

580
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I'm sorry.

581
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm sorry.

582
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
I'm sorry.

583
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
I'm sorry.

584
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm sorry.

585
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I'm sorry.

586
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm sorry.

587
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm sorry.

588
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
I'm sorry.

589
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm sorry.

590
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I'm sorry.

591
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
I'm sorry.

592
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
I'm sorry.

593
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm sorry.

594
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm sorry.

595
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I'm sorry.

596
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I'm sorry.

597
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm sorry.

598
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I'm sorry.

599
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sorry.

600
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
I'm sorry.

601
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
I'm sorry.

602
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,240
I'm sorry.

603
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,240
The business of the Qilong is still going on. It might be done.

604
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Okay, we're here.

605
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Be careful.

606
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
The most time to hide is only two hours.

607
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
I'll call you when I pay the bill.

608
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
No, Mrs. Shen.

609
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
You're in the enemy's camp alone now.

610
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You can't handle any situation.

611
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
But I can help you.

612
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Don't have prejudice. It's a family.

613
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,240
I asked him to give me the bonus, but he didn't say anything.

614
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,240
He's really helping me to make money.

615
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Since Ming doesn't need to give him money for now,

616
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,240
he should tell others about it out of courtesy.

617
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
That's it.

618
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Okay, come down quickly.

619
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Call me. I'm nearby.

620
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
Everything is ready. The Qilong is almost here.

621
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Why didn't Ming buy it?

622
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
Ming doesn't want to use my money.

623
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,240
But Aunt, we've got your money from the fund.

624
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Yes.

625
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Right.

626
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
It's rare for Ming to prove our innocence in front of your son.

627
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,240
He won't think we won't let you get what we want.

628
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Don't say that. Ming doesn't think so.

629
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Actually, the real estate agent Ming found is the same as us.

630
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
They'll come over to see us later.

631
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,240
He told me the price of the owner is lower than the market price.

632
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Ming, you're so smart.

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
You can't buy a new house with a thousand gold coins.

634
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
You'll lose it if you miss it.

635
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Sister, young people nowadays like to be strong.

636
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
For example, our A'Keng.

637
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
He was studying abroad and insisted on renting a house.

638
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,240
I bought his house and became his landlord.

639
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
I was worried he'd sleep on the street.

640
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
All of us mothers are like that.

641
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
I didn't expect he could be like that.

642
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I have a conscience.

643
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
You do have a conscience?

644
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
No!

645
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Can't you lean on his interests?

646
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Are you us?

647
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,240
All your neighbors in this neighborhood don't stand by you.

648
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,240
I didn't buy his house before and take all these money I have was enough.

649
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
I can answer all of your concerns.

650
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
This can't happen.

651
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
You can tell him.

652
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,160
Come on.

653
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,880
Hand in the letter.

654
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,680
Let's go.

655
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,720
Hurry up.

656
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,440
You are the late housewife.

657
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,560
Why is she here?

658
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,920
Are you sure, A'Keng?

659
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,120
Do you have to find her?

660
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,240
Miss Luo.

661
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Do you have a problem with them?

662
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,760
Dad, mom.

663
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,000
You can leave now.

664
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Leave it to me.

665
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,240
Why did you hide the big deal

666
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,960
of buying a chess house from me?

667
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,920
Mr. Ling has always wanted to buy a chess house.

668
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,560
But he has so many principles.

669
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Now Auntie Ling takes the money out

670
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,560
and help him fulfill his wish secretly.

671
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
That's good.

672
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,840
But if my brother knows it,

673
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,960
but I don't tell him, I will die.

674
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,000
I know.

675
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
But Mr. Ling is too stubborn.

676
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,000
I've seen him several times and I know it.

677
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,160
So he needs a smart brother like you

678
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,320
to be with him.

679
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
I know.

680
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,600
Mr. Ling doesn't want to buy a house

681
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,240
to affect the operation of the auction house

682
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,280
and the scientific research.

683
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,080
So it's best to use Auntie Ling's money.

684
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,000
But...

685
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
But the father and son of Dang

686
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,680
are not good people at first sight.

687
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,520
Will they take so much money

688
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
for their mother?

689
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,640
I know.

690
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
But think about it.

691
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,880
If they want to cheat Mr. Ling's money,

692
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,840
they won't take so much money out.

693
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,840
If they want to cheat Auntie Ling's money,

694
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,240
it's even more strange.

695
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,920
The money is in their hands.

696
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
They don't have to persuade Auntie Ling

697
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,600
to take the money out and help him buy a house.

698
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,480
Right?

699
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
You can believe them.

700
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,760
But I...

701
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm a professional real estate agent.

702
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm good at analyzing.

703
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,800
You don't believe me, do you?

704
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,880
Of course I believe you.

705
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,840
A'zuo.

706
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,720
Do you know that

707
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,280
this business is very important to me?

708
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,520
I have six times the cost.

709
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,960
I don't need to be chased by Situ

710
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,040
for at least two or three months.

711
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,960
Do you know that

712
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
I'm usually very nervous

713
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
when I'm chased by Situ?

714
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,880
I'll be shivering.

715
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll have a heart attack,

716
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
I'll lose my hair,

717
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,800
and I'll have a heart attack.

718
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll also have a stomach ache.

719
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,240
Stomach ache?

720
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,520
Stomach ache.

721
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,760
Many male colleagues in our company have stomach aches.

722
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,960
Anyway, if I can't do it,

723
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll have no money,

724
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,000
no money to pay the card debt,

725
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,720
no money to pay the bill,

726
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,240
and I'll just sleep on the street.

727
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't be like this.

728
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
But on the contrary,

729
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
if I can do it,

730
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,520
I might get a promotion and get paid.

731
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,720
A'zuo,

732
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,360
you'll help me, right?

733
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
Of course I will.

734
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,800
A'zuo,

735
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,880
although I haven't known you for a long time,

736
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,400
I know you're a good person

737
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
and you like to help others.

738
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Thank you.

739
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,560
And you said you and Mr. Ling are best friends.

740
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,760
And you're the factory manager of the drug factory.

741
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
Can you make the decision?

742
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,920
Yes, of course.

743
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,320
Then it's up to you.

744
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
Thank you.

745
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,360
But I still think

746
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Mr. Ling can't be without affection.

747
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Miss Luo,

748
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,520
you're my mother,

749
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,040
so I have to be considerate.

750
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,840
Yes, since aunt agrees

751
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,920
not to let my cousin know it,

752
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,840
Rachel,

753
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,080
you're a real estate agent.

754
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,880
If my cousin refuses,

755
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
you'll lose all your money.

756
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
Will you give it up?

757
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,480
Are you done?

758
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,640
If so, let's get to the point.

759
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,600
Rachel, are you okay?

760
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Let's get started.

761
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,840
I've made a temporary contract with Rachel.

762
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,000
If the buyer is okay,

763
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,600
we can talk to the seller.

764
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,520
Why is the buyer the factory manager of the drug factory

765
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,240
and not Mrs. Ling?

766
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,680
I've studied with Henry.

767
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,000
Because Auntie Ling is the shareholder of the company,

768
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,840
if she buys in the company's name,

769
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,600
she can save tax and lawyer fees.

770
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,440
Yes.

771
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,640
Plus, aunt uses shareholder shares to buy a house,

772
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,120
which is more convenient.

773
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,440
I don't understand the problem.

774
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,920
You loser!

775
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,640
Mr. Ling,

776
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
this is the house

777
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,480
that Ming bought to fulfill his father's wish.

778
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,920
The factory is also his father's life's effort.

779
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,800
It's okay, Miss Luo.

780
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,240
That's right.

781
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,200
Henry treats me as his idol.

782
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
It's okay in his name.

783
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,880
Okay, I'll talk to Auntie Ju.

784
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,560
organizing

785
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
Why did you drink so much?

786
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,200
Any worries?

787
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,240
Just tell me about it.

788
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
Tomorrow,

789
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,040
we're signing a contract with Auntie Ju.

790
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,480
But Mr. Ling has known her.

791
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,360
If Mr. Ling去看他的话,

792
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,680
something bad would happen to me.

793
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,840
It'll be a mess.

794
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,040
I cannot open the order.

795
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,560
I can't pay rent if I can't pay the bill.

796
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,640
Not only that,

797
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,520
I don't even have money to eat.

798
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,640
No, no.

799
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,720
You're thinking too much.

800
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,520
How could I think too much?

801
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,640
I'm always being chased by the sales.

802
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm under a lot of pressure.

803
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,400
Look.

804
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
I can't sleep well every day.

805
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,600
My dark circles are coming out.

806
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760
I can't even cover my eyes.

807
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,680
No.

808
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
You're still beautiful.

809
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,840
What should I do?

810
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,920
Will Mr. Ling suddenly run over?

811
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,480
So many annoying things.

812
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,440
Oh, this is simple.

813
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm going to Guangzhou tomorrow to see Chinese herbs.

814
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,960
Just ask my brother to go with me.

815
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,160
Yes.

816
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,640
Ah Zuo was so smart yesterday.

817
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,800
Thank you.

818
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,560
Thank you for helping me.

819
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,120
You're really smart.

820
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,440
That's great.

821
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,280
Thank you.

822
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Aunt Ju, look.

823
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,360
We've known each other for decades.

824
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Ah Keng, look at him.

825
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,880
He's still holding it in his hand.

826
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes, yes.

827
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,960
Now they're all so old.

828
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,320
Their children grow up so fast.

829
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,880
We're old, too.

830
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,640
Yes.

831
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,320
That day, Ming came to me.

832
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,600
I didn't recognize him.

833
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
By the way,

834
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
why didn't you see him when you signed the contract today?

835
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,520
Yes.

836
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,800
Mr. Ling went to Guangzhou to see Chinese herbs.

837
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,440
We're all family.

838
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,960
Everything is the same.

839
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,920
That's right.

840
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,160
We're all the same.

841
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,480
Didn't you say that the raw materials we borrowed were a little strange?

842
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,240
Yes.

843
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,440
Can you describe

844
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,240
which kind of strange method it is?

845
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
That strange method

846
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,040
is like

847
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,600
I can't describe it.

848
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,360
You'll know when you see it later.

849
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
That's good.

850
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,440
It's better to see it.

851
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,240
Yes.

852
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm going to the gate now.

853
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,040
How's it going over there?

854
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,240
Did you sign the contract?

855
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,040
You drive. I'll write it down.

856
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,840
Okay.

857
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,800
I'll write it down.

858
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,600
Okay.

859
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,480
Okay.

860
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,840
Why are you so brothy-lipped?

861
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,200
I'm worried about brother-in-law.

862
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,480
Can't you hear me?

863
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,200
I can hear you.

864
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
Miss Luo, I'm Lin Weimin.

865
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,560
Who is Mrs. Ju signing the contract with?

866
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,360
Did she sign it?

867
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,920
No.

868
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,640
It's good if she didn't.

869
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,680
Let her stop right away.

870
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,960
Anyway, wait for me.

871
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
Send me to Mrs. Ju's house immediately.

872
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
I don't want her to be in a hurry.

873
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,520
Mr. Ling just called.

874
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,880
He told us not to sign the contract.

875
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
We must wait for him.

876
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,720
That's good.

877
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,640
Then we'll sign it when Ming comes.

878
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
That's awkward.

879
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,760
Because later,

880
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,280
I have a meeting with my dad.

881
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,720
I may not be able to wait for the watchman.

882
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,240
You're right.

883
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,600
We can't do it without him.

884
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,080
We have to sign the contract in the name of Ren Yuan Pharmaceutical Factory.

885
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,040
Ren Yuan?

886
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
It's Dr. Lin Ren Yuan?

887
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,920
Yes.

888
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,640
We bought the gas building

889
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,320
to fulfill his wish.

890
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,800
Yes.

891
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,760
Let's sign the contract as soon as possible.

892
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Let's sign it.

893
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,200
Come on.

894
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
We should wait for Mr. Ling to come.

895
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,280
Hurry up.

896
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,080
But Mr. Ling said

897
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,440
we have to wait for him no matter what.

898
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,400
I know.

899
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,080
But the money will be here soon.

900
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,120
Hurry up.

901
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,880
Brother.

902
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,720
Don't be so stupid.

903
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
You should spend their money.

904
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,760
Don't you remember?

905
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,000
They were jealous of you.

906
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,440
They didn't give you a single yuan

907
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,960
for your application.

908
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,240
Now they pay you.

909
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,120
Don't you feel good?

910
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
You don't need to borrow from the bank.

911
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,600
Why are you hiding it from me?

912
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Because I know you'll do this.

913
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,240
How can I tell you?

914
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,080
And you were self-reliant.

915
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,200
You've already given them

916
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,960
the contract.

917
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,080
Now Mrs. Lin

918
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,320
is using her shareholder to help you.

919
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,120
What's wrong with that?

920
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
You're better than their father and son.

921
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,000
But these are the things

922
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,960
I don't want to

923
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
drag my mom down when I'm with them.

924
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,080
Are you familiar with them?

925
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,960
You were cheated by that girl

926
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,920
when you believed them.

927
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,800
Even I was cheated.

928
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,080
What do you mean by being cheated by women?

929
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm doing this for your own good.

930
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,080
You're always like this.

931
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,600
You're self-reliant.

932
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,440
My business is complicated.

933
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,040
It's not as simple as you think.

934
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,800
Anyway, I'll handle my business.

935
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,920
Don't worry about it.

936
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,200
Your house.

937
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,040
That's your house.

938
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,320
That's right.

939
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,880
That's right.

940
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920
I didn't mean that.

941
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,800
I'm not your...

942
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,320
I have no right to say anything.

943
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,280
I should shut up.

944
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,640
I didn't mean that.

945
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,680
Right. I know.

946
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,960
I know. I know.

947
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,840
Hey!

948
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,720
Okay. I'll handle my business.

949
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,360
I didn't mean that.

950
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,560
That car is also yours.

951
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,000
Drive wherever you want.

952
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,800
Hey!

953
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,920
I'm not your...

954
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm not your...

955
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm not your...

956
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,720
I'm not your...

957
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,360
Where are you going?

958
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,160
Hey!

959
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,440
Don't do this, okay?

960
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,480
I didn't mean that.

961
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,080
Anyway, get in the car first, okay?

962
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
Go home.

963
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,480
Hey! Get in the car first.

964
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,240
I won't interfere with your family business anymore.

965
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,040
Hey!

966
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,320
You jackass!

967
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,680
You!

968
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,960
You...

969
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,480
How dare you run away?

970
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,800
That's my living room.

971
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,560
How should I say when you call me?

972
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,920
I won't answer.

973
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,200
I won't say anything.

974
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,160
You nuts!

975
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,720
Alright.

976
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,080
When you call me,

977
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
let's go to the car.

978
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,240
to see if there are any signs of bleeding and relapse of the tumor.

979
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,640
Grandma Ju, let's start.

980
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Our contract is a three-part ceremony.

981
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,240
We need to sign every page.

982
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,440
Let me tell you where to sign.

983
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
Here.

984
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,240
Mr. Deng.

985
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
The signing is done.

986
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
Thank you, Mr. Deng.

987
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,040
Here.

988
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,240
30 million Hong Kong dollars.

989
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Grandma Ju, look at the last one. It says Chen Jin Ju,

990
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,640
30 million Hong Kong dollars. See if there are any problems.

991
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,040
No problems. Thank you.

992
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,240
That's great.

993
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,440
Today, the temporary contract of Qilou 581 has been signed.

994
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,240
Congratulations.

995
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,040
What are you doing here?

996
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,440
Why are you here?

997
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Liang Yanzu, stealing is not right.

998
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,640
Did you see a bald boy?

999
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Did you see him?

1000
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,240
No.

1001
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,440
I'll give you half of it.

1002
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Thank you.

1003
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
By the way, you...

1004
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
You're here to see me?

1005
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
By the way, you...

1006
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,240
What's wrong?

1007
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
The doctor said there's something in my head.

1008
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
I need to take it out.

1009
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
By the way, why are you here?

1010
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,640
I have a heart disease.

1011
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,840
I've been living here for a year and a half.

1012
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,040
I still can't go home.

1013
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,440
Don't be so sad.

1014
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,640
My name is Liang Yanzu.

1015
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,440
What about you?

1016
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I'm Lin Weimin.

1017
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,840
We're brothers from now on.

1018
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,440
We share the same fate.

1019
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Come on. Let's go.

1020
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
What's wrong, Weimin?

1021
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,040
What's going on? How long have you been stealing?

1022
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
About five minutes.

1023
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Liang Yanzu.

1024
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Come on, brother.

1025
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,640
You'll get better.

1026
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Wait for me to have a surgery.

1027
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,240
We'll go to the river together.

1028
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Okay.

1029
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Nurse, why hasn't Liang Yanzu come out for so long?

1030
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,440
Yanzu had a big surgery.

1031
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,040
It took seven or eight hours.

1032
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
But it's been ten hours now.

1033
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,240
Will he die?

1034
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,040
You have to have faith in the doctor.

1035
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Go to sleep.

1036
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,440
People in the city often have a headache.

1037
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,640
Sometimes, the system of pain in the neck

1038
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,640
that is insufficient will make you feel pressure,

1039
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,040
cold or change your physiological cycle.

1040
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,640
Except for the acupressure at the back of the neck,

1041
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,840
you can press the acupressure behind the ear.

1042
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
You've never heard of acupressure.

1043
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
It's the scent of perfume that a lawyer usually use.

1044
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,440
I'm so touched by your presence.

1045
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,240
I want to be a butterfly and make a pose.

1046
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,640
With you in the world, I can start again.

1047
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:57,640
See that we can be together.
