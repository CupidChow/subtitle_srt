1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You didn't even let your father go.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're not human at all.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The police are looking for you. You can't escape.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not my fault.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's you people who pushed me to this.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sir, I'm Lin Wei Min.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mr. Lin, you called the police and said that two of your friends were in danger.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Our colleagues from the patrol found this car according to the clues you provided.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I believe this car belongs to your company.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What about the people inside?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We only found a car that was empty.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
But according to the car's

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When I called my girlfriend just now, she said she was being chased by Deng Shikeng.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Could it be related to Deng Shikeng?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We checked the surveillance video of the neighborhood.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We did see Deng Shikeng driving by.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But it happened to be a dead end.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we don't know why the car was hit.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And why there's no one in the car.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mr. Lin, don't worry.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We'll do our best to help you find those two friends.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please, Mr. Lin, you'll go back to the police station with our colleagues later.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Make a detailed report.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please come over.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's wrong, A'Zou? How are you?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Big brother, your uncle had an operation.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not dangerous.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Your aunt is awake.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But the police said she didn't want to say anything.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She said she didn't know or remember.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's obvious that she was covering up that bastard.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
By the way, did you find our car?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The body was hit.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's parked on the side of the road.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did they get hurt?

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Rachel and Ned are not in the car.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know where they went.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From the scene, it's likely to be caught by Shikeng.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How could this be?

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Where are you now? I'll go find you.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to the police station to make a report.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go back to the clinic first.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you have any news, we'll contact you again.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A'Zou, have some water first.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Brother, is there any news?

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The police also think that

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
there's a possibility that

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ned and Rachel were taken by Shikeng.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're already on the hunt.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That means there's no news.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You've been calling Rachel for hours.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That guy is crazy.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Could they be a little more dangerous?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, don't talk nonsense, okay?

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know how to explain to my uncle and aunt.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If something happens to the two women,

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
prepare 10 million cash.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll call you later.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll call the police and give them a check.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's wrong, brother?

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
10 million cash. He's crazy.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll call the police.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, brother.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That guy is crazy.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He's afraid to take the risk.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If we call the police, what will happen?

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll pay. Don't do anything stupid.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll pay.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother, you're pretty fast.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You didn't even tell me the price of one yuan.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
10 million.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now it's mine.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're crazy, Deng Shikeng.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm crazy.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was forced by you guys.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have no choice now.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can't escape from so many bad things.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't you hate Rachel?

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Didn't you always say you wanted to hurt her?

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why are you on her side now?

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't let you go even if I die.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let her go, Deng Shikeng.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's none of her business.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You women are really funny.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Have you forgotten?

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She helped me drugged.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
She helped me seduce you.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now she's her good sister.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You guys did something wrong to me.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But she knew her mistake.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She chose to go back on the right path.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But you?

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know I'll keep making mistakes.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You won't even let your father go.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I did this because of you and my cousin.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't blame me and A Min.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You caused all these.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Rachel.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been with you for so long.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why don't you agree?

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you choose her?

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not as good as her.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why did you choose her?

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you thinking?

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're comparing yourself with A Min.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Stop.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't go back.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You'll die.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even if I die,

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I want you two to die with me.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wen Yan.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The boat has arrived.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have medicine.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll go to the dock to find you.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How's Mr. Ren?

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If it weren't for helping me,

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
you wouldn't have been dragged into the water.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You didn't drag me into the water.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I got you into trouble.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was wrong to do this.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But you made me see

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
what kind of person she is.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You made me

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
see her as a person

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
who is willing to stand by your side.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Rui Chou.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want to

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
say sorry to you

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and be honest with you.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I couldn't accept

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
A Min choosing you over me.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's why I did so many things

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that hurt you.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Even if you say sorry to me

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
many times,

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll believe you

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and accept it.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The past is over.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Then we'll be

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
friends from now on.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Not only that.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If we get through this,

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
we'll be good friends

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
who were born to die.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Brother, you're giving him 10 million?

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why are you so stingy?

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No matter how much,

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the most important thing is that he's fine.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If anything happens to them,

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll kill them.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's important to save them.

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Drive.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The entrance.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This way.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's too high.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look at the balcony.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Be careful.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We can climb down here.

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Slow down.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Be careful.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Slow down.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Be careful.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Be careful.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Be careful.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Slow down.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Be careful.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you okay?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm fine.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm fine.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Be careful.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Be careful.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you okay?

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm fine.

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Where's the money?

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Where are you?

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Lin Wei Min.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why is there only one person?

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Is it Rui Chao?

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't rush.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Take your time.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Give me the money.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll return the money to you

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
after I've paid the bill.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop yelling, you bastard.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Or I'll scratch your face.

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't come here.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The money is here.

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let go of me.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Open the bag.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm warning you.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't play tricks.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I have both the women.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Throw the money here.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Rui Chao is not here.

218
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He's hiding.

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Say it.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where's Rui Chao?

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't get it.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You don't need to know.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You won't say it even if you die.

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you want to be a prisoner for your whole life?

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have nothing to fear now.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can die with your woman.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Stop.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Stop.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Stop.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Stop.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Stop.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Stop.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Stop.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Stop.

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Stop.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Deng Shikeng,

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we're arresting you now.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Chief Hu,

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
we're arresting you now.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How are you?

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm fine.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm fine, too.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Li Wenbin,

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I won't let you go.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Calm down.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Deng Shikeng,

248
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
what you're saying

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,880
may become a public

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll go with you to the hospital.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just a small matter.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No need.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You've finished the report.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A-Se said they would send someone to find Rui Chao.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you remember

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
before Shikeng brought you here,

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you didn't stay in any place?

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I remember

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the car stopped on the way.

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
At that time,

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Deng Shikeng pulled Rui Chao down the car.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then I heard

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the sound of the engine.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then I arrived here soon.

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Rui Chao!

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Rui Chao!

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Deng Shikeng!

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Rui Chao!

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You...

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Rui Chao!

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You...

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm fine.

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm fine.

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm fine.

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm fine.

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm fine.

277
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm fine.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm fine.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm fine.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm fine.

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm fine.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm fine.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm fine.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm fine.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm fine.

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm fine.

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm fine.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm fine.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm fine.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm fine.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm fine.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm fine.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm fine.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm fine.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm fine.

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm fine.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm fine.

298
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm fine.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm fine.

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My love is so sweet.

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm fine.

302
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm fine.

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What?

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I heard you were brave that day.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If it wasn't for that guy having a weapon,

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I would have beaten him to death.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You always risk your life.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't you know your martial arts?

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me pack the soup.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Stop it.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Come on.

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,120
Be happy

313
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
Now the loser is caught

314
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
We are safe

315
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,720
Drink some soup first

316
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,600
Thank you, brother

317
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,200
Let me pick it up

318
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,520
A'Zong

319
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,960
What's wrong

320
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm fine

321
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm fine

322
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,840
Tell A'Ming

323
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,120
Don't hide it from him

324
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
What are you talking about

325
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm fine

326
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm really fine

327
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,120
Since when

328
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,040
A'Ming

329
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,720
His brain tumor

330
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,000
Has already crushed the nerve

331
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
He can't see it now

332
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,720
You persuaded him to have surgery

333
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,160
Such a big thing

334
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,600
Why are you hiding it all the time

335
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Why are you hiding it from me

336
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,800
Sorry

337
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,400
It's my big brother's fault

338
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,480
I didn't know you were sick

339
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,120
Sorry

340
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,800
You had a lot of trouble before

341
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,920
I didn't tell you

342
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,840
Look at you

343
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,600
You know what can be done

344
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Why are you so sad

345
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,320
And the doctor wants to make money

346
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,000
So he asked me to have surgery

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,560
It's okay

348
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,600
How can it be okay

349
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,040
You said that day

350
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
I don't know how long I can live

351
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,600
I don't understand

352
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't understand why the doctor

353
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,200
Asked you to have surgery

354
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,080
You don't do it

355
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,920
Why wait to die

356
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
Why don't you have surgery

357
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,760
Now everyone is worried about you

358
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,920
A'Zou

359
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
If you don't have surgery now

360
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
And continue to worsen

361
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,240
You may not even have a chance

362
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,040
A'Zou

363
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,400
A'Zou

364
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,000
Let them talk

365
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,480
A'Zou

366
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,160
A'Zou

367
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,600
Answer me

368
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,520
Why don't you have surgery

369
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,720
You were not like this when you were a kid

370
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,400
The doctor said that the position of my tumor

371
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,720
Is very close to the nerves

372
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,120
Even if the surgery is successful

373
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
I may be disabled

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
You don't have surgery

375
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,200
You will be worried and afraid every day

376
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
You will be more and more painful

377
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,320
Do you feel happy

378
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,920
Do you think we

379
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
Will bear to see you like this

380
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,040
I don't know

381
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm just afraid

382
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
I'm afraid that after entering the operating room

383
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,160
Close your eyes

384
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
No chance to open your eyes again

385
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,600
No

386
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,600
When you were a kid

387
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,280
You can come out safely

388
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,320
Now you are grown up

389
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,120
You can do it too

390
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,920
I used to wait for you alone

391
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
Now there is Nell

392
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,680
Rachel

393
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,160
Zhixiong

394
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,920
We will wait for you

395
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,360
You have to believe

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,040
You will be fine

397
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,760
It's not the same as before

398
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,440
I had nothing before

399
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,400
I stole a candy

400
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,520
And got the whole world

401
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,680
Now I have you

402
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,440
I have my favorite Nell

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,240
I have too much to let go

404
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,360
If I die on the operating table

405
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,560
You will be very sad

406
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,560
Don't think about it

407
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,200
I still have to be with you

408
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,920
A good brother for a long time

409
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,800
Then

410
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,400
I get married

411
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,560
You still have to be my partner

412
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,880
Then when I have a child

413
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,920
You are their godfather

414
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,760
And my mother

415
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,440
You are her godson

416
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,040
You have to take care of her

417
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,880
How can you be so selfish

418
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,720
But I really don't want

419
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,000
To die so young

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm so afraid

421
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,840
Don't be afraid

422
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,720
Don't be afraid

423
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,120
You just sleep

424
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,040
You will wake up soon

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,280
You will be fine

426
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,920
You have to wait for me

427
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,040
I will be here

428
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,240
I will be here

429
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
I will be here

430
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
I will be here

431
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
I will be here

432
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,040
I will be here

433
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,080
I will be here

434
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,520
You have to wait for me to wake up

435
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,040
Didn't you say

436
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,560
You hope that the food will be on the market

437
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,000
After you get better

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,040
I will go to the gala with you

439
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,800
And let you stand in the middle

440
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,560
What do you say

441
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,480
What do you think

442
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,160
This is the new chocolate

443
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,280
I bought it in advance

444
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,800
I will eat it with you when you wake up

445
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,480
Food

446
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
But you have to keep it for me

447
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
Don't let it melt

448
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,680
Of course

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,040
I have confidence in you

450
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,000
I know you will wake up soon

451
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,360
When you wake up

452
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,280
We will go to the gala together

453
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,440
Go to the gala

454
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
After I finish the operation

455
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
We will go to the gala together

456
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,640
Ok

457
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,840
I will wait for you

458
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't be so shameless

459
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,800
My name is Liang Yanzu

460
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,440
And you

461
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,480
My name is Lin Weimin

462
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,400
We will be brothers in the future

463
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000
We will share happiness and sorrow

464
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,080
Sir, look at my flashlight

465
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,320
Doctor

466
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,440
How is he now

467
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,440
Everything is normal after the operation

468
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
After a few days of observation

469
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,840
If there is no problem

470
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
You can leave the hospital

471
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,840
Thank you, doctor

472
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,440
Ok

473
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,880
I told you it's not scary

474
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,480
Where is Nett

475
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,440
She was here when you were in the operation

476
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,720
But she left when she heard the doctor said the operation went well

477
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,560
Where did she go

478
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,680
She didn't say

479
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,200
But she left a bear and a letter

480
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,760
Azu, I am sorry

481
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,880
I left before you woke up

482
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,960
But the doctor said your operation went well

483
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,880
I am relieved

484
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,880
Thank you for your unconditional devotion

485
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,880
You let me know I deserve to be loved

486
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,560
You deserve a good girl

487
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,480
To give you real happiness

488
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,760
But she is not me

489
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,120
I have experienced so much with you

490
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,880
I really think I don't deserve to be with you

491
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,640
I want to try again

492
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,720
You have to take care of yourself after the operation

493
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,080
You should start over

494
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,600
Promise me

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,600
Don't be so impulsive

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,120
Don't be so strong

497
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Have a good day

498
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,680
Nett

499
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,880
Nett

500
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,840
Do you feel angry recently

501
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,640
No

502
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
I feel much better now

503
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,640
I have something to show you

504
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,360
Ok

505
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,920
I want to move

506
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
Are you ok

507
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,880
I am fine

508
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,000
You've made great progress

509
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,560
You are doing well

510
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,880
You must practice harder at home

511
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,360
But my breastache's coming

512
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,440
I'm practicing walking

513
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,000
I am despite地下地出

514
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Can you not tell your disciple?

515
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Mo Jiajun, I didn't interrupt your communication, right?

516
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,600
I'll get back to work.

517
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Okay.

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Qian Zai, you're getting better.

519
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,800
Doctor Li.

520
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,200
It's all thanks to you, Doctor Li.

521
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,000
Qian Qian can't only leave now.

522
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,600
I even took her to the farm to play.

523
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
That's great.

524
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
These flowers are so beautiful.

525
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I gave them to you.

526
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
You gave them to me? Thank you.

527
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
But why did you give me the sunflower?

528
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Because you're my sun.

529
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Thank you.

530
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you.

531
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Qian Qian, you should eat some too.

532
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
Thank you, little sister.

533
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
How is it? Is it good?

534
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Is it steamed egg or salted egg?

535
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
It's so salty.

536
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
I don't have any.

537
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
I've been busy all day.

538
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000
Can you give me some face?

539
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
But seriously,

540
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
I really miss the bamboo rice that Zhi Xiong made.

541
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
Do you remember?

542
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,200
Zhi Xiong is going back to the station to accompany his wife.

543
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,400
If you miss her so much, go to the station to find her.

544
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
No need.

545
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I'll make it for you next time.

546
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Okay?

547
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
I'll make it too.

548
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Okay.

549
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you remember that you said before

550
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
you wanted to take out some of your profits

551
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
to make a grassroots medical fund

552
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,000
to help some kids like Qian Zai?

553
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
I don't only remember, I'm still thinking about it.

554
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
I've also thought about it for you.

555
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,800
If we take out 30% of our profits,

556
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,200
the company's finances will still be very healthy.

557
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Actually, I don't only want to do a medical check-up.

558
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
I also want to provide those families with

559
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,600
the support of the grassroots patients.

560
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
It can relieve the pressure of the family

561
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,400
and bring them hope.

562
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
We can't let Qian Zai down.

563
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
Then why don't we call it the Sunset Crescent Act?

564
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
Sunset Crescent rises from the sun

565
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,600
which means giving hope to the patients.

566
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,200
Okay. I like Sunset Crescent.

567
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,800
How about we change the Crescent to the shoes of the shoes of the shoes.

568
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,400
It means that we can walk forward together with the patient.

569
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,200
That's even better.

570
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,400
It's really different to do a marketing.

571
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
You've made the whole thing more luxurious.

572
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,600
A'cu is back.

573
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Have you eaten? Help me eat some.

574
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,800
There's nothing tasty except white rice.

575
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,600
No need. I'm not hungry.

576
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,000
How is it? You haven't found her yet?

577
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
No. She resigned and moved out.

578
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
I don't have any news about her.

579
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,200
It's quite difficult to find someone in Hong Kong.

580
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
I'll go up first.

581
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,600
I've experienced so much with you.

582
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,400
I really feel that I don't deserve to stay by your side.

583
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
I want to try to start over.

584
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Promise me that you'll live every day well.

585
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Come.

586
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,200
Dr. Lin, why did you establish Sunset Crescent?

587
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,600
The inspiration for Sunset Crescent is actually from a patient.

588
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,800
She has a brain concussion and won't walk or talk at first.

589
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,200
After that, after the efforts of both sides of the patients,

590
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,000
one day, she walked by my side and gave me a Sunset Crescent.

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
At that moment, I was thinking, apart from her,

592
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
there are many patients with brain diseases and weak body in Hong Kong.

593
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,400
They need the help of Chinese medicine and medical resources.

594
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Apart from giving medicine and giving medicine, I want to do more.

595
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,800
I hope that the patients and their families can hope again

596
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,200
and let them continue to pursue their dreams.

597
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,800
I also hope that everyone who agrees with our friend

598
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
can give money and help them.

599
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,600
A Min, what do you think of this promotion?

600
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,200
Very good. It's simple and straightforward. Just use this sentence.

601
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
I thought that when you guys started,

602
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
you said that you wanted to help those sick children

603
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,000
to realize their dreams during the festival, so I was really shocked.

604
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
But I didn't think that their wish is so simple,

605
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,400
they just want to go to the farm to play.

606
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,800
We welcome everyone to do charity work and go out for a walk.

607
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Then, you can't do anything without good luck.

608
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
Of course, you won't have more illness.

609
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
Wow, why are there so many people today?

610
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Mom.

611
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,600
My soup isn't enough to share.

612
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll help you to share. You sit down.

613
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,400
A Min, this is 200,000 yuan. It supports your Xiang Ren Xie campaign.

614
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
That much?

615
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
This is just a small part of the income of Ren Yuan.

616
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,200
You can also reduce your taxes when you do charity work.

617
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
A while ago, I went to see Second Brother with my sister.

618
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
He also said that it's good.

619
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,000
Uncle has really changed a lot.

620
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Actually, I didn't expect that

621
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,200
other than giving Ren Yuan to you, he even transferred the shares to you.

622
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
He has figured out everything.

623
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
The only thing that he can't let go of now

624
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,400
is his son and wife.

625
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,600
If A Ken is willing to admit his crime like Second Brother, he won't be so harsh.

626
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Don't say things that make you unhappy.

627
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,400
Let's help.

628
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay, okay.

629
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,600
How to do it? Come, teach us.

630
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,600
As the saying goes, in the spring of March,

631
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
the night has fallen, the morning has come, and the wind has stopped.

632
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
The hair has been cut and the hair has been cut again.

633
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,400
The treatment isn't limited to the clinic.

634
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,800
Sometimes, the sun and the nature are also good medicine for treating illness.

635
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,000
Today, we also invited special guests.

636
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
They are the Star-Picking and Flying Dumplings.

637
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Welcome them.

638
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Hello, everyone.

639
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,800
And remember, don't scare them when you feed the sheep.

640
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Otherwise, they will spit on your whole body.

641
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,600
That's right.

642
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Come one by one. Everyone has one.

643
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
Mom, I don't have any feed.

644
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,200
Sister, I've finished feeding.

645
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,000
Here's a cup for you.

646
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Thank you.

647
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
This is for you.

648
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Thank you, Sister.

649
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,200
Ying Ying, there are children who want to drink water.

650
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Do you know where the water is?

651
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
Oh, yes.

652
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,800
I didn't expect my sister to be so good.

653
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I used to think that she can only be taken care of by others.

654
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,200
Now, she can take care of others.

655
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
It's thanks to her own hard work.

656
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,400
Plus, you and your parents are by her side.

657
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,000
That's why she can make such a big progress in the next two years.

658
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,800
And your encouragement.

659
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,200
She often opens her mouth and closes her mouth.

660
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,800
She's the one who listens to you the most.

661
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm just doing my duty as a doctor.

662
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
In fact, the care of the family is the most important.

663
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,200
You are her strongest backing.

664
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
If I hadn't met you,

665
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
I wouldn't have known how to face my sister's illness.

666
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Maybe I'm still trying to avoid it.

667
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I think Jingzhi and Qianzai are just like me.

668
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
They feel lucky to have met you.

669
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Actually, I don't know how much I can do.

670
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Step by step.

671
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I hope to do my best to help more people who need help.

672
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Don't worry. I'll be by your side and support you.

673
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
We need to make the Day Day Up campaign bigger.

674
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
We need to organize more activities every year.

675
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
So more people can donate to the charity fund.

676
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
That's it.

677
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Are you here for a date or an activity?

678
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
It's rare to have you. Of course I'm going to be lazy.

679
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Did you forget something important to do?

680
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
What?

681
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Little girl, that camel is so cute.

682
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Let's go take a picture.

683
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Yes, a special mission.

684
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Where's the important thing?

685
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
It's with you.

686
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Where did you go without me?

687
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Why didn't you bring the important thing with you?

688
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Stop arguing. Hurry up and find it.

689
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
No.

690
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Could it be on the bus?

691
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
How would I know?

692
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
You go over there. I'll look for it here.

693
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I'll go over there and help you find happiness.

694
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Come on.

695
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Wow, is it exciting?

696
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
How about it? Can you be higher?

697
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
You're a kid. You're everywhere.

698
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
You're a kid. You're everywhere.

699
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Is it fun?

700
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Brother.

701
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
How's it going? Did you find it?

702
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Okay.

703
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Thank goodness I found it.

704
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
You're so careless.

705
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Hey, what's wrong with you?

706
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
You look so ugly.

707
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I saw you just now.

708
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
That's great.

709
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
And then?

710
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I saw you just now.

711
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I saw you just now.

712
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
That's great. And then?

713
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
I saw him with a man.

714
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
He was very happy with a kid.

715
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
No, I didn't say hello to him.

716
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm afraid to disturb him.

717
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Actually, I often think about

718
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
what would happen if I met him again.

719
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I think I won't let him leave.

720
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
But I see him so happy.

721
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Should I give up?

722
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
What?

723
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
You're not wrong.

724
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
You've been looking for him for a year.

725
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
You can't find him.

726
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Now you give up when you meet him.

727
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
You go to him and tell him

728
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
what you want to say to him this year.

729
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
It's better than what you see now.

730
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
You can't let go of it. Go.

731
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Go find your own happiness. Go.

732
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
So beautiful.

733
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
So beautiful.

734
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
A'zu, long time no see.

735
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Long time no see.

736
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I want to say

737
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
although you've started your new life,

738
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
but even if you're someone else's wife,

739
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
mother,

740
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
your position in my heart

741
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
will never change.

742
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
I'm sorry.

743
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
I'll never change.

744
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
What do you mean?

745
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
What are you talking about?

746
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
I saw you three

747
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
having fun over there.

748
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Marcus.

749
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Are you happy today?

750
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Happy.

751
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Thank you.

752
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Bye, grandma.

753
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Bye, we're going to eat.

754
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
We're going to eat snow cake.

755
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Why does your son call you grandma?

756
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
He's my student.

757
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Of course he calls me grandma.

758
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Or he calls me mom.

759
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
And we haven't seen each other for a year.

760
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Do you think I can have such a big son?

761
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Then you're with someone else's son.

762
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Because I'm a kindergarten assistant.

763
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I'll be a teacher later.

764
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Today is a family trip.

765
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
So we'll play together.

766
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Don't be like this.

767
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Nonsense and not clear-headed.

768
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Is it because your brain is not clean?

769
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Great.

770
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Do you know I've been looking for you for a long time?

771
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I've been to your place.

772
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Your place of work.

773
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
I can't find you.

774
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
You said you'd wait for me to wake up.

775
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Why didn't I see you when I woke up?

776
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Where did you go?

777
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
A'zuo.

778
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I wrote down everything I wanted to say in the letter.

779
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
I've seen it many times.

780
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,200
You said you don't deserve to be with me.

781
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
But I don't mind at all.

782
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I just want to be with you.

783
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
It's not that you don't mind.

784
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
It's me who mind.

785
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I mind that you know

786
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I can't face you

787
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
in all my previous things.

788
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Even if I know what you did before,

789
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I haven't changed a bit about you.

790
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Do you want to start over?

791
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Let's start over together.

792
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
The past can't be changed.

793
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
But you can choose

794
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
today, tomorrow,

795
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
and every day after that.

796
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Which one of us you want to spend time with.

797
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
With me.

798
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
A'zuo,

799
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
let me go first.

800
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,200
I won't let you go.

801
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I finally found you.

802
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I won't let you go.

803
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

804
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I lied to Xiaomei that I have a stomachache

805
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
and went to the bathroom.

806
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
So I could leave her alone.

807
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
She was so nervous

808
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
to mention about this yellow.

809
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I was so worried.

810
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I was so worried.

811
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
I was so worried.

812
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
I was so worried.

813
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
I was so worried.

814
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I was so worried.

815
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I was so worried.

816
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I was so worried.

817
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I was so worried.

818
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Thank you, Yingying.

819
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'll leave Xiaomei to you.

820
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Go to her.

821
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Go for it, Doctor Li.

822
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Brother, wait for your good news.

823
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I'll go now.

824
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
What's wrong?

825
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
I've already

826
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
wanted to do something.

827
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,740
Today is the first day of the Day Day

828
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Day Day movement.

829
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I think doing it today

830
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,740
will make it very meaningful.

831
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
In fact, I'm lucky

832
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
to meet you.

833
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
You've been through a lot with me.

834
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
You made me a better person.

835
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
So in the future,

836
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
you let me take care of you.

837
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I'm sorry.

838
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Marry me.

839
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Put me on.

840
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I have a gift for you.

841
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Thank you.

842
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Really?

843
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Brother, brother.

844
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
I caught Nella.

845
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
She promised not to leave me again.

846
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Isn't it shocking?

847
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
I'm more shocked. I'm going to be a father.

848
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Really?

849
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Congratulations.

850
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
I'm going to be a nanny.

851
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Congratulations.

852
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,180
The

853
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,180
best in the world

854
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,180
The best in the world

855
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
The best in the world

856
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,180
The best in the world

857
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,180
The best in the world

858
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
The best in the world

859
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
The best in the world

860
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
You're useless.

861
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
I can't shoot so close.

862
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
What are you laughing at? You bastard.

863
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
What's wrong?

864
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Dad, dad wants to hit me.

865
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Why are you bullying him?

866
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Did I bully him? Come here.

867
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,180
Your parents are so upright.

868
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
You're so cunning. You picked it up, right?

869
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Of course not.

870
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Xiao Jian is the cutest.

871
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Right?

872
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
You're a ghost face.

873
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
Be careful.

874
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Don't hurt daddy.

875
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
What are you doing?

876
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
I like my little friend so much.

877
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Let's have a baby.

878
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
Who wants to have a baby with you?

879
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,180
You.

880
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
I'm going to be a nanny.

881
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,180
I'm going to be a nanny.

882
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Good. Go to paint.

883
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Yingying,

884
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
help me prepare a needle bed.

885
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,180
The patient will lie on the right side of the needle.

886
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Okay, no problem.

887
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Add a little bit of red here.

888
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,180
It will be more beautiful.

889
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
No.

890
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
It's common.

891
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
I don't care about what others say.

892
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
I don't care.

893
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
It's common.

894
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
Don't disturb Jingzhi.

895
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
I'll take you downstairs to find mommy.

896
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay.

897
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Mommy.

898
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,180
Baby.

899
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Mommy, I want to eat a nail.

900
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Okay.

901
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,180
Just one.

902
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
I know.

903
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,180
上功治胃病

904
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,180
上功治胃病

905
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Not only the medical theory,

906
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
but also the attitude of life.

907
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,180
A doctor is a man of common sense.

908
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Not only

909
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
to treat pain and illness,

910
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
but also to be

911
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
a light in other people's lives.

912
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Want to effectively manage pain,

913
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
you can use ABC Three Steps.

914
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
A is aware.

915
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
Pay attention to the body.

916
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
Is there a place that hurts at once?

917
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,180
As the saying goes, if it doesn't work, it hurts.

918
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,180
B is behavior.

919
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,180
Improve your bad habits.

920
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,180
For example, adjust your long-term bad posture.

921
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
C is care.

922
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
Do regular

923
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,180
A, B, C.
