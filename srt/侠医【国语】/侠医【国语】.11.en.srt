1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The doctor said that I have a tumor in my brain.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I said I didn't want to die.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to have my own career, family, house, girlfriend.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let me take care of you.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Azu.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You are a very, very good person.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But I'm not only your friend.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No other person.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Stop!

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, you thief!

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let go!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you taking at this hour?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to know what illness he has.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He turned down my good-natured card suddenly.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think he must have a terminal disease.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's not his case.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Give it to me.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,800
I'll see for myself

48
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Don't scare a kid, okay?

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
You tore it

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
You tore my notebook

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Notebook

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Brother, I know I'm wrong

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Tear your notebook

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
You don't have to stab me all over

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,800
The meridian is all over the body

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
You understand, right?

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
You want to stab someone with a needle

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Want to use me to practice

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
I can see that you like Rachel

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
I must want to help her solve the needle

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Actually, you two are so close

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
What stage are you at?

63
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
Did you hold hands? Did you kiss me?

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
Did you go to her house?

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
You are good at kissing girls

66
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm praising you

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Why do you still want to stab me?

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Small wounds

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Make your throat throat

70
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Let you not talk nonsense

71
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
45 minutes

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't move

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Brother

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Brother, help me pull it out, brother

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
I want one too

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Aren't you sending cards?

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
Why don't you give it to me?

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Mo Jiajun

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
You stand there

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Why are you dressed like this?

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
No

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
I want to help you

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't you feel bored

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
wearing this doll's clothes?

85
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
To be honest

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
I think you are suffering now

87
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
It's not like you are helping me

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Sister

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Maybe you think I'm too much

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
But after reading your painting that day

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I really think your painting is very beautiful

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
I really think your painting is very beautiful

93
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
Very talented

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want you to deny yourself because of others

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
You deny yourself

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Don't paint anymore

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you think I want to?

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
What can I do?

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Everyone only sees me as a wheelchair

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
It doesn't matter how I paint

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
So you should use painting

102
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
to prove yourself

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
You can't use a wheelchair like them

104
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
to label yourself

105
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
In fact, reality is like this

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
No matter how hard I try

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
No one will see me as a normal person

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
You should understand

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,200
I wear this dress to help you promote

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
Just to prove one thing

111
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
I want you to know

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Everyone really likes the things you paint

113
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
Your effort won't go to waste

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
I also helped you get an IG account

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
If you don't believe me, just open your phone and see it yourself

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Actually, I don't understand why you care so much about yourself

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Are you a brain-dead?

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,200
You are labeling yourself

119
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Others don't care at all

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Anyway, I don't want to be followed

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
I just want to be happy

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Then why do you want to participate in the exhibition?

123
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
Why do you sound like you know me very well?

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Xia Chengqiang

125
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,600
It's so late. How can you take out the painting?

126
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
I plan to throw it all away

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
Why?

128
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,000
It's meaningless to keep it

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
How can it be?

130
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
Look, how beautiful these paintings are

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
They look so happy

132
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Jinzhi

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Grandma doesn't know what art is

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
But every time you paint

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,600
Your eyes are shining

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
When you paint, you look so happy

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,200
How can it be meaningless?

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Actually, every time I paint

139
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
I feel so calm

140
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
It's like I'm no different from others

141
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,000
My good granddaughter is excellent and beautiful

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
The people outside are no match for you

144
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Grandma

145
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,200
It's okay if others don't know your good side

146
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
It's their loss

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not short of money and flowers

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,200
So no matter what you do

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't make yourself suffer

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Do you understand?

151
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
I understand

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Don't worry about me, grandma

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,200
I really like this painting

154
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,400
You want to give it to me?

155
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Of course

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
I want to hang it in my room

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Are you angry?

158
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You're the designer

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have the account

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
You can delete it or not

161
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
It's your decision

162
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
But before you delete it

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Why don't you click it?

164
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
The cartoon is so cute

165
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Will it be on the Internet?

166
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Or on the book?

167
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Yes

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
It's cured

169
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,400
It's so cute

170
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Hello

171
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Our company is called Lvguangmingmei

172
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a creative agency that focuses on IP development and authorized cooperation

173
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
We like to fly dumplings

174
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
We think there is a possibility of further development

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
I don't know if you're interested in cooperation

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
If you're interested, please contact me

177
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
We'll talk when we meet

178
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Thanks

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't want to get a headache or a neckache

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Sis, you said you didn't want to take medicine

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
You didn't want to be so tired

182
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,600
You didn't want to be weak

183
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Now Lin Weimin can help you

184
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
No

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
I've seen a horror movie

186
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
The bad guys in it are so scary

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No

188
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Look at the needle

189
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,800
It's so thin that I can barely see it

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
It's so long

191
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Is it short?

192
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,000
It's so short that it's hard to take it out

193
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
It's dangerous

194
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes, it's safe to stick it on your head

195
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
You should believe in the medical skills of Dr. Ling

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Yingying, look at me

197
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
No

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
Sis, Lin Weimin is showing you

199
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
It's safe to stick it on your head

200
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't be afraid

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
It doesn't hurt at all

202
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
No

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
It's okay

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If you're afraid, you'll be heartless

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
You'll be a fool

206
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,000
You'll be stubborn

207
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
Actually, the patient's mood is still emotional

208
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
It affects the treatment

209
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Since he's resisting

210
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Maybe we can try again

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Okay, okay

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't hold your head

213
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Don't stick it on your head

214
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Don't be afraid, sis

215
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,200
We can go home now

216
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
You can take sis home first

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We have to work

218
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay, okay, okay

219
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,800
Let's go

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Sorry, Dr. Ling

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,600
You're so busy

222
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
You have to help Yingying

223
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
It's okay

224
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
I hope Yingying can accept it slowly

225
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
We'll go now

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Goodbye

227
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Goodbye

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Sis

229
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
What are you doing here?

230
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I'm Mr. Liang

231
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
You're Mr. Liang

232
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes

233
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
So you're lying to me to see the house

234
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
You're just a man

235
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
You're just a man

236
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I'm here to see the house

237
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,600
You're so clumsy

238
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,400
You waste my time

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm not lying to you

240
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
I can buy it

241
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
You can buy it

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
Do you know how much money you can buy here?

243
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
You waste my time

244
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
I have to close all the doors

245
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
You didn't answer my call

246
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
You didn't reply my text

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to see you

248
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
How can I see you if I don't do this?

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Now you see me

250
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
I stand closer to see you

251
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Will you leave?

252
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you have a terminal illness?

253
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

254
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,600
We often meet

255
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
We eat together

256
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You even want to get in my car

257
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
We slept in the same bed

258
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,600
You like me, don't you?

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
Why are you willing to?

260
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
You suddenly refused me

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,400
Do you have a terminal illness?

262
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,400
I found out

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Not only is Deng Shikeng sick

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
You're sick too

265
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
I asked my brother

266
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,200
You don't have to lie to me

267
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,200
What did you ask your brother?

268
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
What did he hit you?

269
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
He just didn't answer anything

270
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
So you must have a terminal illness

271
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
You'd rather believe that I have a terminal illness

272
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
than believe that I don't like you

273
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Are you kidding me?

274
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't feel so good

275
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Don't make me

276
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
even a little bit of affection for you

277
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
You finally admit that you have a little bit of affection for me

278
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
I treat you as a friend

279
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,000
A friend, a friend

280
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
The point is a friend

281
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,000
No

282
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
The point is that you said you have affection for me

283
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
No

284
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,400
I order you to leave now

285
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Do you know why you're angry?

286
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Are you angry that I took you to the inn to see the house

287
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
and wasted your time?

288
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll send you a message to apologize to you

289
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Are you leaving after you burn it?

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll burn it

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,400
You go

292
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Go now

293
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,000
And your phone is so annoying

294
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Brother

295
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Hello, brother

296
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,200
How is it?

297
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,600
There's really no red flower?

298
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
I asked the truck driver

299
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,600
He said he went to Uncle Gui

300
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
The people from Uncle Gui didn't give him the goods

301
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,000
What did Uncle Gui say?

302
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I've been calling for a long time and no one answered

303
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,000
The main ingredient of Jian Jianning is red flowers

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
So next

305
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,800
The production line after the packaging, label and packaging

306
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,800
will stop

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Will we have no time to deliver goods?

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm worried about this now

309
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
We have already agreed with Fen Xiang

310
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,200
on the date of our holiday

311
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Uncle Gui is here

312
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
Uncle Gui, I'm a citizen

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Why can't we deliver goods?

314
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Ling

315
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
The warehouse suddenly leaked water

316
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
The whole batch of red flowers are all over

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
I can't deliver goods to you

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,200
Leaked water? How come?

319
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
It hasn't rained recently

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
Anyway, that's it

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Did you take a picture?

322
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Can you show me the damaged situation?

323
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
No, I don't think about it

324
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,800
It's all going to be wasted

325
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
That's it

326
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Uncle Gui is strange

327
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Should we find a new supplier?

328
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
What Rachel said is right

329
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
We can't sit and wait

330
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
Azu

331
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
You try to contact your peers

332
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Buy the red flowers on their hands

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Buy as much as possible

334
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Rachel, help me call

335
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
It's possible to buy

336
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Try it all

337
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,200
it is good

338
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
I'll handle Uncle Gui's matter

339
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uncle Gui, I'm a citizen

340
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm going to your place

341
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
See you later

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
Do you have red flowers?

343
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
We're in a hurry

344
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
Hello, we're Mai Mai Tong

345
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
I want to ask if you have red flowers

346
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,800
Sorry, we don't have enough red flowers

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you

348
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Rachel, no one has goods

349
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
No

350
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Why doesn't every family have goods?

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
In theory, there should be some stock

352
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
Is it because I just entered the industry

353
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
and everyone doesn't know me?

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Maybe Azu has made progress

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
He knows a lot of people in this industry

356
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,400
You can go and ask

357
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
it is good

358
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,600
Hello, Azu

359
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
We didn't collect goods here

360
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Did you collect goods?

361
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
I also asked six bosses

362
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Everyone saw me

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like seeing a ghost

364
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
Said the red flowers were sold out

365
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't think it's that simple

366
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
I think so too

367
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
How could it be so coincidental?

368
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,600
I'll go back and force those guys

369
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,000
to tell me the reason

370
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
OK, that's enough

371
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Hello, it's Miss Luo from Mai Mai Tong again

372
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
You don't have to ask anymore

373
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
I said there wouldn't be goods

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
I know, but I want to ask

375
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
if you have any colleagues

376
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
who can help you

377
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Our order is urgent

378
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
and it's a big deal

379
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
The price is 30% higher than the market price

380
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
It's not that difficult

381
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Is that so?

382
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
I'll give you the intermediary fee at most

383
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,400
You won't have money to make money, right?

384
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
It's just that...

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,600
Do you have any hard questions?

386
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,000
There are some things that are not very convenient

387
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,400
Let me tell him directly

388
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Hello, Richo

389
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
How is it? Long time no see

390
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
It's you again

391
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Deng Shikeng, you're here to play tricks

392
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't say that, I'm a good person

393
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
I heard that your Mai Mai Tong

394
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
is very popular

395
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
I have a lot of them

396
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you want me to sell some to you?

397
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
How could you be so kind?

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
My cousin and I are not good at drawing

399
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
but we are good at drawing with beauties

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,800
You're willing to come out and see me in person

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
It's not that we can't discuss it

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
OK, I'll go out and see you

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Where are you?

404
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll return it to you

405
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Why? You think it's too much money?

406
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
That's it

407
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
How much do you want?

408
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Let's have a price

409
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,800
I don't want to help you

410
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
Ling Wei Ming is really good to me

411
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He's not you

412
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
So I won't betray him

413
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
You don't like my cousin, do you?

414
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
It's none of your business

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,000
I know my cousin the best

416
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you think he would like a woman

417
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,800
who can open a bed sheet by paying the rent?

418
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I don't know

419
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
I just know that he likes a woman

420
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
who can open a bed sheet by paying the rent

421
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Natalie, don't pretend in front of me

422
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,600
It's a million yuan

423
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,400
You can't earn more than this

424
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Do you need so many red and green lights?

425
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Richo

426
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
A Zu, don't ask about your friends

427
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
Deng Shikeng is playing tricks

428
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
He wants all of you to stop selling red flowers to us

429
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,200
That loser again

430
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,400
Why is he like a mad dog?

431
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
He's biting us

432
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Did you tell my brother?

433
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
No, I can't find him

434
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Tell him I have an appointment with Deng Shikeng

435
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No

436
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Don't go to see him alone

437
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,200
I have no choice

438
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
He has bought all the red flowers

439
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
We have to ask him to buy them

440
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Let's see what he can do

441
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Where are you now?

442
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll go to you now

443
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't go by yourself

444
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,200
I know where he is. I won't talk to him

445
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Where is Zu Yi Shi?

446
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Ruo Fu

447
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,400
Weitsing

449
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Di Renjie

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why do you want to come to official Address?

451
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Hello

452
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Uncle Gui, the most famous herbs in your company

453
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,120
are well preserved and of good quality.

454
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,400
But now you tell me that the warehouse is leaking.

455
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
What happened?

456
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,280
The water pipe is leaking. I don't want it either.

457
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,600
The water pipe is leaking?

458
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,800
I see.

459
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,680
Your other goods are all normal.

460
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,560
Only my red flowers are all sold out.

461
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,320
All other goods are fine.

462
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,600
It's really leaking at the red flowers.

463
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,760
Uncle Gui, we've been working together for so many years.

464
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,960
To be honest,

465
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
if there are other buyers,

466
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,400
just tell me.

467
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
The price can be discussed.

468
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
It's really an accident.

469
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,600
There's no other reason.

470
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Am I going to give you a discount?

471
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
Anyway, don't worry.

472
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I'll compensate you according to the contract.

473
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Red flowers are our raw materials.

474
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Can compensation solve the problem?

475
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
I know.

476
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I've disrupted your production plan.

477
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
But I can't help it.

478
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
How about this?

479
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,400
Next time, I'll give you the goods first.

480
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
What's wrong?

481
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Brother,

482
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,000
it's your bastard cousin who's behind all this.

483
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,400
He bought all the red flowers.

484
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Uncle Gui must have a secret relationship with him.

485
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Also,

486
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Rachel went to see Deng Shikang.

487
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm afraid he'll come alone.

488
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
But I have a traffic jam.

489
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Come back quickly.

490
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll be back as soon as possible.

491
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,200
It's Deng Shikang, right?

492
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,800
He's the most honest in business.

493
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
I'll give you a chance to confess.

494
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
You can choose to lie to me.

495
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
You're the most curious.

496
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
I'll be honest with you.

497
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,400
I'll be honest with you.

498
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
You can choose to lie to me all the way.

499
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You'd better pray that

500
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,400
you can continue your business with him for a long time.

501
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I'll let all our country's peers know it.

502
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
Let's see if they will work with you,

503
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
who sold out long-term partners for money.

504
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Wu Wei Ming, Wu Wei Ming.

505
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Cousin, come and drink with me.

506
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
Where's Rachel?

507
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
You're here?

508
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
She's gone and gone?

509
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
That's interesting.

510
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
You found a woman and came to this place?

511
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,000
Stop pretending.

512
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
You thought we didn't know?

513
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,960
to buy his red flowers

514
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,240
to make us out of money

515
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
and force us to sell them?

516
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,280
It's a good thing to do business

517
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,880
You don't have to sell them to me

518
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,840
People don't need red flowers

519
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,000
You can't use all the red flowers

520
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Why do you do something

521
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,640
that will harm people?

522
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,360
Yes, I just want to make fun of you

523
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,760
I don't have any red flowers

524
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
But I'd rather

525
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,240
put them in the warehouse

526
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,880
and give them to you

527
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,040
What do you think?

528
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
Are you a pervert?

529
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
He's your cousin

530
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm talking to my cousin

531
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,280
It's none of your business

532
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,400
Who are you talking about?

533
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
Enough, Shikang

534
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,520
Azu is my family

535
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,200
He's not a pervert

536
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,760
I don't care about Ren Yuan anymore

537
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
Why do you insist on biting me?

538
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,400
Because you're pretending to be a man

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,560
You pretend to be a gentleman

540
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080
You steal our business and steal Ren Yuan's

541
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,600
It's because you don't like it

542
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,840
Last time you colluded with Rachel

543
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
and made us unable to buy a house

544
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,280
This time I want you to

545
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,560
pay no interest when you go home

546
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm happy to see you finished

547
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,080
This time I'll see how you end up

548
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,440
You'll end up...

549
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,840
Why are you looking for me?

550
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,360
Answer me honestly

551
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,440
Did you take the money from Deng Shikang

552
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,840
to sell Amin and Mai Maitong?

553
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,160
Why do you say that?

554
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
I went to see Deng Shikang just now

555
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,080
I saw you take out the cheque

556
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,520
after you saw him

557
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,640
And

558
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
Deng Shikang told me that himself

559
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
What's the matter, Deng Shikang?

560
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
You're bored, aren't you?

561
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,200
You want to make Mai Maitong suffer even if you die

562
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,240
What are you going to do

563
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,600
to return the red flower to us?

564
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,560
Drink a glass of wine first

565
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Don't waste time

566
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Just say it

567
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,600
I have a bottom line

568
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
If you're going to threaten us

569
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
not only your cousin

570
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
I won't save you

571
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,800
Although you and Natalie are good sisters

572
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
you have a very different personality

573
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
You do everything against me

574
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
They all listen to me

575
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,600
What do you want to say?

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
You know to ask me

577
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
But why don't you ask yourself?

578
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,600
How can I know

579
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
that the most important raw material of your new products

580
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
is red flowers?

581
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm very fair

582
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
In terms of work

583
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
Honestly, Natalie

584
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
can really help?

585
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Just now

586
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
She took the cheque of one million and left

587
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
I know you do everything for money

588
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,600
Azu likes you

589
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
You use him to inquire about the news

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
But Amin treats you

591
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
He is so good to you

592
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
How can you betray him?

593
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Have you forgotten how Deng Shiheng treats you?

594
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
You know I like Amin

595
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
He is a

596
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
good man I've never met

597
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Diamond King, Lao Wu

598
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I want him

599
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why should I betray him?

600
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,600
You mean it?

601
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes

602
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
I really like him

603
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,400
What about you?

604
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Do you like him?

605
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
What we need to discuss is not whether you like him

606
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,000
It's that Man Man agreed to make trouble for me

607
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
Don't pretend to be a talkative person

608
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,800
I know you treat him differently

609
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm fighting for the same man as you

610
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
But I won't lose

611
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
Then why do you want to see Deng Shiheng

612
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,800
and take his cheque?

613
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,000
It's none of your business

614
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Anyway, whether you believe it or not

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
I won't hurt Lin Weimin

616
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,400
And

617
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
You can treat him well

618
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,400
I can too

619
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
But I use my way

620
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,600
I'll go now

621
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,200
Amin

622
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,000
Amin

623
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Liang Yanzu, you can leave now

624
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Remember to report every Monday

625
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Do you know?

626
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Yes

627
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Thank you, officer

628
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,200
What happened?

629
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
How can A'zu get the gemstone?

630
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
You bastard

631
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,600
A'zu, no

632
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
It can't solve the problem

633
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
Calm down, let him go

634
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
I'll take my revenge

635
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
Help, are you crazy?

636
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Someone is hitting me

637
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
Call the police, he's hitting me

638
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Who knows that loser will be so crazy

639
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
He hit himself with a smoke bomb

640
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,200
The most important thing is that I have my fingerprint on the smoke bomb

641
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
Did you tell the police?

642
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,200
No, brother said that we should wait for the lawyer

643
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,200
This is a criminal case

644
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,600
We need to discuss with the lawyer

645
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
We should go back to the company as soon as possible

646
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
We need to start the factory as soon as possible

647
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
How can we start without the red flowers?

648
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
I've got an idea

649
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Dear colleagues, good news

650
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,400
The problem of the red flowers shortage has been solved

651
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
We will restore Jian Jianning's production line very soon

652
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,400
Yeah

653
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Yeah

654
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,400
But the bad news is that we will work overtime

655
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Because we need to catch up with the progress

656
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,400
We need to catch up with the holiday

657
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
No problem

658
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Boss, how did you solve the problem of red flowers?

659
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Yes, and the red flowers are the exclusive supply of the department

660
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,000
Actually, I contacted the red flowers planting business in the mainland

661
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
In addition, I asked friends from the logistics to help me arrange the special line

662
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,000
And send the red flowers directly to us

663
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
The transportation fee is a little expensive

664
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
But it will take us on time to get the goods

665
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
You are here to see me

666
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I'm not here to see you, I'm here to see your brother

667
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, what's the matter?

668
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
You had a good talk just now

669
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
Have you solved the problem of red flowers?

670
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Money can solve the problem

671
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
Well, Azu even told you about the red flowers

672
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Deng Shikeng told me

673
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I have a good idea

674
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,000
He wants to buy me this cheque

675
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,600
It's a cheque

676
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
I know

677
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But this cheque is not 200,000

678
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,200
It's 1 million

679
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
The cheque he gave me for the first time was 200,000

680
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
But I didn't agree

681
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
The second cheque grew to 1 million

682
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,600
But I won't agree no matter it's 1 million or 1 million

683
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Although I don't work for you like Rachel

684
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
But I won't harm you

685
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Thank you

686
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,200
I took this cheque

687
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
Because I think if he wants to harm you

688
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
He will make you a mess

689
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Now that you have solved the problem with money

690
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
That's good

691
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
He owes you the cheque

692
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Shikang won't let you go easily

693
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,600
He bought me

694
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,000
He can't sue me for not having the black paper

695
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,200
You take it

696
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
As my friend's love for you

697
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,800
You don't want to do this, do you?

698
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,800
I'll keep this cheque for you for the time being

699
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,600
You never smile so happily in front of me

700
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Son, what happened?

701
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
How could this happen?

702
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
Liang Yanyan is a bastard

703
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
He hit me with a smoke bomb

704
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
And hurt me

705
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
He's crazy

706
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,600
Why did he hit you?

707
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,800
The supplier didn't give them anything

708
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
So he blamed me

709
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
They suddenly came back and scolded me

710
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
That bastard

711
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,000
He hit me without saying a word

712
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
Is he crazy?

713
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
You are his boss's cousin

714
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
He even dared to hit you

715
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
So the most exaggerated thing is that his cousin is here

716
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
He didn't help me

717
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
That Lin Weiming

718
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
He is merciless, we are not

719
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,000
We don't have to give him face

720
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm going to your aunt's house

721
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
To scold them

722
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
It's no use for you to rush over now

723
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,800
Call the police and let the police handle it

724
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
He's putting his dog here now

725
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
To bite your son, idiot

726
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
Mom, forget it

727
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
I don't want to have anything to do with that Lin

728
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Any relationship

729
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm going to talk to them now

730
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Feng

731
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,000
Feng

732
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Why are you here alone?

733
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,800
Why are you so angry?

734
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
I called you sister

735
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
I didn't expect you to hurt my son so much

736
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
What's wrong?

737
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,800
Your son

738
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
That damn pig, dog, dog

739
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,200
That Yan Zu

740
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
He hit my son to death

741
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
Now he's lying in the hospital

742
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,800
A Zu won't hit people without any reason

743
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
It must be A Keng

744
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,200
I don't know what he did

745
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
You even accused the bad guys first

746
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,400
You are just like your son

747
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
The autopsy report

748
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,000
The record of the case

749
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
My son was beaten to death

750
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,600
Your son was killed

751
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,200
I don't know how you taught your son

752
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't be so excited

753
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
There may be a misunderstanding

754
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
When they come back

755
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
You can ask them in person

756
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,600
I have nothing to say to them

757
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
I won't forget it

758
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
See you in court

759
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Feng, we are family

760
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,600
I don't want to have anything to do with you

761
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,800
I want to buy your shares in Ren Yuan

762
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
My husband left me the shares of my company

763
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
For us

764
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
I won't sell it no matter how much I pay

765
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
You keep talking about the company

766
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
You don't care

767
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
But you insist on holding the shares

768
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
You make my husband and my son

769
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Unable to get out of the company

770
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,000
You are so brave

771
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You don't tolerate me

772
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
I will sue that guy

773
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
To get justice for my son

774
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
I will find out about A Zu

775
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
But I won't take the company's shares

776
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,800
As the bargaining chip

777
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
You are so noisy

778
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,400
You are not welcome here

779
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
I am back

780
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
What are you doing?

781
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
I am helping your sister

782
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,800
To overcome the fear of the acupuncture

783
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Is it useful?

784
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
Step by step

785
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Come on, sister, let's start

786
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
Stretch out your hand

787
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Come on

788
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
How is it?

789
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Are you not afraid of your back?

790
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No

791
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,400
Ok, remember

792
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
It doesn't hurt to use acupuncture

793
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
No

794
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,600
Now it's your turn

795
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Put your legs out

796
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
It itches

797
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Yes, it's just itching, doesn't it hurt?

798
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,000
It itches

799
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Now I will pinch your neck

800
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,200
No, no, no

801
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Weiwei, what are you doing?

802
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,200
You scared my daughter

803
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
I just want to help her

804
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
You can't force her

805
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,600
I am afraid

806
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
You use acupuncture to pinch your neck

807
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Is it safe?

808
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Sister, it hurts

809
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
I will help you

810
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Is it better?

811
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
I feel much better

812
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Why didn't it hurt when you pinched me?

813
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Sister, you only help your sister

814
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
Can you help me?

815
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
Help mom

816
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
Mom is working hard

817
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I want to help mom

818
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dali, Dali

819
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Young master

820
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
Mrs. Deng is here to see Mrs. Deng

821
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,200
Mrs. Deng

822
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
Don't believe them

823
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
I didn't hit that bastard

824
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,000
They wronged me

825
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,800
Azu, I know you very well

826
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
You said you didn't hit anyone

827
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,600
I will believe you

828
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,800
But A Min

829
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
That Feng came here to get angry

830
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
He said he wanted me to sell all the shares of the company to him

831
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
You are so obvious

832
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
He did so many things

833
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,600
Just want to use me to force Mrs. Deng to sell the shares to him

834
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
Mom, you didn't agree with them, right?

835
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,000
It's dad's hard work to get the source of the health care oil

836
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
You have to think about it

837
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,200
I don't lack money

838
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,600
The shares of the company

839
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Your dad left to us two

840
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,000
I will not sell it

841
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
But they said they would sue Azu

842
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
They can sue anyone they want

843
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I am a man of my word

844
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They can't sue me

845
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,800
Mom, don't worry

846
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
If you don't want to sell it, no one can force you

847
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I will handle this

848
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Thank you, brother

849
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
Mrs. Deng, do you want to take out the soup?

850
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,000
Okay, I will take it for you

851
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Let me help you, Mrs. Deng

852
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Okay

853
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Slow down, don't rush

854
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,600
We have a lot of time today

855
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,200
Okay

856
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,400
The soup is very hot, be careful

857
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Brother, brother, brother

858
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Come here

859
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,600
What?

860
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
What did Ned want to see you today?

861
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,600
Is he okay?

862
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
You are so

863
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,400
You are so self-confident and you are worried about others

864
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Do you think you can handle it?

865
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,600
I said thank you

866
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
Ken used one million to buy Ned

867
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
He wants to give him the information about the new products of MaiMaiTong

868
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
So Ned betrayed us

869
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
Don't worry, he didn't agree

870
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,800
He also gave me one million

871
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
He said I should solve the problem of Honghua

872
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,400
You are so kind and beautiful

873
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
You are so kind and beautiful

874
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Enough, enough

875
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Save it

876
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
You can tell him yourself

877
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,800
But Deng Shikang is so despicable

878
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
By the way, how do you deal with one million?

879
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Give him a chance

880
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Of course not

881
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,200
He owes us

882
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
If he continues to sue me

883
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I will take money to sue him

884
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
It will be better to keep that one million

885
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
If you really think about it

886
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
Of course you should return the cheque to Ken

887
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,000
Then you won't owe him

888
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,800
That's right

889
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,000
Enough, don't worry

890
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
I will do what I said

891
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
I won't let anything happen to you

892
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,400
Come and eat

893
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Okay, aunt

894
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Mom, don't worry

895
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
From today

896
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I will never give up on my uncle's family

897
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Sister, you did a good job

898
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
But don't put too much pressure on yourself

899
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
You have to take it slowly

900
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
I will help you to massage your head, okay?

901
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Sister, it's so comfortable to massage

902
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
I can't help it

903
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
I can't help it

904
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I can't help it

905
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I can't help it

906
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I can't help it

907
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
I can't help it

908
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I can't help it

909
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I can't help it

910
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
I learned it from Lin Weiming

911
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Sister

912
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,000
I know you are afraid of being drunk

913
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,400
But

914
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,600
If Lin Weiming helps you to be drunk

915
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
I will be very relieved

916
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Because he won't harm you

917
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
He will be very careful and careful

918
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,400
It's so painful and scary to massage my head

919
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,000
But think about it

920
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,800
Lin Weiming treats you very well

921
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes

922
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,600
I am tired of him carrying me

923
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,000
He took me to drink sugar water

924
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,160
He treated me to eat

925
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Yes

926
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,800
Do you think he treats you well?

927
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
He treats me well

928
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,800
And also to my sister

929
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Yes

930
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,600
He cured my headache and foot pain

931
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,600
When I need it

932
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,400
He stood up and helped me

933
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,600
He is really a person who can be trusted and relied on

934
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
He is a good person

935
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,600
I really like him

936
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
What about you?

937
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
Do you like him?

938
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,600
I am fighting with you for the same man

939
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,200
But I will not lose

940
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Someone told me today

941
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
He likes Lin Weiming

942
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
He wants to fight with me

943
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Do you like Lin Weiming?

944
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't know

945
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,400
I will be happy when I have the things I like

946
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,200
I like when I see Lin Weiming happy

947
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,400
Our advertisement is about new products

948
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
So Dian Dian and Jian Jian

949
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
You must put them in a good place

950
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
We will give them to the endorsement later

951
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes, I am looking forward to seeing Ma Yixiang

952
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,400
Me too

953
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,800
But we need to be professional

954
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,000
We will do it later

955
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,600
Okay

956
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Rachel, you are so smart

957
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,800
Once Prince Jiuying is back

958
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,200
You will find him as an endorsement

959
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Smart

960
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yes, because our products are good and sincere

961
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
I have been chasing after Xiangzai

962
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
I saw his foot was twisted so badly

963
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
I thought he would rest for a year and a half

964
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
But I didn't expect that

965
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,600
He has done his best

966
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I am so proud of him

967
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
I think he is

968
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
Persist in recovering and working hard

969
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Never give up

970
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
It suits our brand spirit

971
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
Come, have some drinks

972
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,800
I prepared two kinds

973
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,000
One is plum and plum juice, good for your health

974
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,400
The other is soy milk and water

975
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,600
Warm food and food for the body

976
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,800
Take it to share with everyone

977
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,200
Thank you, boss

978
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,400
You are welcome

979
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,800
How is it? How is it going?

980
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Almost done

981
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
Ma Yixiang is coming

982
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,400
We will arrange it after introducing it

983
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,000
Then we will take the photo

984
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
Do you have a camera?

985
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Yes, I do

986
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
I like your slogan

987
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
No fear, no pain, no limit, it's great

988
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The most important thing is that after the advertisement is released

989
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
More people will pay attention to our products

990
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
I think so too

991
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
I hope your hard work will not be wasted

992
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Look

993
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Go over there

994
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Richo

995
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Hello

996
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
Xiangzai, this is Richo

997
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,400
I am in contact with him

998
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,000
Hello, Mr. Ma, welcome

999
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,400
This is our boss, Mr. Lin Weiming

1000
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Thank you for agreeing to be our endorsement

1001
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Thank you for your invitation, please help us

1002
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Hello

1003
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,600
Let's go over there to take the photo

1004
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Let's go, Brother Zuo

1005
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,400
The delivery is ready

1006
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,000
OK

1007
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Three boxes of oil and three boxes of oil

1008
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Put it over there

1009
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Hello

1010
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
What company is this?

1011
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
How can you ask such a person to help them?

1012
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,000
This is him

1013
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Brother Zuo

1014
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
You made a scene on the forum about the moment

1015
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
It was very popular

1016
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
Xiangzai, take a break

1017
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
OK, I have a phone call

1018
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Mr. Ma, do you mind if I ask you a question?

1019
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
No, please ask

1020
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,000
When you landed just now

1021
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
Did your foot hurt?

1022
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
No, it doesn't hurt, I am fine now

1023
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,600
I know you just recovered

1024
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
But you recovered so quickly

1025
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Your condition may be a little too much

1026
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
Mr. Lin, I have something to ask you

1027
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,600
The online news

1028
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,000
Selling and selling through drug oil

1029
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Making employees

1030
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,200
Use the opium to compete with the opponent

1031
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
The other party's high-levels are in a mess

1032
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
What's going on?

1033
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Mr. Ma, Wilson

1034
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,000
This is not true

1035
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
It's just a misunderstanding

1036
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Rachel

1037
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,400
The employees are hitting people

1038
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
Such a big scandal

1039
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
Will make the image of selling and selling through

1040
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,600
Become negative

1041
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
Not just a misunderstanding

1042
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,400
You can think it's okay

1043
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Give us some time to understand

1044
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
I am not targeting you

1045
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
But Xiangzai is your spokesperson

1046
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
The image is directly linked to your company

1047
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,200
This is my biggest concern

1048
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,600
In short

1049
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,200
Before things are solved

1050
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,600
Sorry

1051
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,200
Today's advertising shooting

1052
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,600
We want to cancel

1053
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Yes

1054
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,200
We can't allow the online public

1055
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,400
To spread further

1056
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,200
We need to tell the public

1057
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,600
What's your plan?

1058
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,200
That's very important

1059
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,000
I want to emphasize

1060
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,600
The online version

1061
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Is not the whole truth

1062
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,600
Currently, we are waiting

1063
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,200
For the police to investigate

1064
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
He is very attentive to the staff's operation,

1065
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
but he will never allow the information to be lost.

1066
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,000
It will ruin the reputation of the staff.

1067
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,800
Right. Because we don't want to draw a line between us and A-Zu?

1068
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
What are you doing here?

1069
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,000
I heard that you signed Xiang Zai as your spokesperson.

1070
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
I really like him.

1071
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,200
I came to see if he is here.

1072
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
You are really not inviting him to sit here?

1073
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,400
You are the one who is trying to get A-Zu and Mai Bai to get along.

1074
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,200
My wound is still here.

1075
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,000
He was so cruel and used the smoke bomb to hit me.

1076
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Maybe he was trying to help me to gain justice.

1077
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What do you mean by gaining justice?

1078
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Don't be so cruel. Calm down.

1079
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,000
Don't fall for his tricks. Calm down.

1080
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Please listen to my cousin.

1081
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,000
You are now carrying out a criminal case.

1082
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
You don't care about yourself, but you also have to care about the company.

1083
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Otherwise, Mai Bai will be made to smell bad by you.

1084
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,600
You are the one who will smell bad. You can use these dirty tricks.

1085
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,200
Listen to your heart and control your own heart.

1086
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,600
I will return this cheque to you today.

1087
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Please don't do those small tricks again.

1088
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,800
You don't earn money. It's so funny.

1089
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,600
How can you do business?

1090
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,200
I didn't want to bother you guys.

1091
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Let's take our time to solve this matter.

1092
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,000
You bastard.

1093
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Calm down.

1094
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,400
This is Ma Yi Xiang's agent.

1095
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes, Winston.

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,200
I just wanted to call you and explain this matter to you.

1097
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,000
Miss Luo, I don't want to force you to do something.

1098
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,800
No matter how you end up, there will be a big dispute.

1099
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Xiang Zai's image is already very healthy.

1100
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
I don't want to be involved in violence.

1101
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,000
Our employee didn't use violence. He was wronged.

1102
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,400
Don't persuade me. I've decided to terminate the contract.

1103
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,600
What? You really want to terminate the contract so soon?

1104
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,000
The contract shows that you are obliged to protect Xiang Zai's image.

1105
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,400
You are the ones who are breaking the contract. Sorry.

1106
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
No, Brother. I must rush to beat that bastard.

1107
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,200
Calm down.

1108
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,800
The client came to provoke you and us.

1109
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
If you are anxious, you will be upset.

1110
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
We must not be made to be a mess.

1111
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,000
Okay.

1112
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,200
I will make a statement now.

1113
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,800
Thank you.

1114
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
The beauty of the past is still in the past.

1115
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
The heart is still in the past.

1116
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
When everyone is walking,

1117
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,200
if you have pain in your right leg,

1118
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,000
it will cause problems in your left waist or legs.

1119
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,600
It will cause systematic damage.

1120
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,800
To improve systematic pain,

1121
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,600
if you want to transfer, you must reduce the severity.

1122
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,400
It will promote blood circulation.
