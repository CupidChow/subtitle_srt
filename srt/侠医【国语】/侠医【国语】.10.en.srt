1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can let go of everything else.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But your family,

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
no matter how much pressure you have,

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you can't just let go.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Recently, many people have been wanting me to reopen the clinic

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and be a doctor again.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid...

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid the result will still be the same.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Although you gave them hope,

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in the end, you still let them down.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Next month, new products will be on the market.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We should start thinking about how to promote them.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dian Dian Ning's design is cute.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It suits girls.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm a little moved.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Light green with leaves.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It feels fresh.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Dian Dian Ning's target audience

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
is young city people, especially OL.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They have a lot of work pressure.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They have to look at their computers every day.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The location of this medicine box is a quick and easy help.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I have an idea.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Perfume has perfume fitting.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Actually, I think Dian Dian Ning

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
can make a mini version of 5ml.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's enough.

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You can put it in the makeup bag.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's a good idea.

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Because we want to break the

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
impression of the old people who use and smell the skin.

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Let them try it.

63
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Okay.

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Our Maimaitong has been using the slogan,

65
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
which is to put your heart in the bottom.

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
I think Dian Dian Ning can add one more sentence.

67
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
It's a little pain, simple and direct.

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Rachel, this is good.

69
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Michael, you're in charge.

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
I know, boss.

71
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
By the way, in terms of Dian Dian Ning,

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
what do you think we should promote better?

73
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Dian Dian Ning is for the damage and pain of deep muscles.

74
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Why don't we find a spokesperson for the athletes?

75
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
We can use the fame and the effect,

76
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
plus the trend of sports,

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
to promote to those who work out,

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
run, and do yoga.

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
I'm okay with that.

80
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
But we need to shoot the ad faster.

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
If no one else has a choice, who should we look for?

82
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Actually, I've already prepared a list.

83
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Here.

84
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Of course, I have a favorite candidate.

85
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
It's the swimming athlete Lian Shien,

86
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
who won two Olympic medals in a row.

87
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
His image is healthy and young.

88
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
He's really a great choice.

89
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
No.

90
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
In fact, so many sports,

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
you don't have to choose swimming.

92
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
The sportsman Li Jun,

93
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
he's in good shape,

94
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
has six abs, and is tall and mighty.

95
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm a man, I think he's excellent.

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
But swimming is a full-body sport.

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Full body muscles can be used.

98
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Our products are for the upper, middle, and lower body parts.

99
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I think swimming is more suitable.

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
The yoga is also the upper, middle, and lower body parts.

101
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
You can just find KOL.

102
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
No, Zuge.

103
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Even Shuren is better than those KOL.

104
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
His IG photos are super girly.

105
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
That's right.

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
I didn't expect him to be so good on the field.

107
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
In private, he's a girl from the Lin family.

108
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
He not only won many medals,

109
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
but also has a very humble personality.

110
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Men and women are all the same.

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Enough.

112
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
In short, any sport is fine.

113
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Swimming is not allowed.

114
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Why?

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Why are you so against the swimmer's endorsement?

116
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Okay, okay, stop arguing.

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I'll think about this matter.

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Let's talk about other things first.

119
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Brother, I can help you.

120
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll go to the bathroom.

121
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Okay.

122
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Why are you so against the swimmer's endorsement?

123
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
I know.

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Zuge must be because he swam in the water when he was a kid.

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
I was a swimming champion when I was a kid.

126
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Your ex-girlfriend was a swimmer.

127
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
She dumped you, so you have a shadow.

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
That's right.

129
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Say what you like to say.

130
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You must have been hurt by a woman and don't like women.

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Did you forget Natalie?

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
I don't know if you're hiding something.

133
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Women are not interested in swimming.

134
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
What do you mean?

135
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
I like to see women in swimsuits.

136
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Men and women like to see women in swimsuits.

137
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
You must deny them.

138
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
You don't understand.

139
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
In short, swimming players cannot be sponsored.

140
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Then you have to give a reason.

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Now no one is watching the swimwear.

142
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
That's right.

143
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Reason, right?

144
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
The reason is...

145
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
I feel uncomfortable.

146
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Who?

147
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
If you feel uncomfortable, go to the doctor.

148
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm so angry.

149
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Let's do this first.

150
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Zuge, we're busy.

151
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Boss.

152
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Don't argue about this.

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Leave it to me.

154
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm not arguing.

155
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
He's the one who's holding me back.

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Have you made an appointment with the distributor?

157
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Yes.

158
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Let's go.

159
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Mom.

160
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Mom.

161
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Okay.

162
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Okay, I'll go home now.

163
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
I'm sorry.

164
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
I have to take a half day off.

165
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
My dad is not feeling well.

166
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
My mom needs to take care of him.

167
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm taking my sister to the hospital.

168
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I'll take you there.

169
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I also want to know how he's doing now.

170
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Okay.

171
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
The patient's mental state assessment

172
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
and physiological indicators are normal.

173
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Not bad.

174
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Just take the medicine.

175
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
No medicine.

176
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
No medicine.

177
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Doctor, you've seen it.

178
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
My sister has been in a coma after taking the medicine.

179
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I can't wake her up in the morning.

180
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
She's been having nightmares at night.

181
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I can't sleep at night either.

182
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
If she's feeling better, can we stop the medicine?

183
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Although this medicine has side effects,

184
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
considering that she had a congenital fever

185
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
and her anxiety index is very high,

186
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,560
it's not suitable to stop the medicine for now.

187
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Doctor, this medicine helps to stabilize her mood.

188
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,560
If the Chinese medicine can help,

189
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
can we adjust the dosage?

190
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I don't object to the Chinese medicine's help.

191
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
We can do it together.

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Let's see the effect first.

193
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
As for whether to stop the medicine,

194
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
we'll do the review after the consultation.

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm so tired.

196
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
I want to sit down.

197
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay, sit down.

198
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Yingying, what a coincidence.

199
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Jingzhi.

200
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Jingzhi.

201
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Jiajun, Jingzhi.

202
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
What a coincidence.

203
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Why are you here?

204
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm here for the review today.

205
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Jiajun has time to come with me.

206
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Are you two close?

207
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Not bad.

208
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
We met when you were staying in the same building.

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
We thought we could chat and became friends.

210
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
How is Jingzhi and Grandma?

211
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
We haven't seen her for a long time.

212
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
She's always in pain.

213
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
She's always in pain.

214
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
But she's feeling better now.

215
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
With Jiajun to accompany me for the review,

216
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
she doesn't have to be too tired.

217
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Your body is still the same.

218
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Are you playing games and sleeping late?

219
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Don't you remember to drink less water?

220
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
If you have time, drink some tea.

221
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
It'll help you.

222
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I've told her to sleep early.

223
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
And don't hide at home every day.

224
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
You should go out often.

225
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Don't do that.

226
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
You go to the clinic.

227
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I'll teach you archery.

228
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Archery?

229
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Archery is good.

230
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
It strengthens your body.

231
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
It helps you get rid of sweat

232
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
and your wetness.

233
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Okay, let's try.

234
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
We're leaving soon.

235
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Yingying, when will you come to my house

236
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
to eat tea and water dumplings?

237
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
I don't feel like eating recently.

238
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
She's been like this recently.

239
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
We'll go to see you and Grandma Ju another day.

240
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Okay, see you another day.

241
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Bye.

242
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Okay, bye.

243
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Bye.

244
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Sister, how are you?

245
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
We're hungry and we're going to eat.

246
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
We'll take you to eat hamburgers.

247
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I don't feel like eating anything.

248
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I want to go home.

249
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
I think of a place she might like.

250
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Why don't you try?

251
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Okay.

252
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
What's purple?

253
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
It's purple sweet potato and millet.

254
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Ling Weiming ordered it for you.

255
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Your favorite purple.

256
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
It looks good, but I don't want to eat it.

257
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I don't want to eat anything.

258
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Hello, give me some egg milk.

259
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
What are you drawing?

260
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm sorry.

261
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
I wanted to draw a smiling face.

262
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Now I'm drawing a crooked face.

263
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Your mouth is crooked.

264
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Sister, you're so good.

265
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
You're so much better than Ling Weiming.

266
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
But it's a pity.

267
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I'll pour it later.

268
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
I said I can't pour it.

269
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
You don't want to eat it.

270
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I'll pour it.

271
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,560
I don't feel so good after taking the medicine.

272
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
It's all on you.

273
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Sweet taste can be put in the skin.

274
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Sometimes it can improve the mood.

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I can't walk.

276
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
It's so tired and painful.

277
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Let's go two steps to pick up the car.

278
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Let's go.

279
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
My feet are so painful.

280
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
You carry me.

281
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I carry you?

282
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
You're so old.

283
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Do you want me to help you?

284
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
No, don't spoil him.

285
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
He won't come down again.

286
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Thank you.

287
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
It's OK. I'll carry him.

288
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Be careful.

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
You don't feel so good?

290
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
I'll take you to a place.

291
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
OK, let's go.

292
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
We're ready.

293
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Be good. Don't look.

294
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Why can't I look?

295
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
The more you look, the more nervous you are.

296
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
The muscle is tight.

297
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
The effect is not so good.

298
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Lie down and don't look.

299
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Sister, be good.

300
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Close your eyes.

301
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
After I finish, your muscles will be less tight.

302
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Take more medals.

303
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm coming.

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
What are you doing?

305
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
You're stiff.

306
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Your needles will get into your face.

307
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
It's weird if you're not afraid.

308
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
If you're afraid, close your eyes.

309
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,560
If you close your eyes, you'll feel like you're bitten by a mosquito.

310
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll try.

311
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
You can walk.

312
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
See if you feel better.

313
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Be careful.

314
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
It doesn't hurt.

315
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
It's not so tiring.

316
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
It's effective so fast.

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
I just help him relax his muscles.

318
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Improve his blood circulation.

319
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
My sister had a stroke that day.

320
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,560
You helped him to get better after you gave him acupuncture.

321
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
He's getting better.

322
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I want to ask, can acupuncture cure autism?

323
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,560
It's helpful for people with autism.

324
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
But it can't cure them completely.

325
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
It can improve their brain function.

326
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Improve their language ability.

327
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
And reduce their behavior abnormalities.

328
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
So it can be improved?

329
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
If the method is right, it will be effective in the long run.

330
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
If you need it, I can introduce you to other doctors.

331
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
No need to find other doctors.

332
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,560
You've helped him, but he's still so obedient.

333
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
You're so familiar with his situation.

334
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
I'll leave my sister to you.

335
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
You can help him.

336
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
I've lost my job for a long time.

337
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I don't plan to start a new job.

338
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
But you have the ability.

339
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
It's okay to help others.

340
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
But I can't do it without my responsibility as a doctor.

341
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
You should find someone else.

342
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Thank you, Lin Huimin.

343
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
You're welcome.

344
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,560
I read that there are a large number of customers.

345
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
They're from different sports, sports groups,

346
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
discipline teams, and teams.

347
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Yes, they've been our biggest supporters for years.

348
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,560
So we must maintain our relationship with them.

349
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,560
As long as they give us three products, we'll be fine.

350
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I'm a member of the skin care team.

351
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I receive a gift card and a discount card every year.

352
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I also receive a try-on.

353
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
We can do the same.

354
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
It's almost New Year. Let's print the monthly record.

355
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Then we can print the product's link next to the photos.

356
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
You said we shouldn't have a swimmer.

357
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
No, it's good.

358
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
We haven't printed the monthly record for a long time.

359
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I've printed it before. Can you give me a reference?

360
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
It should be in the store. Go and look for it.

361
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Go and look for it.

362
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
You guys go back to your work.

363
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Okay.

364
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
What's this?

365
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
A poster.

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Mai Maitong used to hire a swimmer as a spokesperson.

367
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Why can't they do it now?

368
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Uncle.

369
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Yes, Uncle.

370
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
There's something wrong with this order.

371
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
What's wrong?

372
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I'm asking you why.

373
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
No problem.

374
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Come here.

375
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Swimmer. Why can't they do it now?

376
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
You tell me.

377
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Why can't they do it now?

378
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm asking you.

379
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Why can't they do it now?

380
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Why can't they do it now?

381
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Why can't they do it now?

382
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Swimmer. Why can't they do it now?

383
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Come here and have a look.

384
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm telling you.

385
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Hong Kong swimmer, Lin Minyi,

386
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
is in the final of the world championship.

387
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Hong Kong team, Li Minyi,

388
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
is in the final of the world championship.

389
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Lin Minyi has been discharged from the Asian Games.

390
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Hong Kong team swimmer, Lin Minyi,

391
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
has been discharged from the multi-phase printout.

392
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Farewell to the swimming pool.

393
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
The former Hong Kong team, Lin Minyi,

394
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
is in the final of the world championship.

395
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Farewell to the swimming pool.

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
The founder, the swimmer, and his daughter

397
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
have been discharged from the multi-phase printout.

398
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
You have a sister.

399
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Will she come if the building is decorated?

400
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I'll leave my sister to you.

401
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
You can help her.

402
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,560
It's okay to help each other among friends.

403
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
But you want me to bear the responsibility of a doctor.

404
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I can't do it.

405
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
You'd better find someone else.

406
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Granny Ju.

407
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
These are all products of my company.

408
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
I plan to give them to you.

409
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
This bottle of medicine is not yet listed.

410
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
It's called Jian Jianning.

411
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
It's good for blood circulation and blood circulation.

412
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Really?

413
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Now I'll help you

414
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
to massage the small area near the joint.

415
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
When we press it,

416
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
it should be slow,

417
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
but deep.

418
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,700
The

419
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Your methods now

420
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
are exactly the same as Dr. Lin's.

421
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Because my dad taught me.

422
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
I remember you said

423
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
you helped manage your dad's clinic.

424
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Why didn't you do it later?

425
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
You inherited his medical skills.

426
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Making medicine oil

427
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
actually inherited my dad's medical skills.

428
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
That's right.

429
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
This medicine oil is really good.

430
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
My hands seem to be relaxed.

431
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
It's really a waste if you don't become a doctor.

432
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
By the way,

433
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
what's the matter that you come to me so late?

434
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Actually, I want to talk to you

435
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
about the spokesperson.

436
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I think we should not

437
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
hire a swimmer as the spokesperson.

438
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
Actually, there are many other good candidates.

439
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
For example, the prince of the jumping distance, Ma Yixiang,

440
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
is also good.

441
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Don't you like Lian Shi'en?

442
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,560
You don't have to worry about Azu.

443
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Actually, I've considered it.

444
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
You're right.

445
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Swimming is a kind of full body exercise.

446
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
And the upper, middle, lower muscles

447
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
can be exercised.

448
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Swimming players.

449
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
I don't object.

450
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I

451
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
accidentally found this poster.

452
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh.

453
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
I'm sorry.

454
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
I didn't know your sister, Min Yi,

455
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
is a swimmer.

456
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
She also worked as a spokesperson for the company.

457
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I didn't mean to hurt you.

459
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
It's been so long.

460
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm too worried.

461
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Sister, you're great.

462
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Brother, I won.

463
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Miss Lin,

464
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
after a series of tests,

465
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
you have confirmed multiple-signal print.

466
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
It's a kind of immune disease

467
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
that affects the central nervous system.

468
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Because of the damage of the nerves,

469
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
the brain can't properly control the muscles.

470
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
There is no way to cure it.

471
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
I can only open the rib cage

472
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
and open the rib cage.

473
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
I can use the rib cage to help you

474
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,200
reduce inflammation and

475
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,560
to help you adjust your immune system.

476
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
I'll try to help you control the disease.

477
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Brother,

478
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,560
will I not get better?

479
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Will I not be able to swim anymore?

480
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Don't worry.

481
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
I promise you.

482
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I won't let anything happen to you.

483
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
It's okay.

484
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
I opened a clinic.

485
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Because as long as you're focused

486
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
and work hard enough, you can cure the immune system.

487
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Let it be able to fulfill its own dream.

488
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
But it turns out

489
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
that if you don't work hard,

490
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
you'll get results.

491
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
How is it?

492
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Does it hurt here?

493
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
It doesn't hurt.

494
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
You don't even have to close your eyes now.

495
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Because I'm good at it.

496
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
And compared to this disease,

497
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
this kind of pain is nothing.

498
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I won't hurt you anymore.

499
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,560
I won't let you hurt anymore.

500
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Brother,

501
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
thank you.

502
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Inflammatory impotency

503
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,560
is usually a late-stage of multiple-signal inflammation.

504
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It causes hemorrhage and organ failure.

505
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
We've tried our best.

506
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
You?

507
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Brother,

508
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,560
I hope that in my next life,

509
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I can be your sister again.

510
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
You've tried your best.

511
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Don't blame yourself.

512
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm sorry.

513
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I can't cure you.

514
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm sorry.

515
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Even my sister can't be cured.

516
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
That kind of helplessness...

517
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Don't blame yourself.

518
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Min Yi leaving doesn't mean you fail.

519
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

520
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
My sister has autism.

521
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I've known since I was a child

522
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
that no matter how hard I try, it's useless.

523
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
autism is a lifetime thing.

524
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
There's no way to turn back.

525
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
There's no way to cure it.

526
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,560
We've experienced disappointment, despair,

527
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,560
and hope for no miracle.

528
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,560
If she makes a little progress,

529
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
it's hope for us.

530
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,560
You're a good doctor.

531
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
I see you've helped so many people.

532
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I don't want you to waste your medical skills.

533
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
If your sister Min Yi knows that

534
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
you're not a doctor,

535
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
will she be happy?

536
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,560
I've been a doctor for too long.

537
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
It's not the best choice for your sister.

538
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,560
I don't want you to cure my sister.

539
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I just don't want you to be a troublemaker.

540
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Thanks.

541
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I'll definitely help you.

542
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,560
After I see you, I have to tell you this.

543
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,520
You won'tpanic from giving me an

544
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
I'm sorry.

545
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,360
I'm sorry.

546
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,560
I think I'll have to bother you again.

547
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,000
What happened this time?

548
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,640
This time it's not a knife injury.

549
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,880
It was a hit by a stick.

550
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
It's all bruises.

551
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
Please come in.

552
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,480
Look at you,

553
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,000
you're hurt like this.

554
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
The knife injury hasn't healed yet.

555
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,720
And you have a back injury.

556
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,840
I've heard from you.

557
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,000
I went to see a doctor.

558
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,520
The doctor said

559
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,240
the doctor said I really had a back injury.

560
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,640
Why don't you listen to me and quit the martial arts world?

561
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
I'm using this medicine oil

562
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,280
to help you disperse your bruises.

563
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,480
But this can only be treated with a needle, not a needle.

564
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,240
It hurts.

565
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,160
Your body is always damaged.

566
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
If you go on like this,

567
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,240
you'll be on a wheelchair

568
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
when you're less than 60 years old.

569
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
It's not that serious.

570
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,920
I just want you to know

571
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,480
that money is money.

572
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,800
You have to cherish your body.

573
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
There are many ups and downs in the world.

574
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,880
I really don't want to see you go back.

575
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
What do you want me to do?

576
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
I have money for you.

577
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,160
Go to my company today.

578
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,600
I'll talk to you when I see you.

579
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm sorry.

580
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,920
It's okay.

581
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,760
I just got your report.

582
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,320
Look at the business report.

583
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
Your uterus is thin.

584
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,320
The shape is not so even.

585
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,760
Have you had any pain or disorder recently?

586
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
Yes.

587
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,960
I often feel a little pain in my lower abdomen.

588
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
Have you ever had any internal surgery?

589
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
For example,

590
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
a miscarriage or a miscarriage?

591
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,200
I had a miscarriage surgery

592
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
a few years ago.

593
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
Maybe the wound is not healed well

594
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
after the surgery.

595
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,960
It causes internal friction in the uterus

596
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,200
and it hurts.

597
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
200,000 yuan.

598
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,040
Isn't it good?

599
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,960
It's good.

600
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Isn't it good?

601
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,840
It's better than you paying a few hundred thousand.

602
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,960
I don't have money to eat.

603
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
I don't need your money.

604
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,720
And I remember how you treated me.

605
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
You are so mean.

606
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
Why should I help you?

607
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,080
You are a pure girl now.

608
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,760
You can get 200,000 yuan.

609
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,240
Don't fight with money.

610
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
You want to fight with your cousin.

611
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,440
What do you want me to do?

612
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,040
You don't need to know.

613
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
You just need to be prepared.

614
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,760
You have a problem in your brain.

615
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,640
Do I do something illegal?

616
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,920
Don't worry.

617
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
I won't let you kill people and set fire.

618
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,640
The cheque is here.

619
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
You decide whether to accept it or not.

620
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,280
You don't let me keep touching the real estate agent.

621
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,640
You see it yourself.

622
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,720
You say I like her.

623
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
Now you are so stubborn.

624
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,560
You just say others don't know about yourself.

625
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,960
You are serious now?

626
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,000
Who do you think I am?

627
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,080
Mai has a new move.

628
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,400
She is just a chess piece.

629
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,120
She will help the company to fight.

630
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,680
What move?

631
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,560
She will let people go if she doesn't know.

632
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,880
But that crazy dog Liang Yanzu

633
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,320
will be a dead dog when she meets that woman.

634
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,120
She will get something.

635
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,120
Hello.

636
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,760
Hello, Xiao Mei.

637
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,520
You go to find her.

638
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,040
You go to work.

639
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't mind me.

640
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,720
Okay.

641
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,200
Hi, Miss Lin.

642
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
Why are you not here today?

643
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,920
I come to ask you about something.

644
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,640
We went toAnyitting.

645
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,560
I think Mengyuan will be funny.

646
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,480
Do you have any important company criticize?

647
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,960
She can be the previous boss's visitors.

648
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
She comes here to talk about your company's need.

649
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
But she comes here.

650
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
ENS nervous.

651
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,880
But I think she is in cute way.

652
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,320
You are talking.

653
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,440
She knows you stay at home.

654
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,080
She needs some rest.

655
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
I can eat it.

656
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
Of course.

657
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
Where are your brother and Rachel?

658
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,680
Rachel is at the printing factory.

659
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,880
Brother is at the production line.

660
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,680
I'll call him for you.

661
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,480
No need.

662
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,880
Don't bother him.

663
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,280
How is it?

664
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,080
New products?

665
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,880
I haven't seen it.

666
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,480
Yes.

667
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
It will be launched next month.

668
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,280
This is Jian Jianning.

669
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,680
This is Dian Dianning.

670
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Remember to let your friends support it after it's launched.

671
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,680
Okay.

672
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,480
Brother,

673
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
the package boxes outside are used up.

674
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,680
But we don't know where the others are.

675
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,280
I'll take you there.

676
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,080
You go ahead.

677
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll talk to you later.

678
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,680
Okay.

679
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
A'zu.

680
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,880
What's wrong?

681
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Do you need my help?

682
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,480
No, you speed it up.

683
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,680
It hurts.

684
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
Let me help you get some rest.

685
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes.

686
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
How is your brother και Yazawa?

687
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,880
I'll help him tonight.

688
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,880
Is it serious? Do you need an ambulance?

689
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,580
It doesn't look serious. It's probably just a bad blood flow.

690
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,480
I'll help you with some acupuncture later. It should be more comfortable.

691
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,180
Okay.

692
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,980
Brother Ancestral, the warehouse wants you to take care of the order.

693
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
You guys just watch it.

694
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,680
Okay.

695
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Go do your work. I'll take care of him for you.

696
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Okay. I'll come back to find you later.

697
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,680
I'll help you with some qihai acupuncture now.

698
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,480
Don't move.

699
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,980
Are you here for the monthly check-up?

700
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
No.

701
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,480
Did you listen to my check-up?

702
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I did.

703
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I got the report today.

704
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
The doctor said that I had done a light surgery.

705
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,480
So the internal membrane is very sticky and the abdomen is very painful.

706
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
I'll do the operation again.

707
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
Okay.

708
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,480
From a Chinese doctor's perspective, you have a blood vessel cancer.

709
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,980
Light surgery is a process of damage to the meridians.

710
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,480
Plus, your body is cold and your qi is not working well.

711
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,480
It will slowly form a blood clot.

712
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,480
The operation will be repeated.

713
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,480
The doctor said that I can do the operation.

714
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I'm going to continue taking painkillers.

715
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
But I don't want to do the operation.

716
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,480
It's not a good idea to take painkillers for a long time.

717
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Or you can consider acupuncture and love wine.

718
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
It can help you cool down, cool down,

719
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
replenish qi and nourish blood, and regulate your pulse.

720
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,480
It's very helpful for the pain of the meridians.

721
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
What do you mean?

722
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Instead of explaining, how about I show you now?

723
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Okay.

724
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Acupuncture, qi, and nourishment.

725
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll help you to relieve your pain.

726
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Then I'll help you to love wine and nourish qi.

727
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
You need to know the process first.

728
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Please take off your clothes.

729
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Does it hurt?

730
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
How is it?

731
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
It's fine.

732
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I'll leave my sister to you. You can help her.

733
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,480
But I can't take the responsibility of carrying the doctor.

734
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
You should find someone else.

735
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Thank you, A-Ming.

736
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
You're welcome.

737
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,480
A-Ming.

738
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I don't want others to know about me.

739
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Can I take it as a little secret between you and me?

740
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret for you.

741
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Okay.

742
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
I talked about it for a long time.

743
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
How's it going?

744
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
It's going well. The printing will start tomorrow.

745
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
That's good.

746
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Thank you for your hard work.

747
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Did you pay me?

748
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,480
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

749
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,480
No. I have a stomachache.

750
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Is it such a big symptom?

751
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
You said you didn't want to see a doctor.

752
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
You said you were afraid of disappointing others.

753
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
You're not afraid of being disappointed?

754
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,480
You came to shoot arrows at night?

755
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
I'm not free.

756
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
A-Ming.

757
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I feel much better after you helped me with the alcohol.

758
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Do you have time tonight? I'll treat you to dinner. Thank you.

759
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,480
He doesn't have time. He's going to practice archery with me.

760
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,480
It's okay. There will be a long future.

761
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,480
You'll continue to help me with my treatment, right?

762
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

763
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I'll go first. Tell A-Zu for me. Bye.

764
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,480
See you tonight, right?

765
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Did you talk to your dog today?

766
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
They're too fragrant.

767
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,480
You don't get to play with me so don't play around.

768
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I'm afraid you're the wrong person.

769
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
You're the one taking all the blame.

770
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Feel any better?

771
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I think so.

772
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,680
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

773
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,120
Because you're working.

774
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,940
Oh, you're not in pain anymore?

775
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm much better.

776
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,560
Your big brother is indeed a great man.

777
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,320
Of course.

778
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,480
You should still be busy. Don't mind me. I'll go on my own.

779
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,840
I've almost finished my work.

780
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,000
I want to ask if you have time right now.

781
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
Okay. What is it?

782
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,680
I want to take you to a place

783
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,080
where you can meet someone very important.

784
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,680
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

785
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes.

786
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
A'zu.

787
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Didn't you say you would take me to meet a very important person?

788
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Godfather.

789
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
Holy Mother.

790
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
I did something wrong.

791
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,680
That day, although I was so confused,

792
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I had a relationship with you. I must be responsible.

793
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Now I'm in front of Holy Mother.

794
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Please be my girlfriend.

795
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Are you sick? Nonsense.

796
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
You're not burning up, you're burning your brain.

797
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
We didn't have any relationship that day.

798
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I'm just afraid you're too cold and sick.

799
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
So I held you.

800
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Just like this.

801
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
No, even if you just held me,

802
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I was serious about what I said.

803
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
I want you to be my girlfriend.

804
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
A'zu.

805
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
When I was born,

806
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,680
the doctor said I had a tumor in my brain.

807
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
I didn't even see it.

808
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,680
My parents were thrown into this child's home.

809
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
The doctor said I could die anytime.

810
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
The night before the operation,

811
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I walked here and knelt down.

812
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I said I didn't want to die.

813
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,680
I wanted my own career, family, house and girlfriend.

814
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Luckily, I have her here.

815
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,680
If she hadn't taken care of me, I wouldn't have survived.

816
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Now I'm just a warehouse manager at a drugstore.

817
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
It's considered a successful career.

818
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
I just need a home,

819
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,680
a girlfriend like you.

820
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
Let me take care of you.

821
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
A'zu.

822
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Actually, you really...

823
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
I don't want a good credit card.

824
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
I know you're nice to me.

825
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,680
You're a...

826
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
I told you I don't want a good credit card.

827
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,680
You're a very, very nice person.

828
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
But apart from being your friend,

829
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
I have nothing else.

830
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
I'll go back by myself.

831
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Don't have to see me out.

832
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Why?

833
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
But I won't give up.

834
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
I know she's just not ready.

835
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,680
One day, I'll be moved.

836
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
C smoothly.

837
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Everything depends on güzel 70PR.

838
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
C!

839
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
C!

840
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
C!

841
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
C!

842
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,680
He's so determined.

843
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
C!

844
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
C!

845
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,760
You know it?

846
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,200
Yes, I'm unhappy

847
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,720
But I'm not angry at you for helping Neda

848
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm angry that you give Neda

849
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,880
Zhi Xiong and everyone else

850
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
But I want to give my sister to you

851
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,520
Your mother-in-law

852
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
Let me go to find someone else

853
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,120
So that's why

854
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,960
Let me explain

855
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
You said you couldn't afford

856
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
To be a doctor

857
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,680
Isn't it the best choice?

858
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,320
I remember it very clearly

859
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,400
I didn't misunderstand you

860
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,880
The doctor in the capital said

861
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,960
It's medical virtue

862
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Doctors shouldn't care about

863
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,280
Who the patient is

864
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,600
They should treat the patient the same

865
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,480
As if they are their own family

866
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,200
It's hard to know what to do

867
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,960
The most difficult person

868
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Is the closest person

869
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,640
I understand what Neda said

870
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,080
Too much attention and care about the result

871
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,320
But the patient is more afraid of making mistakes

872
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,240
Ying Yin is your family

873
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,960
You give her to me

874
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,240
The weight is different from other patients

875
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,520
Do you understand?

876
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm afraid I can't cure her

877
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,680
You will be disappointed

878
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,320
I want to be more careful about your sister

879
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,200
There is a school in our brain

880
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Called Yaman School

881
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,920
It's here

882
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,080
The needle can help

883
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
To open the brain and clear the mind

884
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,560
To replenish the brain water

885
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
To improve brain function

886
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
And to enhance our language communication ability

887
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,240
To improve our emotions, cognition

888
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
Concentration and behavior

889
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
Can my sister

890
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,120
Try this school?

891
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,080
But Yaman School

892
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,600
Is a high-risk school

893
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,360
Because the most important thing

894
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,080
Is the eyes and brain

895
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
It requires a lot of needlework skills and experience

896
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,040
To control the depth and angle of the needle

897
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,440
Do you understand?

898
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,400
Why I dare not act rashly

899
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,600
But you are right

900
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,000
I shouldn't be self-conscious

901
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,440
I can't help Mi Yi

902
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,680
But I should help Ying Yin

903
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,240
I should treat patients as family

904
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,160
But I push her away from her family

905
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,040
Don't push so hard, daughter

906
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm worried about you

907
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,240
I'm not feeling well

908
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,880
Grandpa

909
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Don't be so sad

910
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't push so hard

911
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm worried you will hurt yourself

912
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm not strong enough

913
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,840
Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

914
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,440
No

915
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,520
Don't push so hard

916
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,040
I'm not strong enough

917
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,200
Remember this position

918
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,840
The foot and eyes should be 5 inches up

919
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,320
This is called the light snow

920
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,120
Your sister's legs are weak

921
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,320
You use the needle to push this position

922
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,840
Push it in

923
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,480
You should feel a little bit sore

924
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,040
How is it, sister?

925
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,040
Is it a little sore?

926
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,080
Yes

927
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
I feel very comfortable

928
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,920
Really?

929
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,680
That's good

930
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,920
You don't need to take medicine anymore

931
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,600
Really?

932
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Give me Ying Yin

933
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
But give me some time to prepare

934
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,240
I believe you

935
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,320
We will wait for you

936
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,320
Sister

937
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,600
Don't promise her

938
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Your sister is serious

939
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Or you want to change a western doctor?

940
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,760
A Min has a Chinese medicine qualification

941
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,200
He said there is a magic called Amethyst behind his neck

942
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,240
If you use other acupuncture points

943
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,520
to help your sister

944
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,480
when you stab him

945
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,520
But is it dangerous to stab him in the neck?

946
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,320
I trust A Min's medical skills

947
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
He won't do anything wrong

948
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,600
Brother

949
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,120
Brother

950
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,480
I'm broke

951
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,720
What?

952
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,320
Didn't you say you had a relationship with him?

953
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,240
I thought I had a relationship with him

954
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,720
But he told me in front of the saint

955
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,600
that I had never had a relationship with him

956
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,520
Women's thoughts

957
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,000
are more complicated than the emperor's

958
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,960
He said I'm a good person

959
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,040
What's wrong with being a good person?

960
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,680
Is it good to be a good person?

961
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm not a good person

962
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm a good person

963
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm a good person

964
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm a good person

965
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
I'm a good person

966
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
I'm a good person

967
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,480
Why didn't he choose me?

968
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,920
Don't think like that

969
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,480
It's not necessarily your fault

970
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,800
when it comes to love

971
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,040
Yes

972
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,880
It's not necessarily my fault

973
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,960
It's okay

974
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,600
It's okay

975
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Who is it?

976
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,960
He Sheng

977
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,600
Someone asked me to give you the things

978
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
What's this?

979
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,000
Jian Jian Ning

980
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,240
Dian Dian Ning

981
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
What's this?

982
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,840
Jian Jian Ning

983
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Dian Dian Ning

984
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
Dian Dian Ning

985
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Dian Dian Ning

986
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Dian Dian Ning

987
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
Dian Dian Ning

988
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Dian Dian Ning

989
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,680
Can you eat ?

990
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,160
Next president

991
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,560
Where do you have dian dian記得

992
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:55,840
Remember

993
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,960
Listen look after your health

994
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,320
What are you going to do ?

995
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,280
Pretend to be a good person

996
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,360
Now you

997
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,920
You should be carefully

998
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,720
come

999
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
to me

1000
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,880
I'll be in your heart

1001
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,640
can improve the quality of sleep

1002
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,320
and the mood will be better.
