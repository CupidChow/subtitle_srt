1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Be careful.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Luckily, you didn't get splashed with gun water.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Do you have a body to make money by your face?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You acted very well.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You've worked hard.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's not hard.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The most important thing is to trick them.

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll take care of him.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is it?

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mrs. Ju.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's Jia Jun.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't recognize you.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you think I'm going to lose my memory so soon?

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you want me to praise your skin?

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've improved.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You've found it out.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll go to the meeting.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Come in.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait here.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll call Jinzhi out.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Jinzhi, your friend is looking for you.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come out.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Jinzhi.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jinzhi.

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What's wrong, Jinzhi?

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you not feeling well?

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Help me to get some wine.

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Jinzhi, hang in there.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hang in there, Your Majesty and Your Highness.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please have a meal.

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's the matter?

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're celebrating.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The new product is so good.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Your sales are so high.

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You sold 20,000 bottles a month.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you want to celebrate?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I can invite the whole company.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I need an excuse to make the most of it.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then you owe me.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait for me.

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is it a temporary leave?

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, thank you.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Here's your fish and salad.

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Lemon tea.

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you.

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You eat this?

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sorry.

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I want to change it.

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can change it into

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
ham and vermicelli and hot coriander.

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, no problem.

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll have this.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can't eat it.

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Eating those food

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is okay to eat once in a while.

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm doing it for your own good.

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Can I have a sip?

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
From a Chinese doctor's point of view,

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the breastfeeding is related to the stomach.

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you eat too much or too greasy,

95
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
it will cause the stomach to heat up.

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And it will cause the breast to increase.

97
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Such a big deal.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're talking about it in public.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Everyone knows it.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't want to eat it.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Eat a little, Qianqian.

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Be good.

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't want to eat it.

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Open your mouth, Qianqian.

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't want to eat it at all.

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Eat a little.

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You have to eat a little.

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

110
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're great.

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sorry.

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to ask you

113
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if this child

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
was born prematurely.

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He walks and talks

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
later than a normal child.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What does it have to do with you?

118
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Actually, I'm a Chinese doctor.

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I saw him

120
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
being a little weak.

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He's got a sprain, a sprain.

122
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
His hands are soft and his feet are soft.

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I believe I can help him.

124
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't need your help.

125
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My clinic is nearby.

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have no money to treat him.

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't worry.

128
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I won't charge you.

129
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll treat him for free.

130
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you.

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Today,

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll help Qianqian

133
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
make a push-up

134
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and acupuncture.

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let him get used to it.

136
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He should come here once or twice every week.

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Actually,

138
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
it's good for health

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to press his back.

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Especially for children.

141
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Usually,

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you can help him press his back.

143
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Starting from the bottom,

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
keep pressing it up.

145
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
According to his lower abdomen,

146
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
this position

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
can improve his problem of drool.

148
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,720
If you move down a little bit,

149
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,240
it will be easier for her to swallow.

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Then I'll help Qian Zai with acupuncture.

151
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Acupuncture can stimulate the meridians

152
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
and awaken her muscles.

153
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,040
It can also make up for the gas.

154
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,040
I'll help her with two acupuncture positions.

155
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
One is the acupuncture point,

156
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
and the other is the rib.

157
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,640
These two positions

158
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,080
will be very helpful

159
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
for her finger flexibility

160
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,280
and arm muscles.

161
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,560
It hurts!

162
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,320
It hurts!

163
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,560
Qianqian, are you all right?

164
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Don't worry.

165
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
It hurts if it doesn't hurt.

166
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
It hurts if it doesn't hurt.

167
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,280
It hurts because the meridians are closed.

168
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Mummy, it hurts!

169
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,320
It hurts! It really hurts!

170
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Mrs Li,

171
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
would you mind going over there and waiting?

172
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,600
Because you're afraid.

173
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
Qian Zai will be afraid too.

174
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,680
Mrs Li,

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll go over there with you.

176
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,520
I'll wait for you.

177
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,600
I'll wait for you.

178
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll wait for you.

179
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I'll wait for you.

180
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll wait for you.

181
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'll wait for you.

182
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
You'll wait for me?

183
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll go over there

184
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,080
and wait for you, Qianqian.

185
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
Mrs Li, sit.

186
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
I want to say

187
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
I said I don't have money to see a doctor,

188
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
but I'm not joking.

189
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Mrs Li, don't worry.

190
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
The doctor said

191
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
you can go to the doctor's for free.

192
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,880
He won't charge you.

193
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,880
And don't worry about the medical expenses.

194
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Me and my sister

195
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,520
have undergone the treatment.

196
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
After the injection, he's much better.

197
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Qian Zai, you need to leave the needle for 28 minutes.

198
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
Qian Qian is so young.

199
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
She needs to get so many needles.

200
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,640
The needle can stimulate the meridians and blood vessels.

201
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,880
The acupuncture point of the needle is on the four fingers.

202
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,720
It won't hurt the internal organs.

203
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Thank you, Doctor Ling.

204
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,160
You're welcome.

205
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,720
I want to help you take a look.

206
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,840
How's your sleep?

207
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
It's normal.

208
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,840
I sleep in the morning.

209
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,440
Sometimes I feel dizzy and have a bad hearing.

210
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,120
You've been suffering from old age.

211
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,920
So your blood vessels will naturally be weak.

212
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,520
Let me check your back.

213
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
It hurts a little.

214
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,640
The spleen and the abdomen will hinder the blood vessels.

215
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,120
Let me help you relax it.

216
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,240
Thank you.

217
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Doctor Ling,

218
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
you've been treating Qian Qian for free.

219
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,080
You don't need to worry about me.

220
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,560
The Chinese doctor said it's not a serious illness.

221
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,560
You've taken care of Qian Zai.

222
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
I don't want to see you get another one.

223
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
Thank you.

224
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,440
You're welcome.

225
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,880
What the doctor said just now,

226
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
don't mention it to my grandma.

227
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,520
It's not a small problem.

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,280
Does she know it?

229
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't mention it.

230
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,760
My grandma just got out of the hospital.

231
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
She's recovering.

232
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't want to scare her.

233
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,480
Grandma, I'm back.

234
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Jin Zhi, are you okay?

235
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
What did the doctor say?

236
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
I've tested the blood and I've taken CT.

237
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,560
The doctor said I was overworked.

238
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll be fine after a good rest.

239
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Right.

240
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
I've told you not to work so hard.

241
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,320
You didn't listen.

242
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I know.

243
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll take care of myself.

244
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,720
By the way, I've cooked porridge.

245
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,680
I'll serve it to you.

246
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,880
I'll take you back to your room.

247
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,680
Okay.

248
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,800
Hello.

249
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm so sorry today.

250
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,000
It's okay.

251
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,920
You should rest when you're sick.

252
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Can you do it tomorrow?

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
I'll talk about the details of the new project.

254
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,080
Sure.

255
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,640
We'll do as we did.

256
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
See you tomorrow.

257
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,240
See you tomorrow. Bye.

258
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,680
Miss Zhou,

259
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,720
I admire your patience and talent.

260
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
I hope you can conveys

261
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,520
your great talents.

262
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
Bye.

263
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Miss Zhou,

264
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
let me see yourension.

265
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,880
You may face…

266
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,360
The mission.

267
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
What's the mission?

268
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
Your true colours.

269
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
The desire behind them.

270
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
as a book reader.

271
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Thank you.

272
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,800
I'll work hard.

273
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
It's really happy to promote this cooperation.

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,960
We have a good cooperation.

275
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,920
Good cooperation.

276
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
I have a meeting to hold.

277
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,800
I'll see you out.

278
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,480
Okay.

279
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Great.

280
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,840
You agreed to help them draw the cross?

281
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,800
What's the problem?

282
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,400
Do you know how big Miss Xie's

283
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
anime company is?

284
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,720
Her anime

285
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,480
has been canceled.

286
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,520
It's rare for them to ask me to cooperate.

287
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,560
Of course I have to do it.

288
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,320
But Ji Ji,

289
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,840
you need to rest now.

290
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Tell me,

291
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
what's the use of resting?

292
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,920
The doctor only asked me to do the operation.

293
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,480
Besides,

294
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,360
my disease won't be cured.

295
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm afraid you'll really be unable to eat.

296
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Jia Jun,

297
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
do you know that there was a swimmer

298
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,840
who found out that he had blood cancer

299
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,800
one and a half years before he participated in the Olympics?

300
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
His illness

301
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
was so serious that it affected his walking.

302
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,520
But fortunately,

303
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
God gave him one more year.

304
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
That Olympics

305
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
lasted a whole year.

306
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,040
In the end, he was really amazing.

307
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,160
He really became the Olympic representative.

308
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,960
Do you know that when he was interviewed later,

309
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,000
the most painful thing for him

310
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,040
was not that he couldn't participate in the competition in the future,

311
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,880
but that he lost hope in life.

312
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't know how much time I have left.

313
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
I don't know

314
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,920
when I can't take up this brush again.

315
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,840
I really don't want to have any regrets.

316
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,800
I'm sorry.

317
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm sorry.

318
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm sorry.

319
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm sorry.

320
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I'm sorry.

321
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,440
Mom, I just finished stuffing it.

322
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,360
I can leave in a while.

323
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,840
Come pick me up.

324
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Bye-bye.

325
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,040
Jia Jun,

326
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,560
did you just watch Jing Zhi's live broadcast?

327
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,360
When he was doing the live broadcast,

328
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,160
many people gave him a heart.

329
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
I want to see...

330
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Look at the pillow.

331
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,680
It's not that swollen.

332
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
It's improved.

333
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,040
Not bad.

334
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,600
Why are you absent-minded?

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,000
Cousin.

336
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,600
Can you...

337
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,640
Coming.

338
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,160
Doctor Ling.

339
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,840
Come here.

340
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Sit down.

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,560
Come.

342
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Sorry.

343
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
Doctor Ling.

344
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,840
Qianqian spilled the stuff.

345
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,040
So we're late.

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,960
It's okay.

347
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,520
By the way,

348
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,320
this is the report of Qianqian's

349
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
hospital check-up two years ago.

350
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I want to ask your opinion.

351
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay.

352
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,680
Right.

353
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,720
The report says

354
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,920
there are several side dishes.

355
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
I remember the doctor said

356
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,000
she can have surgery after Qianqian's surgery.

357
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,680
But it's risky.

358
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,160
Surgery

359
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,640
is not the only way to treat the spine.

360
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,200
Especially Qianzai is so small.

361
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,240
I suggest we try Chinese medicine first.

362
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,800
For example, Chinese medicine and Chinese wine

363
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,240
can help Qianzai.

364
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,640
Let's go.

365
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
Mum.

366
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Yingying.

367
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,240
How are you?

368
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,160
Are you feeling unwell?

369
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,400
No. I'm not afraid.

370
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Don't worry, Auntie.

371
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,800
Yingying is very good.

372
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
By the way, Doctor Ling,

373
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Yingying has been sleeping better than before.

374
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
And her mood is stable.

375
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,440
So,

376
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,800
can we stop the surgery?

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
You're busy.

378
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,240
We don't want to bother you.

379
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,840
Ling Weiming said it's good for me to continue the surgery.

380
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
Yingying is much better now.

381
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
After the surgery,

382
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,920
she can have a surgery.

383
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
It's okay to do more surgery.

384
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,600
It's okay to continue the surgery.

385
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,440
It's not a game.

386
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
No need to challenge yourself.

387
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,520
Don't think too much.

388
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,720
Don't delay the surgery.

389
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,600
Mum, I'll take you home.

390
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,400
Bye, Ling Weiming.

391
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm back.

392
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,920
The blood is on the head.

393
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,120
The God of Wealth will open the door.

394
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
The light is on.

395
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Stop.

396
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Let's eat.

397
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,520
Okay, let's eat.

398
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay, let's eat first.

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,040
Let's eat.

400
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,720
Wife.

401
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,600
Next time, you can take me to the hospital for the next consultation.

402
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,440
My elbow hurts recently.

403
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
Please give it a massage.

404
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,160
She said that Yingying is much better now.

405
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,440
She doesn't need to go there often.

406
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
No.

407
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
She needs to go there often.

408
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Ling Weiming said it's good for me...

409
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,520
Now she has a long neck.

410
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,720
It's not a game.

411
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,640
What if something happens to her?

412
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,520
Mum, why do you say that?

413
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,800
Did Ling Weiming die?

414
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,080
everything is over.

415
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,640
Everything is completely out of place.

416
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
You should have known it.

417
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,160
But you let her treat you instead.

418
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,160
Ling Weiming died of an stroke

419
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,360
but first-aid strange treatment was out of her control.

420
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,400
How did she become Amin and die?

421
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,560
Yes,

422
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,280
I have seen many people...

423
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
have been cured by Amin for 2 months

424
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,240
Probably.

425
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,520
Her injury is useful.

426
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,920
It's also good to see her recover after getting hit by the cold.

427
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
I'm afraid of the future.

428
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Anyway,

429
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm not afraid of ten thousand,

430
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
but I'm afraid of the future.

431
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,920
Where did you get this garbage?

432
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,720
When I went to the clinic today to pick up the audio,

433
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,720
it was all on the ground.

434
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,920
Put it here.

435
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,720
OK.

436
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
But you have to face the street,

437
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,320
shoot the street, shoot the sky.

438
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
Left, left.

439
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm on the right.

440
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,520
Can't you point left and right?

441
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,120
Can I?

442
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,920
Yes.

443
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
It's this position.

444
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,520
Are you looking at the cow or the street?

445
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,720
What are you talking about?

446
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm doing my job seriously.

447
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
You said I was looking at the cow.

448
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,120
You're affecting the whole progress.

449
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,120
You think you can scare me

450
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
by pretending to be a camera?

451
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,920
You're better than nothing.

452
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
At least there's evidence

453
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,120
when someone makes trouble.

454
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,520
How is Amin feeling?

455
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,720
He's been thinking about something all day.

456
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
Go in and see how he's doing.

457
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,920
Amin,

458
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,520
what are you doing here?

459
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
I'm doing some exercise.

460
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,320
So you're not only a Tai Chi and archery player,

461
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,520
but also a fisherman.

462
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm not a fisherman.

463
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm just doing some normal exercise.

464
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,320
I just need to lose some weight.

465
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,520
You need to be able to bend and bend.

466
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,520
You're being wronged now.

467
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,320
It's just a slander

468
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,920
to write you like that.

469
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,320
I can't do it if I take the initiative.

470
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,520
How can I become passive

471
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
if I take the initiative?

472
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,320
You're really passive now.

473
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
You don't clarify or counteract.

474
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,520
You don't change at all.

475
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,520
The air in the human body

476
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,720
goes from head to toe.

477
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,120
It's usually gathered under the shoulder.

478
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,720
You mean

479
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,120
to look at the problem from different angles?

480
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,320
From another angle.

481
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,320
For example, like a knife.

482
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,720
It can make the blood flow back to the meridians

483
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,520
and make the air flow and blood flow smoothly.

484
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,920
I've figured out a way to help Qian.

485
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Except for drinking and taking medicine,

486
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,720
we can use the air to help her make passive move.

487
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
We can make her move from all angles

488
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
to recover gradually.

489
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,120
I'm talking about the order now.

490
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
You're being blackmailed and not angry.

491
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,320
The one who worries about the other will be angry.

492
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
The one who is angry will be confused.

493
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
You should be careful when you exercise.

494
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,320
You can become a patient.

495
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
It's not that easy.

496
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
The medicine oil is good.

497
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Your technique is better.

498
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,320
Actually, it hurts here.

499
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,520
Really?

500
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,520
This position?

501
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
And it hurts here.

502
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,120
Here.

503
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
Here?

504
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,720
Is it right here?

505
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,520
Hello?

506
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,920
Mr. Deng.

507
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
It's better to stop here.

508
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
It's not right to walk.

509
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,320
I feel like I can't hold it.

510
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
Don't worry.

511
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,520
I got the news.

512
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,320
A big shareholder is going to buy in.

513
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,920
Now the price is low.

514
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
He's going to sweep the goods.

515
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Where did you get the news?

516
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I didn't hear it.

517
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,120
You should sit in my seat.

518
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,520
Ke.

519
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,320
Where are you going?

520
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
I'm going to the bank to do something.

521
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Do you want some sugar water?

522
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,720
No.

523
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

524
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,320
Aunt Jia.

525
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,120
We just arrived.

526
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Get in the car.

527
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Okay.

528
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,720
Xinpipe

529
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,520
Mrs. Ling.

530
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,520
I laid out the paperwork

531
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,920
according to your memorandum.

532
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,920
Please check it out.

533
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,720
Ah Xiang, help me check the details of the regulations.

534
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
Okay.

535
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,120
Madam, it's a will. Are you not feeling well?

536
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,920
Tell us. Why are you making a will?

537
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,520
It's not a will. It's a transfer of shares.

538
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm old. If something happens,

539
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,120
should I hand over these shares to Ah Ming?

540
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,320
You're so energetic. How could you be like this?

541
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,920
Don't tell Ah Ming.

542
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,720
He's always been against accepting any shares.

543
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll find a suitable opportunity to persuade him.

544
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,320
After you persuade him, you'll have to tell me that it's hard to keep a secret.

545
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,920
Sister, these regulations are not a problem.

546
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,520
Madam, considering your age,

547
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,920
before signing this document, I need to make sure

548
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,720
that you understand the legal effectiveness of this document.

549
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,920
Also, you signed it when you were awake and didn't get threatened.

550
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,120
I understand.

551
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,320
Then, let's start.

552
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
Your full name in Chinese is...

553
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,920
Deng Shu Huan.

554
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,120
How is it? Did you get your child back?

555
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
You asked me out on purpose.

556
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
You're not just concerned about my private life, right?

557
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
I just want to know why Liang Yan Zu

558
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,120
is driving my aunt and auntie to the law firm today?

559
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm working with you for one purpose.

560
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
To make Luo Ying Chen.

561
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,520
I'm not interested in anything else.

562
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Look at this.

563
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,720
See if you're interested.

564
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,720
It's used on Luo Ying Chen.

565
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
You're successful.

566
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,920
It doesn't seem like you're helping me.

567
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,720
Didn't you always hate him for stealing your things?

568
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,520
I don't want to be treated as a good person either.

569
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,720
With him, you can control Luo Ying Chen.

570
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,920
Control him to be as good as a lamb.

571
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,320
Isn't that good? What?

572
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,920
You're here to be a sister?

573
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,320
It's too late.

574
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,520
If you really think you're unlucky, don't think about it.

575
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
This woman.

576
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,120
If you don't give her a chance,

577
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,920
she'll think she's a top talent.

578
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
She'll definitely eat you.

579
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,720
As you wish.

580
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,120
Su Mei Yuan, do you know what's the different between this group two more years ago?

581
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,920
I don't care.

582
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,120
What?

583
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Me too.

584
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,320
My ...

585
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,720
Me too.

586
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Me too.

587
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Hello, hello.

588
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,920
I think your keychains are very pretty.

589
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
I had a good friend before.

590
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
When it was her sister's birthday, I bought her a keychain.

591
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,920
It's exactly the same as yours.

592
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,920
This is a birthday gift from my sister.

593
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Then, could your sister be Rachel Luo Ying Chen?

594
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Yes, I'm her sister, Luo Ying Ying.

595
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Hello, Ying Ying. I'm your sister's good friend.

596
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Oh, right. You Zhen was stabbed in your head.

597
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Where did you feel uncomfortable?

598
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I have autism and dizziness.

599
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Ling Wei Ming said that after the stabbing, I don't need to take medicine.

600
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I think you're so brave.

601
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
And this keychain is really pretty.

602
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
It's over.

603
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Hello, auntie.

604
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
She's my sister's friend.

605
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
What's your name?

606
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
My name is Natalie.

607
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Auntie, I'm Natalie. Hello.

608
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Ling Wei Ming!

609
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Come out!

610
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Do you have a ghost in your heart and you're not going to come out to pick up people?

611
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Ling Wei Ming! Come out! Come out!

612
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
This doctor will kill people.

613
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
You still want to see him?

614
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
He will kill you!

615
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Calm down.

616
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
Ling Wei Ming!

617
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm Ling Wei Ming. What's the matter?

618
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
You're the fake doctor.

619
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You're the one who's causing trouble to my Xiao Qian.

620
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
You only have half a life left.

621
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
You're Qian's father.

622
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
What's wrong with Qian?

623
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
Look!

624
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Look!

625
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
My son was hurt like this.

626
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
He was hurt like this.

627
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Look! Look!

628
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Don't do this.

629
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
My son was hurt like this.

630
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,920
What evidence do you have that you're a fake doctor?

631
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
My son was fine.

632
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
He took the medicine and suddenly had a congenital infarction and went to the hospital.

633
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
If you hadn't used the needle to stab him, would he have been like this?

634
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Is Qian awake?

635
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
And before the congenital infarction,

636
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
did he have any special symptoms?

637
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Don't pretend to be a good person here.

638
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Save it.

639
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Your broken clinic will kill people.

640
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
I'll tear your sign today.

641
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Sir, you can't do this.

642
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
My son is in the hospital.

643
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Sir, you can't do this.

644
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Let me tear the sign.

645
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
Sister, where did you stab him?

646
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Is there anything uncomfortable?

647
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Don't do this.

648
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
You can't do this.

649
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
What are you doing?

650
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I told you to move away.

651
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
If I don't tear your sign today, you won't leave.

652
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
You dare not leave, right?

653
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Get out of here.

654
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
A Zu.

655
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
A Zu.

656
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
How is it?

657
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
It's okay.

658
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Don't hit me.

659
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
Don't do this.

660
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Don't do this.

661
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Everyone saw it.

662
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
You threatened me.

663
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm going to attack the city.

664
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
You can get out of here.

665
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
I'm sorry.

666
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
We'd better go first.

667
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Let's go, sister.

668
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I'm sorry.

669
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm really sorry.

670
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I'm sorry.

671
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Forget it.

672
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
We'd better close the door early.

673
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Okay.

674
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
How is it?

675
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Did you get hurt?

676
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Yes.

677
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
It's okay.

678
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm going to the toilet.

679
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
It's okay.

680
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I'm sorry.

681
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
It's a little messy today.

682
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I can't help you with the medical treatment.

683
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
It's okay.

684
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
But A Min,

685
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
I believe your medical skill.

686
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
It's definitely not your business.

687
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Thank you.

688
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Fortunately, my head is hard enough.

689
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
A Zu.

690
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Let's go.

691
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Liu Bin is bleeding.

692
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Did you hit him hard just now?

693
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
It's a fire.

694
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I'm fine.

695
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
You go out and help my brother.

696
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Are you really okay?

697
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Let A Min see it.

698
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
I said I'm fine.

699
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Are you going or not?

700
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Go.

701
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Are you really okay?

702
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm fine.

703
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
I've thought about it.

704
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,920
We'd better not take my sister to the acupuncture in the future.

705
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Mr. Li is so unfair.

706
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Why did he say A Min made his son faint?

707
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Yes.

708
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
After the acupuncture,

709
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
my sister really got better.

710
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
You weren't there today.

711
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
That man was so noisy.

712
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
He scared my sister.

713
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,920
And that man has a photo as evidence.

714
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,920
His son was lying in the hospital and had a tube inserted.

715
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
It's so pitiful.

716
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Mom, don't be so harsh.

717
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,920
A Min only had to be treated for a thousand times.

718
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,920
My sister asked him to be treated for two months.

719
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Not only is she fine,

720
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
she's getting better.

721
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
She's fine now.

722
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
But her neck...

723
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
I'm still worried.

724
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Lin Wei Min is not a bad person.

725
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I'm fine after the acupuncture.

726
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
My sister is A Min's patient.

727
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
She said she was fine.

728
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Can you give me some confidence?

729
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
As a mother,

730
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm responsible for protecting my daughter.

731
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
If something happens to my sister,

732
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
can you and your dad afford it?

733
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Stop talking.

734
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Anyway, I've decided.

735
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I won't throw away the wine in the future.

736
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Really?

737
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Of course.

738
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
I'll give you more than that.

739
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
I'll treat you well.

740
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
My sister.

741
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Let your mom digest it.

742
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Today she was scared by the man in the hospital.

743
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
It's inevitable that she thinks too much.

744
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
But I believe

745
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,920
A Min won't kill anyone.

746
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
A Min.

747
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm just worried about Qian. I'm going to the hospital now.

748
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,720
Do you want me to go with you?

749
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
No need. It was too chaotic earlier.

750
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,320
I was worried that I would scare your sister. You stay at home and keep her company.

751
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
She's fine. Don't worry.

752
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
If you have any problem, just call me anytime.

753
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
I will. Bye-bye.

754
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
Bye-bye.

755
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
Qian.

756
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,520
Mrs. Li, how is Qian?

757
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't go in.

758
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,120
We just want to see how Qian is. We won't disturb her rest.

759
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm not not letting you in.

760
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,320
Then it's her! It's this doctor!

761
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,520
He gave my son too much alcohol and made him have a fever and went to the hospital.

762
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,320
What nonsense are you saying? My eldest brother is treating your son. He doesn't take money.

763
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,320
You say it so well. Treating him for free. Is that so good?

764
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,920
It looks like a treatment. In fact, there is a drug factory

765
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,320
that wants to promote their own drug.

766
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,920
They don't understand and pretend to understand. This is just ignoring people's lives, right?

767
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Doctor Lin, what response do you have to Mr. Li's order?

768
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,720
No response.

769
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,920
Then don't touch me!

770
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,520
This is a hospital. If things get worse,

771
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
it's not fair to Qian and the other kids.

772
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,520
I won't answer any questions here.

773
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,720
But please believe me. I'm like Mr. Li and Mrs. Li.

774
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
I don't want anything to happen to Qian.

775
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,720
Stop pretending to be a good person. You've killed your own sister.

776
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,320
What are you saying? What evidence do you have?

777
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,720
What? I'm just saying evidence.

778
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,720
If something happens to Qian, I will definitely investigate it to the end.

779
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Here.

780
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,720
Hey, we're here. The food is just ready. Eat.

781
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,320
Why did you suddenly ask me out for dinner?

782
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Silly. Do I need a reason to ask you out for dinner?

783
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
That's not what I meant.

784
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,920
But you rarely ask me out.

785
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,720
Then, I'll just take it as my thanks.

786
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,920
Thank you for taking me to the hospital.

787
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,720
Only then can Rachel and I get back together.

788
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,520
But you were thrown all over the place.

789
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,720
Did you help me chase those bastards?

790
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
But I didn't catch them in the end.

791
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,520
Stop talking so much. Hurry and eat.

792
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,120
Or else, the food will get cold.

793
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Here. This.

794
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,920
Okay, okay. I'll do it myself.

795
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
Thank you.

796
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,120
Why are you suddenly so hostile to me?

797
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Did I make you angry?

798
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,120
No, no.

799
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,720
It's just that the hospital is having some trouble lately.

800
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,920
The food is ready.

801
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,320
I know. Is it that Mr. Li?

802
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,720
Actually, you're bleeding.

803
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
I have tissue. Here.

804
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,120
It's just a heatstroke. Nothing special.

805
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,720
That's right. Don't worry.

806
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,920
Really?

807
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Okay.

808
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Oh, right. How do you and A Min want to resolve this matter?

809
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,720
How can we resolve it?

810
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Qian Zai isn't awake yet.

811
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,720
They don't have any evidence to prove that it's related to Big Brother.

812
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,920
Big Brother even saw that they were poor and didn't take a single dollar from them.

813
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,920
He treats kindness as a fish in the water.

814
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,920
If that Mr. Li is poor to the point that

815
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,920
his son is sick and doesn't have money to treat him,

816
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,120
then would he want to cheat A Min?

817
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,920
Do you know that his son needs to be hospitalized now?

818
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Hospitalization is very expensive.

819
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
That's possible.

820
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Yes. But if he's doing it for money, then it's fine.

821
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,720
Because money can resolve the problem, it's not a problem.

822
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,120
Money can resolve the problem, it's not a problem.

823
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,520
This way.

824
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Yes, sir.

825
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,920
Big Brother, I've solved Mr. Li's problem.

826
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,720
There won't be any trouble at the hospital anymore.

827
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,920
Solved? How?

828
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,120
What did you say?

829
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
I have my own method,

830
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,520
but Mr. Li won't make things worse again.

831
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,320
You've done a lot of great work this time.

832
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Wait. Can you clearly tell me

833
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,520
how you settled this?

834
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Secret.

835
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Hey, Mr. Li!

836
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
Dr. Ling, we got the news.

837
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,120
Your assistant bought him and threatened his family.

838
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
Is that true?

839
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,800
I didn't buy or threaten him.

840
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,160
Don't deny it. You have a false witness.

841
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,600
Mr. Li,

842
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,400
you've got the money now.

843
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,920
So don't say so much.

844
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,760
Or I'll beat you up.

845
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,400
So this is how you did it.

846
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
It's not like that.

847
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,240
What you saw in this video

848
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,560
is fake.

849
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,080
You cut off the head and tail.

850
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,880
But this is obviously a false accusation.

851
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,720
Dr. Ling.

852
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
This has nothing to do with Lin Weiming.

853
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,360
I did it.

854
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,520
But I was framed.

855
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,680
Did you ask your assistant

856
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
to buy other people's families?

857
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
You poured the wine on the kid's neck

858
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,080
and caused his blood to flow.

859
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,960
What happened?

860
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,120
There's also a rumor that you killed your sister.

861
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
Is that true?

862
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,240
Your pharmaceutical factory sells medicinal oil.

863
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,680
Can your medicinal oil be reliable?

864
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,080
Yes.

865
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,800
Mr. Li, please.

866
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,280
I need some time

867
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,320
to understand the content of the video.

868
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,480
As for you guys questioning me for pouring the wine,

869
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,800
I have to make it clear.

870
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,920
Yamen School is a history of medicine.

871
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,640
It's used to adjust the language,

872
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,800
and to control the throat.

873
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
You're still pretending to be a medical expert.

874
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,960
Look.

875
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
The reporter is so right.

876
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,040
I'm worth it no matter how much I spend.

877
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,080
What's wrong?

878
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,960
You can't bear to leave?

879
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,760
You feel sorry for him?

880
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,280
Or do you still like him?

881
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,640
He chose Luo Yingchen.

882
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,560
His business has nothing to do with me.

883
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,440
I'm just collecting money.

884
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,720
Although I got this done,

885
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,600
I have to thank you for being so smart.

886
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,120
You fooled Liang Yanzu, the fool,

887
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,800
and made him pay for Mr. Li's case.

888
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,480
So,

889
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,400
I'll drink to you.

890
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,680
Liang Yanzu, the idiot,

891
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,320
I can really make good use of him

892
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,440
by my cousin.

893
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,280
I can use him many times.

894
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,280
I'll decide whether to use him or not.

895
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,960
It's not your decision.

896
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,400
What?

897
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,560
Protect him?

898
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,400
You can't bear to leave?

899
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,760
Not like you.

900
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,520
It won't take many times to bribe a poor man.

901
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Find me if you have a good idea.

902
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:58,840
Here.

903
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,080
Brother, believe me.

904
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,680
Mr. Li didn't mean it.

905
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,320
He has confessed his fault in front of me.

906
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,520
He said he needed medical fees for slander.

907
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,800
I think Qian is so miserable.

908
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,840
So I gave him money.

909
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,000
How long have you been following me?

910
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,520
I know who you are.

911
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,280
I know you were used.

912
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,200
Brother, you're good.

913
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,360
And you're very good at medical.

914
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,160
I don't believe you made Qian Zai stay in hospital.

915
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
I don't know if the medical skills are good or not.

916
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
But I only used four needles to help Qian Zai.

917
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,960
It doesn't involve the drug.

918
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,360
It won't stimulate the central nervous system and cause dizziness.

919
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,960
He's already sick. He doesn't even care about his own illness.

920
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
What are you doing? You saw the news and came here to gossip.

921
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,160
I'm telling you, I didn't bribe anyone. Big Brother is innocent.

922
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
I know. I believe in you.

923
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,360
Did something happen to Xiao Yi?

924
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,960
It's not because of me.

925
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Cousin, I'm asking you to save Ji Ji.

926
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,960
If she insists on it, something will happen sooner or later.

927
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,760
Okay, that's settled.

928
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,560
Xiao Ming.

929
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
The distributor said they don't want our goods.

930
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,560
You can tell the shipping department to stop shipping from today.

931
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,360
But our big client has already canceled our order.

932
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,160
Even the distributor is like this.

933
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
If this continues, can our company hold on?

934
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,760
The most important thing is that we can hold on.

935
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
I know.

936
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,160
Rachel, look.

937
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,560
I saw someone in the online forum calling to resist the sale of Maimaitong.

938
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,360
There are a dozen posts and there's even a response from the Internet celebrity.

939
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,760
I was so naive to think that it was just a medical problem.

940
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,160
The result is so serious.

941
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,960
The boss is the founder of Maimaitong.

942
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,160
There's a company here.

943
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,960
It will definitely affect our side.

944
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,160
The most dangerous thing is that it will become a traffic code and be pushed by someone.

945
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,560
Yes.

946
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,760
Nan.

947
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,360
Sorry, Rachel.

948
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,160
This time, it was my fault.

949
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Let's drink something first.

950
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,960
You're not here yet?

951
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes.

952
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,160
The client said that it will take 15 minutes.

953
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,960
I'll go after him later.

954
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,160
You're so amazing.

955
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,360
You even know about the medicine and oil export business.

956
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,760
You also know that our company has a lot of overseas clients.

957
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,160
Although the market in Hong Kong is not very good right now,

958
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,960
at this time, it's the right time to do some overseas real estate investments.

959
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,160
I think that the medicine and oil are also similar.

960
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,960
That Mr. Li who blackened the clinic and made Maimaitong difficult to sell in Hong Kong.

961
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,160
We need the export.

962
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
So, I'm really grateful that you're introducing us.

963
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,760
Don't say that.

964
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
Last time, I was looking for Mr. Li with A'zu.

965
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,160
I thought that we could use money to solve it.

966
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,760
But in the end, we made Maimaitong a problem.

967
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,360
I should apologize.

968
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
Forget it. I understand.

969
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,360
You and A'zu just want to help.

970
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,160
That's why, I think that this client is reliable. He definitely can do it.

971
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Let's go after him again.

972
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
That's weird.

973
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,960
What's wrong?

974
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,760
I can't get through.

975
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Who are you waiting for?

976
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,760
If you wait for the export,

977
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
he's my friend.

978
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,160
I'm his friend. I can't let him get into trouble.

979
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,960
I told him that Maimaitong and Wei Ming Clinic have scandals.

980
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,160
Maybe after he hears it, he won't want to do business with you two.

981
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,960
Deng Shikeng, don't be so rash.

982
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,560
I gave you a chance.

983
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,160
You're going to stick to my cousin like a dead man.

984
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,960
Of course, I'm going to break Maimaitong.

985
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
If you and cousin beg me,

986
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,160
I might be better to you.

987
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,960
Think about it. I won't beg you for anything.

988
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,760
Let's go.

989
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,760
I'm sorry, Rachel. I didn't help you.

990
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,760
I had to be helped by him for a long time.

991
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
What's wrong?

992
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,360
I'm so dizzy. I'm so angry that I'm dizzy.

993
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
Come.

994
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Sit down first. Do you have any medicine?

995
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,160
No.

996
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,560
You're just dizzy, right?

997
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,760
I'll go buy you some medicine.

998
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,560
Sit here and wait for me. I'll be back soon.

999
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,560
I'm sorry.

1000
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,360
I'm sorry.

1001
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,560
I'm sorry.

1002
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm sorry.

1003
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,960
I'm sorry.

1004
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm sorry.

1005
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I'm sorry.

1006
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm sorry.

1007
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
I'm sorry.

1008
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
I'm sorry.

1009
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
I'm sorry.

1010
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm sorry.

1011
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I'm sorry.

1012
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I'm sorry.

1013
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,360
I'm sorry.

1014
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,160
I'm sorry.

1015
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,560
I'm sorry.

1016
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,560
It was great to be here.

1017
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,880
That's awesome.

1018
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
the problem of the five-storied and the five-softened.

1019
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,280
But we can make up for it by the day after tomorrow.

1020
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,680
We need to find a doctor to take care of the vital organs as soon as possible.

1021
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Besides the acupuncture,

1022
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,280
we can let them do the shoulder exercises we taught before.

1023
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,480
Lying on the bed and stretching slowly

1024
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,280
can improve the blood circulation of their brain.

1025
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
The problem of the five-storied and the five-softened.

1026
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
But we can make up for it by the day after tomorrow.

1027
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,880
We need to find a doctor to take care of the vital organs as soon as possible.

1028
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
But we can make up for it by the day after tomorrow.

1029
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Besides the acupuncture,

1030
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
we can let them do the shoulder exercises we taught before.

1031
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,880
We need to find a doctor to take care of the vital organs as soon as possible.

1032
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Besides the acupuncture,

1033
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
we can let them do the shoulder exercises we taught before.

1034
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
Besides the acupuncture,

1035
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
we can let them do the shoulder exercises we taught before.

1036
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Besides the acupuncture,

1037
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
we can let them do the shoulder exercises we taught before.

1038
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
Besides the acupuncture,
