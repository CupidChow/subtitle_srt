1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's great.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The temporary contract of Jilu 581 has been signed.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Congratulations.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll take care of my family's business.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You don't have to worry about it.

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your family?

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's your family.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't do anything to your family anymore.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The CT shows that

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
there is no new bleeding in his brain.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And other abnormal situations.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The situation is getting stable.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But we still have to continue to observe.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you, doctor.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I want to remind you.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He used to have a brain tumor cut out surgery.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,200
To avoid the

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mr. Ling, please answer my phone.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's continue to find good housemates for Mr. Deng.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Make more money.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Cheers.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you for helping me today.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You don't drink at all, do you?

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come on.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Rui,

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Harry is giving you a toast.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You should drink it.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Drink with me.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Harry,

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you can't do this.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You only drink with Rachel.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What about me?

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you talking about?

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's the same as drinking with me.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on, come here.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on, come here and drink with me.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, it's the same as drinking with Mr. Deng.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Come on.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is for everyone.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have no reason not to drink it up.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll answer the phone first.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll drink it later.

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come on, come on, this bottle.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Ling.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Miss Luo, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have time to call you now.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You haven't been here.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You don't answer my call.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In the end, Mrs. Ju and Mr. Deng

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
signed a temporary contract.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My cousin called.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He asked him to come here to celebrate.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He wanted to buy the 7th floor anyway.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now we have bought it.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He should be the one who should celebrate.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Cousin, come here.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uncle is with you.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My boss asked me to come.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have to come.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We are celebrating in Jiu Long now.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I see.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll see how it goes.

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll go there if I can.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You finally wake up.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You see I'm awake.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why don't you cry?

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
When you were a kid,

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you had to lie down for 10 hours

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to get out of the surgery.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The doctor said you would wake up in two hours.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have to sleep for three hours.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
When your brother

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
doesn't have a strong heart,

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
he really can't stand it.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have no right to say that.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not a man.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm a man.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a man.

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm a man.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm a man.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm a man.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm a man.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Did you get heart disease?

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The pharyngal heart disease

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
is caused by training the ball.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not caused by shock.

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You don't know.

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Even elementary school students know.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
They may die if they run on the road.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I just woke up.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're cursing me to die.

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We promised each other when we were kids.

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No one can die first.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then please be careful.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not hurt by a car.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm angry by you.

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not dead yet.

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's what it is.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Which brothers don't fight?

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
By the way,

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
how's the building?

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's okay.

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll solve it.

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Be careful.

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't do anything.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know you're more crazy than me.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I know.

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have my own rules.

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You rest.

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on.

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Drink more.

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't stop.

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Go on.

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This bottle of wine is expensive.

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a waste if you don't drink it.

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't drink it.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Enough.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Open your mouth.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't drink it.

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Enough.

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Didn't you hear that?

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He said he didn't drink it.

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He doesn't drink it.

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You drink it.

158
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Since you're here,

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you should know

160
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we bought that building.

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You should be happy.

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can drink it.

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You?

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You asked A'zu to fire me

165
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and then I'll go to the building.

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't drink it.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not good for me.

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on.

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't be so mean.

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're the one who has a problem.

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're helping you.

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's not good for you.

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't be so polite.

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Ling.

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's continue.

176
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Before they sign the agreement,

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I should have thought of a way to inform you.

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't expect you to be so hard.

180
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's none of your business.

181
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can only blame myself for not catching up.

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A'zu was sick and was hospitalized.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Is he okay?

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He should be fine

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
if he's hospitalized.

186
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's so drunk.

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Can he leave?

188
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Drink it.

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't leave until the boss leaves.

191
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Cheers.

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cheers.

193
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Miss Luo.

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't drink it if you can't drink it.

195
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Drinking too much wine

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
will cause blood loss

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and your head will hurt.

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I know.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Take care of yourself.

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're still drunk.

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Cheers.

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Drink more.

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Drink more.

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Cheers.

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right?

207
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Richard.

208
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Where do you live?

209
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll take you back.

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No need.

211
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I called a taxi.

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If you can't get on the road,

213
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll take you back.

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's because I can't get on the road

215
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that I'm more sincere.

216
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Here's the car.

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't be so stubborn.

218
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Richard and Mr. Deng are waiting for you.

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mr. Deng, your car keys.

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Richard, you're on the car.

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll help you.

223
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Take the car.

224
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Deng.

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I just remembered

226
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that my friend is in the hospital today.

227
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm going to buy some daily necessities for him.

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
See you next time.

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Bye.

230
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hello.

231
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Are you okay?

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I heard that you were in the hospital.

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm fine.

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can even kill a few tigers.

235
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you that good?

236
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But your brother said that you almost died.

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You care about me.

238
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You helped me.

239
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I should care about you.

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
By the way,

241
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
how's it going over there?

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Did my brother give you a bad temper?

243
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Just like that.

244
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know your brother's business best.

245
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
By the way,

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to the hospital.

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll call you later.

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Bye.

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you say that you wanted me to treat you to something?

250
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Richard.

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Richard.

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Richard.

253
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Richard.

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Richard.

255
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Richard.

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Richard.

257
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Richard.

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Richard.

259
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Richard.

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Richard.

261
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Richard.

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Richard.

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Richard.

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Richard.

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Richard.

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Richard.

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Richard.

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Richard.

269
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Richard.

270
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Richard.

271
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Richard.

272
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Richard.

273
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Richard.

274
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Richard.

275
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Richard.

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Richard.

277
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Richard.

278
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Richard.

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,300
Are you crazy?

280
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
What's wrong with you?

281
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll support you, okay?

282
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Just let me go.

283
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Are you mad?

284
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
You...

285
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
Are you crazy?

286
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,280
That way.

287
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,000
Go on.

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,600
Exusu...

289
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,760
Really?

290
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,440
I'm afraid you're too bored in the hospital

291
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,840
and can't eat well.

292
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,200
So I bought some fried chicken

293
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
and snacks for you.

294
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
Only fried chicken?

295
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,280
What only?

296
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,720
You're in the hospital now.

297
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,000
After you're discharged,

298
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

299
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,880
Really?

300
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,760
This is the hospital.

301
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,920
You can't drink beer.

302
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,520
You can't drink, but I can.

303
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,120
No.

304
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,560
The nurses here are very ugly and fierce.

305
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
They pull the curtain and drink together.

306
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,440
How dare you!

307
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,960
But,

308
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
drinking alone seems boring.

309
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,160
How about we play a game?

310
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,320
Black and white.

311
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,880
The black and white king of the big circle.

312
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
It's so bad.

313
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
If you lose, you have to drink.

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Okay.

315
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,200
Come on.

316
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,840
Black and white.

317
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
Black and white.

318
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Black and white.

319
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
You're hungry?

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,680
Black and white.

321
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,640
Black and white.

322
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,520
Black and white.

323
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,400
Black and white.

324
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Who's so loud?

325
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Black and white.

326
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,760
Drink.

327
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
What are you doing here?

328
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:20,160
I'm doing the

329
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
mental hospital.

330
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,800
Stop talking.

331
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,840
Keep playing.

332
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,120
Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?

333
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,960
We can just play black and white.

334
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Why?

335
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,120
Just play without talking.

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is it okay?

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
One, two, three.

338
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,600
Can A'zu be discharged tomorrow?

339
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,360
I plan to cook soup for him tomorrow.

340
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,480
The doctor asked him to stay in the hospital for a while.

341
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,040
But he's still in good spirits.

342
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,400
So don't worry too much.

343
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,520
But I think you're worse than him.

344
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm not.

345
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm not.

346
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm not.

347
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
I'm not.

348
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I'm not.

349
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm not.

350
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm not.

351
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm not.

352
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm not.

353
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I'm not.

354
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm not.

355
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I'm not.

356
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm not.

357
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm not.

358
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm not.

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,920
You look so worried.

360
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,720
You have a lot of worries.

361
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,360
Is it because of the building purchase?

362
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,320
Actually, I want to help you.

363
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,320
Don't blame uncle and his father.

364
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,720
I was talking to aunt Ju about the building.

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,480
Now uncle just jumped over me.

366
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,280
I really don't know how to explain to aunt Ju.

367
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,160
Actually, the building is sold to Ren Yuan Pharmaceutical Factory.

368
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,680
Or the sale is successful.

369
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,680
It's the same for me and aunt Ju.

370
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
We just hope to keep the building

371
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
and fulfill your father's wish.

372
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I know you can't talk to your uncle and his father.

373
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,560
But we're a family.

374
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
It's good to have something to say.

375
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,360
Don't think too much.

376
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
Drink it while it's hot.

377
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Okay, mom.

378
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm sorry.

379
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,960
I didn't clean the house for too long.

380
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,560
I hope I can fix it.

381
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,760
So I'm sorry to bother you.

382
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
It's okay.

383
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,960
I have time anyway.

384
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Throw away the garbage.

385
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,560
Don't bother the decoration.

386
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,560
It's just some living things.

387
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,160
But the most important thing

388
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,760
is to keep the pillars of this building.

389
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
This is the pillar to keep this building.

390
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,560
Aunt Ju, actually, this building...

391
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Is here.

392
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Miss Luo, why are you here?

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,960
I heard you would come to clean the garbage.

394
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,360
I want to see if you need any help.

395
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,960
Okay.

396
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,360
You didn't tell me.

397
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I thought you had a good talk.

398
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
Aunt Ju,

399
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,960
I want to tell you something.

400
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,160
Wow, it's so old.

401
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,760
It needs a long time to be cleaned.

402
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,560
Cousin, what a coincidence.

403
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Mr. Dong, I know the situation of the house.

404
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,960
Remember to tell us if you want to pay the rent.

405
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
We have many procedures to do.

406
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Do what?

407
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,360
Why do you do that?

408
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Aunt Ju, the house is too old.

409
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,560
So we will do it.

410
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,760
Ming said he would keep the building.

411
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,160
It's too old.

412
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,360
And it can make 60 million yuan.

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,160
Who will refuse to do this business?

414
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,560
The value of the building is not measured by money.

415
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Old is not gone, new is not coming.

416
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't be so old.

417
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,360
It's against my father's wish.

418
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,760
I sold the house to you.

419
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,560
Why did he decide it?

420
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
He said he would demolish it.

421
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,360
Aunt Ju, I'm sorry.

422
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
I can explain it clearly.

423
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,160
The building is bought in the name of Ren Yuan.

424
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm not the shareholder.

425
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,960
I can't decide it.

426
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,560
But you didn't say you would demolish the building when you signed the contract with me.

427
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,960
If you want to demolish it, I won't sell it.

428
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,160
Aunt Ju, you signed the contract.

429
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,960
There is a contract that you must buy and sell.

430
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,760
If you break the contract, you will not only lose twice the deposit.

431
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,560
I have the right to return the market price.

432
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
The price is 1.2 billion yuan.

433
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,360
But it's okay if you don't sell it.

434
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,560
You can give me 60 million yuan.

435
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,960
Ask Miss Luo if you have any questions.

436
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
She signed the contract for you.

437
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
You lied to me.

438
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
You signed the contract in secret.

439
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
You knew they would sell it.

440
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
I didn't know.

441
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,160
I thought they were just...

442
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
You thought?

443
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,360
I thought you took care of your sister like this.

444
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,960
You are a good person.

445
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,560
You colluded with them to lie to me.

446
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,160
No, I didn't.

447
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,760
Don't be angry.

448
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,160
Let's go back and think of another way.

449
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,360
Did you know that Henry and the others would sell the house?

450
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,760
They have double the deposit.

451
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,160
They have money to make.

452
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,960
How could you do this?

453
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,960
You didn't tell me. You even lied to me.

454
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Miss, you are so personality.

455
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
You are open-minded and have a good heart.

456
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
You wouldn't be a match for me.

457
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,560
I'm telling you, you only know how to mess things up.

458
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,160
That house has a lot of memories of Aunt Ju and her family.

459
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
She almost fainted when she heard that she was going to tear it down.

460
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,960
How could you lie to her and her family?

461
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,560
Are you crazy?

462
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,960
Are you a split-minded person or a dual personality?

463
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
You will get drunk and get into their car.

464
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,160
You will say that they lied to your mother-in-law.

465
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,960
You are also a rich person. Stop pretending.

466
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm not as cheap as you think.

467
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,560
How about this?

468
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm the first.

469
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm not as lucky as you.

470
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,360
I have such a good father to help you pay your credit card.

471
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
And I have a good school to study.

472
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
I have nothing.

473
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I don't rely on this. What do I rely on?

474
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm really very drunk. Stop arguing with me.

475
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,560
So this is how you always see me.

476
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,360
What do you think?

477
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,960
This is an office. Have you two had enough of this?

478
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,760
That's right.

479
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Who told you that Lin Wei Min never gave money?

480
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,960
She can't afford to pay. But someone will pay to buy it.

481
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,160
Even if the person who pays isn't someone who is willing to buy it,

482
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
we still have to do business.

483
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,160
Grandma Ju believes that Mr. Lin and I

484
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,560
sold the building at a low price.

485
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,360
You are now telling her that you want to demolish it and you are blaming me.

486
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,560
How am I going to explain to her?

487
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,960
You are so funny, Miss.

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,360
What do you mean by explain?

489
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
We are a real estate company.

490
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,160
We are a charity organization. We will definitely make money first.

491
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,560
Wei Lian, take care of the rest. Don't argue with her.

492
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,160
Okay.

493
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
Ah!

494
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,360
Be careful. Take your time.

495
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,160
Sit down first.

496
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
What's wrong, Grandma? Are you not feeling well?

497
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
That's right. I feel a little dizzy.

498
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,560
It's an old disease.

499
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll get you a cup of hot water.

500
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,760
I'll apply some medicine oil for you.

501
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
Thank you.

502
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
In fact, Grandma Ju, you overworked yourself.

503
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,960
You are not able to control your blood pressure.

504
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,760
Remember, don't get too agitated. Or else, you will easily faint.

505
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,560
I am really too muddled.

506
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,760
I shouldn't have signed a contract with them when you were not around.

507
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,560
But seeing how our two granddaughters are old and weak,

508
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
how could they not be bullied?

509
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,960
If they want to demolish it, then do it. I can't stand it anymore.

510
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,360
Don't think like that.

511
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,560
Maybe you can wait for me to find a chance to talk to my uncle.

512
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,360
That's good.

513
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,560
I really can't bear to demolish it.

514
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Mr. Ling! Mr. Ling! You can't go in!

515
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
If you don't have enough money, I can give you double the money.

516
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,760
I hope you can seriously consider giving up this kind of building.

517
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,760
Cousin, I have a business worth one hundred million and two thousand million.

518
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
You don't think that I will give up just because of this, right?

519
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
You only know about money. For money, you even lied to my mother.

520
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Hey, hey, hey. That's my sister.

521
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Don't say that lying is so bad, okay?

522
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Cousin, don't always say that it's cheaper than us.

523
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,160
This pharmaceutical factory is also my aunt's.

524
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,360
When she is able to get a good position, it will still be cheaper than you.

525
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
My aunt's life is long and long.

526
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I am like my mom. I bought this building not to earn money.

527
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
I am doing this for my father's wish.

528
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,760
The pharmaceutical factory is my uncle's.

529
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
What's wrong with us making it big and strong?

530
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,760
If we earn too much money now, he will have to lie in the coffin and smile.

531
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,360
My father opened the pharmaceutical factory not to earn money.

532
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,960
He wanted to help people. He wanted to help people.

533
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,560
He wanted to help people. He is not like you.

534
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
You only know how to lie to money and put it in your own pocket.

535
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,160
Be careful what you say. Be more easy.

536
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,560
It's because your father and son will never understand.

537
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,960
Cousin, let's go.

538
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,560
Mr. Ling.

539
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,560
What are you doing here?

540
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,360
Mr. Ling, I want to explain to you.

541
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,760
I hope you believe me.

542
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,560
I really don't know that they are planning to sell this building.

543
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,960
That day, I heard that they are going to buy it in the name of Ren Yuan Pharmaceutical Factory

544
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,760
instead of in the name of Mai Mai Tong.

545
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
I should have told you.

546
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,160
Now that things have become like this, I am responsible for the economy.

547
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,960
I know that I have a big responsibility.

548
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,160
But I won't lie to you and Grandma Ju. Believe me.

549
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,960
I really don't know that they will collude and lie to you.

550
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm sorry.

551
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,960
It seems that they have a heart and they are not.

552
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
I can't blame you.

553
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,560
There are some problems that I haven't resolved.

554
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm sorry.

555
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
toxins

556
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,640
değil

557
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,480
Xueling saved me

558
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,560
What I want to say is

559
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,760
that fans think that their money and clothes are so expensive.

560
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,560
Accordingly, this funds is too chann중 to pay for.

561
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,400
if they don't want to sign the contract at the same time,

562
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,560
it would be different.

563
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,520
They have money to make,

564
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,880
how can they give up the deal?

565
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,760
I've studied the contract with Grandma Ju for a long time.

566
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
When we signed the contract,

567
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,720
Grandma Ju asked us to do the ritual

568
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,480
at the bottom of the building

569
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,600
on the first day of the New Year.

570
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,480
And hang the traditional decorations on the outer wall.

571
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,520
The meaning of this right

572
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,760
is to extend it in the law.

573
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,940
The

574
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,000
keep the building.

575
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,520
Yes.

576
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,120
I've made the deal.

577
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,160
The representatives of the land owners will sign the contract later.

578
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Don't worry.

579
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,080
I'll help Grandma to get this deal done.

580
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,360
Grandma is so great.

581
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,240
I'm relieved to have her.

582
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,880
This document in front of you

583
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,480
is the contract memorandum of the deal.

584
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
According to the memorandum,

585
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,760
the next buyer will pay 6 million per box.

586
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,080
See if there's any problem.

587
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
What are you doing here?

588
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm in charge of the building.

589
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm here to transfer the deal.

590
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,200
But you're not in charge now.

591
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
It's against the rules.

592
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
It doesn't matter.

593
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
When the ritual comes,

594
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,280
one more person and one more pair of eyes.

595
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,600
Help me to see the memorandum later.

596
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
Okay.

597
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm sorry about that day.

598
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,280
I was a little lost.

599
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,640
I hope you won't mind.

600
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,480
I was very drunk that day.

601
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,560
I don't remember.

602
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
Let's drink again another day.

603
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay.

604
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,720
I'm going to the bathroom.

605
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,240
You're so drunk.

606
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,400
You're so annoying.

607
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,800
Annoying, right?

608
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,880
Annoying, right?

609
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
What's wrong with this place?

610
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,280
What's wrong with this place?

611
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,240
You said you're not a low-level buyer.

612
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
I thought you were a high-class buyer.

613
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,680
I didn't expect you to be a low-level buyer.

614
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,080
I owe so much to the bank.

615
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,840
Do I have to pay for it?

616
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,280
And this deal,

617
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,080
did you help me to make it?

618
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,480
How can I let you down?

619
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
But I'm most grateful

620
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
to you

621
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
for letting me know Henry's potential.

622
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,840
Who do you think you are?

623
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,440
Do you know what happened between me and Henry?

624
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,600
Don't try to get in our way.

625
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Mr. Du.

626
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
The next buyer just called.

627
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,960
He said he showed his lawyer team

628
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,400
your temporary contract.

629
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,320
He said there's a problem with the contract

630
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
and he wants to cancel the deal.

631
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,600
What?

632
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,400
What's the problem?

633
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,680
He said there are some special terms

634
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
on the contract.

635
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,240
He's slowly making it up to him.

636
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,040
How's it going?

637
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,760
Is it going well with the transfer?

638
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,040
What are you doing?

639
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,120
Grandma Ju said

640
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,280
she's afraid that you can't reach an agreement with the seller

641
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,880
and she's afraid that you can't pay the fine.

642
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,200
So she asked me to come up with a plan with her.

643
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,080
Sit down.

644
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
Look at the contract.

645
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,520
What terms are there?

646
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,640
I have a copy.

647
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,840
I'll read it for you.

648
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,760
The seller has the following rights.

649
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,480
During the New Year,

650
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,640
the seller has the right to perform family rituals

651
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,320
at the bottom of the original building

652
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
and to hang traditional decorations

653
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,360
on the original outer wall

654
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,080
during the traditional festival.

655
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,080
What do you mean?

656
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,040
He likes to worship the god of heaven and earth.

657
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,920
What does it have to do with it?

658
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
In the law,

659
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,200
the use of the certain part of the property

660
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,800
and the physical structure are inseparable.

661
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,960
Using the original bottom of the building

662
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,680
and the two rights of hanging traditional decorations

663
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
on the original outer wall

664
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,680
are the obligations of keeping the structure

665
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,200
and the outer appearance of the building.

666
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,960
It means that

667
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,360
you changed the structure of the building

668
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,320
and violated the contract terms.

669
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,120
We can apply for a ban

670
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,000
and let you pay the loss.

671
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,520
How can there be such a condition?

672
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,000
Did you add it secretly?

673
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,040
You were in a hurry that day

674
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,280
to ask Grandma Ju to sign the contract.

675
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,000
You can say whatever you want.

676
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,440
I'll write whatever Grandma Ju says.

677
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,040
You can all watch it.

678
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,720
You were there that day.

679
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
How can you let her change the structure of the building?

680
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
She made it clear.

681
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Didn't you hear it?

682
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,200
This is the blessing of God.

683
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,720
Who can't be righteous?

684
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
There is a must-buy and must-sell condition

685
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,200
in the contract.

686
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,920
So please pay the loss

687
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,360
to Grandma Ju as soon as possible.

688
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,400
Grandma Ju, let's go.

689
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,800
I'll go with you.

690
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,800
You can't go.

691
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,080
Go back and explain it to Mr. Nen.

692
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,840
Let go.

693
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,440
I've said what I wanted to say.

694
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,640
You offended our guest.

695
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
You want to leave without solving the problem.

696
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Let go first, okay?

697
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
I taught my subordinate.

698
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,240
It's your turn.

699
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,880
I'm his boss.

700
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,720
Let him go.

701
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,560
Just stand.

702
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,720
Even if you kneel down,

703
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,840
you can't say no.

704
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,040
You hit me.

705
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,960
You don't want to do it anymore.

706
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,680
I've wanted to hit you for a long time.

707
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm not doing it now.

708
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
You're sick.

709
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
I'm not going to sell Qilong now.

710
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,840
Why do we spend so much money

711
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,880
to buy it?

712
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,400
A Ming's attitude is so tough.

713
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
This won't do.

714
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,960
What if my sister...

715
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,920
How to talk?

716
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,600
If it's like this,

717
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,400
don't you have to kneel down

718
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
and bow to apologize?

719
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,680
There's nothing we can do.

720
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
You've done enough

721
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,880
to be so embarrassed.

722
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,200
You're so mean.

723
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Ariel, I...

724
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
Go to my office.

725
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,880
Ariel, I called you so many times.

726
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,120
Why don't you answer?

727
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,880
Do you think I'm still in the mood to answer?

728
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I understand.

729
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
I know you're bored now.

730
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Cancel the deal,

731
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
pay the deposit and the commission.

732
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,240
You still want me to pay?

733
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
Now you're so economic.

734
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,600
You made me lose three million

735
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,080
to that old woman for no reason.

736
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,760
If you don't sue me, I'll laugh at you.

737
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Yes, yes, yes.

738
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,600
I know.

739
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,080
Don't be angry.

740
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,200
I'm not angry.

741
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm just angry.

742
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I'm just angry.

743
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,240
Don't be angry.

744
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,480
Actually,

745
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,040
it's really none of my business.

746
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,160
Don't get me wrong.

747
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,280
It's all because of Rachel's old woman.

748
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,800
She hurt me.

749
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
And...

750
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
And...

751
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,400
I don't need to pay

752
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,040
for our relationship.

753
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,120
Make it clear.

754
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,280
What's my relationship with you?

755
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,920
It's not just

756
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,880
about work, right?

757
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,560
Are you really so naive?

758
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,040
I don't want my dad to beat you.

759
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,960
You think you can be my woman

760
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
just because you sleep with me?

761
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,840
Don't be so naive.

762
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,760
The door is over there.

763
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,160
I thought Mr. Tu

764
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,960
really wanted to help you.

765
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,600
I didn't know he was really not naive.

766
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
Luckily, you're smart this time.

767
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
Evil people have their own evil people.

768
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,760
They can't steal a chicken for 18 meters.

769
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720
And they lost three million.

770
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
Be gentle.

771
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,400
Uncle will come to eat later.

772
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,560
It seems that he wants to talk about this.

773
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
Mom, you just need to know.

774
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
Listen to what he wants to say.

775
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,840
He's so shameless.

776
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,680
How dare he come to eat?

777
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,080
You two,

778
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
don't be fooled by him.

779
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,920
He'll come and play another show.

780
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,000
He'll say he's this and he's that.

781
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,080
You're shameless.

782
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,240
You don't come here.

783
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,480
You don't even tell me you're out of the hospital.

784
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Then the doctor...

785
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,680
A'zu, it's time for you to take your medicine.

786
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,440
Thank you.

787
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
Open the door.

788
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,400
Sister,

789
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,200
your favorite roast goose.

790
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
It's just out of the oven.

791
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Eat it while it's hot.

792
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I bought you all goose legs.

793
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,840
Do you think I'm your sister?

794
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,040
Do you think A'min is your nephew?

795
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,240
I think we have a little misunderstanding.

796
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,320
You bought a roast goose and said it was a misunderstanding.

797
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,440
You're good at calculating.

798
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
Then...

799
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,440
Then I'll go with you.

800
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
Then...

801
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,840
Then I and A'Keng just want to help Ren Yuan make more money.

802
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,640
We're blaming Chengfeng Real Estate.

803
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
It's a bad economy.

804
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,600
Just for a little bit of money,

805
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
you mislead the customers.

806
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
You don't promise us.

807
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,040
I'll tell them.

808
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,160
Uncle,

809
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,440
you mislead others or they mislead you.

810
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,360
You know it very well.

811
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,040
You can't fool me or my mom anymore.

812
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Let's eat.

813
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
Let's go to the table.

814
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
I heard your business is ruined.

815
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,040
Are you okay?

816
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,440
Sorry.

817
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
I was a little annoyed just now.

818
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,040
I know you're busy.

819
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,640
But can you reply to me?

820
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
It's so bad.

821
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,040
Everyone is having a hard time.

822
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,640
Why don't we make an appointment to talk?

823
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,040
I'll treat you to a drink as compensation.

824
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
I can pay for it right away.

825
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,640
After that, I will force you.

826
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,440
Fine, I'm%

827
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,240
I'll pay for it right now.

828
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,040
After that, I will force you.

829
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,240
After that, I will force you.

830
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,240
I will tell you.

831
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
You have time for half a gallon.

832
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,240
If you still don't come, you'll regret it.

833
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,160
How about letting your uncle go back?

834
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm not good. I'm too greedy.

835
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,680
I saw Qilong with A'Keng and I can make money.

836
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:14,580
I was brainwashed by the

837
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,280
You shouldn't just beg me.

838
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,480
This matter affects A'Ming.

839
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,960
You should say sorry to A'Ming.

840
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,720
A'Ming. A'Ming. A'Ming.

841
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,600
Uncle is wrong.

842
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm sorry. I'm wrong.

843
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,440
I'm not good. I'm wrong.

844
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Enough. Enough.

845
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
Everyone knows this matter clearly.

846
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,600
You blame me. I can't bear it.

847
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
No matter what, let's talk about it first.

848
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,240
Yes, A'Ming.

849
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,480
In fact, you know the value of Dongluo most.

850
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,240
If you really want to buy it,

851
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,520
I'll transfer it to you.

852
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,880
I don't know.

853
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,920
I can at most try to tell Grandma Ju.

854
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,720
See if you can only ask for your five percent deposit.

855
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
Then I'll buy it.

856
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,640
OK. OK. No problem.

857
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,000
The most important thing is that you are willing to talk.

858
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,720
Dolly.

859
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
Bring a pair of chopsticks out.

860
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,560
Yes, mom.

861
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,160
Thank you, A'Ming. Thank you.

862
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm in the blue room.

863
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,960
You come and drink with me.

864
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,920
Drink. Drink.

865
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,600
Drink.

866
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,960
The second bottle.

867
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,360
Why drink so much?

868
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,560
Why are you here?

869
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,840
Who told you to come?

870
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,080
You told me to come.

871
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
You asked me to come and drink with you.

872
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,720
I didn't.

873
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,800
I don't have to come.

874
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,680
You go. You go.

875
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
I should come and I shouldn't come.

876
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,480
I shouldn't come and I'm here.

877
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm so annoying.

878
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,920
Who else will come?

879
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
I don't know.

880
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,880
I don't know.

881
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,760
I don't know.

882
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,360
I don't know.

883
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,960
I don't know.

884
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,600
I don't know.

885
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,440
I don't know.

886
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,520
Stop drinking.

887
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,080
You're drunk.

888
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,200
I'll get you a glass of water.

889
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,160
No.

890
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,720
Stop drinking.

891
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm not drunk.

892
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,880
You go. You go.

893
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,960
You don't answer me.

894
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,920
I see you're like this.

895
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,400
You don't answer me.

896
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,860
So you do this

897
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,440
after driving for most of the time?

898
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,780
Didn't you vàal me?

899
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,880
You're on the car.

900
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,400
Then get on.

901
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,120
I've talked with Auntie Ju again on the phone.

902
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,440
I decided to cut the sales for the eggplant building.

903
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,640
It's your kindness that made us get a good reward.

904
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,640
I finally made up for it.

905
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,440
Oh, right. You and your boss are fighting so hard.

906
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
Are you really going to quit?

907
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,040
I won't take back what I said.

908
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,640
What are your plans in the future?

909
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,840
I haven't decided yet.

910
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
But you don't have to worry about me.

911
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,040
I've been in this company for a long time.

912
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,440
It's good that I've decided to leave now.

913
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,240
I support your decision.

914
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,840
Anger, liver, heart, heart, skin, sorrow, lung, and fear are all very painful.

915
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,440
So these emotions can't be adjusted properly.

916
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,240
This will make our organs lose their function and cause a lot of pain.

917
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Are you hungry?

918
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Yes. I didn't have an appetite and didn't eat anything.

919
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,840
Then let's go and get the stomach treated first.

920
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,240
A pilot that can't see.

921
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,240
It's whether it's not perverted or reasonable.

922
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,640
When buying shares within an amount of square meters.

923
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,440
It's rich and expressively harmful.

924
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,640
But does this not mean that it is bad?

925
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm on it.

926
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Do you want to play?

927
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,160
Okay?

928
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
Look.

929
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,240
Is it good?

930
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,160
Is it good?

931
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,640
I have other photos.

932
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,240
Are you crazy?

933
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,200
Do you want to see?

934
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,080
Do you want to see?

935
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,680
Do you want to see?

936
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
Have you had enough?

937
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,440
Go away.

938
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,280
Go away.

939
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,680
If you can't play,

940
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
don't play with me.

941
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm afraid you will be the one to suffer.

942
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
You will break into the unit.

943
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
I have finished looking at the photos.

944
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,960
I will pay for this round.

945
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
Wow, you are so great.

946
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,800
Thank you.

947
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,920
Don't drink so much.

948
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,240
You are drunk.

949
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,920
Hey, can you use your strength?

950
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
No, I don't have strength.

951
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,480
Sit down and take a rest.

952
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,200
I can. I can. I can.

953
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,360
Be careful.

954
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,040
A'zuo.

955
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
I know what you are thinking.

956
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,080
Do you think I'm a low-class person?

957
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm self-sufficient.

958
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,040
I take the initiative to give a hug and send a message.

959
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,040
I'm so great.

960
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,720
And then,

961
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,520
they don't want me anymore.

962
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,280
I have to fight with them.

963
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,680
And they took this kind of photo.

964
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,640
It's so embarrassing.

965
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,440
Right?

966
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,120
Right?

967
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,720
Tell me.

968
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,440
Of course not.

969
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,000
It's that loser who doesn't know how to cherish you.

970
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,240
I think you are beautiful and kind.

971
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,440
And you are charming.

972
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,080
In fact, many people want to chase you.

973
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,840
What about you?

974
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,160
Do you like me?

975
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,960
Do you like me?

976
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Tell me.

977
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,640
Yes.

978
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,480
I like you.

979
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,520
I want to be with you.

980
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,720
I want to protect you.

981
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
I won't be like that loser

982
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
who tortures you every day.

983
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,280
I will protect you.

984
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,480
I can be with you 24 hours.

985
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,520
I can send you wherever you want.

986
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,160
I just want to be with you.

987
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
How are you?

988
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,320
Are you feeling better?

989
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
Sit down.

990
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,520
Don't be afraid.

991
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
I'll help you go home.

992
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Go home and sleep.

993
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,000
Leave me alone.

994
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,440
No.

995
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,840
It's too dirty here.

996
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,640
Let's go.

997
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm so tired.

998
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,640
I'm so tired.

999
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,520
Stand still.

1000
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,760
I'll get the bag.

1001
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,640
It's dirty.

1002
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,840
I'm so tired.

1003
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Brother.

1004
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,000
Do you want to try this?

1005
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,680
Okay.

1006
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Is it good?

1007
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,440
Not bad.

1008
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,320
What's wrong?

1009
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,120
Brother.

1010
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,520
I'm in Lan Guifang now.

1011
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,080
Come to me.

1012
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,960
You just left the hospital.

1013
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,640
Why are you going to Lan Guifang?

1014
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,400
Leave me alone.

1015
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,200
I'm dying.

1016
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,920
Come to me first.

1017
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,800
What?

1018
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,640
Where are you now in Lan Guifang?

1019
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,520
I'm...

1020
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,200
Brother.

1021
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,120
Hello.

1022
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,040
Wake up.

1023
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
What's wrong?

1024
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,520
A'zu just left the hospital and is going to Lan Guifang.

1025
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,160
Now he's dizzy and wants me to pick him up.

1026
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,040
He hasn't responded yet.

1027
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,240
Is he fainted?

1028
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
Let's go find him.

1029
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,640
No.

1030
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,920
I can't pick him up.

1031
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,320
How about we split up?

1032
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,840
You go this way.

1033
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,280
I'll go this way.

1034
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
Okay.

1035
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,800
Brian!

1036
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,480
Are you alright?

1037
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,120
죽rt!

1038
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
Don't beat me.

1039
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,400
OK.

1040
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,120
Hurry up.

1041
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,180
I'll catch up.

1042
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,080
Let's go home.

1043
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,960
Impossible.

1044
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,400
I can't,culmon!

1045
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
I told you to tell him.

1046
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,820
You'll

1047
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,640
get your hands dirty.

1048
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,080
I'll tell him.

1049
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,800
I'll ask the doctor.

1050
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
You should make it up to me

1051
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Let go of me!

1052
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Help!

1053
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Let go of me!

1054
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Let go of me!

1055
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Hold your hands together

1056
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Hold your waist

1057
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Hold your chest, raise your head

1058
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
Breathe

1059
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
2, 3, 4, 5

1060
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
If you are a computer user

1061
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
I recommend you to do it 3 times

1062
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
per hour
